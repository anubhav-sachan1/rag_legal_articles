        "In light of the recent referendums and purported annexation by Russia of four territories of Ukraine on September 30, 2022, the United States, United Kingdom and European Union have expanded measures and provided additional guidance related to Russia-related sanctions and export controls.\n\nThese include the addition of new individuals who are subject to blocking and asset freezes, as well as limitations on dealings with entities that support the Russian war effort, the referendums it held in Ukrainian territories, or its purported annexation of four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.\n\nNew U.S. rules target entities in third countries that help Russia \u201cbackfill\u201d material for its military, and EU and U.K. export restrictions have also been expanded.\n\nThe actions by the three jurisdictions differ in some respects, but many of their new provisions overlap.\n\nWe anticipate further actions in response to the attempted annexation.\n\n(For earlier updates, see our July 29, 2022, alert \u201c US Adopts Further Sanctions and Export Controls Targeting Russia \u201d and our August 1, 2022, alert \u201c EU and UK Adopt Further Sanctions and Export Controls Targeting Russia .\u201d)\n\nIn addition to the recent measures imposed in reaction to the purported annexations in Ukraine, at the G7 meeting on September 2, 2022, agreement was reached to finalize and implement a comprehensive, global prohibition of services enabling maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nThe provision of such services would only be allowed if the oil and petroleum products were purchased at or below a price cap.\n\n1 New US Sanctions and Export Controls On September 30, 2022, several branches of the U.S. government announced expanded sanctions measures in response to Russia\u2019s purported annexations.\n\nExpanded Blocking Sanctions\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. Department of State designated, or redesignated, numerous persons for enabling the referendums and annexations, including: persons in Russia\u2019s military-industrial complex, including two international suppliers; key leaders of Russia\u2019s financial infrastructure, including the governor and first deputy governor of the Russian Central Bank; immediate family members of certain senior Russian officials; and members of the Russian Duma who supported the annexation of Crimean territory.\n\nAny property or interest in property belonging to these persons, or any entities in which these persons have a 50% or greater, direct or indirect, ownership interest, that is in the U.S. or comes within the possession or control of a U.S. person must be blocked ( i.e. , frozen), and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions or dealings involving them.\n\nNew OFAC Guidance OFAC issued Frequently Asked Question 1091 , warning that OFAC is prepared to use existing authorities to take action against persons inside and outside of Russia who provide material support to persons subject to existing U.S. Russia-related sanctions; attempt to circumvent or evade U.S. sanctions on Russia or Belarus; or provide political or economic support for Russia\u2019s efforts to annex Ukrainian territory.\n\nThat includes material support for: the organization of Russia\u2019s referendums or annexation; economic or other activity that seeks to legitimize Russia\u2019s referendums or annexation; Russia\u2019s military and defense industrial base; or Russian entities or individuals that are subject to blocking sanctions.\n\nOFAC emphasized that U.S. sanctions are not designed to target Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, including those living in areas occupied or annexed by Russia.\n\nOFAC also pointed to prior guidance, which clarifies that U.S. sanctions are not intended to target transactions related to the export of food or medicine, personal remittances, internet services, mail, or the activities of certain international or nongovernment organizations in Ukraine.",
        "The United States, United Kingdom and the European Union, among other allies, have moved swiftly in response to the Russian Federation\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMerely hours after Russia\u2019s announcement on February 21, 2022, that it would recognize as \u201cindependent\u201d states the separatist regions of Ukraine referred to as the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR), the United States imposed comprehensive sanctions on the breakaway regions.\n\nThe U.K. imposed additional sanctions targeting Russia shortly thereafter, and the EU followed with its own sanctions package.\n\nThe U.S. issued additional sanctions on February 22 and 23, 2022, targeting individuals close to President Vladimir Putin as well as the Russian financial services and energy sectors.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the U.S., U.K. and EU announced further sanctions, as well as new export controls, in response to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and use of military force.\n\nTo the extent Russia continues on its current path, the U.S., U.K. and EU governments have stated that they will continue to work in close coordination to support Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, defend the territorial integrity of NATO allies in the region and increase economic pressure on the Russian government, its functionaries and key sectors of the Russian economy through aggressive sanctions, export controls and other economic measures.\n\nGovernment officials in each of the U.S., U.K. and EU have indicated that the sanctions and export controls implemented or announced to date, as outlined in this client alert, represent the early stages of the coordinated response.\n\nTo that end, we anticipate additional announcements in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFurther significant sanctions and export controls may be imposed rapidly, and, consequently, the legal landscape remains very fluid.\n\nUS Sanctions US Export Controls UK Sanctions and Export Controls EU Sanctions and Export Controls I.\tUS Sanctions Overview of US Sanctions\n\nOn February 21, 2022, President Joe Biden issued an executive order (E.O.) imposing comprehensive sanctions on the DNR and LNR, prohibiting almost all commercial activity by involving the two regions (the February E.O.).\n\nIn the following days, the president announced further sanctions in response to Russia\u2019s decision to recognize the DNR and LNR and the subsequent invasion by Russian armed forces into Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory.\n\nPursuant to E.O. 14024, 1 which the president issued on April 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated as Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) several major Russian banks, including Vnesheconombank (VEB), Promsvyazbank PJSC (Promsvyazbank) and VTB Bank PJSC (VTB), certain of their subsidiaries and numerous individuals with close ties to President Putin and his inner circle.\n\nOFAC issued three new directives (Directives 1A, 2 and 3) pursuant to E.O. 14024, imposing increased restrictions on dealings in Russia\u2019s sovereign debt, restricting correspondent and payable-through accounts of PJSC Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank), and restricting access to U.S. capital markets by 13 entities linked to the Russian government and financial industry.\n\nOn February 25, 2022, OFAC imposed sanctions on President Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and two members of Russia\u2019s Security Council.\n\nIn addition, OFAC imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its managing director following German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s announcement that Germany would halt certification of the pipeline.\n\nFinally, OFAC designated as SDNs 24 Belarusian individuals and entities in light of Belarus\u2019 support of the Russian invasion.\n\nTogether with the directionally similar sanctions imposed by the EU and the U.K., discussed below, these actions represent a coordinated effort to increase pressure on the Russian government and tighten existing restrictions on the Russian economy.",
        "Through a series of coordinated actions in May 2023, the United States launched a whole-of-government effort to expand and strengthen enforcement of its sanctions campaign against Russia as the conflict in Ukraine continues in its 15th month.\n\nOn May 19, 2023, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Department of State and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) imposed sweeping new Russia-related sanctions and export controls.\n\nThe same day, BIS issued a supplemental joint alert with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) urging financial institutions to remain vigilant against Russian efforts to evade U.S. export controls.\n\nThese coordinated actions were taken only three days after the Disruptive Technology Strike Force announced its first five enforcement actions for violations of Russia-related sanctions and export controls on May 16, 2023.\n\nThese steps demonstrate the U.S.\u2019 sustained effort to prevent sanctions and export controls evasion, and portend greater cooperation and alignment among the Justice, Treasury, Commerce and State Departments.\n\nTaken during the G7 summit, this robust display of U.S. government action also appears calibrated as a diplomatic effort to encourage continued multilateral support for the counter-Russian sanctions program.\n\n1 New OFAC and State Department Designations OFAC designated 22 additional individuals and 140 additional entities pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 , including: Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service.\n\nA Russia-based defense technology supplier.\n\nRussia-based technology and electronics importers.\n\nRussian energy-related educational institutions and research institutes.\n\nRussian drilling and mining companies.\n\nPersons that have sought to evade or undermine economic restrictions on Russia.\n\nOFAC designated not only Russian persons but also third-country persons, including persons who have facilitated transfers of technology to Russia.\n\nOFAC also issued a general license authorizing the wind down of transactions involving certain universities and institutes, which expires at 12:01 a.m.\n\nEastern Daylight Time on July 18, 2023.\n\nIn addition, the State Department designated or identified as blocked property almost 200 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft pursuant to E.O. 14024.\n\nThe State Department designations target: Russia\u2019s future energy production and export capacity.\n\nRussia\u2019s military-related procurement and sanctions evasion activities.\n\nA Rosatom-related entity.\n\nMilitary-related transfers between Russia and Iran.\n\nThe Russian metals and mining sector.\n\nRussia\u2019s military establishment.\n\nThe Wagner Group.\n\nRussia\u2019s advanced technology industries.\n\nDeportations of Ukrainian children.\n\nRussian government officials, elites and associates.\n\nKremlin-installed authorities in Russia-occupied territories in Ukraine.\n\nGrain theft from Ukraine.\n\nSimultaneous to its designation by the State Department, OFAC issued a pair of general licenses with respect to PJSC Polyus , which is the largest gold producer in Russia and a top 10 gold miner by ounces produced in the world.\n\nOne of the general licenses authorizes the wind down of transactions involving PJSC Polyus, and the other authorizes certain transactions related to debt or equity of, or derivative contracts involving, the company.\n\nBoth general licenses expire at 12:01 a.m.\n\nEastern Daylight Time on August 17, 2023.\n\nThe individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft designated or identified by OFAC or the State Department have been added to OFAC\u2019s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.",
        "On 22 February 2024, shortly before the second anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the UK government published its first sanctions strategy (the Strategy).\n\n1\n\nThe Strategy explains the UK\u2019s use and implementation of sanctions as a foreign policy and security tool and signals the government\u2019s likely areas of focus going forward.\n\nThe publication of the Strategy coincided with the UK\u2019s announcement of designations against 52 individuals and entities under the Russia and Belarus regimes.\n\nThe new designations focus on those supplying munitions to Russia, as well as key sources of Russian revenue, including relating to metals, diamonds and the energy trade.\n\nIt builds on the broader UK regime of Russia-related sanctions, which have dramatically restricted trade with Russia and limited Russia\u2019s revenue from targeted sectors and products.\n\nThe UK government estimates that international sanctions have cut approximately $400 billion of potential funding for Russia in its war against Ukraine.\n\nShortly after the UK government published the Strategy, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) announced the licensing principles for designated individuals (the Principles).\n\nThese detail the policy principles that OFSI applies to determining licence applications relating to designated individuals and follows an indication by a UK court that OFSI should publish internal guidance regarding its approach to licensing requests.\n\n2 We set out in this note the key points contained in the Strategy and the Principles and what they mean for the UK sanctions landscape going forward.\n\nUK Sanctions Strategy New Restrictions on Designated Persons The Strategy indicates that, in 2024, the UK will introduce a new prohibition making it unlawful for a designated person under the UK sanctions regime to act as a director of a UK company.\n\nIn practice, this is unlikely to lead to a significant change \u2014 given ownership and control risks, most UK companies are unlikely to have a designated person sitting on their board.\n\nIt will, however, strengthen the pressure imposed on sanctioned businessmen who desire retaining involvement in UK commercial operations.\n\nThis follows OFSI\u2019s recent announcement of new reporting requirements for designated persons under the Russia-related sanctions regime.\n\nDesignated persons are required to proactively provide to OFSI details of their UK assets (or their worldwide assets if they are a UK person) within a specified time period from designation.\n\n3 Release of Sanctioned Funds \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s Reconstruction The Strategy confirms that OFSI is developing a voluntary process whereby sanctioned individuals may apply for frozen funds to be released for the express purpose of supporting Ukraine\u2019s recovery and reconstruction.\n\nThe announcement cements the UK\u2019s intention to build mechanisms (alongside its G7 partners) for redistributing sanctioned funds to support Ukraine\u2019s recovery, in addition to a number of existing and planned international mechanisms such as (i) the Council of Europe\u2019s Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation Against Ukraine , which is designed to be the first component of a future international compensation mechanism in cooperation with Ukraine; (ii) the International Criminal Court (ICC)\u2019s Trust Fund for Victims ; and (iii) the Global Survivors Fund.\n\nThe Strategy goes further, stating that the UK government is \u201cworking with allies to pursue all possible ways, in line with international law, to unlock the value of immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHowever, the UK and other countries have struggled to develop nonvoluntary mechanisms to confiscate assets given the complex international law issues and geopolitical considerations involved.",
        "On April 24, 2024, President Joe Biden signed into law a high-profile package of national security legislation (Public Law 118-50).\n\nWhile most press reports focused on the spending elements of the package (appropriating funds to support U.S. allies such as Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan), one subchapter of the legislation contains important new measures that directly impact Russian state assets that are currently blocked ( i.e. , frozen) pursuant to U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe \u201cRebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act\u201d (the \u201cREPO for Ukrainians Act\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) is the latest U.S. measure in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSince then, the U.S. government \u2014 through the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of State \u2014 has imposed broad-ranging sanctions against the Russian government and a large number of Russian entities and individuals.\n\nThe European Union, United Kingdom and numerous other countries have adopted similarly broad sanctions .\n\n1\n\nAccording to the congressional findings accompanying the REPO for Ukrainians Act, \u201c$300,000,000,000 of Russian sovereign assets have been immobilized worldwide\u201d as a consequence of these various sanctions programs.\n\nOf this amount, \u201cbetween $4,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d\n\nPotential Seizure and Diversion of Russian Sovereign Assets The REPO for Ukrainians Act seeks to create a framework for the seizure of Russian sovereign assets and their \u201crepurposing\u201d for the benefit of Ukraine.\n\nAlthough initially a separate bill, it was folded into the general spending package that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson put to a House vote on April 20, 2024.\n\nPresident Biden signed the bill into law following the Senate vote a few days later.\n\nThe law begins with a general prohibition on the release of \u201cblocked or effectively immobilized\u201d Russian sovereign assets until the U.S. president certifies that \u201chostilities between the Russian Federation and Ukraine have ceased\u201d and either: Russia has paid \u201cfull compensation \u2026 to Ukraine for harms resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation,\u201d or the Russian government \u201cis participating in a bona fide international mechanism that, by agreement, will discharge the obligations of the Russian Federation to compensate Ukraine for all amounts determined to be owed to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIf the president determines that Belarus has also \u201cengaged in an act of war against Ukraine\u201d related to Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion, Belarussian assets can be subject to similar treatment under the REPO for Ukrainians Act.\n\nThe Act then provides a framework for the president to authorize seizure of Russian sovereign assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction and their \u201crepurposing\u201d for the support of Ukraine.\n\nSpecifically, the president may certify that such action is appropriate, provided that such action \u201cis in the national interests of the United States,\u201d the president has \u201cmeaningfully coordinated with G7 leaders to take multilateral action\u201d concerning such seizures and one of the following contingencies has arisen: a \u201cproperly constituted international mechanism\u201d has been \u201cestablished for the purpose of, or otherwise tasked with, compensating Ukraine for damages arising or resulting from [the invasion by] the repurposing of sovereign assets of the Russian Federation\u201d and has officially requested U.S. participation, \u201cthe Russian Federation has not ceased its unlawful aggression against Ukraine,\u201d or Russia has \u201cceased its unlawful aggression\u201d but has \u201cnot provided full compensation to Ukraine for harms resulting from the internationally wrongful acts of the Russian Federation,\u201d and is not participating in a \u201cbona fide process\u201d to provide such compensation.",
        "Blocking Sanctions Targeting Russian Institutions, Companies and Individuals The EU imposed blocking sanctions and travel bans against the 336 members of the Russian State Duma who voted in favor of a resolution to ask President Putin to recognize the independence of the DNR and LNR.\n\nThe EU also added 22 individuals and four entities to the EU list of persons subject to restrictive measures.\n\nThese include members of the government who were involved in the decisions that have led to Russia\u2019s incursions into Ukraine, 18 three banks, 19 businesspersons/oligarchs supporting financially or materially Russian operations in the DNR and LNR, senior military officers 20 and those responsible for leading a disinformation war against Ukraine.\n\n21\n\nAll funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by these listed persons are required to be frozen.\n\nMaking funds or economic resources available to \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 or for the benefit of listed parties is also prohibited.\n\nThe travel bans applicable to the listed individuals prevent them from entering or transiting through EU territory.\n\nRestrictions on Dealings in Russian Sovereign Debt As part of the February 23, 2022, package of sanctions, the EU has further expanded its sectoral sanctions by amending Council Regulation 833/2014 22 (Regulation 833) to introduce restrictions that prohibit any person to whom EU sanctions apply 23 from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling or providing investment services for, or assistance in the issuance of, transferable securities and money-market instruments issued after March 9, 2022, by: Russia and its government; The Central Bank of Russia; or a legal person, entity or body acting on behalf or at the direction of the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nThe new sanctions also prohibit \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 arranging or being part of any arrangement to make any new loans or credit after February 23, 2022, to the legal persons, entities or bodies listed above.\n\nThe amendments to Regulation 833 are designed to cut off Russia and its government from the European financial markets, as the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in a television interview on February 20, 2022.\n\nSince 2014, Regulation 833 has restricted the ability of certain large state-owned Russian companies in the energy, defense and financial sectors, which frequently need medium- to long-term financing, to issue such equity or debt on the EU market.\n\nRegulation 833 has now been expanded to directly target, in the same manner, the Russian government.\n\nWith the aim of protecting legitimate EU trade, the EU sanctions contain exceptions for loans or credit that have a specific and documented objective to provide financing for non-prohibited imports or exports of goods and non-financial services between EU member states and non-EU countries.\n\nFurthermore, the new restrictions do not apply to drawdowns or disbursements made under a contract concluded before February 23, 2022, if: (i) all the terms and conditions of such drawdown or disbursements were agreed before February 23, 2022, and have not been modified on or after that date; and (ii) prior to February 23, 2022, a contractual maturity date had been fixed for the repayment in full of all funds made available and for the cancellation of all the commitments, rights and obligations under the contract.\n\nSecond Set of Measures To Come The EU Commission stated on February 24, 2022, that an additional \u201cpackage of massive and targeted sanctions\u201d has been prepared and is being presented to the EU Council for approval.\n\nThis new package includes measures targeting strategic sectors of the Russian economy by preventing their access to certain key technologies and markets.\n\nThe new package would also include measures to stop Russian banks from accessing European financial markets.",
        "On 18 December 2023, the European Union adopted a 12th package of sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe sanctions impose an asset freeze on more than 140 individuals and entities pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 269/2014 1 (Regulation 269) and expand existing sectoral sanctions targeting key aspects of the Russian economy under Council Regulation (EU) 833/2014 2 (Regulation 833), including a ban on Russian diamonds.\n\nThe asset freeze restrictions against the listed persons and entities entered into force on 18 December 2023, 3 and the sectoral sanctions took effect on 19 December 2023.\n\n4\n\nThe key aspects to note are: The EU has introduced new criteria for imposing asset freeze restrictions, including on persons or entities that benefit from the compulsory transfer of ownership of, or control over, Russian entities that were previously owned or controlled by EU businesses.\n\nThe EU has also imposed an asset freeze against more than 140 additional individuals and entities.\n\nRegulation 833 now restricts the sale, supply, export and transfer of additional dual-use goods and technology, advanced technological items and goods that could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial and defense capacities.\n\nThese include certain chemicals, thermostats, direct current (DC) motors and servomotors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), machine tools and machinery parts, construction-related goods, processed steel, copper and aluminum goods, lasers, and batteries.\n\nThe EU has added new Russian and third-country entities to the list of entities connected to Russia\u2019s military and industrial complex, making them subject to tighter export restrictions concerning restricted goods and technologies.\n\nRegulation 833 imposes a so-called \u201cno-Russia clause\u201d that requires EU exporters to contractually prohibit the re-exportation of certain restricted goods to Russia when dealing with third-country business partners.\n\nThe requirement will take effect on 20 March 2024.\n\nThe EU has imposed a ban on the import of Russian diamonds into the EU or any other non-EU country.\n\nThe EU has made the import ban on iron and steel more flexible.\n\nThe ban on the import of certain iron and steel products processed in third countries that incorporate Russian iron and steel took effect on 30 September 2023; the EU has since introduced a derogation for certain partner countries and a wind-down period for certain specific products.\n\n5\n\nThe EU has extended the scope of the ban on certain professional services to the provision of software for the management of enterprises and software for industrial design and manufacture.\n\nThe EU has also added an expiration date to the intragroup exemption: as of 20 June 2024, EU entities will need an authorization to provide professional services to a subsidiary established in Russia.  \n\nEU entities that benefitted from the derogation should therefore prepare to request for such authorization before the deadline.\n\nThe EU has introduced new information that businesses are required to provide to show compliance with the EU\u2019s price cap on Russian oil, and it has implemented restrictions on the import of liquefied propane gas from Russia.\n\nAs part of its anti-circumvention measures, the EU sanctions include new notification requirements for certain transfers of funds out of the EU involving EU entities that are owned more than 40% by Russian residents, nationals or entities.\n\nThe EU has also extended the deadline to 30 June 2024 for EU national competent authorities to authorize EU businesses to engage in covered transactions involving restricted goods and technology, in order to divest or wind down their business activities in Russia.\n\nThe EU has also provided additional guidance on Russian exit transactions.\n\nAsset Freezes New Entities and Persons Listed by the EU\n\nThe EU has imposed an asset freeze against more than 140 individuals and entities.",
