        "The greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels, and by 2050 the European Union should be climate neutral.\n\nThat is the EU's target \u2013 an ambitious one, especially considering how divided MEPs were initially on the implementa-tion of concrete measures and how dissatisfied certain EU Member States are with the drafts.\n\nThe \"Fit for 55\" package includes draft amendments to existing EU legislation in the fields of climate, energy and transport and 13 new legislative proposals aiming to reduce emissions in a wide range of sectors.\n\nThis makes it the EU's largest revision of climate and energy legislation to date.\n\nThe package was presented by the Commission one year ago, in July 2021.\n\nFor the drafts to become binding legal acts, the approval of the European Parliament as well as of the Member States, represented in the Council of the European Union, is required.\n\nDissatisfaction about the planned emission-free mobility The European Parliament's most straightforward vote on a measure in the climate package so far was the adoption of the Commission's proposal to revise the CO2 emission performance standards for new cars and vans, reaching zero-emission road mobility by 2035.\n\nThis means a de facto ban on the sale of diesel, petrol, and hybrid vehicles.\n\nHowever, to arrive at an agreement among European environment ministers on this issue proved more difficult.\n\nEspecially Germany's role in the negotiations was strongly criti-cized, for making late and uncoordinated proposals, such as a proposal on allowing synthetic fuels.\n\nNevertheless, the Council voted in favour of the Parliament's position.\n\nStill, the German government continues to hope that a recital clause inviting the Com-mission to examine the use of CO2 neutral fuels outside the scope of the fleet standards will allow it to weaken the phase-out consequences.\n\nDisagreement on the revision of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) One of the central elements of the Commission's proposal, the reform of the European Emissions Trading System and its extension to transport and buildings, was initially rejected.\n\nSo far, only energy-intensive industrial sectors, the energy sector and aviation within Europe must have their emissions certified.\n\nWhile conservative politicians wanted to weaken the Commission's proposition by amending it, for example by continuing distributing free allowances to companies for a longer period of time, the Greens and Social Democrats considered the draft not being enough ambitious and instead of agreeing on a softened emissions trading regume, they rejected the text.\n\nHowever, Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Liberals agreed on a compromise outside the plenary sessions.\n\nThat compromise reduces emissions in ETS by 63% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.\n\nThe Commission's original proposal set a target of 61%, and the Environment Committee originally called for 67%.\n\nIt was also agreed to gradually phase out the free allowances by 2032, and from 2027 onwards, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) should also be applied to the ETS sectors.\n\nNevertheless, whether the CBAM will become law and is compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organization must still be seen.\n\nSurprisingly, in the plenary session on 22 June 2022, MEPs went even further than agreed in the compromise and now want to establish a new ETS for commercial buildings and transport by 2024.\n\nAccording to the Parliament's vote, before this ETS is to include private buildings and road transport, there should be a new co-decision procedure, as this would further increase energy costs for citizens.\n\nMaritime transport should also be covered by emissions trading in the future.\n\nOn the night of 29 June 2022, the Council announced its negotiation position on this issue, which is more similar to the Commission's proposal.",
        "A prominent recent coercion case involves China\u2019s adoption of coercive trade sanctions against Lithuania after the EU country opened a diplomatic representation of Taiwan in its capital.\n\nMr Bernd Lange, negotiator for the Parliament, did not hesitate to name China and the US (the latter pursuant to threats of punitive tariffs in case the EU were to implement a digital tax against big US corporations) during negotiations of the political agreement.\n\nThe Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, in a recent speech on EU-China relations, also stressed that the Union should rebalance its relationship with China, by making more and better use of its trade instruments.\n\nNext Steps Technical discussions concerning the Proposal will continue in the coming weeks.\n\nThe agreed text must then be endorsed by the negotiators at a final meeting and formally adopted by the two co-legislators, Council and the Parliament, most likely before the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOnce the legislative procedure is completed, the Regulation will be published in the EU Official Journal and it will enter into force 20 days afterwards.",
        "For example, they could be linked to certain economic or environmental requirements.\n\nThe consultation will remain open to comments from stakeholders until 19 May 2023.\n\nThe results will be decisive for the further action to be taken by the European Commission.\n\nEU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton plans to finalise the initiative by the end of his term in office in July 2024.",
        "Further negotiations on the EU ETS are planned for the next few days, and a final agreement is expected by the end of the week.\n\nAdditional details on the duration of the CBAM transition period, the phasing out of the free allowances and the treatment of exports from the EU to third countries will not be available until then.\n\nOnce a full deal is reached, the agreement needs to be formally approved by the two co-legislators, the Council and the Parliament, before it is final.\n\nThe regulation will come into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal.",
        "On 18 December 2022, the trilogue negotiators of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission (hereafter \u201cCommission\u201d, together \u201cthe EU institutions\u201d) agreed on a provisional text on the proposal to review the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter \u201cETS\u201d).\n\nThis milestone deal was reached only a few days after a similar provisional agreement on the EU\u2019s carbon border tax on certain imported products , also known as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter \u201cCBAM\u201d) (see our related News Alert here ).\n\nThe successful conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the ETS is an important milestone on the path to the expected adoption of the EU landmark legislation CBAM early in the new year.\n\nThe EU ETS and the CBAM Both the proposal for a directive amending Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (hereafter ETS Directive) and the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism are part of the so-called Fit for 55 package , presented by the Commission in July 2021, which aims to reduce net greenhouse gas (hereafter \u201cGHG\u201d) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality in 2050.\n\nThe ETS is a carbon market based on a cap-and-trade mechanism of emission allowances for energy-intensive industries and the power generation sector.\n\nThe reform of the system aims to align the ETS Directive with the target set out in the European Climate Law to reduce net GHG emissions\u00a0by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\n\nNegotiators of the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to increase the overall ambition of emissions reductions in the sectors covered by the ETS to 62% by 2030 and in order to reach this target they propose a steeper annual reduction.\n\nThe scheme will also be extended to cover more sectors of the economy, such as maritime transport.\n\nA separate ETS for fuel emissions from the road transport and building sectors (\u201cETS II\u201d) will be established by 2027, with the possibility for it to be postponed until 2028 if energy prices are exceptionally high.\n\nThe ETS allocates free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage identified in a list for energy intensive industries.\n\nWith the introduction of the CBAM, the EU institutions intend to equalise the carbon price between domestic products and imports, allocate free allowances in a more targeted way and to incentivise the uptake of low-carbon technologies and the reduction of GHG emissions by third countries.\n\nThe CBAM is designed to complement the ETS, serving as an alternative means of reducing the risk of carbon leakage by allocating free ETS allowances to energy-intensive industries.\n\nThe current free allocation of allowances under the ETS will be gradually phased out as the CBAM is phased in.\n\nSpecifically, the Council and the European Parliament have now agreed to end free ETS allowances for the sectors covered by the CBAM over a nine-year-period between 2026 and 2034.\n\nUntil free allocations end, the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions that do not receive free allowances under the ETS.\n\nA transitional period will start already on 1 October 2023, during which importers will be subject to reporting obligations of their embedded GHG emissions without having to pay financial adjustments.\n\nOnce the CBAM becomes fully operational, importers will need to obtain authorisation from a centralised CBAM authority and purchase carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that they would have had to pay to produce the goods at issue in the EU.",
        "The CBAM will apply to imports from all third countries except those participating in the ETS or a linked mechanism from a limited number of emissions-intensive sectors that are at greater risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity generation, hydrogen, certain precursors as well as some downstream products such as screws and bolts and similar articles of iron or steel.\n\nIndirect emissions will also be covered under certain circumstances.\n\nBefore the end of the transition period, the Commission shall assess whether to cover also other goods at risk of carbon leakage, including organic chemicals and polymers, and it will also evaluate the risk of carbon leakage for goods produced in the EU but exported to third countries.\n\nIf deemed necessary, the Commission will present a separate legislative proposal on that.\n\nNext steps The successful conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the ETS having been declared a prerequisite for reaching a final agreement on the CBAM, the provisional agreement on the ETS takes us a decisive step closer to seeing the CBAM legislation being finalized in the very near future.\n\nIn order to be final and adopted, both the provisional agreement on the CBAM and the provisional agreement on the review of the ETS now need to be formally approved by the two EU co-legislators, the Council and the European Parliament.\n\nThe new legislation will come into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal, which is expected for March/April 2023.",

        "On 12 December 2022, during the fourth inter-institutional meeting on the EU\u2019s proposed carbon border tax on certain imported products, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter \u201cCBAM\u201d), negotiators from the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission (hereafter \u201cCommission\u201d) reached a provisional agreement .\n\nBecause the transitional period for the new mechanism is scheduled to begin on 1 October 2023, now is the time for companies to prepare for the new mechanism.\n\nBackground As a driver of the global environmental agenda, the EU aims to become the world\u2019s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.\n\nThe European Green Deal , presented by the Commission in December 2019, is a roadmap of policy initiatives designed to make the EU\u2019s economy sustainable, an ambitious target.\n\nThe milestone goal is to reduce EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\n\nThe first set of legislative proposals designed to facilitate the emissions reduction and to align the EU\u2019s climate, energy, transport, taxation and land use policies with this target was the \u201c Fit for 55\u201d package of July 2021.\n\nAs part of this package, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism aims to contribute to the EU\u2019s climate neutrality objective while encouraging other countries to decarbonise their production processes by levelling the playing field in carbon pricing between EU producers and foreign producers.\n\nThe CBAM in a nutshell The principal objective of the proposal for a CBAM is to equalise the carbon price between domestic products and imports, thereby addressing the risk of carbon leakage caused by asymmetrical environmental policies of third countries and to potentially incentivise them to put greener policies in place.\n\nThe CBAM is designed to complement the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter \u201cEU ETS\u201d) and is intended to serve as an alternative means of reducing the risk of carbon leakage by allocating free ETS allowances to energy-intensive industries.\n\nFree allocation of allowances under the ETS will be gradually phased out as the CBAM is phased in.\n\nUntil free allocations end, the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions that do not receive free allowances under the EU ETS.\n\nThus, according to the provisional deal reached by the co-legislators, the CBAM will initially apply to imports from all third countries except those participating in the EU ETS or a linked mechanism from certain emissions-intensive sectors that are at greater risk of carbon leakage.\n\nSpecifically: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, and electricity generation (as originally proposed by the Commission), hydrogen and certain precursors as well as some downstream products such as screws and bolts and similar articles of iron or steel.\n\nIndirect emissions will also be covered under certain conditions that are still under negotiation.\n\nThe scope of the CBAM could be extended in the future; before the end of the planned transition period, the Commission will assess whether to also cover other goods at risk of carbon leakage, including organic chemicals and polymers; the goal, as reiterated by the Parliament, is to include all goods covered by the EU ETS by 2030.\n\nThe proposal foresees a transitional phase during which importers in these sectors will have to report their embedded GHG emissions but not pay the financial adjustments.\n\nOnce the CBAM becomes fully operational, importers into the EU will need to obtain authorisation from a CBAM authority and purchase carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid to produce the goods in the EU.\n\nUnder the provisional agreement, the CBAM\u2019s initial phase will begin in October 2023.\n\nThe full CBAM will be phased in gradually while phasing out the free allowances under the revised EU ETS for the sectors concerned.",
        "The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter \u201cthe CBAM\u201d), a key element of the European Green Deal legislative package, has been conclusively adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) legislators (European Parliament and Council of the European Union).\n\nFollowing the formal adoption of the CBAM by the European Parliament on 18 April 2023, the Council of the European Union adopted the new law on 25 April 2023.\n\nIt will be published in the EU Official Journal in the coming weeks and will enter into force twenty days later.\n\nThe CBAM addresses imports of products/goods into the EU from carbon-intensive industries.\n\nIt aims at equalising the carbon costs contained in domestic and imported products, by imposing a carbon price on certain (defined) imported products, which risk offsetting EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts, whilst simultaneously encouraging collaboration with non-EU businesses adhering to high climate standards.\n\nThe carbon price principally covers direct and indirect emissions from the production of electricity consumed during the production processes of CBAM goods, with the exception of goods for which the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter \u201cthe ETS\u201d) allows Member States to compensate indirect costs, such as iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen, for which only direct emissions will be taken into account (see Annex II of the CBAM).\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s CBAM Proposal was presented in July 2021 as part of the so-called \u201c Fit for 55\u201d package .\n\nAn provisional agreement on the Proposal was reached in December 2022 (see our related News Alert here ).\n\nKey Differences to the Initial Proposal\n\nThe CBAM covers a wider range of products compared to the initial Proposal, more precisely: cement, electricity, fertilisers, iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen and some precursors and downstream products made from cement, iron and steel, aluminium (see Annex I of the CBAM for the concerned CN codes), so-called CBAM goods.\n\nThe final text also stipulates a more centralised model of implementation through the European Commission (hereafter \u201cCommission\u201d), for which the Commission has requested more resources, and pushes back the beginning of the transitional period from January until October 2023.\n\nLinks with EU ETS Reform Together with the CBAM, the legislators also officially endorsed the Commission Proposal to review the ETS , another key aspect of the Fit for 55 package.\n\nThe EU ETS is a market-based mechanism which caps greenhouse gas (hereafter \u201cGHG\u201d) emissions by dividing them into allowances, each representing one tonne of CO2.\n\nThe emissions allowances are mostly auctioned but some are distributed to industries at risk of carbon leakage for free.\n\nThe EU ETS was launched in 2005 and reviewed for the last time in 2018, determining the total quantity of emissions allowances for the so-called phase 4 until 2030.\n\nThe Proposal to review the ETS concerns the ongoing phase 4, with the aim of reducing the phase 4 cap and introducing a more ambitious linear reduction factor for GHG emissions, in order to align with the 2030 target of reducing net emissions by 55%.\n\nA provisional agreement was reached in December 2022, a few days after the agreement on the CBAM (see our related News Alert here ).\n\nThe successful conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the ETS was crucial to the final adoption of the CBAM, as the CBAM will replace the ETS in the sectors to which it applies.\n\nThis will be achieved by a phasing-out of the free ETS allowances from 2026 to 2034 and a corresponding phasing-in of the CBAM.\n\nThe reduction rate for free ETS allowances is as follows: 2026: 2.5%; 2027: 5%; 2028: 10%; 2029: 22.5%: 2030: 48.5%; 2031: 61%; 2032: 73.5%; 2033: 86%; 2034: 100%.Until the free ETS allowances are completely phased out, the financial obligations under the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions which do not receive free allowances under the ETS."
