Noerr,Caution needed when shareholders waive claims,"Background Shareholders of corporations and partnerships waiving claims is a widespread structuring tool for boosting companies in financial trouble.

Shareholder waivers also have a solid place in preparing for company successions, especially in partnerships.

In these cases they can reduce harmful administrative assets as part of the exemption of business assets from inheritance or gift tax.

However, the income tax implications of shareholder waivers must always be examined, as a recent decision by Germany’s Federal Fiscal Court (BFH) on 16 December 2023 (case IV R 28/20) shows once again.

Income tax treatment of shareholder waivers at corporations The income tax treatment of shareholders of a corporation waiving claims has been largely clarified by numerous BFH rulings.

First of all, it must be determined whether the claims waiver is business-related or caused by the company relationship.

It is generally assumed that the waiver of claims is due to the company relationship if a non-shareholder would not have declared the waiver of claims if such non-shareholder had exercised the due care of a prudent businessman (known as the arm’s length principle).

If the waiver of the claim is caused by the company relationship, a hidden contribution to the corporation is to be assumed in the amount of the recoverable part of the claim and a generally taxable income of the corporation in the amount of the non-recoverable part of the claim as a result of the derecognition of the corresponding liability (the BFH calls this a discontinuation gain).

In addition, the balance of the corporation’s tax contribution account is increased by the recoverable portion of the receivable.

If the claims waiver is for operational reasons (e.g. because major third-party creditors also waive their claims), the corresponding liability of the corporation must be derecognised and, subject to a tax exemption for restructuring income, the full nominal amount of the liability results in a taxable discontinuation gain at the level of the corporation.

Income tax treatment of partner waivers at partnerships Until the ruling of 16 December 2023, the tax implications of a shareholder waiver with respect to partnerships had not yet been covered by supreme court case law.

The legal situation is therefore much less certain than in the case of shareholder waivers at corporations.

There are various opinions on this in the legal literature, including the opinion that criteria which are relevant in the context of shareholder waivers in relation to corporations, such as the nature of the reason for the waiver (operational or through the company relationship) and the recoverability of the receivable, are far less important in the case of a partnership due to the income tax transparency of partnerships and that even if a receivable with a reduced value is waived, a taxable gain is not effectively realised at the level of the partnership at all or is only realised in the future (when the waiving partner leaves the partnership or the partnership is dissolved).

BFH ruling of 16 December 2023 In its ruling of 16 December 2023, the BFH had to rule on the tax implications of a partner waiver in partnerships for the first time.

The question at issue was whether a taxable discontinuation gain arises if a partner acquires a receivable from “their” partnership for less than the nominal value and subsequently waives the (worthless) part of the claim that exceeds the purchase price.

The lower court took the view that taxable income arose in the partnership, but that this income should be allocated to a tax equalisation item and only taxed when the partner leaves the partnership or when the partnership is fully terminated.

In deviation from this, the BFH ruled that the resulting income could not be neutralised by creating a tax adjustment item.

As a result, in the view of the BFH, the partnership realises a discontinuation gain that is immediately taxable."
Noerr,Caution needed when shareholders waive claims,"As a result, in the view of the BFH, the partnership realises a discontinuation gain that is immediately taxable.

According to the BFH, this was not in conflict with the income tax transparency of partnerships.

The fiscal authorities have decided to apply the BFH ruling on a general basis.

Analysis and practical implications Caution is also needed when partners in a partnership waive claims.

It is often said that a shareholder waiver has no income tax disadvantages, regardless of the reason for the waiver and the recoverability of the receivable, in any event due to the transparency principle, or that such tax disadvantages would only be effectively realised at a later date.

As the BFH decision shows, this must be examined on a case-by-case basis and may result in an immediately taxable discontinuation gain if the valuation of the receivable in the special tax balance sheet of the partner differs for any reason from the valuation of the corresponding liability at the level of the partnership.

In practice, these cases are not always immediately obvious.

In addition to the commercial balance sheets, the special tax balance sheets must also be audited.

If the valuations in the special tax balance sheet of the partner and in the overall balance sheet of the partnership correspond, a waiver by the partner (even if the value of the receivable is limited or non-existent) should still not lead to a taxable discontinuation gain at the level of the partnership, because any income from the derecognition of the partnership’s liability is offset by an expense of the same value in the special tax balance sheet of the partner.

While the BFH did not have to rule on this specific question in the case at hand, the strict “accounting” approach taken by the BFH supports this interpretation.

The BFH ruling is likely to have rendered obsolete the arrangement proposed in legal literature of selling the receivable in question below its nominal value to a shareholder who subsequently declares a shareholder waiver instead of a claim waiver by a non-shareholder.

In addition to the income tax implications of a claim waiver, any gift tax implications must not be neglected."
Noerr,"EU merger control: European Commission takes stricter action against submission of incorrect, incomplete and misleading information","Some two years after the collapsed acquisition of Trimo by Kingspan, the European Commission now charges Kingspan over providing incorrect, incomplete and misleading information during the merger control review.

The European Commission has issued a Statement of Objection which outlines its preliminary findings.

The procedure may result in severe fines and once again highlights that companies need to check very carefully the information they provide in the context of merger control proceedings.

This applies not only to the parties directly involved in the transaction (acquirer, target, joint venture partner) but also to any third parties questioned, such as competitors, customers or suppliers.

Background: Proposed acquisition Kingspan, an Irish manufacturer of insulation panels, notified the European Commission about the proposed acquisition of its Slovenian competitor Trimo in March 2021.

In the in-depth examination procedure, the Commission outlined its competition concerns: higher prices, lower quality and less choice on certain national building materials markets for mineral fibre sandwich panels which are used for the construction, renovation and insulation of industrial and commercial buildings.

Kingspan and Trimo eventually abandoned the transaction.

Further investigation: Incorrect, incomplete and/or misleading information?

The European Commission did not leave it there.

A few months later, it launched an investigation to determine whether Kingspan had intentionally or negligently provided incorrect, incomplete and/or misleading information during the merger control proceedings.

The European Commission has now informed Kingspan that it considers its suspicion confirmed with regard to the following facts: Internal organisation, relevant aspects aimed at assessing the relevant product and geographical market, barriers to market entry and expansion, importance of innovation, and closeness of competition between Kingspan and Trimo and their competitors.

Kingspan will now comment on this preliminary assessment by the Commission.

Infringements may lead to significant fines The obligation not to provide incorrect, incomplete and/or misleading information applies equally to European and German merger control proceedings.

The scope of the obligation and the risk of a fine depends on the type of information request or transmission: Merger notification: The obligation comprehensively applies to information provided in the merger notification (including annexes, certifications, and supplements thereto).

Infringements can be sanctioned with a fine.

In addition, incomplete mandatory information also renders a filing not complete; the time limits provided for in the European Merger Control Regulation do not start to run.

Simple oral questioning : Simple oral questioning, for example via telephone/video calls, is a tool often used by competition authorities to gather information quickly and easily.

The obligation not to provide incorrect and/or misleading information also applies in this case.

However, infringements cannot be sanctioned with a fine.

Simple request for information: The vast majority of information requested in merger control proceedings is demanded by way of a simple request for information (RFI).

The obligation not to provide incorrect and/or misleading information applies, but legally, there is no obligation to provide the information at all.

The provision of incomplete information can only constitute an infringement if the partial information is misleading about the true facts.

Infringements in the context of simple requests for information can be sanctioned with a fine in European merger control proceedings – unlike in German merger control proceedings.

Formal request for information : The European Commission may also request information by way of formal decision to receive the requested information."
Noerr,"EU merger control: European Commission takes stricter action against submission of incorrect, incomplete and misleading information","Formal request for information : The European Commission may also request information by way of formal decision to receive the requested information.

In addition to the obligation not to provide incorrect and/or misleading information, there is an obligation to provide (complete) information within the time limit set, which can be enforced with coercive measures if necessary.

Infringements can be sanctioned with a fine.

Formal requests for information are often not necessary because the mere threat of them is sufficient to obtain a response to a simple request for information.

Due to the principle of proportionality, a formal request for information must only be used if necessary.

However, there is no strict priority of simple information requests.

The European Commission has the discretion to directly use formal requests for information if it has reasonable grounds to assume that a simple request for information will not be sufficient.

The European Commission (as well as the German Federal Cartel Office) can impose a fine of up to 1% of the total (group) turnover of the company concerned in the last financial year for each infringement that is subject to a fine.

Importantly, it does not matter whether the information provided has an impact on the outcome of the merger control proceedings.

The nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement as well as any aggravating or mitigating circumstances – such as cooperating with the European Commission in the infringement proceedings – are taken into account when setting the fine.

The fine must be both proportionate and deterrent.

The fines imposed by the European Commission for incorrect or misleading information illustrate the relevance: EUR 110 million in 2017 on Meta, EUR 52 million in 2019 on General Electric and EUR 7.5 million in 2021 on Sigma-Aldrich.

The German Federal Cartel Office has also taken action in recent years, albeit with significantly smaller fines.

Assessment and practical implications The Kingspan case is of great significance because it is the first time the focus seems to concern incorrect, incomplete and misleading information relating to relevant aspects of the qualitative market assessments.

It must be acknowledged that for its merger control assessment, the European Commission is dependent on comprehensive and precise information, most of which can only be provided by the parties.

The information provided by the parties to the merger and third parties questioned ensures the effectiveness of merger control.

However, descriptions of the relevant markets, the barriers to market entry or the closeness of competition are in complex cases all but straightforward and not simply true or false.

Companies and their advisors should nevertheless always check information provided in merger control proceedings very carefully to avoid being accused of providing incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information.

Given the far-reaching information obligations and requests for information, and the often very tight deadlines in merger control proceedings, this can be a considerable challenge for companies which can only be overcome by careful preparation of the filing and provision of sufficient resources."

Noerr,Role of the DMA for app developers,"In September 2023, the European Commission (“ Commission ”) designated Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft as gatekeepers under the DMA.

This is based on the total of 22 core platform services (“ CPS ”) operated by these six companies.

The CPS provided in the DMA are all characterised by the fact that they act as an interface between a large number of end users on the one hand and commercial users on the other.

CPS also include operating systems and app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google.

App developers are dependent on these stores to the extent that they can largely only reach their customers via app stores or operating systems.

Accordingly, app developers are dependent on the gatekeepers granting them transparent and non-discriminatory access to customers.

As of 7 March 2024 – known as DMA ‘Compliance Day’ – gatekeepers had to have implemented the DMA obligations and prepared (and regularly updated) reports outlining how they comply with their DMA obligations.

The Commission published the reports on its website in a non-confidential version.

Following these reports, the Commission initiated official proceedings for failure to implement the DMA obligations as early as on 25 March 2024, i.e. not even 20 days after DMA Compliance Day.

In particular, Apple and Google are accused of failing to comply with the requirements of the DMA in the design of their app stores (see Commission press release ).

Non-compliance proceedings may lead to substantial fines for the gatekeepers.

In addition, the gatekeepers may be confronted with legal proceedings initiated by users and app developers before national courts based on non-compliance with the DMA obligations (private actions for abatement, injunctions and damages; more background information on this can be found in our article on Noerr News ).

Which obligations are particularly relevant to app developers?

The DMA contains more than twenty obligations in Articles 5-7, many of which also have at least an indirect impact on app developers.

Below, we highlight the three most important obligations that are likely to lead to particularly far-reaching changes to app developers’ rights and options.

Authorisation of steering measures – Article 5(4)

DMA Gatekeepers are obliged to allow measures by app developers with which they advertise to end users, particularly as part of their intermediary services and operating systems.

It is important to note that the advertising can also relate to products and terms not even offered by the app developer via the gatekeeper’s CPS.

This is intended especially to prevent commercial users from being obliged to offer products exclusively via the gatekeeper’s CPS.

The DMA therefore aims at reducing dependencies of commercial users by enabling them to steer their end users away from the gatekeepers’ CPS (known as “steering measures”).

It is worth mentioning that the Commission recently (i.e. before DMA Compliance Day) fined Apple over €1.8 billion for similar behaviour on the basis of antitrust provisions, and not under the DMA ( Commission press release ).

In the case at issue, Apple had prohibited developers of music streaming services from referring to and advertising cheaper offers outside the Apple ecosystem.

Significance for app developers: App developers have the right to communicate their offers and alternative (especially cheaper) distribution channels to end users via each gatekeeper’s core platform services.

Obligation to allow the installation and use of third-party software – Article 6(4)

DMA Article 6(4)

DMA requires gatekeepers offering an operating system as a CPS to allow the effective use of apps and app stores from other providers.

Compliance with this obligation requires transparent and non-discriminatory access to the technical programming interface of the operating system for app developers so that the apps can be installed on the relevant operating system."
Noerr,Role of the DMA for app developers,"Gatekeepers must also allow side-loading which means the option of obtaining and installing an app via channels other than the official app stores of the operating system.

The purpose of this obligation is to open up closed business models in which using the operating system previously required using the company’s own app store.

The obligation is intended to encourage competition between app stores on all operating systems and enable cost-effective and simple distribution for app developers.

Significance for app developers: App developers have a right with respect to operating systems (that are designated as CPS) to distribute their apps via other/their own app stores or other distribution channels without being restricted to using a particular operating system.

Interoperability obligations for operating systems – Article 6(7)

DMA Article 6(7)

DMA states that gatekeepers must permit the exchange of different information with other software and hardware free of charge (known as interoperability) in relation to operating systems and virtual assistants designated as CPS.

By way of an example, gatekeepers must ensure from a technical perspective that app developers have access to all features of an operating system.

Such requirement shall ensure that app developers can offer apps other than those of the operating system operator but with comparable features.

The aim of interoperability is thus to facilitate competition at app level.

Without interoperability, a gatekeeper could otherwise exploit a possible dual role as the operator of a CPS and the sole provider of compatible products.

Significance for app developers: App developers are entitled to obtain free and effective access from gatekeepers who operate an operating system or a virtual assistant as a CPS to those CPS by means of interoperability for complementary software and hardware.

How can app developers enforce their rights?

The Commission enforces the DMA, and app developers could approach the authority in Brussels in order to prompt action against the gatekeepers.

In addition to such public enforcement.

affected parties can therefore bring civil actions for injunctions (including interim relief) and, if necessary, claims for damages before the national courts in the EU (private enforcement – see our Noerr News article for more information).

Once the Commission (and, if applicable, the courts) have found a breach of the DMA, follow-on actions for damages against gatekeepers will also be possible.

With the 11th Amendment to the German Act against Restraints of Competition, the German legislators have extended the binding effect of Commission decisions familiar from antitrust law to Commission decisions on the DMA.

What comes next?

The Commission must complete its investigations into Alphabet’s, Apple’s and Meta’s practices within twelve months.

Of particular relevance to app developers is the question as to whether and to what extent Alphabet and Apple are in breach of the DMA due to the way they organise the terms and conditions of their app stores.

App developers and other affected parties may in principle also take action against the gatekeepers in national courts even before the Commission’s proceedings are concluded.

Note : The book New Digital Markets Act (DMA) , recently issued by Jens Peter Schmidt and Fabian Hübener, is our assessment of the background to, implementation of and compliance with the DMA.

Please contact us if you would like further advice and tailored solutions regarding the DMA and related competition law issues."
Noerr,Federal Court of Justice confirms relevance of negative interest rates when calculating early repayment compensation,"In a long awaited judgment ( XI ZR 159/23 ), the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) confirmed that the creditor may calculate its losses caused by the termination of a loan agreement secured by a mortgage on the basis of the interest rate applicable to the reinvestment of the repaid loan even if the interest rate is negative.

Background

The starting point of the judgment is section 490 (2) sentence 3 of the German Civil Code.

According to this provision, the borrower is obliged to compensate the bank for the loss arising from the premature termination of a loan agreement that is secured by a mortgage (so-called early repayment compensation – Vorfälligkeitsentschädigung ).

According to longstanding case law the bank can choose between two methods for calculating its loss: The first method assumes that the prematurely repaid loan amount is reissued as a fixed-interest mortgage loan.

The second method, the so-called ‘asset/liability method’ ( Aktiv-Passiv-Methode ) is based on the principle that the creditor’s loss of profit is calculated by taking into account the notional return that it could expect to obtain if it reinvested the funds released by the early repayment in mortgage bonds with maturities corresponding to the term of the loan.

Prior to the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice, there was no consensus among courts how to deal with the problem that negative reinvestment interest rates had formed on the market for the relevant capital market securities.

In some cases, the consideration of negative interest rates was allowed, in others it was rejected.

Arguments of the Federal Court of Justice for relevance of negative interest rates The Federal Court of Justice agreed with the courts which based the calculation of the early repayment compensation on negative interest rates.

The court simply applied the principles already established to the scenario of negative reinvestment interest rates.

According to theses principles the creditor may notionally calculate its loss on the basis of a reinvestment in mortgage bonds with matching maturities (paras. 17 et seq. of the judgment).

According to the court, this starting point applies irrespective of the relevant interest rate environment (para.

18 of the judgment).

This is convincing because the relevant legal principles should indeed apply regardless of actual developments such as the development of market interest rates which cannot be influenced by the contractual parties.

In this respect, the Federal Court of Justice explicitly rejects the idea that the abstract calculation of damages, which is detached from the actual reinvestment, violates the principle under German law that there may not be any overcompensation.

Here too, the court emphasised that the already accepted principles apply and that there is no reason to deviate from these principles if the applicable interest rates are negative.

According to these principles, the creditor may calculate its loss in the abstract because the successful claim of an early repayment compensation would otherwise be thwarted by practically impossible requirements of proof (paras. 20 et seq. of the judgment).

Implications and outlook With this judgment, the Federal Court of Justice has created legal clarity and certainty for a large number of past cases in which creditors calculated the early repayment compensation based on negative reinvestment interest rates.

The wave of requests for reimbursement that would otherwise be expected will therefore not materialise.

As a negative interest rate environment is not to be expected in the foreseeable future, the judgment has no direct significance for loan agreements that will be terminated in the future.

However, the judgment underlines the fact that the Federal Court of Justice will continue to adhere to established principles for calculating damages in the future and will not deviate from them lightly."
Noerr,Supply chain compliance: CSDDD and EU Forced Labour Regulation coming soon,"This week, MEPs voted to pass two important pieces of legislation in the field of supply chain compliance that many companies will have to focus on over the next few years: the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Regulation (“ CSDDD ”, also known as “CS3D”) and the Regulation on prohibiting products made with forced labour on the Union market (“ EU Forced Labour Regulation ”).

I. European Supply Chain Act On 24 April 2024

, representatives of the European Parliament adopted the final text of the CSDDD with 374 out of 628 votes.

The text has not been changed since the Committee of the Permanent Representatives (COREPER) were able to reach a compromise about a month before.

We summarised the key contents of the CSDDD in a Noerr News article at the time.

The European Council now has to formally approve the CSDDD so the text can be published in the Official Journal of the EU.

The EU Member States will then have two years to implement the CSDDD into national law.

After much toing and froing, this means there will also be a supply chain act at European level.

II.

Tighter rules for products on the Union market Just one day before the CSDDD was adopted, a large majority of MEPs voted in favour of the final text of the EU Forced Labour Regulation .

Essentially, products manufactured using forced labour at any stage of the supply chain should not be allowed to be imported, made available or exported to the Union market.

All natural and legal persons or associations of persons who place, supply or export products on the Union market are covered.

Unlike in the CSDDD, there is no employee or turnover threshold.

Moreover, the term “product” is to be understood broadly and encompasses anything that can be valued in money and is capable of forming the subject of commercial transactions.

The competent supervisory authorities will be given far-reaching powers to carry out investigations and to ban products or groups of products from the European market where appropriate.

A database is also to be established in which these bans will be published and to which whistleblowers will be able to submit tip-offs.

The Regulation also provides for steep fines if companies infringe a ban that has been imposed or a related order.

The Member States have to apply the Regulation within three years of it coming into force.

III.

Conclusion In the future, companies will have to take an even closer look at the human rights, environmental and climate-related aspects of their supply chains and products.

Both Regulations give the supervisory authorities responsible far-reaching powers to impose penalties and intervene.

New litigation and reputational risks are emerging as the public and stakeholders are granted more rights.

Civil liability under the CSDDD is a striking example of this.

From a compliance point of view, companies covered by the Regulations will have to examine how these new requirements will affect their processes and structures, especially their risk management systems.

The fact that provisions in the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, LkSG ) may overlap with those of the EU Forced Labour Regulation and the CSDDD is also likely to pose challenges.

It will make sense to take a holistic approach and consider other possible rules and legislation such as the rules on conflict minerals.

Looking at the EU Forced Labour Regulation, we can also see that above all projects with long planning phases already have to take into account the risks of using products made with forced labour and reduce those risks as far as possible at this stage.

Over the next few months, we will examine important aspects of the CSDDD and the EU Forced Labour Regulation and keep you up to date on any new developments.

Noerr,Update on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“FSR”): First dawn raid by the European Commission at a Chinese manufacturer of security equipment,"On Tuesday, 23 April 2024, the European Commission carried out the first unannounced inspections as part of an ex officio investigation under the FSR on suspicion of foreign subsidies that could distort the internal market.

According to a press release from the European Commission, several business premises of a security equipment manufacturer in the European Union were searched.

The company in question is the Chinese state-owned company Nuctech, which manufactures surveillance technology and security equipment, and whose business premises in Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Warsaw (Poland) were searched.

According to various press reports, IT equipment, mobile phones, documents and other data were seized during the search.

The European Commission officials were accompanied by officials from the national competition authorities.

Nuctech is a manufacturer of surveillance technology and security equipment and produces baggage security scanners for airports and seaports, among other things.

According to publicly available sources, Nuctech is wholly owned by the Chinese state and has been listed by the US as a company that acts contrary to US national security interests.

Collaboration with Nuctech has also been seen as controversial in the European Union in the past.

According to Article 10 (1) (b) and Article 14 of the FSR, the European Commission may conduct inspections of undertakings within the European Union as part of a preliminary investigation in case of indications of foreign subsidies distorting the internal market and, in this context, seize or request documents or access other information.

When doing so, the European Commission usually cooperates with officials from the Member States, in this case with officials from the Dutch and Polish authorities.

In addition, the European Commission has the option under Article 15 of the FSR to conduct inspections even outside the European Union.

In its official statement, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce expressed serious concern about the unannounced inspection of the European subsidiaries of a Chinese company.

This first dawn raid follows a series of in-depth investigations by the European Commission under the FSR’s public procurement tool, all of which have targeted Chinese companies so far, as well as an initial ex officio investigation into Chinese wind turbine manufacturers (see our articles of 19 February 2024 and 11 April 2024 ).

This is the second ex officio investigation, i.e., an investigation in which the European Commission acts on its own initiative, and the first dawn raid under the FSR.

In addition to these investigations based on the FSR, the European Commission has launched other investigations into China, such as an anti-subsidy investigation in the area of electric vehicles and, more recently, investigations under the International Procurement Instrument for medical devices.

Outlook The European Commission’s most recent measure clearly shows that it is already making use of the full range of tools available under the FSR soon after the regulation came into force.

In addition to the in-depth investigations carried out to date based on the public procurement tool, the European Commission is apparently already prepared to initiate ex officio investigations and, in cases of sufficient indications of foreign subsidies, to carry out on-site dawn raids at companies.

Further ex officio investigations are likely to follow.

It is telling (although unsurprising) that the European Commission’s reviews and investigations have so far been focussed exclusively on Chinese companies.

This tallies with the European Union’s other commercial and political measures.

China is therefore likely to continue to be in the focus of the implementation of the FSR in the future.

Recent developments show that the European Commission’s FSR-based investigations are gaining momentum."
Noerr,Update on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“FSR”): First dawn raid by the European Commission at a Chinese manufacturer of security equipment,"Recent developments show that the European Commission’s FSR-based investigations are gaining momentum.

Noerr,New since 15 March 2024: Third-party notices in DIS arbitration proceedings - The Supplementary Rules for Third-Party Notices (DIS-TPNR),"In state-court proceedings in Germany, third-party notices are a proven remedy to avoid contradictory decisions or suspend a statute of limitations.

If a dispute is announced to a third party who is not already a party to that legal dispute, the third party must accept the decision in a subsequent legal dispute against them.

The main use of the third-party notice is in constellations where there are claims against a third party for warranty or indemnification.

This often involves supply chain and subcontractor relationships or joint and several liability.

The third party can join the legal dispute as an intervening party in order to actively participate in the proceedings and support the defense of the main party.

The German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) regulates third-party notice in state court proceedings; however, involvement of third parties in arbitration proceedings requires the consent of all parties involved and is therefore more difficult.

While the arbitration rules (DIS Rules) of the German Arbitration Institute (DIS) already contain provisions on the involvement of third parties (see Art.

18 f. DIS Rules), they fall short of the concept of third-party notice in the ZPO.

With the Supplementary Rules for Third-Party Notices ( DIS-TPNR ), effective as of 15 March 2024, it is now possible - similar to the requirements for court proceedings in the ZPO - to notify third parties of a dispute in a simpler and more legally-secure manner in accordance with a standardized procedure.

Unlike previously utilized Art.

18 f. DIS Rules, the DIS-TPNR comprehensively regulate the requirements and legal consequences of a third-party notice.

According to Art. 1 DIS-TPNR, the rules apply if the parties have agreed to their applicability.

Also according to the DIS-TPNR, it remains the case that all parties must agree in order to be bound by the outcome of arbitration proceedings.

Nevertheless, the DIS-TPNR provide model agreements that facilitate this consent, which can be found on the DIS website: German Arbitration Institute (DIS): DIS Model Clauses (disarb.org) .

When concluding new contracts, the DIS-TPNR can regularly be used even before a dispute arises to enable a later notice of dispute.

The DIS-TPNR in detail: Admissibility and procedure A third-party notice is admissible pursuant to Art.

2 DIS-TPNR if a party believes it has a claim for warranty or indemnification against a third party in the event of an unfavorable outcome of the DIS arbitration proceedings or if it is concerned about the claim of a third party.

Additionally, the third party must have agreed to a third-party notice in accordance with the DIS-TPNR (based on Section 72 ZPO).

To give the third-party notice, a party submits a written submission to the DIS.

The DIS assists by transmitting that submission to the third party being notified and to the other party to the DIS arbitration proceedings (Art. 3, 6 DIS-TPNR).

The submission must also specifically name the agreement wherein the third party has acquiesced to a third-party notice under the DIS-TPNR.

As is allowed under the rules of the ZPO (Section 75 ZPO), the third party may also join the arbitration proceedings under the DIS-TPNR as an intervening party in support of the party giving notice of dispute (Art.

6.2 DIS-TPNR).

In principle, such an intervention must be made within 21 days of the notification of the third-party notice to the third party.

A key aspect of arbitration law is that the parties involved in the proceedings select the arbitrators themselves.

The DIS-TPNR ensure that, in addition to the parties, third parties can also influence the selection of arbitrators if they join the proceedings as intervening parties.

To this end, it is stipulated that a third-party notice must be issued before the arbitral tribunal is constituted (Art. 4, 7, 8 DIS-TPNR)."
Noerr,New since 15 March 2024: Third-party notices in DIS arbitration proceedings - The Supplementary Rules for Third-Party Notices (DIS-TPNR),"To this end, it is stipulated that a third-party notice must be issued before the arbitral tribunal is constituted (Art. 4, 7, 8 DIS-TPNR).

The arbitral tribunal may also, however, authorize a third-party notice at a later stage in the arbitration proceedings.

This presupposes that the third party agrees to the third-party notice and declares that (a) it raises no objections to the composition of the arbitral tribunal, and (b) it accepts the proceedings as they stand at the time of the third-party notice.

Objections to the validity and effect of the third-party notice Objections to the validity of the third-party notice may be raised by the parties or the intervening party within 21 days after the intervening party submits the declaration of intervention.

Only an intervening third party may raise such an objection as an intervening party.

Indeed, Art. 10.1 sentence 2 DIS-TPNR allows a third party to intervene in the arbitration only for the purpose of objecting to the validity of the third-party notice.

The effects of a third-party notice under the DIS-TPNR are also based on the provisions of the ZPO.

In particular, the third party will not be heard in relation to the party giving notice of dispute in a subsequent dispute based on the assertion that the dispute was incorrectly decided (Art. 11.1 DIS-TPNR).

Due to the third party’s agreement to the DIS-TPNR, the third party is, vis-à-vis the party giving third-party notice, obliged to recognize these effects in the subsequent dispute (Art. 11.2 DIS-TPNR).

Furthermore, the limitation period vis-à-vis the third party is suspended (Art. 11.4 DIS-TPNR).

Evaluation and outlook Overall, the DIS-TPNR are to be welcomed.

They regulate third-party notices in DIS arbitration proceedings with legal certainty and thereby take into account the interests of the parties involved in a balanced manner.

It should be emphasized that a third-party notice of arbitration under the DIS-TPNR is not only effective if the subsequent proceedings are also DIS arbitration proceedings, but even if they are arbitration proceedings under other rules or state court proceedings.

There are other offers for rules on third-party notice in arbitration proceedings, in particular the Munich Rules on the Participation of Third Parties in Arbitration Proceedings (Munich Rules).

In comparison, the DIS-TPNR offer a more legally secure option due to their alignment with the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) and the model clauses provided.

With the Munich Rules, on the other hand, the effect of the third-party notice depends on questions of interpretation in the relationship between the parties.

The DIS-TPNR are also binding in both the German and English versions, which should make it easier in particular for international parties to reach an agreement.

It remains to be seen, however, whether they will become relevant for international constellations, as the involvement of third parties does not naturally correspond to the ZPO model internationally.

The DIS-TPNR are available here German Arbitration Institute (DIS): DIS Rules (disarb.org) .

When drafting new arbitration clauses, the possibility of agreeing to the DIS-TPNR should already be considered in order to be able to benefit from it later.

It will be interesting to see how the instrument is accepted in practice."
Noerr,Data Compliance Governance,"Following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016 and the Data Governance Act (DGA) in 2022, the European legislature has set a further regulatory milestone with the Data Act (DA) early 2024.

The Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA ) already approved by the European Parliament will soon further complement the regulation of data and artificial intelligence within the European Union.

In total, a series of directly applicable regulations and numerous other legal acts form the new European data law .

Data Compliance Adhering to regulatory requirements is one of the core components of “ data compliance” which has become an integral part of business, regardless of an organization’s industry and size.

Data compliance essentially covers any applicable rules organizations must adhere to when processing (personal and non-personal) data including statutory requirements , contractual terms, certifications, codes of conduct, industry standards as well as binding corporate rules and internal policies .

The extensive European data law requirements essentially establish the regulatory framework for setting up business processes as well as the design and utilization of applications and systems within an organization.

Adhering to the regulatory requirements of data law by way of “ data compliance by design ” will play a crucial role for the sustainable success of most digital business models.

Compliance Risks Non-compliance with European regulation of data and AI may have serious negative consequences for affected organizations, including: Severe administrative fines (up to EUR 35m or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) Actions of competitors under laws on unfair competition Claims for damages by affected persons, customers and business partners Loss of reputation Negative impact on ESG ratings Data Compliance Governance To effectively manage the multitude of data compliance requirements in practice, a robust and efficient data compliance governance is essential.

This involves establishing effective organisational structures and practical processes for implementing data compliance requirements with clearly defined roles and responsibilities .

Data compliance management systems (DCMS) complement and expand upon the perspective of already established data protection management systems (DPMS).

These systems together are designed to systematically plan , implement , continuously monitor and improve measures to comply with regulatory requirements for both personal and non-personal data as well as for artificial intelligence.

Noerr,"Data Act – Scope, Impact, Implementation","As of early 2024, the new Data Act entered into force and is set to be largely enforceable from 2025.

This new regulatory framework may require significant legal and engineering effort to (re-)design affected products/services and business processes to ensure compliance.

Organizations are advised to evaluate their compliance strategies well in advance of the enforcement deadlines, given the complexity of changes and efforts for implementing technical and organizational solutions.

Scope

The Data Act focuses on data in relation to the use of IoT-devices and device-related services ( personal and non-personal data ) and will apply various entities, including: Manufacturers of connected products and/or providers of product-related digital services as well as users of connected products and/or related services Data holders (entities who have the right or obligation to use and make available data, including due to data access obligations under the Data Act itself) and data recipients (entities to whom a data holder makes data available) Providers of data processing services (cloud computing services)

Obligations The Data Act imposes various obligations, including: Accessibility of data from connected products and related services by design Making available data from connected products and related services to users and third parties Data licences for the use of non-personal data from connected products and related services Contractual terms for data access and data processing services and FRAND conditions Facilitating interoperability and switching between data processing services Transparency (information to users/customers)

Timeline The Data Act will generally be applicable from September 12, 2025

The data accessibility requirement will apply to connected products and related services placed on the market after September 12, 2026 Compliance risks Access under the Data Act might lead to conflicts with IP/trade secret protection and GDPR data protection requirements which remain unaffected by the Data Act.

Organisations face the challenge of complying with both the Data Act and the GDPR while maintaining legitimate IP/trade secret protection.

Non-compliance with the Data Act and/or the GDPR may have serious negative consequences for affected organizations, including: Severe administrative fines (up to EUR 20m or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) Actions of competitors under laws on unfair competition Claims for damages by affected persons Loss of reputation Our Data, Tech & Telecoms team is happy to support on any data regulatory matters.

Noerr,Russia sanctions: EU banks’ reporting obligations clarified,"As part of the Russia sanctions, banks and financial institutions are increasingly subject to auditing and reporting obligations (e.g. in Article 5a(4a) and Article 5g of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014).

A new reporting obligation will come into force on 1 July 2024.

This concerns outgoing payments from the EU by undertakings and other entities and bodies held by Russian owners.

On 12 April 2024, the Commission published guidance on these latest reporting obligations.

This addresses 16 frequently asked questions.

[1] Additionally, a template for reporting to the national competent authorities – in Germany, the Bundesbank – was published.

[2] A. Extensive reporting obligations for companies and banks In December 2023, Article 5r was added to Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

[3] Paragraph 1 of Article 5r Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 requires legal persons, entities and bodies established in the EU to report transfers of funds of more than €100,000 to a destination country outside the European Union in cases where more than 40% of the ownership rights in the paying entity are held directly or indirectly by (a) legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia or (b) Russian nationals or (c) a natural person residing in Russia.

In addition, Article 5r(2) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 requires credit and financial institutions to report such transfers of funds if they are initiated on behalf of an institution held from within Russia within the meaning of paragraph 1.

B. Comprehensive scope and demarcation problems The Commission’s questions and answers mainly concern the scope of application of the provision, namely the question of whether a report is required at all.

The modalities of the reporting procedure are also examined.

With regard to the scope of application of the reporting obligation for credit and financial institutions, it is first clarified that branches outside the European Union are also covered if the branch does not have its own (foreign) legal personality (Questions 4 and 5).

Moreover, it is also clarified that the term “funds” as referenced in Article 5r of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 encompasses financial assets and benefits of any kind (see also Art. 1 lit. zd))

(Question 3).

It is not necessary for the reporting threshold of €100,000 to be exceeded by an individual transfer; rather, individual payments within the reporting period are added up (Question 7).

The identification of EU companies and entities (indirectly) held from within Russia within the scope of the reporting obligation is likely to cause considerable practical difficulties.

In this respect, the Commission clarifies that the 40% threshold is calculated on an aggregate basis.

Accordingly, the reporting obligation applies if the sum of all property rights held by relevant Russian groups of persons exceeds the threshold (Question 9).

“Indirect” ownership status on the part of the relevant Russian groups of persons within the meaning of Article 5r of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 means ultimate ownership status that is legally mediated by intermediary entities and legal persons (“intermediaries”).

De facto control for exerting influence is not relevant (Question 10).

Credit and financial institutions must initially identify the EU undertakings, entities or bodies concerned that are held from within Russia on the basis of know-your-customer information.

If not all relevant information is available, the missing information must be gathered in the next regular customer screening (Question 12).

Furthermore, the identification of “indirect transfers” within the meaning of Article 5r(2) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 is likely to present complex practical issues.

In this regard, the Commission provides an example according to which a transfer via one or more intermediaries in the EU with an ultimate destination outside the European Union is deemed to be an indirect transfer (Question 6)."
Noerr,Russia sanctions: EU banks’ reporting obligations clarified,"Moreover, the reporting modalities have been specified in detail, in particular by providing the reporting template.

The reports from credit and financial institutions for the first half of 2024 are due by 15 July 2024 and for the second half of 2024 by 15 January 2025 (Question 8).

Concerning corporate groups, the individual legal entities within the group are obliged to report to the relevant authorities in the according Member State.

It is not possible to submit a collective report for a corporate group covering the entire EU (Question 15).

C. Uncertainties remain despite clarifications The new guidance provides some welcome clarifications in view of the approaching reporting deadlines.

However, considerable uncertainties are likely to remain in practice when assessing whether certain transfers are reportable.

In view of the first reporting deadline of 15 July 2024, the credit and financial institutions concerned should drive forward the implementation of the new reporting obligations as soon as possible.

Noerr,Rebates and bonuses back on the agenda of the competition authorities,"Rebates or discounts, bonuses and other sales promotion measures (hereinafter ""rebates"") are common practice in distribution systems and as such are generally legitimate measures for increasing sales.

At the same time, the rules of competition law must always be considered when designing rebates programs.

Sales promotions have in common that the provider or supplier voluntarily offers the customer additional benefits that are linked to the fulfilment of certain conditions.

There are sales-related rebates such as volume rebates (e.g. simple volume rebates, target rebates, loyalty or exclusive rebates) and non-sales-related rebates that reward certain other services provided by the customer (e.g. service and function rebates, cash rebates, availability rebates).

In practice, the design of rebate programs is very diverse.

From a competition law perspective, the prohibition to abuse a dominant position must be observed (A.) as well as the cartel prohibition which also sets limits on the design of rebate programs (B.).

A. Abuse of a dominant position power in respect to rebate programs An undertaking in a dominant position has a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair genuine undistorted competition on the common market.

They must therefore also ensure that the implementation of rebate programs do not amount to an abuse of the companies’ dominance.

Who is the norm addressee?

The addressees of the European prohibition to abuse a dominant position are dominant companies.

Dominance has been defined under European law as a position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking, which enables it to prevent effective competition being maintained on a relevant market, by affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, its customers and ultimately of consumers.

The German prohibition to abuse a dominant is wider in scope and is also applicable to companies with relative market power.

Relative market power can be assumed if other companies are dependent on a company as suppliers or buyers of a certain type of goods in such a way that there are no sufficient and reasonable opportunities to switch to third parties.

There are no rigid limits either for a dominant market position or for relative market power.

It is necessary to consider the individual case.

However, the thresholds in the following overview can serve as a reference point: Click on the image or here to enlarge it When may rebates be abusive?

Abuses can often be qualified as either exclusionary or exploitative.

They are qualified as exclusionary where a company seeks to use its market power to exclude its rivals to restrict competition.

They qualify as exploitative where a company uses its market power to extract rents from customers and consumers.

Regarding rebates both categories can be of relevance.

In practice, however, abusive foreclosure of competitors is more relevant.

In addition, rebates must not discriminate customers.

Abusive foreclosure of competitors Rebates sometimes cross a line of vigorous competition on the merits and unfairly hinder the (dominant) supplier's competitors.

This can in particular be the case if they lead to a de facto exclusive relationship between the (dominant) supplier and its customers.

The supplier's rebate in these cases have a loyalty enhancing effect on the customer that is capable of excluding the supplier's competitors as an alternative source of supply for the customer.

In view of the large number of different options to design rebate programs, the following ""traffic light system"" can serve as a rough guide as to whether a planned rebate could potentially have a critical loyalty enhancing effect: Click on the image or here to enlarge it A case-by-case examination is necessary to establish whether a rebate qualifies as (vigorous) competition on the merits or as abusive conduct.

This is particular important for the rebates in the “red zone” shown above."
Noerr,Rebates and bonuses back on the agenda of the competition authorities,"This is particular important for the rebates in the “red zone” shown above.

To draw the line, it may be appropriate to work with an "" as-efficient competitor test” (AEC test).

Though the relevance of the AEC test is debated, it may help to answer the question whether the dominant supplier's rebate program is likely to foreclose a hypothetical competitor that is as efficient as the dominant undertaking.

In order to determine this, the European Commission will examine economic data relating to cost and sales prices, and in particular whether the dominant undertaking is engaging in below-cost pricing.

Discriminating rebates Not every unequal treatment of customers is abusive – it must be based on arbitrariness or aim at objectives in conflict with competition on the merits.

This means that a mere price difference is in general not sufficient to assume discrimination in violation of competition law.

Cases in which there is a risk of discriminating conduct include: excessive rebate spreads (e.g. progressive increase of rebate levels along turnover / purchase volume) or customer-specific rebates (customer A receives 2%, customer B receives 7% for the same volumes).

Another example is discrimination resulting from the fidelity rebates, where customers in similar circumstances receive different fidelity rebates depending on whether they agree to exclusive sourcing or reserve their freedom to choose their suppliers.

The discriminatory nature needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

For example, with regard to whether there are objective and appropriate reasons for the unequal treatment of customers.

B. Cartel prohibition and rebates Rebate programs must also not violate the cartel prohibition.

In general, according to the prohibition of cartels all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market shall be prohibited, unless there are exceptional circumstances which may make the agreements, decisions or practices permissible.

Rebates create incentives for certain conduct – typically they aim at selling more products.

However, occasionally rebate programs also amount to (indirect) restrictions of competition.

In principle, vertical agreements between suppliers and customers are exempted from the prohibition of cartels within the scope of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (or in the automotive sector, for example, under the additional requirements of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation).

However, this does not apply to so-called hardcore restrictions.

Such restrictions may exist if the incentives associated with the rebates are designed to restrict the customer’s ability to set prices completely free, actively or passively supply certain customer groups use the internet or offline retail, actively or passively sell into certain areas .

C. Conclusion and outlook When designing rebate programs, the previously outlined limits should be observed at any time.

Competition authorities are actively scrutinizing rebate programs.

In November 2023, for example, the German Federal Cartel Office announced that it would investigate in more detail whether Coca-Cola had structured its conditions and rebates vis-à-vis food retailers in compliance with competition law ( German Federal Cartel Office press release ).

The prohibition to abuse a dominant position is highly relevant here: if a supplier is dominant or has relative market power, the supplier must take particular care to ensure that its rebates are not abusive, meaning they (i) drive competitors out of the markets and / or (ii) discriminate others in an anti-competitive way.

Irrespective of whether there is an abuse of market power, the rebate may infringe the cartel prohibition."
Noerr,Rebates and bonuses back on the agenda of the competition authorities,"Irrespective of whether there is an abuse of market power, the rebate may infringe the cartel prohibition.

It must be carefully examined whether the incentives associated with the rebate could, for example, have an anticompetitive impact on the pricing of c ustomers or their selection and supply of customers.

More guidance regarding rebates may be provided by European Commission in its new guidelines on the application of Art. 102 TFEU to cases of exclusionary conduct.

At present, the publication of a first draft is planned for summer 2024.

In any case, companies are well-advised to continuously monitor the competition law compliance of their rebate programs."
Noerr,"Update on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (""FSR""): European Commission launches first ex officio investigation into wind turbine sector","On Tuesday, 9 April 2024, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, announced in a speech at Princeton University in the US that the European Commission had launched its first ex officio investigation under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“ FSR ”).

According to Vestager, the ex officio investigation focuses on Chinese suppliers of wind turbines and relates to the expansion of wind farms in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria.

Vestager has not yet revealed any further details of the investigation.

However, she placed the investigation in a broader political context.

According to Vestager, the EU could not afford to repeat its experience in the solar panel industry (where fewer than 3% of the solar panels installed in the EU are produced in Europe) with electric vehicles, wind turbines or computer chips.

The European Commission will therefore make use of all available tools, she said.

Nevertheless, a systematic approach had to be developed beyond individual cases, Vestager added.

First ex officio investigation by the European Commission What is special about the procedure now initiated is that this is the first ex officio investigation by the European Commission under the FSR, which has applied since July 2023.

In such an ex officio investigation, the European Commission acts on its own initiative based on tipoffs from the market or other information and then investigates at its own discretion whether distortive subsidies from third countries have been granted to companies in a particular industry.

Last autumn, the European Commission announced in its European Wind Power Action Plan (Communication on the state of the wind power industry) its intention to possibly take action against foreign subsidies in the wind energy sector under the FSR.

It is now putting this announcement into practice with its first ex officio investigation.

It therefore remains to be seen what concrete results the investigation will produce.

As the background, the FSR provides three different tools for the European Commission to investigate potentially distortive foreign subsidies (described in detail in our article of 17 January 2024 ).

There is (1) the “M&A transaction tool”, which requires certain M&A transactions to be notified to the European Commission.

There is also (2) the “public procurement tool”, which requires the notification of certain bids in public procurement procedures.

Finally, (3) the FSR also allows the European Commission to initiate ex officio investigations, regardless of whether certain thresholds are met or a notification obligation exists.

Several in-depth investigations already underway into Chinese companies using the public procurement tool under the FSR Vestager’s announcement is one of a series of recently launched in-depth investigations (sometimes also referred to as a “phase 2 investigation”) by the European Commission under the FSR’s public procurement tool.

These in-depth investigations were all initiated following notifications from Chinese companies regarding their bids in public procurement procedures: The first in-depth investigation under the FSR was launched in February, using the public procurement tool, into CRRC Qingdao Sifang Locomotive (“ CRRC ”), a subsidiary of the Chinese state-owned enterprise CRRC Corporation Limited, which had participated in a public procurement procedure in Bulgaria (see also our article of 19 February 2024 ).

It has been public knowledge since 26 March 2024 that CRRC withdrew from the procurement procedure after the in-depth investigation was initiated, after which the European Commission closed its investigation.

Just last week, on 3 April 2024, the European Commission also announced it had launched in-depth investigations using the public procurement tool into two bidding consortia with Chinese involvement."
Noerr,"Update on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (""FSR""): European Commission launches first ex officio investigation into wind turbine sector","Just last week, on 3 April 2024, the European Commission also announced it had launched in-depth investigations using the public procurement tool into two bidding consortia with Chinese involvement.

The first investigation is aimed at a consortium consisting of LONGi Solar Technologie GmbH (a subsidiary of LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd., which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange) and the Romanian ENEVO Group.

The second investigation is aimed at a consortium consisting of Shanghai Electric UK Co. Ltd. and Shanghai Electric Hong Kong International Engineering Co. Ltd. (both subsidiaries of the Chinese state-owned company Shanghai Electric Group Co. Ltd.).

The background to this is the submission of notifications by each of the bidding consortia in a Romanian public procurement procedure for the design, construction and operation of a photovoltaic park, which both consortia had participated in.

Outlook

The European Commission is already making active use of its tools under the FSR after only a short time.

Especially in view of Margrethe Vestager’s statement, it is clear that the European Commission’s investigations must be viewed in a direct political context and that further ex officio investigations are not unlikely.

It is not surprising that the European Commission is targeting Chinese companies first.

Right from the start of the legislative process, distortions of competition due to subsidies from China were cited as one of the main reasons the FSR was needed.

However, it can be assumed that the European Commission will also actively utilise its powers under the FSR in the case of potentially distortive subsidies from other third countries.

Companies, too, should keep a close eye on the developments relating to the still-new FSR, since tipoffs and complaints from the market in particular can trigger ex officio investigations.

The launch of the first ex officio investigation makes it clear that the European Commission has the will to respond to complaints from the market in addition to the human resources that are now available (see also our article from 13 February 2024 ).

In the future, companies can therefore try to draw attention to distortions of competition in their sector caused by subsidies from third countries by lodging complaints with the European Commission.

If properly prepared, such a complaint may well have the potential to initiate an ex officio investigation by the European Commission – at least that is what the latest developments indicate.

Noerr,News on hybrid cartel proceedings: regulatory impartiality even after settlement negotiations have been terminated?,"In its judgment of 1 February 2024 (C-251/22 P), the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) clarified that the European Commission (“Commission”) does not have to conduct hybrid cartel proceedings with different case teams.

The ECJ determined that the impartiality of the Commission is not automatically compromised.

On the contrary, the principles of good administration and the handling of the administrative procedure within a reasonable period of time generally even require that hybrid cartel proceedings are conducted by the same case team responsible at the Commission.

Background In cartel investigations, the Commission has the option of proposing a settlement to the parties.

If the parties agree to the settlement and meet the requirements outlined in the Settlement Notice, the Commission will reduce the amount of the fine to be imposed by 10 %.

For the Commission, the added value of the settlement procedure lies in being able to “ handle more cases with the same resources, thereby fostering the public interest in the Commission’s delivery of effective and timely punishment, while increasing overall deterrence ” (Commission Notice on the conduct of settlement procedures).

The purpose is therefore to reward the implementation of a simpler, shorter and more resource-efficient procedure.

The Commission will generally only engage in a settlement procedure if all parties have agreed to it.

Hybrid cartel proceedings, which involve a settlement with some parties while others are subject to the standard investigation proceedings, are often complex and fail to achieve the desired efficiency gains in terms of time and effort.

In such cases, the Commission is required to draft a more detailed statement of objections, provide broader access to the files, and, if requested by the parties not inclined to settle, conduct an oral hearing as well.

Hybrid proceedings therefore usually proceed only if every party initially shows a willingness to settle, and the Commission believes there is still sufficient added value in continuing the settlement procedure with the remaining parties despite one party withdrawing from negotiations.

If a party withdraws from the settlement negotiations in good time, it is no longer held to its previous settlement submissions.

As a result, the Commission can no longer use these acknowledgements as evidence against that party and must perform an independent legal evaluation of the case, separate from the other parties’ settlement, and consider with impartiality all information and arguments presented.

Judgment The ECJ has, however, made it clear that it is not necessary to assign a new case team to deal with the case.

The Commission’s approach does not infringe the presumption of innocence or the principle of impartiality, which must be distinguished from it and is part of the right to good administration.

On the contrary, a change in the team responsible at the Commission “ would even run counter to the principles of good administration and the handling of the administrative procedure within a reasonable period of time ”.

This applies even if the Commission staggers its decisions and first issues the settlement decision.

The Commission staff are therefore entrusted with disregarding any self-incriminating statements made by the parties during the settlement negotiations and continue to evaluate the case without bias.

Evaluation and Consequences in Practice It is to be welcomed that hybrid cartel proceedings have not been made more difficult.

If the Commission had to assign a new case team to take over where settlement negotiations have partially broken down, this could negate the efficiency benefits of continuing the settlement negotiations with the remaining parties.

This could effectively give individual parties a veto right over the prospects of success of a settlement by the other parties."
Noerr,News on hybrid cartel proceedings: regulatory impartiality even after settlement negotiations have been terminated?,"This could effectively give individual parties a veto right over the prospects of success of a settlement by the other parties.

Nevertheless, one can certainly be sceptical as to whether the same staff can actually make a completely neutral decision in the standard procedure after exposure to acknowledgments already made in settlement negotiations and submissions.

Parties are therefore well advised to approach settlement negotiations with the Commission carefully and plan their cooperation strategy from the beginning.

Should there be any clear signs of impartiality after the breakdown of settlement negotiations, these should be well documented.

It remains to be seen whether the legal certainty for the implementation of hybrid settlement proceedings resulting from the decision of the court of last instance will also have a positive effect on the EU leniency framework, which plays a central role for the Commission in the detection and prosecution of cartels.

This is because the potential for an extra fine reduction through a settlement is likely to provide an additional incentive for companies to submit leniency applications.

This applies at least when there is no certainty as to whether other cartel participants have already submitted applications, thus precluding the possibility of obtaining complete immunity from fines through a leniency application.

The comeback of dawn raids after the end of the coronavirus pandemic shows in any case that cartel investigations will remain a key enforcement priority for competition authorities in the European Union.

Noerr,Berliner Sparkasse succeeds with Noerr in model declaratory proceedings,"Noerr advises Berliner Sparkasse on questions concerning General Terms and Conditions in banking contracts as well as on strategic questions regarding the defense against class actions.

On 27 March 2024, the Berlin Court of Appeal ( Kammergericht ) ruled on a model declaratory action brought by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations ( Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e.V. – vzbv ) against Berliner Sparkasse, a bank residing in Berlin.

Berliner Sparkasse had adjusted its fees for services in connection with consumer banking accounts in 2016 based on a mechanism common in the banking sector and beyond.

While the Court of Appeal considered fee adjustments based on the GTC to be invalid, it confirmed in particular that the limitation period for any consumer claims had not been postponed, even taking into account European law.

However, the judgment also leaves key questions unanswered, including whether consumers could have claims for reimbursement of fees at all.

Background In its judgment of 27 April 2021 (XI ZR 26/20) , the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) ruled that a fee adjustment clause in consumer GTC is invalid if the clause stipulates that the customer's consent to proposed fee adjustments is deemed to have been given under certain conditions.

Based on the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice the vzbv brought a model declaratory action against Berliner Sparkasse in December 2021.

The vzbv argues in particular that fee adjustments based on the invalid clause are invalid as well, giving customers a claim for reimbursement of the fees concerned.

The proceedings before the Berlin Court of Appeal concern a total of nine declaratory applications which are meant to decide questions relevant for subsequent individual consumers claims.

However, the dispute essentially revolves around two legal questions: The first question is whether the fee adjustments in 2016 are to be considered valid by way of supplementary interpretation of the contract despite the invalidity of the fee adjustment clause, because the customer has paid the increased fees over a longer period of time without objection (so-called “three-year solution”).

This question arises at least in cases where the costs calculated at the time of the conclusion of the contract have fundamentally changed to the disadvantage of the bank over time.

The second question is whether the limitation period under German law was postponed for reasons of European law, at least until the Federal Court of Justice decided that the fee adjustment clause was invalid.

This question has arisen because German law considers knowledge of the facts giving rise to a claim (as opposed to the legal assessment of those facts) to be sufficient for the start of the limitation period.

""Three-year solution"" not applicable to banking contracts The Court of Appeal considered the fee adjustments to be invalid, providing only a very brief reasoning for its opinion that the “Three-year solution” developed in the context of energy supply contracts cannot be applied to banking contracts.

On the one hand, the court emphasised that the invalid clause – unlike clauses in energy supply contracts – did not affect the price itself, but merely stipulated the conditions when the customer's tacit consent to the offer of a fee adjustment was given.

The fact that the Federal Court of Justice expressly qualified a practically identical clause also as a fee adjustment clause without any of the Court of Appeal’s reservations was not addressed in the judgment.

On the other hand, the Court of Appeal argued that the interests of banks and energy suppliers were not comparable because the costs of a giro account were not subject to similarly significant external fluctuations."
Noerr,Berliner Sparkasse succeeds with Noerr in model declaratory proceedings,"The Court of Appeal did not mention, however, that Berliner Sparkasse provided an expert report on precisely this point, showing that the development of interest rates over time seriously increased the net costs of a private giro account.

The judgment thus leaves open the actual legal question of how to deal with situations where the costs have fundamentally changed to the disadvantage of the user of an invalid fee adjustment clause and whether it is fair and reasonable to treat fee adjustments to be invalid even in cases where the parties intended to provide for a solution that allowed the bank to react higher cost by adjusting fees.

Start of the knowledge-based limitation period not postponed In view of the potentially broad impact, the second key question of the proceedings is whether the limitation period was postponed at least until the Federal Court of Justice decided on the invalidity of the fee adjustment clause in April 2021.

The claimant argued that this was the case because the Court of Justice of the European Union infers from the Council Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts that the start of the limitation period must be dependent on consumers' knowledge of the law (see also Noerr News of 26 January 2024 ).

The Court of Appeal rejected the claimant’s view.

Instead, it followed the argument of Berliner Sparkasse that EU law cannot override German limitation law as the wording of the relevant provision, i.e. Section 199 (1) No. 2 of the German Civil Code, and the legislative history, clearly show that the legislator links the start of the limitation period to the knowledge of the facts and not to knowledge of the law.

The Court of Appeal has thus significantly strengthened the interest in legal peace and legal certainty which can be considered to be a statement relevant beyond the case and the banking sector.

Counterclaim inadmissible in model declaratory actions – key questions remain unanswered There is a dispute among scholars whether consumers who have received services based on an invalid fee must still compensate the bank for the services based on principles of unjust enrichment.

According to the claimant’s statement in the oral hearing, it deliberately refrained from having this question clarified by filing an application of its own.

Therefore, Berliner Sparkasse filed a counterclaim and requested the Court of Appeal to decide on these questions.

However, the Court of Appeal did not do so because it inferred from the legislative history that counterclaims are inadmissible in model declaratory proceedings.

Whether the principles of unjust enrichment bar reimbursement claims of consumers is hence another question that remains open.

Noerr,The European Commission’s revised Market Definition Notice for competition cases,"In February 2024, the European Commission (“ EC ”) published the revised Market Definition Notice for competition cases (“ Revised Notice ”), the first revision since its adoption in 1997.

The Revised Notice aims to reflect new market realities, in particular technological advancements in digital markets, as well as developments in the EC's and the European Courts’ decision-making practices.

While it is in principle only soft law, nevertheless the EC is bound by the principles and methods for market definition laid down in it.

The Revised Notice offers important and, in comparison to the previous notice, more accessible guidance to companies in all industry sectors.

We explain the role of market definition in competition cases and the Revised Notice’s most significant amendments.

I.   Importance of market definition Defining product and geographic markets is a prerequisite for determining the competitive constraints that market participants impose on each another.

In other words, it is a helpful tool for assessing the market power of companies.

The definition of the relevant market is therefore key when considering whether a merger between undertakings is possible, as well as when assessing whether certain agreements between undertakings may benefit from an exemption from competition rules, for example, under the Vertical Block Exemption or Specialisation or Research and Development (“ R&D ”) regulation.

Furthermore, it is essential when assessing whether an undertaking has a dominant position and is therefore subject to the abuse of dominance rules.

II.

Relevant product and geographic market The most important criterion for product market definition is the interchangeability of the products from the customer's point of view (demand substitutability).

Other criteria include the possibility of switching to other suppliers (supply substitutability) and to a lesser extent the influence of potential competition.

The relevant geographic market is the area in which the objective conditions of competition for the product in question are sufficiently homogeneous for all companies, and which can be distinguished from other geographic areas, because conditions of competition are appreciably different in those areas ( see, para.

12 ).

Demand substitutability Price is the strongest element for the evaluation of demand substitutability.

According to the Revised Notice, the EC can, but does not have to, rely on the small but significant non-transitory increase in price test (“ SSNIP test ”).

The SSNIP test may, in particular, be of less relevance for market definition in the sphere where services are often offered on non-monetary terms.

This is also a reason why the EC recognises the importance of non-price parameters, including innovation, quality, reliability of supply and sustainability when taken into account by customers in their purchasing decisions ( see paras.

15 and 27 et seq .).

Supply substitution It is recognised that a given product market can be broadened where suppliers use the same assets and processes to produce related products that are not substitutes for customers and where the conditions of competition across the range of such related products are similar ( para.

32 ).

However, the EC points out that (i) most, if not all, suppliers must be able to switch production between products in the range of related products; (ii) that suppliers incur only insignificant additional sunk costs or risks when they switch production; (iii) that suppliers have the incentive to switch production, and would do so, when relative prices or demand conditions change; and (iv) that they can offer all products in the range effectively in the short term ( see para.

33 ).

Geographic market definition The EC explains factors that may justify defining markets as global, EEA-wide, national or local ( see para.

38 )."
Noerr,The European Commission’s revised Market Definition Notice for competition cases,"33 ).

Geographic market definition The EC explains factors that may justify defining markets as global, EEA-wide, national or local ( see para.

38 ).

Imports play a role, but the mere existence of them or the possibility of switching to imports in a geographic area does not necessarily lead to a wider geographic market including the area from which the product was or could be imported.

Additionally, sufficiently homogeneous conditions of competition must exist ( see para.

42 ).

III.

Market definition for certain sectors Market definition in the presence of significant R&D The EC considers the specificities of highly innovative industries that are characterised by frequent and significant R&D. Pipeline products can be included in the relevant product market if there is sufficient visibility on their R&D process ( see paras.

90 - 91 ).

Market definition in the presence of multi-sided platforms Multi-sided platforms support interactions between different groups of users, leading to a situation where the demand from one group of users has an influence on the demand from the other groups.

The EC can choose to either define a relevant product market for the products offered by a platform as a whole, encompassing all user groups, or rather separate relevant markets for the products offered on each side of the platform.

Non-price parameters are particularly important for the evaluation of substitutability ( see paras.

94 and 98 ).

Market definition in the presence of after-markets, bundles and (digital) ecosystems The Revised Notice identifies three options for defining the relevant product market: (i) as a system market comprising both the primary and the secondary product; (ii) as multiple markets, i.e., a market for the primary product and separate markets for the secondary products associated with each brand of the primary product; (iii) as dual markets, i.e., the market for the primary product on the one hand and the market for the secondary product on the other hand ( see para.

100 ).

Where customers prefer to consume several products as a bundle, the EC may examine whether the bundle constitutes a relevant product market distinct from the individual products.

As the EC points out, not all (digital) ecosystems fit an after-market or bundle market approach.

In those cases, factors such as network effects, switching costs and multi-homing decisions are relevant parameters to consider ( see paras.

103-104 ).

IV.

Market shares Historically, the EC regularly relies on market shares based on sales or purchases.

The Revised Notice explicitly adds other metrics to determine market shares, such as capacity or production, the number of suppliers, the number of active users, the number of website visits or streams, volume or value of transactions concluded over a platform ( see para.

108 ).

V. Gathering and evaluation of evidence As it is practice, the EC may rely on both qualitative and quantitative information which can be derived from various sources of information (e.g., internal documents, surveys, public information) and types of evidence.

The EC does not apply a rigid hierarchy of different sources of information or types of evidence ( see para.

76 ).

VI.

Outlook As pointed out by Executive Vice-President Vestager: “If something happens every 25 years, it deserves attention.”

The Revised Notice provides guidance and clarification on various topics such as the importance of non-price parameters.

It also acknowledges that in some circumstances, a forward-looking assessment of competitive conditions is required, and it covers markets undergoing structural transitions and of course also markets that are innovation-intensive.

The Revised Notice is of great relevance for companies assessing the competition law compliance of their conduct as well as the feasibility of potential mergers.

At the same time, the extended guidance on possible sources of evidence and their probative value ( see para."
Noerr,The European Commission’s revised Market Definition Notice for competition cases,"At the same time, the extended guidance on possible sources of evidence and their probative value ( see para.

78 ) underlines yet again that companies need to be aware that product market definition requires a fact-intensive case-by-case assessment."
Noerr,"Digital Markets Act: European Commission opens investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta","On 7 March 2024, referred to as “DMA compliance day”, the Digital Markets Act (“ DMA ”) “went live”.

Since then, the six companies designated as gatekeepers up to now – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta und Microsoft – have had to ensure that they are fully compliant with the obligations set down in the DMA.

The aim of these rules is to ensure that markets in the digital sector are contestable and fair.

Less than twenty days after compliance day, the European Commission (the “ Commission ”) has already found signs indicating that three of the gatekeepers (Alphabet, Apple and Meta) are not adequately complying with the DMA’s obligations or are even deliberately circumventing them.

This has prompted the Commission to open official investigations against these three companies, which could end with them having to pay heavy fines.

Specific accusations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta The Commission is accusing the three gatekeepers, according to a press release , of having infringed various provisions of the DMA:

Alphabet The Commission has levelled two accusations against Alphabet, Google’s parent company.

The DMA provides that app developers are allowed to “steer” end users to their own products or services outside of a gatekeeper’s sales channels by free communication and advertising.

The Commission is now accusing Alphabet of interfering with the use of products or services outside of Google Play, Google’s app store.

Moreover, the Commission believes that Alphabet may be engaging in “self-preferencing”.

The accusation is specifically that Alphabet’s own services are given preference in the results shown in the general Google search (for example Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels).

This means that it may be discriminating against services offered by rival service providers.

Apple As in the case of Alphabet, the Commission is also accusing Apple of interfering with free communication and advertising for products and services offered by app developers on other sales channels through the rules for its own app store.

Besides this, the Commission assumes that Apple is not making it easy enough for users of iPhones to: delete apps from iOS; modify default system settings on iOS; and modify default standard services (e.g. browsers or search engines).

Meta When it comes to Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, the Commission has doubts about the compatibility of its “pay or consent” model with the DMA.

In simple terms, this refers to services and products offered for which end users either have to consent to their data being processed (e.g. to the data being used for personalised advertising) or pay for the data not to be processed.

The offer can only be used by selecting one of these options.

The Commission maintains that such an arrangement could conflict with the requirement under the DMA that gatekeepers give end users a “real” choice about whether their data is processed.

Commission has already announced further steps The Commission is already exhibiting a willingness to commence other proceedings in the near future, such as on Apple’s new payment structure and other terms of use for alternative app stores as well as on possible self-preferencing by Amazon in the ranking of products in its own marketplace.

The Commission reported that it has already launched investigations into these matters.

Finally, the Commission has granted Meta an extension of six months to comply with the interoperability obligation under the DMA in connection with Facebook Messenger.

This essentially means that users of Facebook Messenger must also be able to communicate with users of similar services (and vice versa).

Outlook and assessment The initiation of these proceedings represents the first milestone in the enforcement of the DMA and shows that the Commission intends to put into practice its announcement to strictly enforce the DMA in a consequent and timely manner."
Noerr,"Digital Markets Act: European Commission opens investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta","The proceedings are not entirely unexpected.

The various gatekeepers' compliance efforts to date have, in some cases, been criticised by experts and the market.

This applies to Apple, for example, which was accused of making a “mockery"" of the DMA by 34 companies from the market (including Spotify and Epic Games) in an open letter to the Commission at the beginning of March.

In this respect, it is a confrontation that was to be expected.

Conversely, it is also worth noting that other gatekeepers – at least for the time being – are not affected by the proceedings or investigations.

This applies in particular to Microsoft, which has sometimes been said to be making serious efforts to comply with the DMA.

On the other hand, proceedings have also not been initiated against Bytedance, the parent company of TikTok.

However, as Bytedance is currently challenging its designation as a gatekeeper in court, it was not necessarily to be expected in any case that the company would fully comply with the obligations under the DMA.

The Commission has announced that it intends to complete the investigations within 12 months and decide whether the three gatekeepers comply with the DMA.

If the gatekeepers are found to have infringed the rules, it will be able to impose fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover.

In the event of repeated or even systematic failures to comply, there is a risk of even higher fines or structural remedies for the gatekeepers (even including break-ups).

The course and findings of the proceedings (including potential subsequent court proceedings) are likely to provide first indications of how far the objectives of the European legislator can be realised through the DMA.

All of the market players affected by the provisions of the DMA are therefore well advised to keep an eye on these proceedings.

Alongside the investigations opened by the Commission, the gatekeepers involved could also be confronted by legal measures brought by business users before national courts due to their failure to comply with the rules of conduct under the DMA (private enforcement of the DMA).

Through this possibility of private enforcement, business users and the national courts will have a crucial role to play in helping the Commission monitor DMA compliance (see also our article on Noerr News ).

Background to the DMA In September 2023, the Commission designated six companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft) as gatekeepers in relation to a total of 22 core platform services (“ CPS ”).

These CPS serve as a gateway between a large number of business users on the one hand and end users on the other.

This status as a gateway brings with it a great potential to exert influence on the commercial activities of many market players.

For this reason, the DMA imposes special obligations on the gatekeepers operating the CPS in order to keep the markets open and promote innovation (more details can be found in our article on Noerr News ).

To enable the Commission to verify whether the gatekeepers are complying with the obligations under the DMA without having to carry out time-consuming investigations, the gatekeepers had to explain what steps they were taking to comply with their obligations in compliance reports by 7 March 2024 (more background information can be found in our article on Noerr News ).

Compliance workshops held by the Commission subsequently took place for every gatekeeper in March 2024.

During the workshops, the Commission, gatekeepers and business users of CPS involved were able to engage in discussions about the extent to which the gatekeepers are meeting their obligations by taking the measures set out in the compliance reports."
Noerr,CSDDD update: Breakthrough in European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)?,"On 15 March 2024 the Committee of the Permanent Representatives (COREPER), a subsidiary body of the Council of the European Union which prepares decisions, agreed to the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“ CSDDD ” or CS3D) in the form of a compromise text .

This text deviates from the provisional political agreement achieved in the legislative trilogue in December 2023 .

For example, the scope of the Directive has been reduced by significantly increasing the required number of employees and the turnover thresholds.

A compromise had to be found because some EU countries including Germany spoke out against the text agreed on in the trilogue and the additional coordination rounds and therefore for a long time there was no majority in support of the CSDDD.

Only huge efforts by the Belgian presidency of the Council led to the (provisional) breakthrough and to France and Italy’s assent, with Germany abstaining.

The compromise now achieved still has to be formally adopted by the Council of the European Union.

It will then be discussed in the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament and is likely to be passed in the plenary assembly of the European Parliament in late April 2024.

A. Main areas of regulation at a glance I. Scope of application The CSDDD applies to companies established under the laws of an EU member state and to companies not domiciled in the EU.

The thresholds for EU companies are related to the number of employees and annual net turnover.

On average, the figures are over 1,000 employees and annual net turnover worldwide of over €450m. At non-EU companies the key figure is annual net turnover, which must exceed €450m. The text of the Directive no longer specifies lower thresholds for certain high-risk sectors (such as textiles manufacturing or wholesale of textiles, apparel and footwear).

Obligated companies are those with a legal form listed in Annex I and II of Directive 2013/34/EU.

Under German law, these are AG, KGaA, GmbH, KG and OHG.

II.

Chain of activities and due diligence obligations The original draft of the CSDDD was linked to the value chain to which the companies’ due diligence obligations relate.

In the meantime, the term ‘chain of activities’ seems have to become established.

The recitals state explicitly that this is a term of its own which is not to be equated with ‘value chain’ or ‘supply chain’ (see recital 18).

According to Article 3(1)(g) CSDDD, the chain of activities includes all business partners on the supply side (upstream) connected to the products manufactured or services provided by the company.

In addition, all business partners which transport, distribute or store the products for the company (downstream) are also included.

There is no such provision for the company’s services.

The disposal of products is not covered by the chain of activities either (see recital 18).

According to Article 3(1)(e) CSDDD, a business partner is a legal entity which is related to the business activities, products and services of the obligated company.

This includes companies with whom the obligated company has a commercial agreement (direct business partners), but also legal entities with which there is no such contractual relationship (indirect business partners).

The due diligence obligations, which are basically similar to those of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ), relate to this chain of activities.

Put simply, companies must now determine whether human rights or environmental risks exist in this chain and, depending on the result, take appropriate preventive and remedial measures.

III.

Climate protection measures The current draft of the CSDDD also picks up on the 1.5°C target set in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change ."
Noerr,CSDDD update: Breakthrough in European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)?,"III.

Climate protection measures The current draft of the CSDDD also picks up on the 1.5°C target set in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change .

Obligated companies have to develop and implement a ‘transition plan’ to make their best efforts to reach the climate protection target within their business model and corporate strategy.

In addition, the plan must contain details of the goal of climate neutrality as specified in the European Climate Law.

In particular, the transition plan must define objectives for the year 2030 and then at five-year intervals up to 2050.

IV.

State sanctions and liability under civil law The CSDDD regulates state sanctions, such as imposing fines.

Unlike the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, however, the draft also contains regulations on the civil liability of companies.

Breaches of the national law transposing the CSDDD can be punished by fines and other penalties.

These are calculated on the basis of up to 5% of net worldwide turnover.

A culpable breach of the due diligence obligations and any resulting damage can lead to civil liability on the part of the company.

Liability is excluded if only business partners in the chain of activities have caused the damage.

The limitation period for such claims will not be less than five years.

Particularly notable are the provisions on the submission of evidence.

In certain circumstances, national courts could order companies to disclose evidence.

The options go far beyond those currently available in the German Code of Civil Procedure regarding the production of documents.

B. Entry into force and transition periods If the European Parliament approves the compromise, the CSDDD will come into force in several steps.

For example, companies with over 5,000 employees and turnover above €1.5bn will be subject to the obligations three years after the Directive comes into force.

Companies with over 3,000 employees and turnover above €900m will be subject to the obligations after four years and all other companies only five years after the CSDDD first comes into force.

The member states have two years to transpose the CSDDD into national law.

As far as Germany is concerned, this means that either the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act will be undergo multiple amendments or a new law will be enacted.

C. Outlook

If the EU Parliament approves the CSDDD at the end of April, it remains to be seen how national legislators will implement the Directive.

The adoption will give companies a certain degree of certainty in planning, and they should start preparing for the CSDDD now.

This implementation could also be an opportunity for companies to develop holistic supply chain management.

After all, numerous European directives and regulations are aimed at making supply chains more transparent and recognising and eliminating risks.

In the next few weeks we will update you on the details of the CSDDD and other supply chain-related directives and regulations, such as the regulation on prohibiting products made with forced labour on the Union market , which is now almost ready.

Noerr,Company succession: new option trap when exempting operating assets,"Background One core goal in structuring company succession plans is qualifying for full tax exemption for the assets used to conduct the business.

In contrast to the standard exemption that tax authorities automatically apply, if stricter prerequisites are met and a separate and irrevocable application is filed, not just 85% but 100% of the operating assets are exempted from inheritance or gift tax.

To qualify for full tax exemption, companies must comply with not only stricter requirements on upholding wage levels and longer retention periods but also stricter restrictions on the ratio of holdings to operating assets.

In other words, the market value of the company’s holdings (e.g. real property that is rented out, precious metals, works of art, securities, bank account balances, cash on hand or receivables) cannot comprise more than 20% of the company’s total value.

In practice, determining the ratio of holdings to operating expenses often triggers high costs for tax compliance (not only for the giver, recipient and heirs but also for the tax authorities) and is a primary concern in succession planning.

Furthermore, the holdings ratio has only in very rare cases been established with legal certainty by the time the assets are transferred to the recipients or heirs or when the relevant tax returns are filed, not least because no final clarification of numerous legal issues in connection with calculating the holdings ratio has been achieved, especially when the company is a member of a group of companies.

The possibility that the tax authorities will arrive at a different ratio of holdings must be included in the calculations.

More differences can also occur in the context of a subsequent tax audit.

This creates a need to deal with the legal uncertainty that it may not be possible to conclusively determine whether the prerequisites for full exemption have been fulfilled until several years after a gift or inheritance has been received.

The question arises as to whether at least the standard exemption (85%), for which the prerequisites are not as strict, should be applied as an alternative in such cases.

Tax authorities adopt Federal Fiscal Court’s strict interpretation Whenever it became clear at a later date (e.g. based on a tax audit) that a company did not have the holdings ratio required for a full exemption, former standard practice for tax authorities under inheritance tax guidelines was to grant the standard exemption.

However, in its ruling dated 26 July 2022 (case no.

II R 25/20)

, the German Federal Fiscal Court (Fiscal Court) decided that it was no longer possible for a company to “fall back” on the standard exemption after it had filed an irrevocable application for full exemption.

In February 2024, the highest tax authorities of each of Germany’s federal states issued orders adopting the Fiscal Court’s legal opinion.

In adherence to the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, exceptions apply only to older cases in which the application for full exemption was filed before 25 January 2024.

Companies filing applications that are received later will not be permitted to “fall back” on the standard exemption.

If it is subsequently determined that the company does not have the holdings ratio necessary to qualify for the requested full exemption, neither the full exemption nor the standard exemption will be applicable.

Consequently, absolutely no exemption will be applied to the operating assets, even if the prerequisites for the standard exemption are fulfilled.

Practical consequences If it becomes clear in the course of planning a succession that the holdings ratio could exceed the maximum threshold of 20% even with a “safety margin” for valuation and legal uncertainties, careful consideration should be given to the timing of filing an application for full exemption."
Noerr,Company succession: new option trap when exempting operating assets,"Under procedural rules, it is permissible to file the application at any time before the assessment of the inheritance or gift tax has become final and unappealable.

For this reason, it is not mandatory to file the application when submitting tax returns.

Instead, the application can be filed, e.g. during appeals proceedings against a tax decision or as long as the tax decision is still subject to review.

It should be noted that if an application for full exemption is filed later, the tax authorities are initially required to apply the standard exemption where the prerequisites are fulfilled.

As a result, only 85% of the operating assets will be exempted, at least initially, and inheritance or gift tax will be assessed on the remaining 15%.

This amount is to be prefinanced until the application for full exemption is filed."
Noerr,Update on the Data Governance Act,"It has now been almost six months since the Data Governance Act ( DGA ) became directly applicable law in the EU Member States.

Some of the mechanisms and prerequisites for data sharing provided in the DGA have already been implemented in Germany.

It’s time for an updated overview: Background: Data Governance Act to promote data sharing The DGA is a pillar of the European data strategy.

Its goal is to increase the availability of data for commercial use, data sharing and not least for research purposes in order to give the European market a competitive advantage in data-driven innovation.

We summarised the essential content of the DGA in a previous news article on the Data Governance Act .

The DGA has been in effect since 24 September 2023 .

Entities providing data intermediation services (Chapter III DGA) on 23 June 2022 must comply with the obligations set out in the DGA by 24 September 2025.

Implementation measures taken so far a. Re-use of protected data held by public sector bodies In its Chapter II, the DGA establishes several regulations for sharing protected data of public sector bodies.

To support the public sector bodies, each Member State is to designate a “ competent body ” ( Article 7 DGA) to grant (or refuse) access to re-use of data of public sector bodies .

The support can take the form of technical support or advice of various kinds, for example.

As of yet, no competent body has been designated for Germany (see the list published by the Commission).

To facilitate re-use of data held by public sector bodies in the internal market and beyond, the Commission has established the European Register of Protected Data held by the Public Sector (ERPD) (Article 8(4) DGA).

Data that are available in the national single information point to be set up by each Member State can be accessed in this register.

So far, only data from the Dutch and Czech national single information points are available.

There is as yet no known national single information point for Germany.

b.

Data intermediation services – rules for the joint use of data In Chapter III, the DGA defines a set of rules for providers of data intermediation services (also called “data intermediaries”) to ensure that they will function as trustworthy organisers of data sharing or pooling within the common European data spaces.

Before beginning to offer their services, such data intermediaries must notify the competent authority, where the standard procedure is to review only the formal prerequisites for proper notification (Article 11 DGA).

The competent authority for notification in Germany is the German Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) .

However, data intermediaries can also voluntarily request a review of whether they fulfil the conditions that substantive law places on data intermediary services providers (Article 12 DGA).

Upon passing this (additional) test, the data intermediary can use the label “ EU Recognised Data Intermediary ” and the following logo established by the Commission : The Commission keeps a register of data intermediation services .

To date, only one data intermediary, in Finland, is listed .

c. “ Data altruism” The concept of data altruism is intended to facilitate making data available for purposes in the general interest, for example for research, combating climate change or improving public services (Chapter IV DGA).

One of the ways to promote data altruism is to cause data altruistic organisations to register with the competent national authorities.

In this case as well, the competent authority in Germany is the Federal Network Agency.

Registered data altruistic organisations can apply for entry into the public national register (Article 19 DGA) to be established for this purpose.

However, no such register seems to have been established for Germany as yet.

In addition to the national registers, the Commission keeps a public EU register of recognised data altruism organisations (Article 17 DGA)."
Noerr,Update on the Data Governance Act,"In addition to the national registers, the Commission keeps a public EU register of recognised data altruism organisations (Article 17 DGA).

This EU register of recognised data altruism organisations already exists, but so far it only lists one Spanish data altruistic organisation.

A logo is now also available for registered data altruism organisations : d. European Innovation Council The Commission has already established a European Data Innovation Board ( EDIB ) to facilitate the sharing of best practices, in particular on data intermediation, data altruism and the use of public data that cannot be made available as open data, as well as on the prioritisation of cross-sectoral interoperability standards (Chapter VI DGA).

The EDIB has met twice so far.

Conclusion At least some of the mechanisms and conditions for data sharing found in the DGA have been implemented to date.

However, it remains to be seen whether the DGA’s intended increase in data sharing will now actually materialise or whether the very extensive obligations placed on each party involved will counteract at least some of the desired effects ."
Noerr,European data protection authorities start coordinated investigation into right of access,"Coordinated by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) , the European data protection authorities recently initiated a broad-based initiative looking into the right of access under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In Germany, data protection supervisory authorities from Bavaria (BayLDA), Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein as well as the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI) are taking part in the action.

During the coordinated investigation, the data protection authorities primarily wish to identify whether and how organisations ensure the right of access in practice.

To do so, the authorities will first of all send questionnaires to organisations.

On the basis of the responses, further formal investigations by the authorities are to be commenced where necessary.

The European data protection authorities intend to jointly agree on additional national regulatory and enforcement measures .

Breaches of statutory requirements under the GDPR will be liable for steep fines .

The recently launched action regarding the right of access is the third coordinated enforcement action by the European data protection authorities under their Coordinated Enforcement Framework (CEF) following their investigations into the use of cloud-based services (2022) and the designation and position of data protection officers (2023) .

Background: extensive duties to provide access under the GDPR – strict requirements under case law and by the data protection authorities The GDPR requires that companies provide individuals with access to the personal data relating to them without undue delay and generally within one month upon request.

This initially includes confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning the person requesting access are actually processed in the company.

If this is the case, then information about these data is to be provided in the form of a copy of the personal data .

Apart from this, certain additional information on the processing of the data and on the rights of the data subject is to be communicated .

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has sharpened the right of access to personal data under Article 15 GDPR, going beyond the provision’s actual wording .

In addition to this, the European data protection authorities formulate strict requirements for the provision of information under data protection law in the EDPB’s guidelines on the right of access , which were updated in 2023.

Reviewing internal procedures and documentation on the right of access at companies – data protection governance To be able to provide proper access without undue delay and generally within one month at the latest, companies have to be proactively ready to handle requests for access and implement appropriate internal procedures for these purposes where necessary, as stated by the EDPB in its Guidelines .

The handling of requests to exercise the right of access to personal data and any other data protection rights of data subjects is one of the most important core processes of a robust and effective data protection governance within a company.

When designing the organisational structures and procedures for data protection in a company, the challenge in practice is to guarantee that data protection requests are handled effectively, while at the same time ensuring maximum efficiency and economical use of resources.

In the light of the coordinated inspection actions by the supervisory authorities, companies should therefore also carefully review their internal procedures and documentation relating to data protection and be quick to initiate any necessary organisational improvements."
Noerr,European data protection authorities start coordinated investigation into right of access,"Above all, companies should review their guidelines for handling requests for access and other data protection requests and their templates for requests for access to make sure that they are prepared both for requests for access by data subjects and for official investigations."
Noerr,Classics of authorised dealer law still relevant,"In 2023, important clarifications were made by higher courts in cases regarding the law governing authorised dealers.

The rulings are very relevant to drafting dealer contracts and also give important tips on terminating contracts with authorised dealers and service partners.

Setting basic discounts and bonuses outside the dealer agreement is admissible In 2021, a ruling by Frankfurt Regional Court (LG Frankfurt) dated 16 December 2021 – 2‑03 O 410/20 caused a stir by stating the contractually agreed right of a manufacturer to set basic discounts (margins) unilaterally in circulars, each valid for one year, was to be classified as being in breach of antitrust law.

The appeal judgment caused just as great a stir (Frankfurt Higher Regional Court (OLG Frankfurt), judgment dated 14 February 2023 – 11 U 9/22 (Kart)), setting aside the decision of the lower court and instead ruling it admissible to set basic discounts and bonuses outside of an authorised dealer agreement and change them on a regular basis.

In particular, the court said, the manufacturer reserving the right to unliterally set these does not constitute unreasonable discrimination against the authorised dealer.

With consistent application of the related high court and higher court case law, Frankfurt Higher Regional Court provides more certainty in future contract drafting, especially in a principal’s drafting of a margin and bonus system.

The ruling is not yet final and non-appealable.

Termination pending a change of contract: old and new contracts permitted to exist side by side In other proceedings, Frankfurt Higher Regional Court (judgment dated 13 June 2023 – 11 U 14/23 (Kart)) also considered terms and conditions in an authorised dealer relationship, but this time in the context of a termination for variation of contract.

In this case, the importer had issued its authorised dealer notice of termination pending a change of contract, with the terms structure of the new proposed contract differing from the terminated “old” dealer agreement; the deadline for the authorised dealer to accept the new dealer contract was 2 1⁄2 months.

In the event that the dealer accepted the new proposed contract, the new dealer agreement would replace the old dealer agreement during the notice period for termination of the old dealer agreement.

The court found that the sued importer had not committed a breach of antitrust law or of its fiduciary duty.

It said that firstly, the importer had not put inadmissible pressure on the authorised dealer by setting a deadline for acceptance of the new dealer agreement.

Secondly, it was not a breach of antitrust law or fiduciary duty by the importer if old and new contracts coexisted in the principal’s distribution system until the expiry of the standard notice period for termination of the old contract.

The ruling by Frankfurt Higher Regional Court gives key starting points for validly introducing new authorised dealer contracts into an existing dealer network.

Terminating a service partner agreement Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court’s (OLG Düsseldorf) judgment dated 28 September 2023 – Vl‑6 U 7/22 (Kart) (not published) examined a termination on structural grounds.

In the case leading to the ruling, the importer first terminated the distribution agent agreement and then the service partner agreement with due notice.

The importer justified terminating the service partner agreement by saying it was necessary to adapt the size and structure of the service partner network to ensure it was fit for the future.

The dealer bringing the action was not offered any new contracts and has therefore been operating as an independent repair garage since the expiry of the termination notice periods.

The dealer referred to a company-related dependency and considered itself unreasonably disadvantaged by the loss of the service partner agreement."
Noerr,Classics of authorised dealer law still relevant,"The dealer referred to a company-related dependency and considered itself unreasonably disadvantaged by the loss of the service partner agreement.

Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court, however, confirmed the lower court’s ruling which found the claimant had no claim to the continuation of the old service partner agreement nor a claim to entering into a new service partner agreement.

The claimant could perform all work on vehicles of the make in question in an economically viable manner even without a service partner agreement, the court added.

Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court emphasised in its decision that specialising in one manufacturer’s vehicles based on the company’s own decision cannot establish a company-related dependency without additional circumstances.

Ultimately, Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court rejected the existence of a company-related dependency given the special facts and individual opportunities for the former service partner to switch to other makes.

It is clear that traditional topics such as the termination of authorised dealer and service partner contracts as well as the design of margin and bonus systems have played a key role in the case law of the higher courts in 2023.

Even though manufacturers and importers have been putting new distribution models into place for some time now, authorised dealer law remains topical.

Developments in case law in this area will thus continue to be worth watching.

Noerr,Digital consumer protection: current case law and European legislation,"Contrary to intentions to cut red tape that have been expressed at national and European level, digital consumer protection law is becoming more and more complex.

Mandatory consumer rights, extensive notification and transparency obligations and detailed requirements for standard terms and conditions (T&C) are increasingly challenging for businesses.

Designing compliant digital business models requires expertise, diligence and continual updating.

Failure to comply with legal requirements can result not only in the loss of a right and/or collective redress (such as class actions), but also potentially in heavy fines (only in German).

Recent developments in the law on withdrawal When navigating the jungle of national and European consumer protection law, it is all the more important to be up to date on all relevant issues and follow the latest case law in every detail.

One of the most important issues is and remains the statutory right to cancel distance and off-premises contracts (right of withdrawal).

Only last year, the German legislator revised the requirements for withdrawal information (only in German) and published new model withdrawal information; now, it is only possible to limit the withdrawal period to 14 days by using withdrawal information based on this model (“presumed legality” (Gesetzlichkeitsfiktion) or “protection by model” (Musterschutz)).

In December 2022, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (FCJ) again made it clear that even the slightest deviations from the statutory model withdrawal information negate this presumed legality ( FCJ, judgment dated 1 December 2022 – I ZR 28/22 (only in German)).

The disputed information provided two options as to the parties to whom the withdrawal should be addressed.

This made the information contradictory and generally unclear, as first the name and contact details of only one recipient were given in order to validly exercise the right of withdrawal (“You must contact us”), but later (“Please address your withdrawal to [...] or [...]”) the contact details of an additional recipient were given.

The practical consequence of this is a clear recommendation not to deviate from the model wording, as even the slightest deviation poses a risk to the presumed legality of the instructions.

In October 2023, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that no new right of withdrawal arises when a distance subscription contract is automatically renewed after a free trial period ( ECJ, judgment dated 5 October 2023 – C-565/22 ).

This establishes the general principle that a consumer has only one right of withdrawal.

However, when the contract is concluded, the business must inform the consumer in a clear, comprehensible and explicit manner that payment for the subscription will be due after the free trial period (“trial subscription”).

The ECJ’s decision provides more legal certainty for businesses offering such subscription models.

EU consensus on withdrawal button A change with far-reaching practical consequences is already looming on the horizon.

In the future, the exercise of a right of withdrawal is to be simplified by a withdrawal function or button (only in German) on the user interface (website) of the provider.

The European Council and the European Parliament have reached a consensus on this in their proposal for a Directive concerning financial services contracts concluded at a distance .

It adds a new Article 11a to the Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights which, contrary to previous intentions, makes the new provision applicable to all online consumer transactions.

In addition, according to Article 6, paragraph 1, point (h) of the Consumer Rights Directive, a new precontractual information obligation is to apply in relation to “the existence and placement of the withdrawal function”.

However, the Directive does not provide for sanctions in the event of failure to provide this information or its incorrect provision."
Noerr,Digital consumer protection: current case law and European legislation,"However, the Directive does not provide for sanctions in the event of failure to provide this information or its incorrect provision.

Buttons have become a standard tool in digital consumer protection.

The first one was the “order button” mentioned in Section 312j of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) , which was designed to ensure that consumers understood that they were about to enter into a contract by using unmistakable labels such as “Order and Pay (zahlungspflichtig bestellen)”.

At the national level, the German legislator went a step further in 2022 with its Act on Fair Consumer Contracts (only in German) (Gesetz über faire Verbraucherverträge) by introducing the “termination button” in Section 312k of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) (only in German).

Many businesses still have problems with the implementation.

In January 2023, a study by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (only in German) (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband) concluded that 72% of the nearly 3,000 websites they surveyed had not implemented the termination button as required by law.

The situation is similar for the new requirements for termination clauses.

In a comprehensive “market check” (only in German), Consumer Organisations and Bavaria’s Consumer Service Centre (Verbraucherservice Bayern) checked more than 800 companies and found a total of 167 violations at 116 companies, which were subsequently warned.

The scope of the future “withdrawal function” goes far beyond that of the termination button, as it covers not only recurring payment obligations, but also all consumer contracts concluded via online user interfaces, and thus also in particular all purchase contracts in electronic B2C transactions.

Therefore, the importance of the practical implementation of this amendment should not be underestimated.

It is advisable to start planning the technical implementation at an early stage.

Since the Council approved the European Parliament’s position on 23 October 2023 , the Directive has been adopted.

After being signed by the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Council, the Directive will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force on the 20th day following its publication.

This is the start of the 24-month implementation period for the Member States.

National laws will become applicable 30 months after the Directive enters into force.

This means that businesses will likely have to provide consumers with compliant withdrawal buttons sometime in 2026.

Other current issues in consumer protection law Directive (EU) 2020/1828 on representative actions has just recently been implemented.

As of 13 October 2023, certain consumer protection associations have been entitled to assert the claims of a number of consumers against a company in collective actions (collective action for redress).

However, the practical significance of the new representative action is not yet clear, as many questions remain unanswered .

Another European legislative proposal concerns the repair of goods.

On 22 March 2023, the European Commission presented a Proposal for a Directive on common rules promoting the repair of goods , which in particular provides for a “right to repair” throughout the entire lifetime of certain products.

According to the standard legislative procedure, the proposal has to be approved by the European Parliament and the Council.

The Committee on the Internal Market gave its green light on 25 October 2023.

In addition, Directive (EU) 2019/882 on the accessibility requirements for products and services sets out specific requirements for making certain products and services accessible to people with disabilities."
Noerr,Digital consumer protection: current case law and European legislation,"In order to comply with this Directive, the German legislator has passed the German Act to Strengthen Accessibility for People with Disabilities (Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz) (only in German), which will, among other things, ensure that websites and services are accessible in online transactions as of 25 June 2025.

Finally, consumer protection also plays an important role in the EU’s new Digital Services Act (DSA) .

As of 17 February 2024, Article 6, paragraph 3 of the DSA establishes the liability of online platforms towards consumers, even if the platforms themselves do not offer any products or services for sale, but an average consumer may assume that the platform is the other contracting party or at least supervises the company in question.

In addition, Articles 30 to 32 of the DSA contain specific due diligence obligations for online platforms that enable consumers to enter into distance contracts with businesses.

Noerr,Commercial agency agreements in court: current decisions and their impact,"ECJ judgment dated 13 October 2022 – C-64/21 on the exclusion of repeat-business commission The ECJ confirmed that Article 7(1)(b) of the Commercial Agents Directive does not forbid a principal from excluding its commercial agent’s claim to payment of commission on repeat transactions.

Commission on repeat transactions means commissions for a transaction concluded during the period covered by the contract with a third party whom the commercial agent has previously acquired as a customer for transactions of the same kind.

While the ECJ pointed out, firstly, that the Commercial Agents Directive is intended to protect commercial agents, that protective purpose did not rule out excluding commission on repeat transactions.

It maintained that if paying commission on repeat transactions were mandatory, it could not be ruled out that company owners would make up for the cost of commission on repeat transactions by reducing the basic commission rate, limiting or excluding the costs previously reimbursed or other elements of the remuneration or even forgo entering into a contractual relationship with a commercial agent.

The ECJ thus confirmed the commonly held view in Germany.

FCJ judgment dated 19 January 2023 – VII ZR 787/21 on impediment to termination The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (FCJ) has fleshed out its previous case law with regard to inadmissible impediments to the termination of commercial agency contracts pursuant to the second sentence of section 89a(1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) to the effect that the question of whether the disadvantages attached to the termination of the contract are of such weight that an invalid impediment to termination within the meaning of the second sentence of section 89a(1) of the German Commercial Code exists must always be assessed according to the circumstances of the individual case on the basis of an economic assessment.

The FCJ thus effectively rejected a cookie-cutter assessment according to case groups, as previously applied in case law, and further clarified that the degree to which any disadvantages are linked to the right to summary termination is not decisive.

Therefore, even indirect disadvantages which are a mere “reflex reaction to a termination” cannot be excluded from the outset from the test of applying the standards of the second sentence of section 89a(1) of the German Commercial Code and in individual cases constitute an inadmissible impediment to termination.

According to the FCJ, based on an economic view regardless of the contractual structure, it must be determined whether there is an agreement within the meaning of the second sentence of section 89a(1) of the German Commercial Code which harms the commercial agent’s right of termination.

In this particular case this meant that the principal could no longer demand repayment of a loan given to the commercial agent, not even by applying the law on unjust enrichment.

Judgment by Hamm Higher Regional Court dated 14 November 2022 – 18 U 191/21 on the existence of a commercial agency contract Hamm Higher Regional Court (OLG Hamm) considered whether a distribution contract which defines how distribution activities are to be carried out, but not whether distribution activities are to be carried out, can be classified as a commercial agency contract within the meaning of sections 84 and following of the German Commercial Code.

Specifically, the issue was whether the distribution partner bringing the action was a commercial agent within the meaning of section 84 of the German Commercial Code and could therefore demand to see an extract from the books under section 87c(2) of the German Commercial Code.

Hamm Higher Regional Court found that the claimant was not required to broker transactions based on the distribution contract at issue."
Noerr,Commercial agency agreements in court: current decisions and their impact,"Hamm Higher Regional Court found that the claimant was not required to broker transactions based on the distribution contract at issue.

It reasoned that the claimant was therefore not constantly tasked with negotiating transactions within the meaning of section 84 of the German Commercial Code and was therefore not a commercial agent.

It was not enough, the court said, for a distribution partner to simply negotiate transactions now and then.

Instead, what was necessary was a contractual obligation to make efforts to achieve sales.

As a result, the claimant could not demand to see an extract from the books under section 87c(2) of the German Commercial Code, the court concluded.

Judgment by Cologne Higher Regional Court dated 9 December 2022 – 19 U 21/22 on the definition of the necessary documentation Cologne Higher Regional Court (OLG Köln) considered the interpretation of the term “documentation” in section 86a of the German Commercial Code.

According to that statute, the principal must provide the commercial agent with all the documentation necessary to perform their work free of charge.

Cologne Higher Regional Court has now ruled that even freely available standard software can count as “documentation” within the meaning of section 86a of the German Commercial Code if the commercial agent is obliged to use that software based on the contractual arrangement because it is impossible to negotiate transactions for the principal without that software.

That applied in the case to be decided by Cologne Higher Regional Court partly because the principal had forbidden its commercial agent from using other software.

Judgment by Rhineland-Palatinate Higher Employment Court dated 27 June 2023 – 6 Sa 237/22 on the obligation to pay commission Rhineland-Palatinate Higher Labour Court (LAG Rheinland-Pfalz) ruled that an agreement on commission in the terms and conditions which, in the event that several commercial agents conclude a transaction, awards the entitlement to commission to the commercial agent who entered the order into the principal’s system, may be validly agreed.

Under the first sentence of section 87(1) of the German Commercial Code, any contributory cause is sufficient to trigger the obligation to pay commission.

However, the Higher Labour Court found that a provision deviating from the first sentence of section 87(1) of the German Commercial Code, which specifies the entitlement to commission in cases in which several commercial agents are involved in concluding the transaction, is admissible because this can prevent the risk of a dual obligation to pay commission.

The Higher Labour Court thus agreed with the prevailing opinion in the legal literature.

Noerr,Logistics law in focus: current developments and challenges,"FCJ judgment dated 27 October 2022 – I ZR 139/21 on interpreting German Standard Shipping Terms and Conditions (ADSp) 2017 for multimodal transport The German Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) considered the interpretation of the currently valid ADSp 2017 (German Standard Shipping Terms and Conditions 2017) and clarified the relationship between the first sentence of No 23.1.2 of ADSp 2017 and the first sentence, case 2, of No 23.2 of ADSp 2017, which was previously disputed in the literature.

In this case, one of several snow groomers was damaged during multimodal transport from Germany to the USA and the location of the damage remained unknown.

In a textbook-like examination, the FCJ initially determined the applicability of German substantive law on the basis of the first sentence of Article 5(1)

Rome I Regulation in the absence of a choice of law by the parties in the transport contract.

Due to the multimodal transport, the FCJ affirmed the applicability of sections 407 to 450 of the German Commercial Code via the provisions of sections 452 et seq. of the German Commercial Code with regard to the specific transport contract.

The maximum liability amount of the indemnification obligation, which is regulated in sections 425 and 429 of the German Commercial Code was stipulated in deviation from section 431(1) of the German Commercial Code by the inclusion of ADSp 2017 in the contract.

According to their wording, both the first sentence of No 23.1.2 of ADSp 2017 and the first sentence, case 2, of No 23.2 of ADSp 2017 cover the case of cross-border multimodal transport including a sea route with an unknown location of damage.

However, the first sentence, case 2, of No 23.2 refers to the statutory maximum liability amount, whereas the first sentence of No 23.1.2 limits the liability to 2 instead of 8.33 special drawing rights for each kilogramme, i.e. considerably restricts it.

Since ADSp 2017 are model terms and conditions, the FCJ has interpreted them as standard terms and conditions of business.

In doing so, the FCJ comes to the conclusion that the first sentence of No 23.1.2 ADSp 2017 is the more tailored provision which thus takes precedence in multimodal transport partly by sea with an unknown location of damage over the provision in the first sentence, case 2, of No 23.2.

The FCJ particularly justified this by considering the opposite possibility: If the first sentence, case 2 of No. 23.2 was an exception to the exception to the first sentence of No. 23.1.2, it would additionally limit the already small scope of application, rendering the first sentence of No 23.1.2 practically useless.

Judgement by Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court, dated 17 February 2023 – 15 U 4/22 on the presumption of loss and unlimited liability under the CMR Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court (OLG Karlsruhe) considered the presumption of loss in Article 20 of the CMR (Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road) in the event of refusal of acceptance and unlimited liability under Article 29 of the CMR.

In the case in question, the carrier was to transport jewellery and watches from a sender to a consignee abroad.

The carrier used a sub-carrier for the leg abroad.

When the sub-carrier wanted to deliver the goods to the consignee, the latter refused to accept them.

The sub-carrier then took the goods to its warehouse and waited for further instructions from the carrier.

The whereabouts of the goods remained unknown for a long time; only during the trial, around two years later, did it emerge that the goods were still in the sub-carrier’s warehouse, whereupon they were returned to the sender.

The Higher Regional Court affirmed the carrier’s unlimited liability under Article 17(1) and Article 29 of the CMR.

There was no delivery to the consignee and the consignee’s refusal to accept the goods did not lead to the assumption of delivery, the court said."
Noerr,Logistics law in focus: current developments and challenges,"There was no delivery to the consignee and the consignee’s refusal to accept the goods did not lead to the assumption of delivery, the court said.

Instead, in this case the carrier should have asked the sender for instructions in accordance with Article 15 of the CMR, which it failed to do.

It added that even though the goods were recovered, the sender could consider the goods lost without having to provide further evidence, as they had not been delivered within 60 days of takeover and that insofar the presumption of Article 20(1) of the CMR is an irrefutable presumption.

The Higher Regional Court rejected an exclusion of the carrier’s liability and instead assumed unlimited liability according to Article 29 of the CMR, because the presumption of loss is based on whether the circumstances that were decisive for the non-delivery constitute a special breach of duty.

Because the goods were not properly recorded and handled in the sub-carrier’s warehouse and were therefore untraceable for approximately two years, the Higher Regional Court found a serious lack of organisation on the part of the carrier and thus a serious breach of duty justifying the accusation of reckless trading.

The sub-carrier’s conduct in this respect was therefore attributable to the carrier under Article 29(2) of the CMR.

FCJ, order dated 23 March 2023 – I ZR 180/22 on the start of the limitation period regarding a storage contract In this order on an appeal against denial of leave to appeal, the FCJ addressed the commencement of the limitation period for a storage contract.

The claimant initially commissioned the defendant, a moving company, to carry out a private move.

However, as the move ultimately did not take place, the parties agreed that the claimant’s items would be stored at the defendant’s premises.

Due to a flood, all of the claimant’s items were temporarily flooded.

It was not stated when the claimant got her items back, but she asserted her claims against the defendant in a letter shortly after the damage occurred.

In particular, the limitation period for the claims was questionable during the following lawsuit.

According to the first sentence of section 475a of the German Commercial Code, the provision in section 439 of the German Commercial Code applies to the limitation of claims from storage.

According to subsection 2 of section 439, the limitation period begins running at midnight of the day on which the goods ought to have been delivered.

According to the case law of the FCJ, delivery is to be assumed when the carrier relinquishes custody of the transported goods and enables the consignee to exercise actual control over the goods with the consignee’s will and consent.

In this case, the Higher Regional Court assumed the claimant was in a position to exercise actual control over the property again at the latest when the claims for damages were asserted.

The FCJ has now firmly rejected this assumption.

Judgement by Hamburg Regional Court, dated 15 June 2023 − 407 HKO 20/22 on passing on the costs of shipping container demurrage This is an interesting ruling by Hamburg Regional Court (LG Hamburg), representing a classic issue in day-to-day logistics.

In the case, a freight forwarder took legal action against its customer for reimbursement of demurrage, detention, and storage costs as well as a low water surcharge.

The claimant operated as a fixed-cost forwarder under section 459 of the German Commercial Code.

The costs were incurred during the transport of sea freight shipments from the Far East, including on-carriage, and were invoiced to the freight forwarder by shipping companies.

The claimant argued that the costs were caused by unforeseeable circumstances such as delays at the seaport of Rotterdam and technical defects on the railway line, for which neither it nor the shipping company were responsible."
Noerr,Logistics law in focus: current developments and challenges,"It invoked the 2017 German Standard Shipping Terms and Conditions (ADSp 2017) and the German Commercial Code to claim reimbursement of the costs.

The defendant disputed the claims and argued the costs could have been avoided with reasonable care and were therefore not refundable.

The court ruled that the freight forwarder was not entitled to the costs it sought.

The defendant company had concluded a forwarding agreement with the claimant freight forwarder at a fixed cost for multimodal transports with the consequence that according to the first sentence of section 459 of the German Commercial Code, the agreed freight forwarder’s remuneration covered all expenses associated with the transport.

The claimant was unable to base its claim on the second sentence of section 420(1) of the German Commercial Code.

Although in the case of a fixed-cost shipping company transporting goods, the provision in freight law generally applies which states that the freight forwarder has a claim to reimbursement of expenses beyond the freight.

However, demurrage and detention costs as well as the other claimed costs (storage costs, low water surcharge) are not covered by this provision because the second sentence of section 420(1) of the German Commercial Code explicitly covers only costs which are refundable expenses incurred for the goods.

The aforementioned costs however, are not goods-related but transport-related costs.

In addition, No 17.1 ADSp 2017 does not give rise to a claim to reimbursement of expenses since it only applies to expenses which are outside of the carrier’s sphere of risk and responsibility.

The court clarified that the claimant itself had to bear the responsibility for the risks, obstacles and incidents leading to the additional costs.

This covers errors and inadequacies of any agents acting on its behalf and unpredictable technical defects or failures in the public transportation infrastructure.

In relation to the circumstances at hand such as the cancellation of slots at Rotterdam port and the closure of a train line, the court dismissed the claimant’s arguments that those circumstances were out of its control and thus refundable.

The claim for reimbursement of the low water surcharge and storage costs was also rejected as those costs fell within the claimant’s sphere of risk and were covered by the fixed-cost agreement with the defendant.

In summary, the court found that as a fixed-cost freight forwarder, the claimant bore responsibility for the costs incurred and could not pass them on to the defendant.

Judgement by Frankfurt Higher Regional Court, dated 28 March 2023 – 14 U 84/22 on a freight forwarder’s liability for damage as a result of migrants entering the loading area The judgment by Frankfurt Higher Regional Court (OLG Frankfurt) concerns litigation over claims for damages in connection with a food shipment during which migrants entered the loading area of a refrigerated train, which led to the cargo being destroyed.

The claimant was tasked with transporting 33 pallets of products containing chocolate and cocoa from Stadtallendorf to Ternat in Belgium.

Upon delivery on 30 March 2021 at least 29 stowaways were encountered in the refrigerated train.

The goods were refused by the defendant consignee and destroyed due to the suspicion of damage, as some of the packaging had traces of urine and some packages had been ripped open.

The defendant, the consignee of the goods, claimed damages of €47,943.96.

The claimant disputed the damage and argued the driver could not have prevented the migrants from entering the train and therefore the claim for damages was void under Article 17(2) of the CMR.

The claimant also alleged that the vast majority of the goods were still useable.

The Regional Court upheld the claimant’s arguments.

However, the defendant’s appeal was largely successful.

The Higher Regional Court ruled that the claimant had to pay damages for the entire cargo."
Noerr,Logistics law in focus: current developments and challenges,"The Regional Court upheld the claimant’s arguments.

However, the defendant’s appeal was largely successful.

The Higher Regional Court ruled that the claimant had to pay damages for the entire cargo.

It contended that the carrier did not take every reasonable effort to prevent the migrants from entering and therefore could not invoke Article 17(2) of the CMR.

It was also acknowledged that the damage to some boxes made the entire cargo unusable, which represented a devaluation of the entire cargo.

Suspicion of damage alone was enough to assume damage, since that reduced the value of the goods on the market and the goods could no longer be properly placed on the market, the court said.

The judgment highlights the importance of carriers’ duties of care in international transportation law and the consequences of failure to fulfil those duties.

It also shows that a legitimate suspicion of damage can be sufficient to establish an impairment of the value of goods and thus a claim for damages.

ECJ (7th Chamber), judgment dated 14 September 2023 − C-246/22 on cabotage regulations The judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) following a request by Cologne Local Court (AG Köln) for a preliminary ruling involved the interpretation of Directive 92/106/EEC and Regulation 1072/2009/ EC, especially regarding the transportation of empty shipping containers in combined transport and their exemption from cabotage regulations.

The case arose from litigation between the managing director of a transport company, BW, and the then Federal Office for Goods Transportation in Germany (Bundesamt für Güterverkehr, BAG) (now the Federal Office for Logistics and Mobility (Bundesamt für Logistik und Mobilität)).

The Office imposed a fine for breach of cabotage regulations, which stipulate that a transport company from an EU Member State may only carry out a limited number of intra-state transport journeys in another EU Member State.

The dispute focused on whether the carriage of empty shipping containers could be considered part of a combined transport and was thus exempt from the cabotage restrictions.

The ECJ specified that a combined transport is to be understood as the carriage of goods partly by road but with the majority of the route completed by rail, inland waterway or sea, with the road transport part having to be below a certain route length.

The court ruled that the carriage of empty shipping containers between a container terminal and the location of loading or unloading of the goods counts as part of a combined transport.

This also applies if this transport takes place immediately before or after the carriage of goods.

The ECJ also found that the carriage of empty shipping containers as part of combined transports was exempt from the cabotage provisions of Regulation 1072/2009.

Accordingly, such transport is not subject to the strict restrictions that usually apply to cabotage transport.

The court emphasised the importance of combined transports as a way to reduce road congestion, protect the environment and improve road safety.

The inclusion of empty shipping containers in combined transport contributes to the promotion of this form of transport.

Although the EU transport market is not yet fully harmonised, the judgment highlights the objectives of the EU’s common transport policy.

This policy aims to remove barriers to the free movement of goods and services while ensuring that this is done in a way that takes account of public safety, environmental protection and the efficiency of the transport system.

In summary, the ECJ ruled that the carriage of empty shipping containers can be part of a combined transport and can therefore be exempt from cabotage restrictions, setting an important precedent for similar cases in the future.

Noerr,Contract law in focus: a look at current judgements and legal reforms,"This overview includes case law since mid-2022 and provides an overview of legal amendments that have a practical impact on national and international contracts.

Insolvency-based rescission clauses The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (FCJ) (judgment dated 27 October 2022 – IX ZR 213/21) has clarified its case law on insolvency-based rescission clauses.

An insolvency-based rescission clause is a clause that entitles a contracting party to rescind the contract based solely on the other party’s inability to pay or insolvency.

The dispute regarding the validity of such clauses arises from the delicate balance between contractual freedom on the one hand and the protection of insolvency assets under section 103 and following of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), especially insolvency administrators’ right to choose to continue contracts, on the other.

The FCJ’s decision was in regard to a case in which a transportation contract was terminated with immediate effect for cause based on an insolvency-based termination clause after a preliminary insolvency administrator had been appointed.

The lower court had assumed that the insolvency- based termination clause was invalid because the clause was not covered by any rescission option found in the applicable law.

The FCJ did not concur with this reasoning but instead clarified that such rescission clauses may be valid if they pursue a legitimate goal under insolvency law.

This decision has established a guideline that a rescission clause is invalid if it entitles a party to rescind a contract based solely on the insolvency of the other party and differs from the options to rescind provided by law although no justified grounds for these differences existed when the contract was signed.

As a result, the FCJ has consistently ruled that insolvency-based rescission clauses in favour of the party to which payment is owed are invalid because the payment recipient has sufficient possibilities to protect itself in the form of rights of retention provided by law.

Thus, conversely, this opens up options for recipients of goods and services to draft valid rescission clauses in their favour.

Because the FCJ has not made any sweeping statements in this regard, this will depend on the circumstances of the specific case, particularly whether the purpose of the termination right agreed is to pursue a legitimate goal under insolvency law or whether the risks associated with insolvency constitute cause in any case within the meaning of the termination right provided by law (e.g. section 314 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) or section 89a of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)).

For this reason, it may be advisable to state in the contract itself the reasons for including an insolvency- based rescission clause and to draft the clause to cover all circumstances.

Including a place of jurisdiction clause using a hyperlink The European Court of Justice (ECJ) (judgment dated 24 November 2022 – C-358/21) considered the issue of whether a jurisdiction clause included in standard terms and conditions of business (T&C) is valid if it is only included in the written contract by reference to an embedded hyperlink.

The main issue in the proceedings was whether such a clause that can be accessed online can be deemed to be a durable record equivalent to “writing”.

According to the Brussels I Regulation (recast) 1215/2012 (and the parallel provision in the Lugano Convention), compliance with this formal requirement is necessary in order for a valid agreement on the international standing of a court to hear a case to come about.

This decision is consistent with the ECJ’s history of technology-friendly case law.

In 2015, when ruling on entering into contracts online, it decided that it is sufficient if the T&C are accessible via a hyperlink and their validity has been accepted by clicking on a button displayed for that purpose."
Noerr,Contract law in focus: a look at current judgements and legal reforms,"In this current decision, the ECJ has expanded the option of using a hyperlink to include contracts signed in writing.

Using a hyperlink to include T&C opens up opportunities but also new challenges.

For example, the company that issues the T&C must document the availability and the version provided.

For the other contracting party, this means increased due diligence because they will need to review and comply with linked documents.

Subsequent exclusion of the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) Munich Higher Regional Court (OLG München) has held (guidance order dated 12 December 2022 – 7 U 4810/21) that the applicability of the CISG can be excluded either expressly or implicitly not only when a contract is entered into but also subsequently if it is sufficiently clear that both parties intended this.

The background to the order was a dispute between a dealer in the Netherlands and a dealer domiciled in Germany regarding the effectiveness of the rescission of a purchase contract for electric vehicles.

Without a contractual clause to the contrary, the rules of the CISG would have been automatically applicable to this cross-border case.

Munich Higher Regional Court discerned a tacit exclusion of the CISG from the fact that the parties based their arguments during the court proceedings solely on the German Civil Code.

This case shows that, in the absence of a contractual clause, the courts were able to assume throughout the entire oral hearing that the CISG had been excluded.

Consequently, parties to such contracts are well advised to consider the opportunities and risks of the CISG either when entering into the contract or, at the latest, in the context of a court case.

No-fault B2B vendor liability The FCJ (judgment dated 21 June 2023 – VIII ZR 105/22) reached a decision on a purchaser’s right to claim no-fault reimbursement of its expenses in the context of supplementary performance.

The dispute regarded reimbursement of the expenses incurred for prefabricating and connecting defective stainless steel pipes.

This means that the subject in dispute was not the installation of the defective item per se.

The FCJ awarded the purchaser the reimbursement claimed, noting that reimbursement of expenses was to be interpreted in a purchaser-friendly manner and that the right to claim it already existed when a defect in the purchased item became apparent during the prefabrication process and thus prevented the installation process from being completed.

As long as the purchased item was not inseparably connected to another item, the claim was not defeated by the fact that a new item was created during the installation process, the court stated.

In accordance with the express legislative intent, the FCJ made no distinction between B2B and B2C transactions.

The broad interpretation of the term “installation” of an item leads to a high risk of a seller of materials from which new products are manufactured at great expense being exposed to no-fault liability.

This makes it necessary when drafting contracts to carefully consider the extent to which contractual rights to claim reimbursement of expenses can be restricted and how recourse and indemnity options can be secured within (international) supply chains.

Outlook At the European and national levels, there are several legislative initiatives that will influence contract drafting and dispute resolution.

The German federal government plans to make Germany more attractive as a place of jurisdiction by establishing commercial courts (Bill to strengthen Germany as a place of jurisdiction,

Parliamentary Publication 20/8649 ( Entwurf über ein Justizstandort-Stärkungsgesetz - only in German).

The commercial courts are to be able to rule on first-instance civil commercial cases with claim values starting at €1 million if the parties have agreed to this.

It will be permissible to conduct the proceedings in English or German."
Noerr,Contract law in focus: a look at current judgements and legal reforms,"It will be permissible to conduct the proceedings in English or German.

This bill aims to create quick, efficient and attractive court proceedings to strengthen Germany as a place of jurisdiction and commerce and further develop its civil law.

Additional advantages are intended to be specialised judges, comprehensive protection of business secrets and litigation costs that are lower than those for conventional civil proceedings due to the option of bypassing the first instance.

The German Federal Ministry of Justice has also drafted a bill that would make video proceedings in civil cases more flexible and easily accessible.

In the future, a court is to be able to not only allow digital proceedings but also to order them on its own initiative (for example to expedite the proceedings).

In addition, the requirements for rejecting an application for video proceedings are to be increased.

After the Bundestag (lower house) passed the draft, the Bundesrat (upper house) referred the bill to the mediation committee, making it unclear whether and, if it is passed, when the law will enter into force (Bill to promote the use of video conference technology in the civil and specialised court systems (Entwurf über ein Gesetz zur Förderung des Einsatzes von Videokonferenztechnik in der Zivilgerichtsbarkeit und den Fachgerichtsbarkeiten), Parliamentary Publication 20/8095).

At the European level, the European Commission is planning to combat late payment in commercial transactions.

It has published a proposal for a new late payment regulation to protect companies from the negative effects of late payments ( European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating late payment in commercial transactions ).

The key aims of the current proposal are to limit periods for payment and acceptance and inspection periods to a maximum of 30 days and to make default interest fall due automatically.

Noerr,Guarantee of validity and attribution of knowledge in factoring in the focus of case law,"Only a few decisions in 2023 were significant for factoring in practice.

Attributing knowledge when challenging payments by debtors in an insolvency situation Factoring contracts often include extensive duties on the part of the client to inform and support the factor, which specify section 402 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch).

According to a decision by Schleswig-Holstein Higher Regional Court (Schleswig-Holsteinisches OLG) (see Schleswig-Holstein Higher Regional Court, judgment dated 23 June 2021 – 9 U 109/20), when an insolvency is challenged, if a client knows that a debtor is unable to pay, then payments made by the debtor to the factor could give rise to the question of whether the factor must allow the client’s knowledge to be attributed to it in analogous application of section 166 of the German Civil Code due to the client’s duty to inform.

The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) (FCJ) (judgment dated 25 May 2023 – IX ZR 116/21

= BB 2023, 2256) has rejected this argument and emphasised that a client’s duty to inform and support alone cannot form the basis for attributing such knowledge to the factor.

Standard-form assignment clauses In two decisions

, the sixth civil panel of the FCJ addressed a breach of section 307(1) of the German Civil Code by standard-form assignment clauses.

The two decisions have no direct link to factoring, but reveal the guidelines that are to be observed when wording assignment provisions, including in factoring: In the first decision (FCJ, judgment dated 10 October 2023 – VI ZR 257/22), the court addressed the validity of a standard-form assignment of claims by an injured party against the injuring party in a contract for an expert opinion on estimating repair costs.

The expert opinion contract included a clause according to which the assignee was entitled but not obliged to assert the assigned claim against the injuring party.

The FCJ held that the clause was invalid due to a breach of section 307(1) of the German Civil Code because it did not include a provision regarding the occurrence of the event of loss or damage; in particular the wording that entitled but did not oblige the assignee to assert the claim permitted the interpretation that asserting the claim was intended to be independent of the occurrence of the event of loss or damage.

The decision is significant, primarily for recourse factoring, in which the assignment is similar to an assignment for security and the loan granted by the factor is usually repaid by collecting the assigned receivable by way of performance.

In some cases, the requirements for an assignment for security established by the FCJ could necessitate a corresponding adjustment of the assignment mechanism where recourse factoring takes place.

Even in contracts involving non-recourse factoring, there may be situations in which it is necessary to make a clearer distinction between collecting claims assigned as security for the purpose of realising them and collecting them as a service (collection agency claims).

The second decision (FCJ, judgment dated 17 October 2023 – VI ZR 27/23) deals with the invalidity of a standard-form assignment clause with which a person who had rented a vehicle assigned his damages claim for reimbursement of the costs of renting the car against the injuring party to the car rental company by way of performance.

The FCJ was of the opinion that, under the transparency imperative found in the second sentence of section 307(1) of the German Civil Code, the assignment clause must make it clearly recognisable when the assignor would receive the claim back upon fulfilment of the claim to payment of the renting fee.

In many factoring models there are situations in which the factor reassigns an individual claim to a client (e.g. if the purchase of the receivable is reversed or refused in a final manner)."
Noerr,Guarantee of validity and attribution of knowledge in factoring in the focus of case law,"In many factoring models there are situations in which the factor reassigns an individual claim to a client (e.g. if the purchase of the receivable is reversed or refused in a final manner).

The FCJ decision shows that, under certain circumstances, a non-transparent contractual clause on reassigning receivables can invalidate the previous assignment to the factor itself.

The decision also provides an example of a valid option for wording such a clause.

Clients’ no-fault guarantee of validity of receivables No-fault guarantees of the validity of the receivables in receivables purchase agreements are very common.

If the factor asserts a claim against the client based on the breach of such a clause, the client’s line of defence can be to question the validity of the clause because no-fault guarantee liability tends to constitute a breach of section 307 of the German Civil Code.

This situation was presented to Frankfurt Higher Regional Court (OLG Frankfurt) for adjudication (Frankfurt Higher Regional Court, order dated 21 June 2023 – 10 U 85/22 = BKR 2023, 873).

The Tenth Civil Senate emphasised that no-fault guarantee liability within the meaning of the first sentence of section 276(1) of the German Civil Code cannot necessarily be deemed to have been tacitly agreed.

However, it made it just as clear that an expressly agreed no-fault guarantee of the validity of receivables does not breach section 307 of the German Civil Code.

Its reasoning included the fact that a client is in a much better position than a factor to evaluate the validity of the receivable it is assigning.

The Senate also referred to the FCJ’s case law that a no-fault guarantee of a receivable’s validity issued by a client’s managing director is effective.

This viewpoint expressed by Frankfurt Higher Regional Court concurs with the prevailing opinion regarding no-fault guarantees of the validity of purchased receivables.

Noerr,Franchise Update: Key decisions in 2023,"Introduction In Germany, judgments focusing on franchise law are few and far between.

However, three franchise-related decisions were made in 2023.

Firstly, the Munich Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht München) again dealt with preliminary injunction proceedings involving a well-known fast food chain.

The dispute centred on whether the franchisee’s heiress had to allow card payments in fast food restaurants.

In the case, the court considered whether system adjustment clauses were valid in franchise agreements.

Secondly, the Berlin Higher Regional Court (Kammergericht Berlin) had to decide on the validity of a jurisdiction agreement with a franchisee who was a founder of a new business.

And thirdly, a ruling by the Darmstadt Regional Court (Landgericht Darmstadt) concerned an arbitration clause in a franchise agreement.

Judgment by Munich Higher Regional Court dated 8 February 2023 – 7 U 8606/21 on the validity of a system adjustment clause

The franchisor operates a chain of fast food restaurants and applied for an interim injunction against the heiress of the franchisee who operated several fast food restaurants.

The parties were in dispute about who was entitled to manage the restaurants.

The heiress had taken on the de facto management of the restaurants.

To ensure the revenues came directly to her, she had removed the card readers from most cash registers and self-service terminals in the restaurants or prevented their use by blocking the card slot.

The franchisor made an application to force the heiress to allow customers to pay by card in the fast food restaurants.

Munich Higher Regional Court ruled in the franchisor’s favour, as follows: Firstly, Munich Higher Regional Court clarified the legal relationship between the parties.

Despite the franchisee’s death, the franchise agreements were still in place.

However, the heiress did not become a franchisee because to enter into the franchise agreements she needed the consent of the franchisor, who refused to give it.

The legal relationship was therefore in limbo.

Munich Higher Regional Court likened the limbo to a precontractual obligation (section 311 (2) of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), to which the provisions of franchise agreements were applicable.

Next, Munich Higher Regional Court pointed out that the heiress was required by the provisions of the franchise agreements to allow non-cash payment in the fast food restaurants without any restrictions, in other words at all cash registers and self-service terminals.

It maintained that otherwise the franchisor’s reputation would be damaged.

Younger customers in particular counted on being able to pay by card, the court said.

All franchise agreements contained system adjustment clauses stating that the franchisee’s heiress had to “apply the M system as amended from time to time as laid down and written in the operating manuals, documentation materials, written policies, plans, etc. which are updated from time to time and observe the corresponding principles and policies.”

The franchisor had to “take reasonable account of the reasonable interests of the franchisee according to the principles of good faith” in the event of changes.

The franchisor was entitled, via this system adjustment clause, to define the system standards of the fast food restaurant chain and require cashless payment systems to be available.

The system adjustment clause was also valid and did not unreasonably disadvantage the franchisee’s heiress (section 307 of the German Civil Code).

Binding the franchisee to the system standard is a material element of the franchise system, without which the system could not work.

That also included the possibility of system changes.

The franchisor’s planning of changes to the standards thus corresponded to the key underlying philosophy of franchise law (section 307 (2 No 1) of the German Civil Code)."
Noerr,Franchise Update: Key decisions in 2023,"The franchisor’s planning of changes to the standards thus corresponded to the key underlying philosophy of franchise law (section 307 (2 No 1) of the German Civil Code).

The fact that the franchisor was only allowed to exercise this unilateral right to specify performance only at its reasonable discretion (section 315 of the German Civil Code) was sufficiently expressed in the contractual clause by reference to the interests of the franchisee and to the principles of good faith, the court said.

Judgment by Berlin Higher Regional Court dated 24 May 2023 – 26 U 78/21 on the validity of a jurisdiction agreement with a business founder Berlin Higher Regional Court ruled on whether jurisdiction agreements with franchisees who were business founders were valid.

The franchise agreement contained the following jurisdiction agreement: “ The parties agree that the Regional Court at the location of the franchisor’s head office will have sole jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this franchise contract. ”

Berlin Higher Regional Court affirmed the validity of the above jurisdiction agreement, thus setting aside the decision of the lower court (Berlin Regional Court (LG Berlin), judgment dated 31 May 2021 – 10 O 107/19) and joined the apparently prevailing view in the legal literature.

Berlin Higher Regional Court explained the validity as follows: A jurisdiction agreement within the meaning of section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) which actually establishes the required status as a merchant can also be entered into effectively in the franchise agreement.

It is not necessary for the party to already be a merchant upon entering into the jurisdiction agreement.

Section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure is also applicable to merchants during the startup phase.

No other interpretation is possible from the wording of the procedural standard (section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure).

This mentions “merchants”.

As this term is not defined in procedural law, the term “merchant” as defined in commercial law (section 1 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)) is to be used.

Both uses of the term are to be interpreted identically.

Section 1 (1) of the German Commercial Code reads: “A merchant within the meaning of this Code is a person who carries on a commercial business.”

Entering into the relevant contract establishing the commercial activity, in this case the franchise agreement, is always to be regarded as “carrying on” a commercial business.

By doing so, the franchisee expresses to a third party in civil law legal relations that it wishes to start running a commercial business.

It would make no sense to view the decisive entrepreneurial act of founding a business as a private-law matter, but then view every subsequent action as unquestionably commercial.

Consumer protection does not offer any relief either.

Those who pick a certain commercial or self-employed occupation and enter into transactions aimed at starting a commercial operation are choosing to face the harsh winds of entrepreneurial commerce.

They cannot also rely on consumer protection in their dealings with future business partners and possibly competitors as well.

Especially those who buy a company or enter into a commercial agent or franchise agreement in order to start doing business on that basis in the future cannot draw on consumer protection for this startup business.

Judgment by Darmstadt Regional Court dated 25 May 2023 – 7 O 8/22 on an arbitration clause Darmstadt Regional Court dismissed an action by a franchisor against a franchisee partly for payment of outstanding franchise fees as inadmissible."
Noerr,Franchise Update: Key decisions in 2023,"As grounds, Darmstadt Regional Court referred to the arbitration clause in the franchise agreement, which read: “ Article 22 Arbitration In the event of disputes, the parties agree to seriously attempt to reach an agreement for two months (arbitration) before referring the matter to a court.

This period will begin upon written request by the first party to the second party to conduct the arbitration.

The arbitration will be deemed ended if this period has expired without agreement on the relevant disputed issues, if the second party expressly rejects the arbitration or if the second party fails to respond to the written request within 14 days.

It is inadmissible to refer the matter to the court before conducting and ending the arbitration.

That does not apply to interim relief or to assertion of the franchisor’s contractual payment claims. ”

The court reasoned that according to this, arbitration should have been carried out before referring the matter to the court.

It believed that the concept and significance of arbitration required the involvement of a neutral third party.

Besides this, according to the contract the parties merely holding advance negotiations or talks was not sufficient.

An explicit preprocedural request by the franchisor was also required before arbitration, the court said.

It continued that the franchisor cannot invoke the contractual exclusion clause, which states that the arbitration clause does not apply to the assertion of the franchisor’s contractual payment claims.

The exclusion clause harms the parties’ equality of arms because only the franchisee is given an additional hurdle to asserting its claims in court.

The court stated that it could not see any legitimate interest in this exception on the part of the franchisor and that the clause was therefore invalid under the first sentence of section 307 (1) of the German Civil Code.

Outlook The judgment by Munich Higher Regional Court confirms the validity of system adjustment clauses in franchise agreements and shows that franchisors can set binding system standards as long as the interests of franchisees remain adequately taken into account.

By contrast, the decisions by Berlin Higher Regional Court and Darmstadt Regional Court show that caution is advisable when agreeing on jurisdiction and arbitration clauses in franchise agreements.

The ruling by Berlin Higher Regional Court now creates clarity on jurisdiction agreements with business founders provided that Berlin Regional Court is competent locally.

But since we are still waiting for a decision by the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), caution still needs to be exercised in jurisdiction agreements with franchisees who are business founders.

Noerr,New horizons in distribution antitrust law?,"Sales and distribution contracts between suppliers and purchasers (but also unilateral conduct in the context of sales and distribution, such as dictating terms and conditions) are also subject to restrictions under antitrust and competition law.

These are sales and distribution-related antitrust and competition law issues that should always be taken into consideration when establishing or revamping distribution systems.

A major role in this is played by the Block Exemption Regulation on Vertical Agreements (VBER), which was updated in May of 2022, along with the associated guidelines of the European Commission (more details can be found in our Competition Outlook 2023 ).

Vertical agreements between companies at different stages of the production or distribution chain are exempted from the prohibition of cartels found in Article 101(1) TFEU under the conditions of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (safe harbour).

The VBER exemption does not apply if a distribution agreement contains “hardcore restrictions”.

These are in particular agreements whose object is to achieve resale price maintenance, restrictions on customers or territories and, as explicitly emphasised since May 2022, restriction of the effective use of the internet.

In this context, the ECJ’s “Super Bock Bebidas decision” dated 29 June 2023 (ECJ, judgment dated 29 June 2023 – C-211/22 – Super Bock Bebidas) is to be highlighted.

The case concerned the question of whether a supplier fixing a minimum price for resale by its buyers should always be regarded as a restriction of competition by object.

Such price fixing is a “hardcore restriction” within the meaning of the VBER, and therefore such an agreement is excluded from the safe harbour of the block exemption.

The ECJ has now clarified that the category of “hardcore restriction” cannot simply be equated with the category of “restriction of competition by object” according to Article 101(1) of the TFEU.

The ECJ emphasises in this context the principle that if there has not even been a restriction of competition within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU, an exemption according to Article 101(3) TFEU is irrelevant.

Consequently, the burden of proof has increased for the authorities because they must investigate each breach of Article 101(1) TFEU in more depth.

However, this decision is by no means an open invitation to engage in vertical price fixing.

The VBER brings with it in particular innovations in online sales and distribution, online trading platforms and hybrid platforms.

Specific requirements have also been included as to when exchange of information relevant to competition between suppliers and buyers in dual distribution systems is exempted and when it is not (“vertical exchange of information”).

These must always be taken into consideration when a supplier distributes or is considering distributing goods or services not only directly, e.g. via its own premises or online, but also indirectly via independent buyers such as dealers.

In other distribution systems, for example those that involve companies manufacturing their own contractual products, there is also often a legitimate interest in cooperating with other companies.

Those other companies can include competitors, with the result that competition law is an important component of due diligence.

Thus, it is to be emphasised that the European Commission’s new block exemption regulations on specialisation agreements ( Specialisation Block Exemption Regulation ) and research and development agreements ( R&D Regulation ) have been in effect since 1 July 2023.

They apply until 30 June 2035.

The regulations constitute a safe harbour for certain agreements between companies covering specialised or joint production and joint research and development, including use of the results."
Noerr,New horizons in distribution antitrust law?,"The regulations constitute a safe harbour for certain agreements between companies covering specialised or joint production and joint research and development, including use of the results.

Agreements and any contact with (future) competitors are subject to strict restrictions, primarily with regard to the exchange of information as covered by antitrust law.

It is advisable to note the European Commission’s new guidelines, likewise published in summer 2023, on horizontal co-operation agreements ( Horizontal Guidelines ), which include broad clarifications that take into account more recent legal precedents.

These comprise a newly structured and expanded chapter on the exchange of information that now explains the concept of commercially sensitive information and describes how to avoid a breach of competition law in more depth.

Moreover, there are completely new explanations on “sustainability agreements” that can create room for manoeuvre in collaborations to pursue sustainability goals.

It is also to be emphasised that the ECJ set out more precisely its practices when identifying exclusivity clauses by companies with a dominant market position last year (ECJ, judgment dated 19 January 2023 – C-680/20 – Unilever).

A consequence of the decision is that competition authorities will have to work harder to prove that a company has used an exclusivity clause to abuse its dominant position if that company can defend itself.

In everyday practice, this means that even exclusivity clauses imposed in distribution agreements are not abusive per se and thus not necessarily inadmissible, although it goes without saying that they continue to be risky.

It can be important here whether the exclusivity clause excludes equally efficient competitors (“as efficient competitor” (AEC) test).

The ECJ had previously increased the requirements to be met by competition authorities in regard to exclusivity rebates in a similar way.

It is also particularly interesting for vehicle manufacturers that the period of application of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation on vertical agreements and concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector in its current version has been extended to 31 May 2028.

This means that the previous legal situation regarding aftersales distribution agreements will remain largely the same.

There have been changes to the European Commission’s supplementary guidelines regarding motor vehicles (Motor Vehicle Guidelines, EUR-Lex - 52010XC0528(01) - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu) ).

These include additional guidelines regarding vehicle repair and maintenance information (RMI) to be observed by vehicle manufacturers, for example when distributing or marketing such RMI or other vehicle data and include the warning that unilaterally withholding vehicle-generated data may constitute abuse under Article 102 of the TFEU.

The legislative context here is fraught with legal uncertainty because under laws such as the Type Approval Regulation (EU) 2018/858 vehicle manufacturers must provide “independent operators” access to RMI, on-board diagnostics (OBD) and other information and services.

The ECJ repeatedly dealt with this topic in 2022 and 2023 in cases in which we have been able to ensure that our clients are permitted to continue to derive profit from this RMI (ECJ, judgment dated 27 October 2022 – C-390/21) and are not obliged to provide an automated RMI databank interface (ECJ, judgment dated 9 November 2023 – C-319/22).

Noerr,Green light for CCS and CCU – German federal government presents key issues paper,"The German federal government’s strategy for achieving its climate targets now has an additional component: following the announcement in January 2024 of a possible collaboration with Norway for the storage of CO 2 off the Norwegian coast, the German government now intends to authorise the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), i.e. the capture and storage or further use of carbon dioxide, in Germany as well.

This is set out in the key points of the carbon management strategy and the bill to amend Germany’s Carbon Dioxide Storage Act ( Kohlendioxid-Speicherungsgesetz ), which is based on this strategy and which the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action presented on 26 February 2024.

The technology has already been trialled in other European countries for several decades.

In its latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also assumes that, in addition to other mitigation measures, CCS and CCU are a necessary climate protection technology in emission-intensive sectors with emissions that are difficult to avoid in order to meet the 1.5 degree target.

Most recently, Germany’s industry association BDI and the German Trade Union Confederation, together with the environmental groups WWF and Nabu, called on the German government to authorise CCS in the seabed or on land and to develop a carbon management strategy.

Now the German government is following suit and paving the way for establishing a technology that has long been controversial.

Below, we outline the main aspects of the key issues paper and present the legal framework which companies now have to prepare for.

1.

Areas of application of CCS and CCU The key issues paper makes it clear that avoiding emissions remains the overarching goal.

CCS and CCU are to be used as tools to reducing CO 2 when it is difficult or impossible to avoid emissions in any other way.

The areas of focus mentioned here are the cement and lime, basic chemicals and waste incineration industries.

Obviously, CCS and CCU capacity will remain scarce even after the expansion now planned.

However, this focus is unlikely to be seen as a ban on reducing other emissions (with the exception of emissions from coal-fired power plants) using CCS and CCU.

We can therefore expect fierce competition for the capacity that will be available in the future.

As part of an open-technology transition to a climate-neutral electricity system, the plan is to enable the use of CCS and CCU for electricity generation plants as well, using gaseous energy sources and biomass.

Operators of gas-fired power plants are therefore also likely to try to reduce their emissions by using CCU and CCS.

However, the coal phase-out remains in place; access to CO 2 pipelines is not permitted for emissions from coal-fired power plants.

To remove the current obstacles to using CCS and CCU in Germany, the German Carbon Dioxide Storage Act ( Kohlendioxid-Speicherungsgesetz ), which currently only provides for the testing and demonstration of the permanent storage of carbon dioxide in underground rock strata, will have to be amended.

The bill now authorises carbon dioxide storage facilities in the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf.

2. Subsidies for CCS and CCU An incentive to use CCS and CCU is to be created by the CO 2 price itself, namely if the use of the technology is cheaper than the emission allowances that would otherwise have to be purchased.

However, the German federal government currently assumes that this incentive is not yet sufficiently available.

The plan is therefore to introduce a funding module for CCS/CCU in the Federal Funding Guidance for Industry and Climate Protection in which the focus of government funding will be on emissions that are difficult or impossible to avoid."
Noerr,Green light for CCS and CCU – German federal government presents key issues paper,"This clearly shows the balancing act that the federal government faces: on the one hand, it wants to enable carbon dioxide storage in order to achieve climate neutrality; on the other hand, it wants to avoid the effect of diminishing efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions.

By excluding access to CCS or CCU for emissions from coal-fired power plants, the federal government makes it clear that the approval of CCS and CCU will not result in an extension of the lignite and hard coal era.

However, it is noteworthy that conventional gas-fired power plants and biomass plants are to be expressly approved, even though funding for natural gas is excluded.

This is meant to reflect the intended role of gas-fired power plants as a bridging technology, but nevertheless runs the risk of making the operation of gas-fired power plants even more attractive and thus slowing down the transition to green energy.

It appears that the exclusion of funding for natural gas is intended to combat this undesirable effect.

This makes it clear that the storage or reutilisation of captured CO 2 is not intended to weaken efforts to avoid emissions, but to complement them.

At the same time, particularly emissions-intensive industrial sectors which have no other option for reducing emissions are to be given long-term prospects for keeping their business located in Germany.

3. Transport infrastructure for CO 2

In addition to building the CCS/CCU plants themselves, building CO 2 pipelines is very important.

These pipelines will transport the captured CO 2 as effectively as possible from the emission source directly to the CCS/CCU facility.

This opens up new fields of activity for grid operators.

To start building privately owned CO 2 pipelines within a state regulatory framework, the German Carbon Dioxide Storage Act ( Kohlendioxid-Speicherungsgesetz ) is intended to be rapidly updated to reflect the proposals made by the German government in the analysis report from late 2022, thereby eliminating legal uncertainties in the application of the law.

To date, missing and outdated references to the German Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz ) have prevented a successful planning approval procedure.

As other EU countries are already more advanced in installing CCS plants, another aim is to export CO 2 .

The necessary infrastructure will also have to be built, thus opening up opportunities for grid operators to collaborate with operators of foreign CCS plants.

To this end, the amendment to the London Protocol to enable the export of CO 2 for offshore storage is to be ratified and the necessary changes made to the German High Seas Contribution Act ( Hohe-See-Einbringungsgesetz ).

4. CO 2 storage The exploration of offshore storage sites in the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or the continental shelf will be enabled by law.

If a location proves suitable, taking into account safety standards and environmental criteria, corresponding storage facilities can be developed for industrial use.

However, carbon dioxide is not permitted to be injected into marine protected areas.

This means the area that could theoretically come into consideration covers around 57% of the German North Sea area and around 49% of the German Baltic Sea area.

As marine areas are also required for the large-scale expansion of offshore wind power, CCS infrastructure will be integrated into comprehensive marine spatial planning.

This could be done in such a way that suitable areas identified through exploration are then designated as CCS areas in marine spatial planning.

Approval of CCS facilities is likely to be granted as part of a planning approval procedure including an environmental impact assessment.

The permanent storage of CO 2 in the geological subsurface of the German mainland is still not permitted."
Noerr,Green light for CCS and CCU – German federal government presents key issues paper,"The permanent storage of CO 2 in the geological subsurface of the German mainland is still not permitted.

As a result, the aforementioned transport infrastructure for CO 2 must be built from the industrial regions to the coast, which raises the question of efficient implementation given the considerable logistical effort and expense involved.

The federal government has signalled its willingness to create a legal basis in the German Carbon Dioxide Storage Act ( Kohlendioxid-Speicherungsgesetz ) that would allow individual federal states to opt into onshore storage upon request.

However, it remains to be seen whether individual federal states will take the lead here – there is no information on this to date.

In view of the public debates over recent years, it seems fairly unlikely anything will change fundamentally in the foreseeable future.

5.

Summary and outlook Overall, it remains to be seen what restrictions the legislative process will place on the use of CCS and CCU.

The environmental requirements and the inclusion of gas-fired power plants in particular are likely to be controversial.

As regards the construction of CO 2 pipelines, operators of gas grids will closely observe the planning approval procedure including the planned environmental impact assessment.

Operators of gas-fired power plants are likely to be interested in connecting to CO 2 pipelines and thus to CCU plants, despite the lack of subsidies.

As regards the industries specifically mentioned, in which emissions are difficult or impossible to avoid (lime and cement production, waste management, basic chemicals), the specific terms of the subsidies will be decisive.

As for other, non-subsidised industries, whether the use of CCS/CCU makes economic sense will depend on the development of the CO 2 price in relation to the costs of CCS/CCU technology and the expansion of capacity."
Noerr,Update Commercial 2024,"With the Noerr Commercial Update for 2024 our team is pleased to present you with the most significant recent developments in commercial law.

The year 2023 saw not only legislative initiatives at the European and German levels such as the planned Late Payment Directive, but also numerous judgements that will have a strong impact on contract drafting.

They deal with topics such as insolvency-based rescission clauses, including place of jurisdiction clauses via hyperlink, subsequent exclusion of the UN CISG and no-fault B2B vendor liability.

In addition, digital consumer protection law is becoming more and more complex.

Compulsory consumer rights such as the right to withdraw from a contract, wide-ranging notification and transparency duties and detailed requirements for general terms and conditions are posing growing challenges for companies.

Breaches of statutory requirements can result in not only the loss of rights and collective actions (e.g. representative actions) but also stiff penalties.

Despite progress in implementing new distribution models, many manufacturers and importers continue to rely on the established networks of authorised dealers and service partners.

However, differences of opinion can arise between the companies and some of their dealers in regard to framework conditions such as setting margins and bonus schemes.

Similar conflict potential also exists when sales and distribution partners leave following the termination with due notice of their dealership or service partner contracts.

These “classics” in dealership law were once again in the spotlight of higher-court case law in 2023 and promise to have significant impact in the future.

In 2023, as many as three judgments related to franchise law were handed down.

The Munich Higher Regional Court (OLG München) considered the issue of whether a fast-food restaurant franchisee’s heiress had to allow card payments in the restaurants.

The ruling addressed the effectiveness of system adjustment clauses in franchise contracts.

The Berlin Higher Regional Court (KG Berlin) ruled on the validity of an agreement on jurisdiction with a franchisee who was a new entrepreneur.

A ruling by Darmstadt Regional Court (LG Darmstadt) focused on a mediation clause in a franchise agreement.

In rulings regarding factoring, the courts considered the admissibility of no-fault guarantees of the validity of receivables and clarified that a factoring client’s duties under section 402 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) in the event of debtor insolvency do not form the basis for attributing the client’s knowledge to the factor in analogous application of section 166 of the German Civil Code.

Unrelated to factoring, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled on standard-form assignment clauses.

Our Noerr Commercial Update 2024 will provide you with a comprehensive overview of these and other topics, including the latest developments in competition law regarding sales and distribution, commercial agency law and the law related to logistics.

Noerr,Judgment of the Cologne Administrative Court of 17 November 2023 – BNetzA Acted Unlawfully by Naming Company in Press Release,"I. Introduction The German Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur , BNetzA ) is not permitted to publish press releases with details of the fines imposed and the names of the companies concerned.

In the view of the Cologne Administrative Court, there is no legal basis that would allow for the public disclosure of the fines imposed in this area in contrast to competition law.

The decision is highly relevant in practice as well as for other legal and regulatory areas in which the supervisory authorities are very active in their public relations work, such as data protection.

II.

Background The claimant is engaged in telemarketing and operates several call centres.

The defendant is the German Federal Network Agency (the “BNetzA”).

The defendant initiated administrative proceedings against the claimant for suspected unauthorised telephone advertising and subsequently issued an administrative notice imposing a fine based on section 130(1) of the German Administrative Offences Act ( Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz, OWiG) and sections 20(1)

no. 1 and 7(2) no.2 of the German Unfair Competition Act ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb, UWG (old version)).

Sections 7(1) and 7(2)(2) of the Unfair Competition Act prohibit commercial practices that constitute an unacceptable nuisance to a market participant, which can be assumed to be the case in particular when it comes to unsolicited advertising.

The defendant intended to publish a press release naming the claimant in connection with the imposition of the fine.

It justified this by stating that “the fine imposed should not only serve a repressive and admonishing function, but also have a general and specific deterrent effect” (Cologne Administrative Court, GRUR-RS 2023, 34957, para.

5).

Besides relying on section 130(1) of the Administrative Offences Act in conjunction with sections 20(1)(1) and 7(2)(2) of the Unfair Competition Act, section 45n(8) of the German Telecommunications Act ( Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG (section 52(7), sent.

1 of the Telecommunications Act, new version)) and section 67(1), sent.

1 of the Telecommunications Act (section 123(1) of the Telecommunications Act, new version), the defendant relied on a 2014 competition law order by the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court, in which the court had decided that a press release may include a company’s name if the press’s right to information outweighs the company’s interest in confidentiality, which is founded on the right to corporate personality (Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court, NZKart 2015, 57, 58).

The company’s name was published on the BNetzA’s website and Twitter and disseminated through a mailing list to journalists.

Subsequently, the claimant requested the defendant to no avail to delete the press release and to give the claimant an undertaking that it would cease-and-desist from publication.

In the claimant’s view, it was entitled to an injunction based on section 1004(1), sent.

2 of the German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB ) by analogy with section 823(1) of the German Civil Code in conjunction with Article 2(1) of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz, GG ) in conjunction with Articles 1(1), 5 and 12 of the Basic Law in conjunction with Article 19(3) of the Basic Law.

The claimant then applied to the Cologne Administrative Court for an interim injunction, but its application was refused (Cologne Administrative Court - 1 L 166/21).

On appeal to the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine Westphalia, the claimant obtained a temporary order prohibiting the defendant from disseminating the press release via its website (Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine Westphalia – 13 B 331/21).

In the court’s view, the press release had caused the defendant immense reputational damage that could cost it millions in turnover.

The claimant subsequently brought an action before the Cologne Administrative Court.

III."
Noerr,Judgment of the Cologne Administrative Court of 17 November 2023 – BNetzA Acted Unlawfully by Naming Company in Press Release,"The claimant subsequently brought an action before the Cologne Administrative Court.

III.

The Cologne Administrative Court’s legal analysis The Cologne Administrative Court ruled that the claimant was entitled to the injunctive relief sought against the defendant due to the defendant’s unlawful publication of the information about the claimant on the defendant’s website.

In the court’s opinion, the very fact of the unlawful publication meant it could be assumed that there was a risk of the offence being repeated, which is what section 1004(1), sent.

2 of the Civil Code requires for the grant of relief (Cologne Administrative Court, GRUR-RS 2023, 34957, para.

33).

The court ruled that the BNetzA had unlawfully encroached on the claimant’s freedom to exercise its occupation in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Basic Law in conjunction with Article 19(3) of the Basic Law.

On the other hand, a simultaneous breach of the claimant’s corporate right of personality (Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law) could be excluded.

The court reasoned that section 45n(8), sent.

1 of the Telecommunications Act did not provide a legal basis for the publication in the present case because the publication of information is conditional on “the information provided, such as that in section 45n(1) to (7) of the Telecommunications Act, ensuring that end-users have all the information necessary for choosing a public telecommunications network or a publicly accessible communications service.”

(Cologne Administrative Court, GRUR-RS 2023, 34957, para.

52).

The court added that the operator of a call centre is neither a public telecommunications network nor a public communications service within the meaning of this provision.

Furthermore, publishing offences punishable by a fine is not part of the purpose of section 45n of the Telecommunications Act.

The court pointed out that the revised version of section 45n(8), sent.

1 of the Telecommunications Act (section 52(7), sent.

1 of the Telecommunications Act, new version) does not alter the situation either since the wording of the provisions are fundamentally the same.

In the court’s opinion the defendant’s right to issue orders and take measures under section 67(1) sentence 1 of the Telecommunications Act, old version (section 123(1) of the Telecommunications Act, new version) was also not a sufficient legal basis for the press release.

The defendant had exercised its discretion incorrectly because the fine imposed justified the expectation that the claimant would refrain from future misconduct.

The court stated that if there are indications suggesting that future infringements are likely, the information provided must also relate to this potential misconduct.

Alternatively, if there is a concrete risk to consumers, the BNetzA must employ supervisory measures to mitigate this risk.

The court explained that section of 53(5) of the Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen, GWB ), which is the basis for competition authorities publishing violations of competition law, cannot be used as a legal basis for publication in the present case because of the interference by the public authorities (in the claimant’s constitutional rights) and the associated requirement that express statutory authorisation is needed to justify such interference.

Similarly, the court did not consider section 20(3) of the Unfair Competition Act (old version) a suitable legal basis for publishing the press release on the violation because the press release was part of the public authority’s general public relations work and therefore required its own legal basis.

IV.

Conclusion and outlook The aim of the BNetzA’s publication was to provide information about the fine imposed.

Section 123(1) of the Telecommunications Act (section 67(1), sent."
Noerr,Judgment of the Cologne Administrative Court of 17 November 2023 – BNetzA Acted Unlawfully by Naming Company in Press Release,"IV.

Conclusion and outlook The aim of the BNetzA’s publication was to provide information about the fine imposed.

Section 123(1) of the Telecommunications Act (section 67(1), sent.

1 of the Telecommunications Act, old version) is in principle a suitable legal basis for issuing public warnings.

However, the BNetzA’s publication of the mere occurrence of a violation together with the company’s name was no longer within the provision’s scope of application.

It is not possible to expand public authorities’ powers by relying on the legal basis available under competition law in section 53(5) of the Act against Restraints of Competition because the principle of reservation of legislative power requires measures by public authorities that interfere with individual rights to have a legal basis.

The decision shows that the supervisory authorities’ approach in practice is not necessarily lawful (“naming and shaming”).

For example, although the General Data Protection Regulation contains no express legal basis for this, it is also common practice to publish media-effective fines for data protection violations and to name the controller (Article 58(3)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation is sometimes used as justification).

It should be highlighted that publication of information about violations is not only an interference with fundamental rights that requires justification but can also cause irreparable harm to companies.

For these reasons, publication must be subject to the proportionality principle.

Otherwise, the supervisory authorities could be hit with hefty damages claims."
Noerr,Russian courts target Russian subsidiaries of Western companies when enforcing debts,"Russian courts are currently devising new ways to seize Russian-located assets of Western companies engaged in disputes with Russian claimants.

Shares in Russian subsidiaries of Western companies may be seized even when they are held by foreign entities of the group not related to the dispute.

In a recent judgment dated 20 February 2024 in the case of Ruschemalliance v Linde (Case No. А56-129797/2022), the Arbitrazh Court of Saint Petersburg not only granted a claim brought by Ruschemalliance against Linde GmbH and Linde PLC for recovery of some €750 million for an advance payment and damages under an EPC contract and a related surety agreement between the parties, but also held two non-Russian subsidiaries of the Linde Group (Linde UK Holdings No. 2 and Commercium Immobilien) jointly liable for this debt.

Real estate Commercium Immobilien holds shares in the Russian subsidiaries of the Linde Group.

This was done to allow Ruschemalliance to enforce its claims against the shares in the Russian subsidiaries of the Linde Group, despite the fact that these shares are not held by the actual Linde defendants in the dispute.

To justify the liability of Linde UK Holdings No. 2 and Commercium Immobilien, the Russian court treated them as co-tortfeasors in a tort (i.e. non-contractual claim) of Ruschemalliance.

According to the judgment, these companies allegedly unlawfully contributed to causing harm to Ruschemalliance by the mere fact that they: are controlled by Linde PLC hold the Russian assets of the Linde Group, and failed to voluntarily pay Ruschemalliance’s claim against Linde GmbH and Linde PLC although they were obliged to do so based on the principle of good faith.

In simple terms, the Russian court decided to treat the Russian assets of the Linde Group as the assets of Linde PLC to allow enforcement over Linde PLC’s debts.

Previously, in the case of Russian Railways v Siemens (Case No. А40- 195006/2022) the Russian courts obliged not only Russian Railway’s contractor (Siemens AG), but also Siemens AG’s Russian subsidiary to perform a service contract with Russian Railways, although it was not a party to the service contract.

The above development of Russian case law shows that Russian assets of Western companies (in particular their Russian subsidiaries) are at risk and may be seized in Russia irrespective of the structure used for holding such assets."
Noerr,The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and its Significance for the Financial Sector,"Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector (Digital Operational Resilience Act , “ DORA ”) significantly tightens the requirements for financial entities in dealing with information and communications technology (“ ICT” ) risks and at the same time creates an entirely new supervisory framework for ICT service providers.

Probably the most significant innovation relates to the future supervision of critical ICT service providers by the European supervisory authorities.

DORA will therefore have an enormous practical impact beyond the financial sector in the strict sense.

The regulation entered into force on 16 January 2023 through publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will apply from 17 January 2025.

Addressees and Regulatory Content

This article is the first in a series in which the specific areas regulated by DORA and their significance for the financial sector will be explored in detail over the coming months.

We will focus primarily on topics such as managing third-party risks, negotiating contracts for outsourcing to third-party ICT service providers, testing procedures, IT governance and risk management as well as the supervision of critical ICT service providers.

To start off, this newsletter considers (i) DORA’s scope of application, including its addressees, and (ii) DORA’s key substantive provisions.

Background DORA is based on a package of measures for the digitalisation of the European financial sector adopted by the European Commission in September 2020 (Link) .

The background to this is essentially the realisation that the increased use of ICT in the financial sector gives rise to additional risks for the market participants.

These result, for example, from cyber attacks, ICT disruptions or dependence on (external) ICT service providers.

Consequently, DORA aims to strengthen the operational resilience of the European financial sector, thereby promoting the protection of financial entities and their customers and, ultimately, the financial system as a whole, from ICT risks.

DORA aims to harmonise the largely inconsistent national and European legal frameworks for dealing with ICT risks.

At the national level, various sector-specific regulatory provisions have applied so far to regulated insurance and financial companies, such as the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, “ BaFin ” ) circulars on information technology requirements for credit institutions (Supervisory Requirements for IT in Financial Institutions, Bankaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT, BAIT) or insurance companies (Supervisory Requirements for IT in the Insurance Sector, Versicherungsaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT, VAIT).

DORA establishes uniform requirements for the entire financial sector.

In addition, DORA is intended to harmonise the highly fragmented regulatory requirements at the European level in order to promote a functioning internal market while also establishing a single supervisory framework for ICT third-party service providers.

Scope of application DORA’s requirements essentially apply to all supervised institutions and entities across the financial sector (known as “financial entities”) and to companies that provide ICT services for companies in the financial sector (known as “ICT third-party service providers”)."
Noerr,The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and its Significance for the Financial Sector,"For the purposes of DORA, “financial entities” are credit institutions, payment and e-money institutions, investment firms, capital management companies and insurance/reinsurance companies, but also include account information service providers (AISPs), providers of crypto services within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, MiCAR), rating agencies, crowdfunding service providers, insurance and reinsurance intermediaries and institutions for occupational retirement provision (Article 2(1)(a) to (t) of DORA).

DORA defines “ICT third-party service providers” as undertakings providing ICT services (Article 2(19) of DORA).

This includes digital services and data services provided through ICT systems to one or more internal or external users ( i.e. financial entities) on an ongoing basis, including hardware as a service and hardware services ( cf .

Article 2(21) of DORA).

This means that unregulated third-party service providers, e.g. of cloud services, software, data analysis services or data centres, also fall within the scope of DORA.

In Germany, ICT third-party service providers, as far as they qualify as outsourcing companies, are already subject to limited regulation and the supervisory powers of BaFin.

In addition, at the EU level ICT third-party service providers that are classified as critical will now be under the direct oversight of the European Supervisory Authorities (the “ ESAs ”) (see below).

The DORA requirements will be applied in accordance with the principle of proportionality, taking into account the size and overall risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scope and complexity of its services, activities and operations (see Article 4 of DORA).

Various exemptions from DORA’s scope of application apply to “very small enterprises” ( i.e. financial entities that employ fewer than ten persons and whose annual turnover and/or balance sheet total does not exceed EUR 2 million).

Significant changes introduced by DORA DORA focuses on IT governance and risk management in financial entities and on requirements for outsourcing to ICT third-party service providers.

Financial entities are to create internal structures that limit ICT risks and risks arising from the provision of services by ICT third-party service providers.

This results in the following requirements in particular: ICT risk management (Chapter II of DORA) :

Financial entities’ risk management must cover ICT risks.

Under DORA, financial entities are required to establish an internal governance and control framework that enables an effective and prudent management of ICT risk.

This must be continuously monitored and updated if necessary.

These tasks fall primarily to the governing body, which has overall responsibility for managing ICT risks and ensuring the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data through policies that are periodically reviewed.

The management body must fulfil logging obligations and take preventive measures.

From a German perspective, the requirements for ICT risk management are not entirely new in view of the administrative practices that BaFin already adopts.

Nevertheless, DORA now establishes more specific requirements, which are also elevated to the status of an official law.

Notification of ICT-related incidents (Chapter III of DORA) :

Financial entities are obliged to classify ICT-related incidents according to predefined criteria.

An ICT-related incident is an event or series of linked events unplanned by the financial entity that compromises the security of the network and information systems, and has an adverse impact on the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data or on the services provided by the financial entity (see Article 3(8) of DORA).

In addition, major ICT-related incidents must be reported to the competent authority."
Noerr,The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and its Significance for the Financial Sector,"In addition, major ICT-related incidents must be reported to the competent authority.

Moreover, financial entities may, on a voluntary basis, notify cyber threats to the competent supervisory authority.

Financial entities must establish processes to monitor and document ICT-related incidents.

DORA thus goes beyond the sector-specific reporting obligations that have so far only existed in certain areas, for example, regarding serious security incidents pursuant to Section 54(1), sentence 1 of the German Payment Services Supervision Act ( Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz ).

Digital operational resilience testing (Chapter IV DORA) :

In order to avoid ICT-related incidents, financial entities are required to test their digital operational resilience and make such tests a core component of their ICT risk management strategy.

If they fulfil the DORA requirements, external service providers may also be entrusted with conducting such tests.

The tests must be carried out taking into account the size and the business and risk profile of the respective financial entity.

In the future, systemically important institutions will have to carry out what is known as Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT) at least every three years.

Thus, DORA complies with existing testing requirements as set forth, for example, in the Supervisory Requirements for IT in the Insurance Sector (VAIT) and the Supervisory Requirements for IT in Financial Institutions (BAIT).

What is new, however, is the incorporation of such rules in a European regulation.

BaFin has already announced that it will compare the existing obligations with those under DORA and publish a notification dealing with this.

Management of ICT third-party risk (Chapter V, Section I of DORA) :

Furthermore, DORA provides for additional requirements for managing ICT third-party risk, such as the obligation to maintain a register of information in relation to all contractual agreements on the use of ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers.

DORA also establishes minimum requirements for the main content of outsourcing contracts between the financial entity and the ICT third-party service provider.

This content includes a description of the contracted or subcontracted functions, the obligation to notify the financial entity in the event of an ICT incident, termination rights, reporting obligations and the right of the financial entity to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the ICT third-party service provider.

In this way, DORA builds on the existing sector-specific requirements for outsourcing by regulated institutions (such as the European Banking Authority’s guidelines on outsourcing, the BaFin circular on Minimum Requirements for Risk Management ( Mindestanforderungen an das Risikomangement , MaRisk), the Supervisory Requirements for IT in the Insurance Sector (VAIT) and the Supervisory Requirements for IT in Financial Institutions (BAIT)).

Although the DORA requirements are largely in line with the existing minimum requirements for outsourcing contracts in sector-specific provisions, DORA does add to and clarify the applicable framework.

One example of this is the obligation under DORA to maintain an independent control function for managing and monitoring ICT risks.

Oversight framework of critical ICT third-party service providers (Chapter V, Section II of DORA) :

Finally, DORA introduces “overseeing” of what are known as critical ICT third-party service providers by the ESAs, which is a significant innovation.

The ESAs decide on whether an ICT third-party service provider qualifies as “critical” on the basis of a list of criteria (see Article 32(2) of DORA).

Unlike in the case of full supervision, “overseen” critical ICT third-party service providers do not require a permit from the financial supervisory authorities."
Noerr,The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and its Significance for the Financial Sector,"Unlike in the case of full supervision, “overseen” critical ICT third-party service providers do not require a permit from the financial supervisory authorities.

At the same time, oversight is limited to the sub-area of managing ICT risks for financial entities that may emanate from a critical ICT third-party service provider.

The ESAs’ powers also go well beyond BaFin’s existing sector-specific powers of intervention in relation to outsourcing companies.

Conclusion Given the pace of digitalisation and the associated challenges it presents in the ICT sector, DORA will in practice be a highly significant addition to the current regulatory framework.

By harmonising the currently non-uniform regulations in the EU Member States, DORA will bring us one step closer towards the goal of creating a level playing field in the EU.

Entities that may be impacted by DORA should carefully assess early on if and to what degree they will be affected by the new rules, as well as what requirements will be imposed on them in the future.

In addition, financial entities and third-party ICT service providers must take timely measures to implement the requirements of DORA within their organisations.

Noerr,13th sanctions package against Russia: Third countries and drones,"On 23 February 2024, the EU adopted its 13th package of sanctions against Russia (Implementation by Regulations (EU) 2024/745 and 2024/753 amending Regulations (EU) No 833/2014 and No 269/2014 respectively). 

This follows on from the previous package fairly quickly after just under two months, meaning that the key goods-related sanctions came into force on the second anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2024.

Essentially, the changes to the EU sanctions regime are limited to expanding the lists of sanctioned goods and individuals.

194 new listings of individuals and entities The 13th sanctions package adds another 194 individual designations, including 106 natural persons and 88 entities, to the EU’s sanctions regime against Russia.

This means that over 2,000 individuals and entities are now covered by the measures.

The new listings relate in particular to the military and defence sector, from which over 140 persons with links to the defence equipment manufacturing have been added.

The areas affected include missiles, drones, air defence systems and high-tech components for weapons.

In addition, the increasingly widely known support for Russia from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was explicitly addressed for the first time by listing Russian logistics specialists, the North Korean defence minister and Belarusian supporters.

Other individuals listed are those involved in the administration of the occupied Ukrainian territories or the resettlement of Ukrainian children.

Finally, in a rather symbolic move given the scale of the problem, three Russian players were listed in connection with circumvention transactions.

Product-related and industry sanctions expanded The recent expansion of goods-related sanctions mainly affects companies involved in the procurement of drones and introduces some industry sanctions in this area.

There are 27 new entries in Annex IV of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, which lists companies from, or with links to, the Russian military-industrial complex.

These once again include companies from third countries, including for the first time three companies from mainland China.

Companies registered in India, Kazakhstan, Serbia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey have also been included for the first time.

In addition, the list of goods and technologies that could help strengthen the military and technological situation in Russia or contribute to the development of the defence and security sector has been supplemented by adding components for the development and manufacture of drones:

Annex VII Part B, to which the prohibitions in Article 2a(1) and 2b(1) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 refer, now includes aluminium electrolytic capacitors of sub-heading 8532 22 HS.

Annex XXIII now covers item 8504 HS (“Electrical transformers, electrical power converters (e.g. rectifiers) and inductors and other self-induction coils”) as a whole.

For the new sub-headings covered by this, the execution of old contracts dating from before 24 February 2024 and related ancillary contracts is exempted by Article 3k(3ac) from the prohibition under Article 3k(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 up to 25 May 2024.

New partner country; extended list of high priority sanctioned items Finally, the United Kingdom has been added to the list of partner countries for iron and steel imports in Annex XXXVI.

This means that proof is no longer required for imports of iron and steel products from the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 3g(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

Alongside this, on 22 February 2024 the EU Commission added five entries to the Common List of High Priority Sanctioned Items (List of common high priority items, available at https://finance.ec.europa.eu/document/download/5a2494db-d874-4e2b-bf2a-ec5a191d2dc0_en?filename=list-common-high-priority-items_en.pdf )."

Noerr,Data privacy pitfall: Cookie banners must allow a genuine choice,"Cologne Higher Regional Court ( OLG Köln ) clarified in a judgment in January 2024 ( 6 U 80/23 ( available in German only )) that cookie banners must be designed fairly and consumers given a real choice as to whether they wish to accept cookies or not.

The case was brought by a consumer protection organisation.

It successfully demanded that the first display on a cookie banner provide the option of accepting or rejecting cookies.

It also successfully objected to a design with an X placed next to the words “ Accept and close” .

Background The defendant in the proceedings was a website provider that installed technically unnecessary cookies on its website and used a cookie banner to obtain consent for that purpose.

This was what it looked like on the first page: Cologne Higher Regional Court upheld the claimant’s argument that the design of the defendant’s cookie banner did not meet the requirements of data privacy law.

The court explained that cookie banners could generally be appropriate for obtaining consent to the use of cookies under data privacy law.

These banners may be necessary if a cookie (or similar technology) is not strictly necessary for providing a telemedia such as an app or website, the court added.

Legal classification The court found that the defendant’s cookie banner did not meet the statutory requirements – in this case the GDPR and the German Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act.

The defendant had used an unclear design for its cookie banners, according to the court.

Simply having a choice of either “ Accept” or “ Settings” was not a real choice within the meaning of the data privacy requirements for giving informed consent, it said.

According to the court, the specific design did not give data subjects an equivalent option to reject cookies; instead, they were being directed to give their consent and prevented from rejecting the cookies.

The consent given therefore could not be regarded as voluntary and sufficiently informed.

The court stated that data subjects could give their consent at the first level of the cookie banner, but if they wished to decline, they were redirected to the second level.

In addition, the “ Accept” button was displayed in eye-catching blue, while the word “ Settings” (for rejecting cookies) was grey.

Furthermore, also at the second level consent was highlighted in colour and in the same design, while cookie rejection had to be activated manually (cookie opt-out).

In addition, an X was positioned in the top right-hand corner next to “ Accept and save” , giving the impression that consent could be refused, the court said.

Therefore, the design of the cookie banner with the linked button labelled “ Accept & close X” in the top right-hand corner also breached the principles of transparency and the voluntary nature of consent, the court said.

Summary and practical implications The court’s ruling emphasises that website operators are not allowed to design consent declarations in such a way that users are influenced into making a decision that is disadvantageous to them (known as dark patterns).

The cookie banners often used by companies in practice make it harder for data subjects to reject online tracking in most cases.

Although companies are basically free to choose how to design their own cookie banners, the options displayed must be able to be selected in an equal manner.

The Bavarian Data Protection Office launched a campaign ( available in German only ) in December 2023 which is intended to run until May 2024 to review compliance with privacy requirements on websites and in apps.

The design of consent processes is the focus of this campaign.

This demonstrates that companies should review their cookie banners or cookie dashboards to see if they comply with the statutory requirements, the Bavarian regulator’s questionnaire and also the Guide for Telemedia Providers ( available in German only )."
Noerr,Data privacy pitfall: Cookie banners must allow a genuine choice,"If they fail to do so, companies will face the risk of actions for injunctions from consumer protection organisations, and of course the risk of fines and claims for damages."
Noerr,Russian Presidential Decree No 8 paves the way for expropriation,"Companies with assets in Russia now face new problems since Presidential Decree No 8 was issued on 3 January 2024.

The decree removes certain frozen assets of foreign companies located in Russia from enforcement by private third parties and is therefore apparently intended to prepare for the state confiscation of these assets.

This expropriation raises the question of whether compensation can be obtained from the Russian state by using the instrument of investment protection in international arbitration tribunals.

There is some evidence that it can.

Backdrop:

The European Union’s 12th sanctions package In its 12th sanctions package against the Russian Federation, the European Union for the first time allowed for the option of confiscating the locked financial assets of Russian legal entities or individuals.

Such confiscation could be carried out, for example, with the aim of making compensation payments to European companies whose Russian property has passed into the possession of the Russian Federation or Russian companies.

Presidential Decree No 8 enables confiscation of frozen assets The Russian Federation responded to the new EU sanctions package with various measures including Presidential Decree No 8.

Assets that are frozen in the Russian Federation are also intended to be made accessible to the state.

The assets in question are primarily securities and funds belonging to foreign counterparties from “hostile countries” which are frozen in “type C” accounts in the Russian Federation.

The new Presidential Decree No 8 therefore states: “ Enforcement based on writs of execution, the imposition of an attachment and other provisional measures may not be applied to the funds and securities held in a type C account. ”

The decree is thus aimed at keeping funds and securities located in type C accounts with a view to possible future confiscation by the state.

Up to now, the frozen funds and securities in type C accounts could be exploited in enforcement proceedings by Russian private companies wanting to enforce their claims in Russia.

No compensation is envisaged for confiscated assets held in type C accounts.

In this situation, closer scrutiny of investment protection under a bilateral investment protection treaty is advisable.

Owners of the confiscated assets could, for example, have a claim for damages due to expropriation under Article 4 of the German-Soviet Investment Protection Treaty.

This claim will have to be filed in international arbitration courts, i.e. courts which are independent of the Russian state. 

This is a system that has been successful in numerous arbitration proceedings in the past, especially against Russia and hence has proven to be an effective tool."
Noerr,Complex compliance: Companies face challenges of Russia sanctions,"On 24 February 2024, it is two years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

On that day, the EU is expected to issue its thirteenth package of sanctions.

Against this backdrop, we take a critical look at what the sanctions have achieved.

The Russia sanctions lack both a long-term plan and flexibility.

Accordingly, the collateral damage to EU companies is significant.

The EU would be well advised to learn the lessons of the last two years and reach a consensus that bridges Member States’ special interests and eliminates the contradictions and conflicting aims in the sanctions.

Asymmetry and special interests On the one hand, twelve packages of sanctions have placed financial sanctions on over 1,900 Russian individuals and companies, frozen their assets in the EU, and prohibited any transactions with them.

On the other hand, sectors of the EU’s trade with Russia have been incrementally sanctioned by prohibiting exports and imports of goods as well as the provision of services.

Taken together, these measures seem to amount to a total embargo of Russia.

EU sanctions aim to have an asymmetrical effect, i.e. to hurt the Russian economy more than the EU’s.

It is doubtful whether this aim has always been achieved.

For one thing, sectors that could provide significant leverage against Russia – e.g. the nuclear industry, the real estate sector and, for a long time, the diamond trade – have remained untouched.

One of the reasons for this is special interests of certain Member States.

Because each Member State has a de-facto veto power, it has been impossible to place sanctions on important sources of Russia’s income, and this has seriously undermined the effectiveness of the sanctions.

For example, Hungary was able to obtain an exception for a nuclear power plant that is to be built by Rosatom.

Similarly, due to Belgium’s efforts, trade in Russian diamonds went untouched for a long time although it would have had a disproportionally strong impact on Russia.

It also seems questionable that Russian citizens are not permitted to have deposits of more than EUR 100,000 at any EU financial institution, but are basically free to invest large amounts in European real estate.

On the other hand, substantial bureaucratic requirements and indirect detrimental effects of the sanctions place a heavy burden on European companies.

It is doubtful whether the EU has been or is completely aware of the serious consequences for companies of all sizes.

Notable examples include documentation obligations in the iron and steel industry and the requirement under the twelfth package of sanctions to include a “No-Russia clause”.

This means that for certain exports to non-EU countries, EU companies must contractually prohibit the re-exportation to Russia or for use there.

This causes significant administrative work and expense for the companies, as such clauses must typically be added to hundreds of existing contracts.

It remains at least questionable whether this requirement can really prevent sanctions circumvention and transfers to Russia, especially in light of the fact that many clauses frequently used in foreign trade contracts already contain obligate parties to comply with EU sanctions.

In general, it can be observed that the efforts to enforce sanctions significantly lengthen the list of companies’ due diligence obligations and place a large chunk of the administrative burden on the companies.

These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that compromises on new sanctions packages are often reached at the last minute.

This has resulted in deadlines for licenses, for example for withdrawing from Russia, not being extended until two weeks before they expired.

One possible argument for this is that it increases the pressure on EU companies to withdraw.

However, given how complex exits from Russia already are, companies’ legal departments would rightly frown upon this argument."
Noerr,Complex compliance: Companies face challenges of Russia sanctions,"However, given how complex exits from Russia already are, companies’ legal departments would rightly frown upon this argument.

Lack of flexibility and guidelines for companies The sanctions inadequately reflect the complexity of economic reality, as they often prove to be too rigid and sweeping.

Welcome changes for companies would be additional licensing options and faster assistance.

After all, companies are required to comply with new measures immediately.

The EU Commission and the German federal government routinely issue FAQs to clarify specific questions.

While providing essential guidance, the FAQs are often not published until significant measures such as the “No-Russia clause” have long entered into force and companies have already been forced to act.

EU sanctions would better reflect the complex reality if they offered more room for specific licenses.

This would make it possible, for example, to diverge from prohibitions on a case-by-case basis.

A weighty argument against additional licensing options is based on mistrust among the Member States.

It is the Member States that are responsible for implementing the sanctions, and their authorities are responsible for issuing licenses.

This gives rise to the concern that some Member States could be lax for the benefit of their domestic economies.

On the other hand, some authorities have shown little flexibility and applied excessive standards.

The result has been that some activities that serve the purpose of the sanctions have been permitted too late or not at all.

One example of this is withdrawing capital and investments from Russia after missing the deadline for import into the EU by just a few days due to the complicated situation in Russia.

Compliance in stormy seas Considering how broad the EU sanctions have become, implementing them and preventing their circumvention is now increasingly gaining significance.

For example, several investigations by the German attorney general regarding embargo breaches have become public.

In Germany, two sanctions enforcement laws expanded investigatory powers as early as in May 2022.

But also at the EU level, consensus has been reached on criminalizing sanctions violations in all Member States.

In addition, sanctions regulations are increasingly being used to put pressure on non-EU countries that do not fall under the scope of applicability of the EU sanctions.

One example of this was listing citizens of Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

The EU has also created an “anti-circumvention tool”, a mechanism to prohibit certain exports to non-EU countries where a risk of diversion to Russia has been ascertained.

Although this mechanism has not yet been used, the EU seems to be heading towards extraterritorial sanctions, which claim applicability even beyond the traditional territorial scope of application of EU sanctions, for example to non-EU countries and their citizens.

Up to now, sanctions with extraterritorial effect have come primarily from the USA and have often been met with loud criticism from the EU.

The fact that the EU is now singing a similar tune only illustrates how difficult it is to counter sanctions circumvention and how effective secondary sanctions are.

The erratic course of the EU sanctions and their inconsistencies will continue to pose substantial challenges to companies.

EU companies are exposed to unprecedented regulatory uncertainty arising from legal uncertainty, a lack of interpretation aids and a lack of licensing options coupled with increasing investigatory pressure and efforts to expand the territorial scope of EU sanctions.

Companies therefore often resort to overcompliance with sanctions.

They miss out on potential room for manoeuvre for fear of a presumed sanctions breach and damage to their reputation.

This has given the EU sanctions a previously unknown influence over and impact on completely harmless areas."
Noerr,Complex compliance: Companies face challenges of Russia sanctions,"This has given the EU sanctions a previously unknown influence over and impact on completely harmless areas.

They have taken on a life of their own, and it remains to be seen how far this will carry them.

The only thing that is certain is that change in sanctions law will be a constant companion and that legal advice on it will remain crucial."
Noerr,Employee participation plans under the Future Financing Act (Zukunfts­finanzierungs­gesetz) – Important changes and practical implementation,"In mid-2021, the Fund Location Act ( Fondsstandortgesetz ) added to section 19a of the German Income Tax Act (Income Tax Act) ( Einkommensteuergesetz) a tax deferral provision for employee participation plans at small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) to counteract the “dry income issue” (a situation when shares that employees receive in their company are subject to (income/wage) tax at acquisition even though the employees have not yet received any liquid funds).

The initial purpose of the tax deferral, which targets German start-ups in particular, was to strengthen employees’ incentives by using real ownership (employee stock ownership plans – ESOPs), which are more valuable than the plans currently most often used to avoid the dry income issue, virtual stock ownership plans (VSOPs).

A mere 2.5 years after its introduction, the provision has now been substantially improved once again.

Under the Future Financing Act, its scope of applicability has been expanded and amended to reflect requirements in the venture capital environment.

Although some of the amendments do not measure up to the adjustments originally envisaged in the draft Future Financing Act , they will probably give ESOPs a long-awaited boost (see below under Part A).

Because ESOPs can lead to lower taxation of disbursements (dividends or exit proceeds) taxed as capital income (tax rate usually 25% plus solidarity surcharge and church tax where applicable), they offer a clear tax advantage over VSOPs, which are subject to the employee’s regular income tax (tax rate up to 45% plus solidarity surcharge and church tax where applicable) and social security tax up to the income threshold.

From a practical viewpoint, the question arises as to how ESOPs can be structured in a more advantageous manner in the future and whether and how existing VSOPs can be transformed into advantageous ESOPs (see Part B below for a summary of the challenges involved in practical implementation).

A. Changes brought about by the Future Financing Act To make ESOPs more attractive, the Future Financing Act includes the following changes that have been generally applicable since 1 January 2024:

The (annual) tax-free amount found in section 3, no. 39 of the Income Tax Act has been increased from EUR 1,440.00 to EUR 2,000.00.

However, a prerequisite for the tax-free amount is that the ESOP is made available to all employees who have been employed for more than one year.

This relegates the tax-free amount to a rather minor role in practice.

ESOPs can now (also) be offered by the shareholders (or founders/investors), which is a better fit with the structural reality of the PE/VC environment.

To profit from the tax deferral, an employer company must not exceed certain size thresholds, which have been significantly increased.

Now, companies are eligible if they (i) have fewer than 1,000 employees and (ii) do not exceed a balance sheet total of EUR 100 million or turnover of EUR 86 million.

It remains advisable to monitor the prerequisites for the time required to establish conformity with the threshold values, but these prerequisites have likewise been made more favourable.

The maximum age for a qualifying employer company at the time the participation is granted has been increased from 12 to 20 years.

The maximum duration of the tax deferral has been increased from 12 to 15 years.

This gives recipients of ESOPs more time before taxation.

However, the tax deferral still always ends prematurely in case of exit (or other liquidation of the participation) or upon termination.

A theoretical dry income event can still occur if 15 years have expired without an exit or termination; this can now be prevented by an additional tax deferral (“Extended Tax Deferral”) until the actual sale/liquidation.

However, this option requires the employer to irrevocably declare that it assumes unconditional liability for the income tax upon subsequent sale/liquidation."
Noerr,Employee participation plans under the Future Financing Act (Zukunfts­finanzierungs­gesetz) – Important changes and practical implementation,"However, this option requires the employer to irrevocably declare that it assumes unconditional liability for the income tax upon subsequent sale/liquidation.

Another new provision also impacts valuation advantages in “leaver” cases (end of the tax deferral due to termination).

As previously, if the tax deferral ends (see above), the maximum taxable amount is capped at the market value when the tax deferral began, i.e. when the ESOP was granted (“entry value cap”), but if the market value is lower at the end of the tax deferral, only the lower value is used for taxation (“lower current value cap”).

However, the remuneration actually paid to the “leaver” is now decisive instead of the lower current value cap (with the entry value cap continuing to apply).

This provision in particular privileges “bad leavers”, who usually have to assign their shares for an amount equal to the acquisition price or substantially lower than the market value.

B. Challenges in practical implementation I. Structuring goals under corporate and tax law Corporate and tax laws pose a few challenges that must be met in order to be eligible for the tax deferral now found in section 19a of the Income Tax Act and ensure that the proceeds from ESOPs are subject to more advantageous taxation as capital income: Due to corporate governance considerations and to ensure exit ability, existing shareholders (founders/investors) often do not want a number of micro-shareholdings in the employer company to be established.

The options for resolving this situation (vote pooling, trust agreements, sub-participation, pooling vehicles, alternative participation forms) should be considered on a case-by-case basis and vetted and/or structured according to compatibility with the tax deferral provision.

This applies in particular to structuring indirect ESOPs via pooling vehicles in the legal form of a limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) (possibly taking into account intermediate “warehouse companies”), but also specific structuring of alternative forms of participation such as profit participation rights.

ESOPs typically involve special reservations of consent, as well as the participants’ rights and obligations under the articles of association or shareholders’ agreements (vesting/bound share disposal/leaver rules; tag-/drag-along rights, etc.).

These contractual stipulations are usually included by the German fiscal courts to determine whether a participation offered to employees results in a special legal relationship (if so, preferential taxation of the proceeds in the holding phase or as capital income upon exiting) or (remains) a result of the employment (if so, taxation of the proceeds during the holding phase or upon exiting as employee compensation).

Consequently, the entire set of ESOP contracts is to be structured as tax-efficiently as possible, and the desired tax consequences are to be secured, possibly by procuring (payroll) tax rulings from the financial authorities or using tax insurance products (which can already be seen to exist on the market).

II.

Applicability to indirect participation structures Practical challenges are also inherent in indirect participation structures (as typically found in private equity situations).

In these situations, foreign or domestic partnerships that hold the shares in the company and do not have any operating assets under tax considerations (e.g. in the form of non-commercial GmbH & Co. KGs, also called “ESOP KGs”) are often interposed.

In such structures the employees participate in the ESOP KG as limited partners, and their shares are usually sold by a “warehouse company” or reacquired in the case of a leaver.

The warehouse company is usually held by the shareholders of the employing company."
Noerr,Employee participation plans under the Future Financing Act (Zukunfts­finanzierungs­gesetz) – Important changes and practical implementation,"The warehouse company is usually held by the shareholders of the employing company.

As regards taxation, particularly the following challenges result: A situation only falls under the scope of section 19a of the Income Tax Act if shares are granted by the company or its shareholders.

However, in the structure described above, the limited partners’ shares are transferred by the interposed warehouse company according to civil law.

If the structure in regard of taxes is solely asset administering (i.e. if not only the pooling vehicle but also the warehouse company is a non-commercial partnership), it can be argued that the shares in the employer company are to be attributed to the shareholders based on the proportionate attribution found in section 39 of the German Fiscal Code ( Abgabenordnung ) and that in terms of taxation, it was actually the shareholders that granted the shares.

If a structure regarding taxes is not (completely) asset-administering, the indirect shareholding position (possibly in combination with the proportionate attribution) could be invoked.

In certain situations, it could be advantageous to use a fiduciary solution in which the warehouse company merely holds its shares in the ESOP KG in trust for the employer company’s shareholders.

A similar issue arises with the deemed value in cases of leavers, where, during reacquisition of the participation as a result of termination, the reference value for (income) taxation is to be the amount actually paid to the employee by the employer instead of the common value.

It is questionable whether remuneration paid via the warehouse company can be classified as “remuneration granted by the employer” within the meaning of the second clause of the fourth sentence of section 19a(4) of the Income Tax Act because in that case there is no reference to the shareholders or group companies.

If necessary, trust structures can provide legal certainty in this situation as well.

In any case, it is advisable to ensure the viability of tax structures that arise when a legal entity is interposed (which involve not only the abovementioned issues but also questions in regard to issues such as general share realization concerning joining or leaving employees but also changes in the employer’s shareholders) by means of binding information or income tax information from the financial authorities or by a tax insurance solution.

III.

Significance of the employer’s liability declaration for the “Extended Tax Deferral” A requirement for an Extended Tax Deferral (see Part A above) is that the employer irrevocably assumes liability for the income tax.

The (income) tax is not assessed upon termination of the employment or after 15 years have expired, as is the case for an initial tax deferral, but rather not until the actual liquidation of the participation by the employee (usually in the context of a subsequent exit).

An Extended Tax Deferral will probably be particularly relevant when leavers are involved: Provisions in ESOPs regarding leavers usually provide for reacquisition of the shares by the employer or the shareholders (call option).

If the call option is exercised, the remuneration or severance payment paid to the employee is to be subject to (income) tax in consideration of the entry value cap.

If the call option is not exercised, the employer’s declaration of assumption of liability makes it possible to avoid immediate taxation in a leaver case.

It remains to be seen whether this liability declaration will become common practice because it subjects the employer to the risk of being forced to collect the income tax from the employee, which can become impossible, for example, if the employee’s whereabouts are unknown.

One possible solution would be to combine the employer’s declaration of liability with an agreement regarding retention and setting off or assignment of some of the exit proceeds from the shares."
Noerr,Employee participation plans under the Future Financing Act (Zukunfts­finanzierungs­gesetz) – Important changes and practical implementation,"One possible solution would be to combine the employer’s declaration of liability with an agreement regarding retention and setting off or assignment of some of the exit proceeds from the shares.

This would give the employer access to the proceeds to use them to cover the income tax of the (former) employee.

However, such proceeds distribution arrangements would only be safe from insolvency and enforcement if they were anchored in the articles of association and/or secured by a lien.

Additional implications can arise for the tag-/drag along clauses usually contained in partnership agreements.

They usually stipulate that employees are obliged to sell their shares at the same conditions as those of the investor.

However, if, according to what has been said above, some of the purchase price is paid not to the former employee but to the employer, this might constitute unequal treatment; as a precaution, the clause should permit this as a precaution to ensure that it is enforceable.

IV.

Transforming VSOPs into ESOPs The fact that the tax aspects of ESOPs are more attractive than those of VSOPs could lead especially start-ups and SMEs to consider transforming their existing virtual stock option plans into ESOPs.

Such restructuring is basically possible.

If and to the extent that a company intends to transform a VSOP into an ESOP, as far as possible, the transformation should be the same for everyone who participates in the plan to avoid any labour law risks related to the German General Equal Treatment Act ( Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz ).

The company should enter into an agreement with each beneficiary that includes the termination of the VSOP and the conditions of the new ESOP.

Depending on the structure, each governing body of the company might need to grant its consent to the transformation.

From a tax viewpoint, the structure of the VSOP that is in place is critical.

The transformation of a vested claim arising from a VSOP into an ESOP could be considered as advance disposition subject to income tax of a VSOP claim for granting the ESOP.

The result would be that this transaction would have to be considered a flow of funds from the VSOP equal to the amount of the ESOP.

Such a premature disposal flow would not be privileged under section 19a of the Income Tax Act.

But even for VSOP claims that have not become vested, the question would arise as to whether section 19a of the Income Tax Act is applicable because this assumes that the ESOP shares are granted in addition to the employee compensation that was already owed.

If not-yet-vested VSOP claims were classified as “owed employee compensation”, this prerequisite would not be fulfilled.

However, in our opinion, the reasons for not classifying these claims as owed employee compensation seem to carry more weight, particularly because they had not yet arisen on the date of transformation and thus were not owed.

Because the boundary between vested and unvested claims is blurry and the evaluation of a transformation under tax law varies from case to case, procuring binding information or income tax information from the financial authorities or using a tax insurance solution should be considered for each individual case.

C. Outlook Legislators have used the Future Financing Act to expand the scope of applicability of the tax deferral provision in section 19a of the Income Tax Act for ESOPs at companies from start-ups to medium-sized companies and made (direct and indirect) real stock ownership more attractive.

The response to the amendments, particularly in the venture capital scene, has been consistently positive, so an increase in the number of ESOPs can be expected.

The practical implementation requires attention to some challenges that can arise in individual cases.

Noerr,European Commission launches first in-depth investigation under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"Last Friday, 16 February 2024, the European Commission ( “ Commission ” ) announced that it had launched its first in-depth investigation ( “ Phase 2 investigation ” ) of a foreign subsidy potentially distorting the internal market under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation ( “ FSR ” ).

The investigation relates to a public procurement procedure by the Bulgarian Ministry of Transport and Communications for 20 electronic “push-pull” trains and their maintenance with a contract valued at EUR 610 million.

CRRC Qingdao Sifang Locomotive ( “ CRRC ” ), a subsidiary of the Chinese state-owned company CRRC Corporation Limited, had submitted a tender in the public procurement procedure.

The background to this is the notification obligation under the FSR that has been in place since 12 October 2023.

Under certain conditions, companies must notify the Commission of their participation in public procurement procedures for investigation if they receive financial contributions from one or more non-EU countries (“ public procurement tool ”).

Companies must submit a notification at the same time as they submit a tender or a request to participate in a public procurement procedure.

The notification must contain information on foreign financial contributions in the last three years.

If companies fail to submit a notification or it is incomplete, they may be rejected from the public procurement procedure.

In the case of CRRC, the Commission had first carried out a preliminary review.

Subsequently, it found sufficient indications that the company had received a foreign subsidy that distorts the internal market.

This may have allowed CRRC to participate with an unduly advantageous tender in the public procurement procedure of the Bulgarian authority.

Therefore, as part of its Phase 2 investigation, the Commission will now carry out a more in-depth investigation into the foreign subsidy in question.

Generally, the Commission has 110 working days in total (i.e. until 2 July 2024) to conduct its investigation.

This period may be extended once in duly justified exceptional cases.

At the end of its Phase 2 investigation, the Commission may (i) issue a no objection decision, (ii) a decision with commitments or (iii) prohibit the award of the contract to CRRC altogether.

In addition to this public procurement tool, the FSR gives the Commission two other tools for investigating foreign subsidies: the M&A transaction and the ex officio investigation tools.

You can find an overview of all the tools created in our previous article here.

The opening of the first Phase 2 investigation in a public procurement procedure under the FSR represents a pioneering step for the Commission.

Publication of its decision at the conclusion of its in-depth investigation is heavily anticipated.

The decision will for the first time provide information as to when the Commission considers the requirements for launching an in-depth investigation to be satisfied.

It will also provide insights into the criteria the Commission will use to investigate distortions in the internal market.

Further findings may also be obtained for the balancing test between an identified distortion of the internal market and any positive effects of the subsidy.

Noerr,Update to the Car Energy Consumption Labelling Regulation – Amendment to car labelling requirements adopted,"On 2 February 2024, the Bundesrat passed an amendment to Germany’s Passenger Car Energy Consumption Labelling Regulation ( Pkw-EnVKV ; the “ Regulation ”) initiated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

This puts an end to the long wait for the amendment: the revision of the Regulation was long overdue, as based on Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 the fuel consumption and carbon emission figures for new vehicles have had to be determined in accordance with the new WLTP test programme since the end of 2018.

Now this step is finally to be taken in regard to fuel consumption and CO 2 labelling requirements for passenger cars.

It is now compulsory to state the WLTP figures .

To make it easier for consumers to understand, the WLTP test phases known as “low/medium/high/maximum” are translated into “city centre/suburban/country road/motorway” in the Regulation.

In addition, the electric range of electric or hybrid vehicles must now also be shown on all documents.

The previous carbon efficiency classes, on the other hand, will be abolished and replaced by “ carbon classes ”; the combined carbon emissions are simply assigned to a class from A to G (without any calculation required).

The Regulation not only introduces revised versions of the necessary documents at the point of sale, but also innovations for the advertising of vehicles .

A number of clarifications from case law have been incorporated into the Regulation: for example, it is expressly stated that all online advertising, including social media and video apps, also falls within the scope of the Regulation.

In addition, online distance selling must now include all information previously required only for bricks-and-mortar sales.

To avoid errors, however, a template proposed by the Regulation can be used.

In addition, certain further practical simplifications are planned: for example, the requirements for print advertising are largely harmonised with those for online advertising; in particular, print advertising is now only required to state the combined consumption and emission figures.

In addition, as far as online advertising is concerned, the visibility of the information is irrelevant if the information is “partially or fully invisible purely due to the technical presentation of the advertising platform and without any further action by the manufacturer or retailer”.

This wording is likely to lead to considerable difficulties in interpretation.

The explanatory memorandum to the draft regulation suggests, for example, that this is intended to cover the classic Facebook-type cases in which the necessary information can only be seen by clicking on “show more”.

While the draft also still specified that the compulsory information be accessible via a clearly identifiable link, this simplification has been removed and thus the previous strict requirements for the visibility of consumption and emissions information remain in place.

It is also worth mentioning that a definition of a “new” car has been introduced – a term that has repeatedly led to difficulties in practice: a car is only to be considered new if it is type-approved and was first registered for use on public roads no more than eight months ago or has mileage of 1,000km or less.

Finally, the new draft provides for a right to information for market surveillance authorities.

This allows the authorities to request all variants or versions of a model and (in particular) their consumption and emission figures from the manufacturers.

This is intended to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to fulfil their surveillance obligations.

The amendments to the Regulation will come into force one day after publication in the Federal Law Gazette; publication is expected within the next few days."
Noerr,Update to the Car Energy Consumption Labelling Regulation – Amendment to car labelling requirements adopted,"The amendments to the Regulation will come into force one day after publication in the Federal Law Gazette; publication is expected within the next few days.

Transitional periods of three or six months are stipulated for the changeover to the new requirements, during which documents or adverts based on the old legal situation will (still) be considered admissible.

These fairly brief transition periods will pose challenges to car manufacturers, dealers and advertisers in view of considerable (new) interpretation issues.

Given the known risks of unlawful information, the companies concerned would be well advised to comply with the new requirements promptly and comprehensively."
Noerr,"Foreign Subsidies Regulation: Initial experience, new “State aid” developments","The new Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“ FSR ”) has been fully applicable for a few months now.

It allows the European Commission (“ Commission ”) to investigate foreign subsidies and potential distortions in the internal market.

The three tools created for this purpose (M&A transaction tool, public procurement tool and ex officio investigation tool) are described in more detail in our previous article here .

According to the latest statements by the Commission, so far up to ten transactions have been “cleared” and another 50 transactions are pending as part of pre-notification contacts with and notifications to the Commission.

These first use cases provide initial insights and show new structural developments.

A new Foreign Subsidies Directorate under EU State aid law leadership Unsurprisingly, effective enforcement of the FSR requires a great amount of personnel resources at the Commission.

When the FSR came into force, the Commission announced at the request of the Directorate-General for Competition responsible that it would gradually increase staff numbers and create new structures.

Initially, plans were made for around 120 additional officials.

However, the details remained quite vague.

Now first specific plans have been revealed: A new “Directorate K” will be established within the Directorate-General for Competition in the next few weeks.

The new Directorate K will have three separate units and will assume investigative powers from 1 March 2024.

It will be under the leadership of the experienced State aid Director Karl Soukup.

Karl Soukup will hold his new position in addition to his current position as Director of the State aid Directorate H until further notice.

He will be assisted by numerous other officials who were previously responsible for EU State aid law and international relations.

The previous FSR task force will be integrated into one of the three units of the new Directorate K. EU State aid law instead of “merger control 2.0”

The structure of the new Directorate K and its staffing reflect what has already become apparent in the first few months of the FSR's application: Investigating foreign subsidies that distort the internal market is and remains a matter that is deeply influenced by EU State aid law.

From the very beginning, the aim of the FSR was to subject foreign subsidies to rules similar to those that have applied to State aid by Member States for over 60 years.

Due to globalisation and the greater opening up of the European economy, the control of State aid by Member States alone was no longer considered adequate to ensure fair competition in the EU’s internal market.

Accordingly, the M&A transaction tool does not just serve as a type of “merger control 2.0”, despite formal parallels.

The material, substantive control of M&A transactions – and thus the questions of risk assessment, the best strategic positioning and even the “probability of clearance” – follows its own standards.

Both principles and practical experience from EU State aid law provide the required substantial guidance.

To file or not to file?

The new M&A transaction tool still causes some uncertainty, although an FSR notification obligation can often be clarified by answering just a few questions.

This is illustrated by the following flowchart (for an enlarged version, please click on the thumbnail image or here (pdf) ):

Noerr,Poland’s Family Foundation Act: celebrating its first anniversary,"For many years it has been clear for Polish entrepreneurs that there is no simple legal answer to their strong need to secure their family assets, and above all their family businesses, for future succession.

Due to the lack of appropriate instruments in the Polish legal system, many national entrepreneurs were forced to use the legal institutions of other jurisdictions.

This solution was highly uncomfortable because of the differences in legal regimes and foreign legal requirements that did not entirely meet the needs of domestic entrepreneurs.

Finally, by virtue of the Act on Family Foundation of 26 January 2023 that entered into force on 22 May 2023, the family foundation was introduced into the Polish legal order.

According to the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology of the Republic of Poland, by the end of 2023, around 300 family foundations were registered, along with over 3,000 succession administrators offering their professional assistance in managing family foundations’ affairs.

It only further proves that a family foundation has been a long-awaited legal vehicle for succession planning as well as for accumulating and securing family wealth.

In view of the popularity of the Polish family foundation, it is worth summarizing the most important features of this institution.

The purpose of a family foundation is to accumulate property, manage it in the interests of beneficiaries, and provide benefits for beneficiaries.

A ‘benefit’ means assets, including cash, tangible goods or rights, transferred to the beneficiary or made available to the beneficiary for use by a family foundation or a family foundation in organization, in accordance with the statutes and list of beneficiaries.

The founder of a family foundation can only be an individual (natural person) with full capacity to take legal action who makes a declaration on the establishment of a family foundation in either a deed of incorporation or a will.

The founder must also provide a contribution to the family foundation to cover the initial fund with a value no smaller than PLN 100,000 (around USD 25,000).

Upon signing of the deed of incorporation or announcement of the will, a family foundation in organization is created.

The family foundation in organization acquires legal personality and becomes a family foundation upon registration in the register of family foundations.

The family foundation’s governing bodies are the management board, the beneficiaries’ meeting and the supervisory board.

The main task of the management board is to run the family foundation’s affairs and represent it (act on its behalf), whereas the beneficiaries’ meeting is the ultimate decision-making body.

The supervisory board is mandatory if the number of beneficiaries exceeds 25, and its key purpose is the supervision of the management board.

Hence, the structure applied in the Polish family foundation is familiar to the Polish legal system, as it is similar to that of a Polish limited liability company, which is one of the most common companies in Poland.

When it comes to the scope of operation of a family foundation, it has the right to conduct business activities, but to a limited extent.

By way of example, a family foundation can sell, lease or rent real property; participate in companies, investment funds and cooperatives; buy and sell securities, derivatives and other rights of a similar nature.

It needs to be stressed that conducting business activities exceeding the permitted scope may trigger adverse consequences for the family foundation, like taxation of income from such activities at a corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 25%.

One of the main reasons for the popularity of the Polish family foundation is tax driven."
Noerr,Poland’s Family Foundation Act: celebrating its first anniversary,"One of the main reasons for the popularity of the Polish family foundation is tax driven.

Apart from few exemptions (including the above-mentioned case where a family foundation exceeds the permitted scope of business activity or where a family foundation transfers benefits to beneficiaries) family foundations are basically CIT-free .

In addition, the closest family members of the founder belonging to “group zero” (spouse, descendants, ascendants, stepchildren, siblings, stepfather, and stepmother) are generally exempt from the personal income tax, as well as the inheritance and donation tax with respect to assets contributed to the family foundation by the founder.

But despite the numerous advantages, the family foundation is not without its faults .

For example, there is no generally accessible digital register of family foundations, which means that obtaining information about a family foundation may take up to several weeks.

In addition, there is only one court in Poland that deals with matters concerning family foundations, which may lead to case overload and very long document-processing time.

To sum up, currently there are around 830,000 family businesses in Poland, thus, it is fair to say that 300 Polish family foundations is just the beginning , and its importance as a new legal instrument will certainly grow over time.

On the other hand, a well-known practice in other countries is to employ family foundations in complex transactions and corporate restructurings for the purpose of tax optimization.

At this point such utilization of the Polish family foundation seems to be questionable because of the general anti-avoidance rule laid down in Polish tax law.

However, it is yet to be seen how the Polish lawmaker and courts will impact the functioning of family foundations in practice – and not only from tax perspective – in the near future."
Noerr,Stronger artists’ rights or red tape for streaming services? – European Parliament proposes stricter regulation of music streaming services,"Streaming services have long since dominated the music industry, now accounting for around two-thirds of its global revenue.

Streaming continues to be popular with users, but the business model has its critics among artists, particularly when it comes to remuneration and discoverability of content.

This criticism has now motivated a majority in the European Parliament to take up the cause.

In a resolution dated 17 January 2024 on “cultural diversity and the conditions for authors in the European music streaming market (2023/2054(INI))”

it has proposed fundamental regulation of the streaming sector to benefit musicians in Europe.

The calls for action are addressed to the EU Commission, the only governing body granted authority under the European treaties to introduce legislative initiatives.

Key aspects of the resolution Sustainable ecosystem for authors The European Parliament promotes its vision of greater visibility on the music streaming services and a more balanced distribution of streaming revenues.

In particular, it calls on the Commission to revamp “ predigital” remuneration systems and criticises so-called “payola schemes” that force authors to accept lower or no revenue in exchange for greater visibility.

It also advocates improving creators’ position using metadata to better identify those involved in the creative process.

Ethical use of AI Another important topic of the resolution is how artificial intelligence (AI) is used in the music industry.

Here, the European Parliament emphasises the need for legal targeted provisions to ensure the transparency of the algorithms and content recommendation systems .

It states that ethical use of AI also includes making the public aware of whether music has been generated mainly by AI.

It also advocates setting up reporting mechanisms for deepfakes, meaning AI-generated content that may use authors’ and performers’ identities, voices and likenesses without their consent, and other manipulated content.

Promoting Europe’s diverse music culture The European Parliament also proposes promoting Europe’s diverse music culture.

It believes that European musical works should be more visible and even prominent.

It suggests even considering quotas for European musical works .

Assessment and outlook Naturally, the resolution does not yet contain any concrete draft legislation, but rather restricts itself to basic principles and structural suggestions .

However, it reveals the clear intention to subject the European streaming market to more comprehensive regulation.

It is not currently foreseeable when a bill from the EU Commission can be expected or whether it will include the Parliament’s proposals.

The European Parliament’s initiative entails the risk of deeply curtailing streaming services’ commercial freedom , particularly as regards potential regulation of remuneration structures.

The resolution does state that a new distribution model for authors should be developed based on structured dialogue among all stakeholders.

Nevertheless, legal requirements from Brussels are on the horizon.

Obligations to disclose the algorithms being used and priority discoverability of European works would also have considerable consequences.

The highest priority therefore is to maintain consistency with other AI legislation."
Noerr,Reform of the Capital Markets Model Case Act (KapMuG): Speedier proceedings planned,"On 28 December 2023, the Federal Ministry of Justice published the bill for a Second Act to Reform the Capital Markets Model Case Act (the “ Act ”).

The bill is required because the Act in its current version will expire on 31 August 2024 after several extensions.

As the Act has fundamentally proven its worth (in the opinion of the Federal Ministry of Justice) as an instrument of class and mass action defence in capital market-related lawsuits, the previous time limitation is to be removed and the Act is to be refined on this occasion.

Background to the Act The reason for introducing the Act in 2005 was the volume of individual lawsuits filed by investors in connection with Deutsche Telekom AG’s third IPO in 2000 and the resulting excess workload for the courts.

At that time, the idea was to establish a powerful instrument for class and mass actions in capital market law disputes in Germany in order to improve individual legal protection and relieve the burden on the courts.

Current status of the Act The Act is intended to provide affected investors with special model civil proceedings before the higher regional courts for claims based on false, misleading or omitted public capital markets information, so that potentially affected investors can file their claims more easily.

In short, proceedings under the Act will be used to submit individual questions of fact or law that play a decisive role in several individual disputes to one higher regional court, where they will be heard and ruled on in a single process.

The prerequisite for such model case proceedings is that at least ten parties to such individual proceedings have filed an application for model case proceedings to be conducted.

The proceedings are initiated by an order from a regional court to refer the matter to a higher court.

As long as the model case proceedings continue, all pending individual proceedings must be suspended ex officio in accordance with section 8 of the Act if the decision depends on the objectives of the model case proceedings.

Once the model case has been concluded, the individual proceedings before the regional courts will be finalised on the basis of the model decision.

The model decision will be binding for all suspended proceedings, in which only the individual damage issues then have to be decided.

Individual claimants therefore will not receive an enforceable title through Act proceedings.

They can only obtain such a title in the individual proceedings to be continued.

Content of the bill In practice, model case proceedings under the Act have proven to be lengthy.

The current bill therefore states that one of the aims of the planned changes is to speed up the model case proceedings and make them more efficient.

To achieve this aim, the Federal Ministry of Justice proposes the following specific changes, for example: Faster proceedings The time period between bringing an individual action and the model case proceedings in the higher regional court will be shorter: in future, the trial court will publicly announce model case applications within two months (instead of the previous six months) in accordance with section 4(1) of the bill.

The trial court will also no longer be permitted to wait six months after receiving the first model case application before checking whether the required quorum has been reached.

Instead, it must issue the order to refer the matter to another court as soon as the quorum of ten similar model case applications has been reached (section 7(1) of the bill).

According to section 10(5) of the bill, the higher regional court is to decide on the commencement of model case proceedings within three months of the order to refer the matter being announced, in the interests of a rapid commencement of the model case proceedings."
Noerr,Reform of the Capital Markets Model Case Act (KapMuG): Speedier proceedings planned,"Strengthening the position of higher regional courts Under section 10(2) of the bill, the higher regional courts are to be allowed to determine the declaratory objectives at their reasonable discretion on the basis of the model case applications submitted, i.e. they are then not bound (as they were previously) by the declaratory objectives from the order to refer the matter.

Under section 10(4) of the bill, the higher regional courts may refuse to commence model case proceedings in full or in part if the objectives of the declaratory judgment are not relevant; this decision is to be non-contestable.

Fewer parties involved The regional courts should no longer be obliged to stay ex officio all pending proceedings that depend on the decision about the declaratory objectives.

Instead, under section 2(1) and section 11(1) of the bill, only those parties who have filed either a model case application or an extension application are to participate in the model case proceedings.

Only in such cases will the initial proceedings be interrupted ex officio (section 6(1) and section 11(6) of the bill).

To this end, section 8 of the Act, which provided for an ex officio stay of all pending proceedings that depend on the decision about the declaratory objectives, is to be deleted.

This measure is intended to reduce the number of parties to the proceedings, since all claimants whose proceedings were suspended in accordance with section 8 of the Act due to their dependence on the model case proceedings must also be summoned to the model case proceedings.

Such proceedings, which are not covered by the order to refer the matter or the one-time extension of the model case application (following the deletion of section 8 of the Act) are only to be suspended if a party applies for this before the model case has been finalised (ministerial draft of section 145(5) of the German Code of Civil Procedure).

In these cases, however, there should be no formal tie-in to the (factual) findings of the model case proceedings.

Section 1(3) of the bill will also clarify that proceedings under the Act and the German Consumer Rights Enforcement Act ( VDuG ) are not mutually exclusive, i.e. representative actions and model case proceedings under the Act can be conducted at the same time.

Outlook

The draft bill contains some important changes in the area of mass proceedings influenced by capital market law.

Interested parties had time until 31 January 2024 to comment on the bill.

Those comments have now been received and can be viewed on the website of the Federal Ministry of Justice.

The intended abolition of the suspension of individual proceedings under section 8 of the Act has been a particular focus of debate in the comments received.

If section 8 of the Act is deleted, it is likely that companies will be burdened with a larger number of individual legal actions.

The current consolidating effect of the Act and thus also the relief of the judicial system would essentially be in vain.

Unlike today, there will be competition between individual claims and model cases with the risk of contradictory decisions.

Furthermore, it is not clear which higher regional court will decide first.

At first glance, the proposals in the bill seem likely to speed up proceedings.

Whether this acceleration of proceedings will actually materialise remains to be seen in practice.

One thing is clear: the higher regional courts will be given more leeway in organising and conducting the proceedings.

This leeway must be utilised to ensure efficient proceedings that quickly provide legal certainty for investors and issuers.

This is essential to make Germany attractive as a forum for capital market disputes.

We will closely monitor the next steps in the legislative process and keep you informed of any major developments.

Noerr,Arbitration: a lifesaver in a sea of actions taken by the Russian Federation,"In the past few months, the Russian Federation has increasingly taken action against Western companies.

These widely varying actions include seizures, restrictions on the transfer of funds or interests in a business, compulsory administration, supervision or replacement of management, (ordered) sale below value of interests in a company, etc.

However, companies are not without means of protecting themselves.

Breach of investment protection law Often due to its position as the successor to the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation is a party to more than 60 bilateral investment protection treaties (BITs), including one with the Federal Republic of Germany.

The BITs provide the abovementioned companies with legal protection.

As is usually the case with BITs, the German-Soviet Investment Protection Agreement protects every kind of investment in every sector.

Under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), energy-related investments made before 19 October 2009 also have the option of solving disputes via arbitration.

Many of the Russian actions probably constitute breaches of the protection provided by BITs or the ECT, such as the principle of free transfer of investments and investment agreements or the principle of fair and equitable treatment by the state.

The latter also is likely to cover unjustified enrichment.

In practical application, the rules on expropriation found in every BIT and in the ECT play a major role.

Even merely temporary actions can be classified as expropriation.

According to Article 4 of the German-Soviet Investment Protection Agreement, investors’ assets can only be subject to expropriation or a comparable action in return for compensation.

This compensation must correspond to the actual value of the asset on the date on which the company becomes aware of the actual or imminent expropriation.

This is often not the case in the current actual practice of the Russian Federation.

Enforcing damages claims via arbitration Claims for damages due to breaches of investment protection law can usually be enforced by means of arbitration.

In the past, investors have used the option of arbitration against Russian state-owned companies and/or the Russian Federation itself; by far the majority of such cases were decided in favour of the investors.

Even now, several arbitration proceedings against Russian state-owned companies and/or the Russian Federation are pending.

Such arbitration proceedings are still possible even if the Russian Federation has already brought an action before the Russian state courts, in circumvention of an arbitration clause.

Arbitral award enforceable for a long time Any arbitral award granted against the Russian Federation is in principle binding and enforceable under the New York Convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, which is also applicable to the Russian Federation.

Because the New York Convention enjoys broad acceptance among states, an arbitral award can be enforced practically everywhere in the world.

Depending on applicable national statutes of limitations, enforcement remains possible even many years after the arbitral award has been issued.

How long the creditor of an arbitral award can ask for enforcement in a particular case before it becomes statute-barred varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.

German law has a statute of limitations of 30 years."

The Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA ) already approved by the European Parliament will soon further complement the regulation of data and artificial intelligence within the European Union.

All in all, a series of directly applicable regulations and numerous other legal acts form the highly complex new European data law.

However, regulatory requirements for artificial intelligence and for accessing, exchanging and using both personal and non-personal data do not at times fit comfortably with existing data protection regulations.

Other European legal acts that are currently in the legislative process will further consolidate the regulatory framework for data and AI in the future.

As a regulation, DORA does not require further transposition into national law.

The requirements of DORA, which now must be implemented within a year, are quite extensive.

IORPs are already subject to several guidelines on governance issues under the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s ( BaFin ) Minimum Requirements on the System of Governance of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (“ Minimum Requirements on Governance Systems for IORPs ”).

DORA will further consolidate the regulatory network regarding cybersecurity-related organisational obligations.

Scope of application DORA applies to the financial entities named in its Article 2(1).

These include traditional credit institutions, payment institutions and insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

However, in principle IORPs also fall within DORA’s scope of application .

An exception applies if the IORP in question operates retirement schemes with fewer than 15 members in total.

For the definition of an IORP, DORA refers to Directive (EU) 2016/2341 (IORP Directive ).

Accordingly, pension funds and pension schemes are generally included in DORA’s scope of application.

If insurers provide occupational retirement benefits, they are as insurance undertakings subject to DORA.

Requirements under DORA DORA is characterised by the need for further specification through Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) and Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS).

These standards are developed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

The ESMA website provides further information on current and previous consultations.

These legal acts will provide further legal clarity.

Irrespective of this, however, IORPs can already prepare for the following DORA requirements: ICT (information and communication technology) risk management : The addressees must introduce appropriate governance and organisation, which ultimately must be approved, monitored and accounted for by the management body.

This governance should include strategies, guidelines and policies, procedures, ICT protocols and tools.

There are simplifications for small IORPs (those with pension schemes with fewer than 100 members in total).

ICT third-party risk management :

As the procurement of ICT services from third parties, such as cloud services or managed services, is increasing, DORA provides detailed requirements for this procurement process.

Some of these requirements may already be familiar from the Minimum Requirements on Governance Systems for IORPs in relation to spin-offs.

However, we expect that contracts will have to be renegotiated.

ICT incident reporting : As already known from legislation such as the Federal Office for Information Security Act ( Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik Gesetz, BSIG ) or the GDPR, ICT-related incidents must be reported.

As there is often uncertainty about who should do what in an emergency, we recommend having a clear and comprehensive emergency plan.

Digital operational resilience testing, including threat-led penetration testing: Financial organisations must establish and maintain a resilience testing programme.

This programme should primarily include vulnerability assessments and scans as well as penetration tests.

For particularly critical financial organisations, threat-led penetration tests are also required."
Noerr,Occupational retirement provision update: One more year to implement DORA,"For particularly critical financial organisations, threat-led penetration tests are also required.

Extensive consultations are currently still underway, and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority is also examining how to incorporate the requirements of DORA into its supervisory practice.

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s has issued several circulars that provide guidelines for IT in financial institutions, insurance companies, capital management firms and payment services providers.

These circulars are known as the Supervisory Requirements for IT in Financial Institutions ( Bankaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT, BAIT ), the Insurance Supervisory Requirements for IT ( Versicherungsaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT, VAIT ), the Capital Management Supervisory Requirements for IT ( Kapitalverwaltungsaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT, KAIT ) and the Supervisory Requirements for IT at Payment Services Providers ( Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtliche Anforderungen an die IT , ZAIT).

The future role of these circulars is likely to continue to be significant.

Further information from the supervisory authority and about its initial expectations can be found here .

However, in view of the limited time frame for implementing DORA’s requirements, it is important for IORPs not to waste any time and instead acquaint themselves with DORA’s provisions.

Noerr,2024: a year of strikes? ‒ Options for employers to react to industrial action (Part II),"Germany had just recovered from the German train drivers’ union’s ( Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer, GDL ) last rail strike when the union called and carried out the longest rail strike in the country’s history last week.

In light of this, we have prepared Part II to our article on options for employers to react to industrial action, which explores the strategies employers can resort to during industrial action and the judicial redress mechanisms available to them.

Industrial action by employers Employers’ “traditional” industrial actions, such as lockouts or plant closures, play almost no role in practice anymore as they tend to exacerbate or increase the already often significant economic damage caused by industrial action.

Rather, companies should try to find ways and means of ensuring operations continue as smoothly as possible despite industrial action.

Various options can be considered for this purpose: Strike-breaking bonuses Employers may, for example, offer financial incentives, known as strike-breaking bonuses, to employees who continue to work regularly instead of participating in strikes.

The timing of these bonuses is important: they must be promised before or during the industrial action in order to be considered a legitimate means of industrial action (Federal Labour Court ( Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) of 14 August 2018 – 1 AZR 287/17).

If, on the other hand, such bonuses are only offered after the conclusion of a strike, this will generally violate collective agreements and/or statutory prohibitions on retaliatory measures.

There are no universal guidelines as to the amount of these bonuses.

They can therefore be based on the situation and tailored to the individual case (see, for example, Braunschweig Labour Court ( Arbeitsgericht, ArbG) of 2 June 2016 ‒ 6 Ca 529/15: €200 gross per working day was considered permissible).

When offering strike-breaking bonuses, companies should be aware that unions typically demand, following the conclusion of industrial action and during subsequent collective bargaining, that any bonuses paid during the dispute be subsequently paid to all other employees as well.

While the short-term effect of a strike-breaking bonus may be to keep some employees from participating in a strike, companies should factor in the expected compensation claims from the union in their strategic planning from the outset.

Use of strikebreakers Generally, during industrial action, companies should explore which (additional) workers can be utilised to minimise the strike’s negative impact on operational processes as far as possible.

To this end, employers can try to motivate their own employees to perform the work.

Furthermore, it is permissible to reassign employees from different areas or even from other company operations to the workplaces of strikers to optimise the distribution of the available workforce.

In this context, employers are also permitted to request overtime from employees who are willing to work through the strike period.

Additionally, engaging external personnel is a viable option, but it is important to ensure that such engagements are structured and actually executed as legitimate outsourcing under a service or work contract ( Dienst- oder Werkvertrag ).

This is because only personnel recruited in this way can be legally used as strikebreakers to replace striking employees without any special restrictions.

If bogus work contracts or disguised personnel leasing are involved, section 11(5) of the German Temporary Agency Workers Act ( Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz, AÜG ), which prevents temporary workers from being employed in companies directly involved in industrial action, will apply.

This extensive ban on deployment has been a subject of intense debate but was ultimately upheld as constitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court ( Bundesverfassungsgericht, VerfG on 19 June 2020 ‒ 1 BvR 842/17)."
Noerr,2024: a year of strikes? ‒ Options for employers to react to industrial action (Part II),"Consequently, if the company employing the temporary workers is affected by a union’s strike call, it is not permissible for temporary workers to replace striking employees, either directly or indirectly.

Co-determination in industrial disputes In considering all of the options an employer has in response to industrial action, it is important to note that, according to case law, existing co-determination rights of the works council can be restricted by interpreting them in a way that is consistent with industrial action (established case law, Federal Labour Court of 13 December 2011 ‒ 1 ABR 2/10).

Therefore, actions such as recruitment or transfers due to industrial action, as defined by section 99 of the German Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz, BetrVG ), can generally be implemented without co-determination.

Judicial redress mechanisms Employers have various redress mechanisms available to them in the face of unlawful industrial action.

Interim injunctions

If a strike is imminent, an interim injunction is the right legal remedy to halt an impending strike or at least to negotiate an emergency staffing agreement.

The prerequisite is that the strike action is unlawful, such as when the strike pursues an objective that cannot be regulated by a collective labour agreement.

For instance, Hesse Regional Labour Court declared a pilots’ strike unlawful because it was directed against the establishment of an airline abroad (Hesse Regional Labour Court of 9 September 2015 ‒ 9 SaGa 1082/15).

Another point of contention often arises around the proportionality of the strike measures, which must be assessed by balancing the fundamental rights affected by the strike.

For example, factors such as the notice period, the duration of the strike, its scope and its impact on the employer and external third parties all play a role here.

However, due to the constitutional protection of the right to strike, any claims of disproportionality must meet very high standards.

Consequently, even in sectors providing essential services, such as hospitals, a strike can be lawful if an emergency staffing agreement is in place to ensure adequate care for people.

If there is any uncertainty, establishing an emergency staffing service, potentially enforced by the courts, is a less severe measure than banning the strike outright.

Even high financial losses do not inherently imply that a strike is disproportionate.

However, if the industrial action is intended to jeopardise the company’s survival, it could be deemed disproportionate, although this is normally difficult to prove.

The chances of success of an interim injunction therefore always depend on the circumstances of the individual case.

In the recent interim injunction proceedings concerning the collective bargaining dispute at Deutsche Bahn before the Frankfurt am Main Labour Court and the Hessian Regional Labour Court, the main issue was also the proportionality of the strike.

The railway companies argued that the strike was causing enormous financial losses to them and, in addition, damage to the country’s economy due to days of train cancellations.

However, the courts did not view these financial losses as a threat to the company’s survival, emphasising that economic damage is an inevitable consequence of strike action.

Damages If a court deems industrial action unlawful, employers are generally entitled to compensation for the damage incurred.

The trade union organising the strike is the main potential defendant.

Employees who unlawfully participate in strikes can be prosecuted more effectively with disciplinary measures, including termination without notice, due to the breach of their main contractual obligation to perform their work.

A trade union can only be sued on a contractual basis if it violates a ban on taking industrial action, making statutory claims for damages therefore of primary practical relevance."
Noerr,2024: a year of strikes? ‒ Options for employers to react to industrial action (Part II),"A trade union can only be sued on a contractual basis if it violates a ban on taking industrial action, making statutory claims for damages therefore of primary practical relevance.

The protected legal interest is often the “established and exercised commercial enterprise” ( eingerichtete und ausgeübte Geschäftsbetrieb ).

The amount of damage is usually calculated on the basis of lost profits, but proving this in practice can be difficult.

It should also be noted that only employers who are directly impacted by their own employees’ strike are entitled to claim.

For example, in the context of a strike by air traffic controllers, airlines that were only indirectly impacted were denied damages.

Attack on the union’s capacity for collective bargaining?

Trade unions are only able to carry out strike action if they are legally entitled to enter into collective bargaining agreements.

This requires, among other things, that the union has capacity for collective bargaining.

This capacity can be reviewed in court, which does occur in practice from time to time (see, for example, the decisions of the Federal Labour Court on the collective bargaining capacity of the Collective Bargaining Association of Christian Unions for Temporary Work and Personnel Services Agencies ( Tarifgemeinschaft Christlicher Gewerkschaften für Zeitarbeit und Personalserviceagenturen ) or the Commercial Assistants Association ( Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfen-Verband (DDHV) ‒

Die Berufsgewerkschaft eV ).

German law provides for a special procedure for reviewing a trade union’s collective bargaining capacity, section 97 of the German Labour Court Act ( Arbeitsgerichtsgesetz, ArbGG ).

However, this procedure cannot be used to prevent imminent industrial action as proceedings can go all the way to the Federal Labour Court and it could thus take several months or even years before a legally binding decision is reached.

In the context of interim injunction proceedings, a challenge to a trade union’s collective bargaining capacity is only considered if the union’s lack of capacity is evident.

Proving this in practice is hardly possible, as the recent proceedings before the Hessian State Labour Court have shown.

Furthermore, the established trade unions’ capacity to negotiate collective agreements will not generally be in question anyway.

The application proceedings initiated by German national rail operator Deutsche Bahn pursuant to section 97 of the Labour Court Act are probably solely due to the unique circumstances surrounding GDL’s establishment of a cooperative of temporary workers, Fair Train e.G.

The future stance of the courts on this matter remains to be seen.

Conclusion In the face of industrial action, employers generally have a variety of potential responses at their disposal.

Which of these are most likely to succeed depends to a large extent on the company concerned, the striking trade union and the circumstances of the individual case ‒ in particular the severity of the (announced) strike."
Noerr,Final text of the European AI Act – What companies and public institutions that want to use AI systems need to be prepared for,"On 21 January 2020, the final text of the EU Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (“ AI Act ”) was made public through unofficial channels but has yet to be formally adopted in the legislative process.

Not surprisingly, the almost 900-page working paper still contains numerous substantive changes, many of which primarily affect AI system providers.

For most companies, however, the much more interesting question is: What obligations do they face if they want to use third-party AI systems?

The European AI Regulation poses particular challenges for companies when using AI systems due to numerous obligations.

However, the new obligations are no reason not to use AI systems.

With this in mind, we have done an initial analysis of the final version of the text and examined it for relevant obligations in use cases.

1.

Who do the provisions of the AI Regulation apply to?

The AI Regulation sets out rules for a large number of participants.

The focus is on the provider that developed the AI system.

However, there are also regulations for “ deployers ”.

According to the legal definition in Article 3(1)(4), these are ( mutatis mutandis ) natural or legal persons who use an AI system on their own responsibility.

According to the wording, authorities, public institutions or other bodies are also expressly covered.

The only exceptions are when the AI system is used for a personal, non-professional activity.

It is clear that, if companies or public institutions use an AI system as part of their own activities, that makes them deployers which fall within the scope of the Regulation.

2.

Strict prohibition of AI practices also applies to deployers Article 5 of the AI Regulation sets out strict prohibitions of certain AI practices.

These also apply to deployers.

The prohibited practices are those that are particularly intrusive to individuals from the perspective of fundamental rights.

These include the use of techniques of subliminal unconscious influence to significantly influence a person’s behaviour or cause them harm, and certain forms of social scoring.

The use of these practices is likely to be the exception rather than the rule in the day-to-day operations of companies or public institutions, so the prohibitions are likely to be fairly irrelevant.

Breaches of these prohibitions are punished by fines of up to €35m under Article 71(3) of the AI Regulation or, for companies, of up to 7% of total worldwide annual turnover in the past financial year if that figure is higher.

3.

The crucial question for deployers – Is the AI system a high-risk AI system or not?

One of the focal points of the legislative process was the regulation of AI systems classified as high-risk.

To manage the potential risks of using such technologies, deployers face an extensive list of obligations when using these “high-risk systems”.

Companies and public institutions should therefore always check whether the system has to be classified as a high-risk system before using the AI system.

Existence of a high-risk AI system For deployers, this raises an all-important question: is their own AI system a high-risk AI system?

Classification is quite complex in individual cases.

This is because the European legislature has not simply resolved this issue with a rigid legal definition of the term.

Instead, a dynamic system for classifying high-risk systems has been established in Articles 6 and 7 of the AI Regulation.

AI systems which are used as security components for a product already subject to certain EU rules, or which are themselves such a product, are covered.

The relevant legal acts are listed in Annex II of the AI Regulation.

This includes machinery, toys and medical devices (Article 6(1)

AI Regulation), for example.

In addition, Annex III lists certain areas of application that lead to classification as a high-risk AI system (Article 6(2)

AI Regulation)."
Noerr,Final text of the European AI Act – What companies and public institutions that want to use AI systems need to be prepared for,"AI Regulation), for example.

In addition, Annex III lists certain areas of application that lead to classification as a high-risk AI system (Article 6(2)

AI Regulation).

Relevant examples are: Biometric identification : Real-time and subsequent remote biometric identification of natural persons; Critical infrastructure : Safety components to manage and operate critical digital infrastructure and other types of infrastructure; Employment, HR management : Selection, analysis or evaluation of applicants and automated decision-making in employment; Essential private and public services and benefits : Determining eligibility for state benefits, and also (private sector) credit checks and risk-based pricing for life assurance and health insurance The EU Commission can extend this list by means of a delegated act.

Companies need to continuously monitor the list because classifications can also be added later on.

A new exemption states that AI systems are not considered high-risk despite being listed in Annex III if they do not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons and do not materially influence decision-making processes.

This is ultimately the case if the AI system only performs subordinate auxiliary activities (Article 6(2a) AI Regulation).

The providers of AI systems can assess the existence of this exception themselves but must document the assessment accordingly (Article 6(2b) AI Regulation).

For deployers, this process involves a potential risk, as there is a danger of using a high-risk AI system without complying with the corresponding obligations.

Deployers should therefore always check whether the AI system has an Annex III classification and, if necessary, obtain the provider’s documentation.

4. List of obligations when using high-risk AI systems If companies or public institutions use a high-risk AI system, they must fulfil the list of obligations set out in Article 29 of the AI Regulation.

These include: Using appropriate technical and organisational measures (TOMs) to ensure the AI system is used in accordance with the operating instructions; Ensuring human supervision by competent, trained natural persons who have the necessary support and authority; Ensuring that input data is “ relevant and sufficiently representative ” with respect to the intended purpose; Continuous monitoring in accordance with the operating instructions and ensuring that the product is taken out of service if there is reason to believe that its use poses an unreasonable risk to health, safety or fundamental rights; Complying with reporting obligations in the event of decommissioning (Article 29(4) and Article 65(1) AI Regulation) or serious incidents; Complying with documentation obligations, in particular the storage of automatically generated logs for at least six months to be able to prove the proper functioning of the system or to enable ex-post controls at a later date; Notifying employees and employee representatives in advance if they are affected by a high-risk AI system in the workplace; Complying with special information obligations when high-risk AI systems make decisions about natural persons or assist in these decisions, including the new right of the data subject to demand an individual decision (Article 68c AI Regulation) Breaches of these obligations are punishable by fines of up to €30m or in the case of companies, of up to 6% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the previous financial year if that figure is higher, according to Article 71(4)(g) AI Regulation.

Surprising change: Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment drastically scaled back The final version of the AI Regulation contains a surprising change.

Contrary to the expressed wish of the European Parliament, the obligation for deployers to carry out a comprehensive and complex Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment has been drastically scaled back."
Noerr,Final text of the European AI Act – What companies and public institutions that want to use AI systems need to be prepared for,"Contrary to the expressed wish of the European Parliament, the obligation for deployers to carry out a comprehensive and complex Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment has been drastically scaled back.

The European Parliament’s draft stated this was to be carried out for all uses of high-risk AI systems.

By contrast, Article 29a AI Regulation restricts this obligation to state actors and private individuals carrying out state tasks.

The only exceptions for private-sector providers are for credit checks or risk-based pricing for life assurance and health insurance.

Watch out for the obligation trap of Article 16 AI Act Other obligations for AI systems categorised as high-risk are set out in Article 16 AI Regulation.

In principle, only the provider is subject to this long list of obligations.

However, if certain conditions are met, deployers must also comply with these provider obligations.

Caution is required in particular if a deployer places a high-risk AI system on the market or puts it into operation under its own name or brand, makes a significant change to an AI system classified as high-risk without it losing its status as a high-risk AI system, or makes a significant change to the intended purpose of another AI system, thus making it a high-risk AI system.

In these cases, the original provider is no longer responsible for the high-risk AI system concerned (Article 28(1) and first sentence of (2)).

However, it has to provide the new provider with all necessary documentation required to fulfil the requirements and obligations of the AI Regulation (second sentence of Article 28(2)).

5.

Other obligations when using AI systems In addition to the special list of obligations for high-risk AI systems in Article 29, the AI Regulation sets out further obligations that deployers must generally comply with when using AI systems.

General obligation for all deployers Deployers of AI systems must generally take measures to ensure sufficient understanding of AI systems – AI literacy – among their own staff and others involved in operating and using AI systems on their behalf.

The existing experience and knowledge of those concerned and the context in which the AI system is to be used should be taken into account (Article 4b AI Regulation).

The aim of this obligation is to ensure that informed decisions are made with regard to AI systems and that awareness is raised of the potential and risks of AI.

The scope of the required literacy depends on the risk potential of the AI system and the related obligations (Article 3(1)(44)(bh), Recital 9b of the AI Regulation).

Transparency obligations for deployers of certain AI systems In addition, the AI Regulation provides for transparency obligations for certain AI systems.

For example, the deployer of an emotion recognition system or a system for biometric categorisation must inform the natural persons concerned about the operation of this system (Article 52(2) AI Regulation).

If the AI system produces or alters images, videos or audio content , it must always be disclosed that this content was generated or modified by AI.

Restrictions are provided for in this respect, particularly in artistic and satirical contexts.

(Article 52(3)(1) AI Regulation).

If the AI system produces or alters a text that is published for public information purposes , it must also be disclosed that the text was generated or modified by AI (Article 52(3)(2) AI Regulation).

6.

No additional obligations for deployers of general-purpose AIs (GPAIs) Good news for companies and public institutions: they are not affected by the major political debate in the legislative process on how to deal with GPAIs (formerly known as Foundation Models).

GPAI systems include large language models such as GPT-4 provided by the US company OpenAI.

The provisions in Title IV of the AI Regulation are limited solely to additional obligations for providers of such AI systems."
Noerr,Final text of the European AI Act – What companies and public institutions that want to use AI systems need to be prepared for,"The provisions in Title IV of the AI Regulation are limited solely to additional obligations for providers of such AI systems.

Deployers of GPAIs do not have to observe anything in this respect.

However, the basic deployer obligations, especially in the case of high-risk AI systems, still apply.

For example, a GPAI system such as ChatGPT can be categorised as a high-risk AI system if it is used in an area specified for classification.

7.

When do the regulations start to apply?

The provisions of the AI Regulation are largely set to apply two years after it comes into force (Article 85(2) AI Regulation).

However, some provisions have a different planned date of application.

This applies in particular to the general provisions in Title I and the prohibition of certain AI systems in Title II of the AI Regulation.

These are intended to apply six months after the Regulation comes into force.

What is particularly relevant is that the rules on classifying high-risk systems and the corresponding obligations will come into force after three years (Article 85(3)

AI Regulation).

8.

What about personal use?

The use of AI systems for personal purposes does not fall within the scope of the AI Regulation.

Accordingly, no special precautions need to be taken for the personal use of AI systems such as ChatGPT.

9.

Outlook Companies and public institutions should carry out a thorough preliminary check before using third-party AI systems.

In many use cases, the actual scope of obligations will be manageable.

So, the challenge is to identify the relevant obligations in the first place.

The key factor will be whether the AI system is a high-risk system.

Regardless of this, from a regulatory perspective the biggest hurdles in the use of AI systems will probably still be European data protection law and cyber security."
Noerr,CJEU: Beginning of the limitation period depends on knowledge of the law,"In its judgment of 25 January 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled, following a reference for a preliminary ruling from a Spanish court, that consumer claims for restitution based on invalid general terms and conditions may not be time-barred solely on the basis of knowledge of the facts giving rise to the claim, but that knowledge of the legal assessment of the facts is necessary.

This judgement also has implications for German domestic law.

I. Background

The starting point for the judgement in Joined Cases C-810/21 to C-813/21 ( Caixabank SA and others ) were several references for a preliminary ruling from the Provincial Court of Barcelona on the interpretation of Art.

6 (1) and Art.

7 (1) of the Directive 93/13/EEC .

Based on mortgage loan agreements concluded in 2004 and 2006, the claimants paid notary, registration and administration fees to the lending bank approximately three to four months after the conclusion of the contracts.

In a judgement of 23 December 2015, the Spanish Supreme Court declared the clause on which the payments were based to be null and void.

In 2017 and 2018, i.e. 11, 13 and almost 14 years after payment of the costs, the borrowers filed claims for repayment of the fees (see summary of questions referred ).

According to the applicable Spanish respectively Catalan law, a limitation period of 10 years applies.

The limitation period begins to run – similar to Section 199 (1) of the German Civil Code – ""once the claim has arisen and becomes enforceable, and once the holder of the claim is, or could reasonably be, aware of the circumstances giving rise to the claim and the person against whom it may be brought.""

II.

Questions referred for a preliminary ruling The referring court had doubts as to whether the principle of effectiveness in the light of the Directive 93/13/EEC allows knowledge of the facts to be sufficient for the commencement of the limitation period.

For this reason, it referred the following questions to the CJEU, inter alia, as to whether the knowledge of the consumer necessary for the commencement of the limitation period must also include the legal assessment of these facts, and (ii) in the affirmative, whether the start of the period must be postponed until established case law on the invalidity of the clause has been formed.

III.

CJEU-decision Knowledge of the legal assessment of the facts giving rise to the claim required With regard to the commencement of a limitation period

, the CJEU has ruled that a limitation period is only compatible with the principle of effectiveness if consumers are not only aware of the facts giving rise to the claim, but also of their legal assessment.

Otherwise, it may not be assumed that consumers had the opportunity to become aware of their rights (para.

48–55).

Established case law alone is not sufficient to prove knowledge With regard to the question of what information must be available to the average consumer in order to be able to assume knowledge of the legal assessment, the CJEU focused primarily on the information asymmetry between the consumer and the trader who has used the contractual clause in question.

Since the consumer cannot be expected to follow the case law, such case law may not be decisive for the start of the limitation period (para.

56–61).

In this context, the reference to the CAJASUR Banco case (C-35/22), where the CJEU expects the trader who has used the contractual clause to inform its customers of the invalidity of the contractual provision in question (para. 58), might be considered as an indication of what the CJEU expects to establish sufficient knowledge of the consumer.

IV."
Noerr,CJEU: Beginning of the limitation period depends on knowledge of the law,"IV.

Evaluation and practical implications In practice, the question arises as to whether the German statute of limitations in the scope of application of the Directive 93/13/EEC should be interpreted beyond the wording of Section 199 the German Civil Code and whether the consumer's knowledge of the legal assessment of the facts giving rise to the claim should be required.

The better view is that such an interpretation would contradicted the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (FCJ).

The FCJ increasingly only considers an interpretation in line with a European Directives to be possible within very narrow limits and has accordingly rejected such an interpretation more frequently in recent years (e.g. FCJ, 03.11.2022, VII ZR 724/21 ; FCJ, 04.07.2023, XI ZR 77/22 ).

The prerequisite for such an interpretation is that the domestic provision actually allows for different interpretations within the framework of what corresponds to the legislative purpose and objective.

A provision that is unambiguous in terms of its wording and meaning must therefore not be given a contrary meaning and the normative content of the provision must not be fundamentally redefined (FCJ, 03.11.2022, VII ZR 724/21, para.

42; FCJ, 04.07.2023, XI ZR 77/22, para.

25).

However, this would be the case here.

This is because the legislator deliberately links Section 199 (1) the German Civil Code solely to knowledge of the facts (see BT-Drs. 14/6040 , p. 102).

It also emphasizes the need to create legal certainty and legal stability (cf. BT-Drs. 14/6040 , p. 100).

Requiring legal knowledge, as envisaged by the CJEU, would not be compatible with this legislative concept and would in fact reverse the meaning Section 199 the German Civil Code Against this background, the question arises as to whether the legislator should initiate an amendment to the Directive 93/13/EEC, in order to prevent the German regulatory concept from being abolished by the CJEU case law.

In view of the political challenges of such an endeavor, it is probably more realistic that the German provisions on limitation will be revised in the medium term, with the interest of the clause user in legal stability and legal certainty clearly taking a back seat.

This applies all the more if the CJEU's indications are understood to mean that the beginning of the limitation period depends on the user of the clause informing its customers."
Noerr,Ensuring compliance with the Digital Markets Act,"The Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector – better known as the Digital Markets Act (“ DMA ”) – entered into force in November 2022 and is applicable since 2 May 2023 (for more background information see our Noerr News article).

In September 2023, the European Commission (“ Commission ”) designated six businesses as “gatekeepers” (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft) in relation to 22 so-called “core platform services” operated by them.

These services can be considered as an important gateway between a large number of business users on the one hand and consumers on the other hand.

The Commission carries out further investigations as a result of which other companies and services may be added to the list (for further details see our Noerr News article).

To ensure compliance with the obligations under the DMA, the Commission released a compliance report template and other forms that designated gatekeepers will have to complete.

As of the compliance day (7 March 2024), gatekeepers will have to regularly submit reports showing their compliance with the DMA obligations.

The non-confidential versions will be made available to the public by the Commission.

This way the Commission will find out what third parties think and what their understanding of the market is.

Business users of the gatekeepers’ core platform services and competitors are well advised to watch this space.

In addition to the possibility of asserting rights by means of private enforcement, they will have a crucial role to help the Commission monitoring compliance of the gatekeepers (see also our Noerr News article).

Template for the compliance report explained The Compliance Report Template (“ Template ”) released last October has been further refined based on the contributions received during the public consultation on the draft template (further background information here ).

Article 11 DMA mandates the gatekeepers to “ provide the Commission with a report describing in a detailed and transparent manner the measures it has implemented to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 ”, including a non-confidential summary which will be made available on the Commission’s website.

The report must be submitted within six months after designation and updated each year thereafter.

Therefore, the gatekeepers have until 7 March 2024 to submit their first report, covering all their core platform services listed in the relevant designation decision.

The following table identifies the core platform services for which the designated gatekeepers will have to demonstrate compliance: (Click here or on the image for enlarged version)

The Template specifies the minimum of information that the Commission expects the gatekeepers to provide and is divided into five different sections after a short introduction.

The important second section lists a long, non-exhaustive catalogue of requirements regarding compliance with the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the DMA.

Each reply shall be provided in a separate and standalone annex for each core platform service.

The list requires, among other things, information regarding: the relevant situation prior to the implementation of the compliance measure, the scope of the measure in terms of the products / services / devices covered, the geographic scope of the measure, changes made in connection with the implementation of the measure, consultation with end users, business users and / or interested parties carried out in the context of the elaboration of the measure, involvement of external consultants in the elaboration of the measure, actions taken to inform end users and / or business users of the measure, relevant data supporting the effectiveness of the measures in achieving the objectives of the DMA.

Gatekeepers shall also describe the procedure granting third parties access to data, where applicable."
Noerr,Ensuring compliance with the Digital Markets Act,"Gatekeepers shall also describe the procedure granting third parties access to data, where applicable.

The Commission leaves it to gatekeepers to present the data and analysis they believe to be most appropriate to assess effectiveness and compliance with the DMA obligations.

The other sections of the Template deal with information about the reporting undertaking, its compliance function and policies, the provision of a non-confidential summary of the report and the declaration of completeness, correctness and truthfulness.

Failure by a gatekeeper to provide true, correct and complete information may be directly associated with non-compliance.

The Commission expects the reports to play a fundamental role in assessing gatekeepers’ compliance with the obligations foreseen in the regulation and are keen to find out what third parties think and what their understanding of the market is.

To that end, the Commission may regularly update the Template to request further information from gatekeepers and finally also decide to use its investigatory powers and open proceedings to adopt a non-compliance decision.

Other templates The Commission has also published other relevant templates that designated gatekeepers will have to follow to ensure compliance with the DMA: The Article 8(3) DMA Template (request for specification dialogue) specifies the information needed to launch a request to engage in a specification process with the Commission which determines whether the intended or implemented compliance measures are effective in achieving the objective of the relevant obligation.

The gatekeeper must also provide a non-confidential version of the reasoned submission explaining the measures which may be shared with third parties.

The Article 9 DMA Template (suspension request) specifies the information needed to launch a request for suspension, in whole or in part, of a specific DMA obligation due to exceptional circumstances beyond the gatekeeper’s control which would endanger the economic viability of its operations in the EU.

The Article 10 DMA Template (exemption request) specifies the information needed to launch a request to be exempted, in whole or in part, from a specific DMA obligation based on grounds of public health or public security.

The Article 14 DMA Template (information on transactions) specifies the minimum information to be provided by gatekeepers to the Commission of any intended concentration within the meaning of Article 3 of the EU Merger Regulation, where the merging entities or the target of concentration provide core platform services or any other services in the digital sector or enable the collection of data.

The Article 15 DMA Template (consumer profiling report) specifies the information to be provided by gatekeepers to the Commission about all techniques used for profiling of consumers applied to or across the core platform services.

The report must contain the assessment of an independent auditor on the completeness and accuracy of the description and a non-confidential overview of the report shall be made publicly available by the gatekeeper.

Both the description and the overview must be updated each year thereafter.

The Commission also released a Power of Attorney Template .

The non-confidential summary of the compliance report should enable third parties to scrutinise and eventually provide the Commission with contributions regarding the gatekeepers’ compliance with the regulation and possibly also propose alternative benchmarks.

Hence, the compliance reports will be a tool in particular for business users to evaluate whether the gatekeepers propose and adhere to effective compliance with the DMA obligations.

Noerr,Assigning external personnel from one country to work in another country: ECJ judgment defines possibilities for withdrawing A1 certificates,"In its judgment of 16 November 2023, the ECJ defined the possibilities for withdrawing A1 certificates.

Employers who use these certificates in practice should take precautions, as a withdrawal will have far-reaching consequences.

Background When personnel are assigned to work temporarily in a different country, questions often arise as to their correct classification under social security law and the related obligation to pay contributions.

Where assignments within Europe are involved, the assessment is usually simple: if a person only works temporarily in another country (country of assignment) and can prove that they remain subject to the social security law of their home country (country of origin) during their assignment, then they are not required to pay contributions to the social security system of the country they are assigned to.

Proof that they are currently subject to the social security system in their country of origin is provided by what is known as an A1 certificate, which is issued by the social security institutions of the Member States.

In a 2018 judgment the ECJ commented on the binding effect of such an A1 certificate and stated that: The social insurance findings in an A1 certificate are binding both for other social insurance institutions and for the courts.

As long as such an A1 certificate has not been withdrawn or declared invalid by the competent institution, it remains binding, even if the fulfilment of the condition on which it was issued is questionable or if circumstances subsequently arise that give rise to doubts.

A certificate has binding effect even if issued retroactively.

Since just having an A1 certificate makes it possible to avoid any requests from social insurance institutions in the country of assignment, unsurprisingly, A1 certificates are widely used in practice and are frequently recommended as an effective means of creating more legal certainty for cross-border personnel assignments.

As explained, the ECJ stated that the certificate would remain binding as long as it had not been withdrawn by the competent social insurance institution.

The ECJ has now ruled precisely on this topic, which is the reason for this update.

The Court’s decision The ECJ now states that: The insurance institution issuing an A1 certificate is authorised to withdraw the certificate at any time.

Withdrawal may take place without initiating a dialogue and conciliation procedure with the social insurance institution of another state.

Withdrawal may be issued retroactively.

The Court justified its decision by stating that the binding nature of A1 certificates is based on the principle of sincere cooperation under Article 4(3) of the TEU, which in turn implies the principle of mutual trust.

It pointed out that this requires the issuer of the certificate to carefully examine and properly assess the facts of the case.

Moreover, the social security institutions of the other Member States are entitled to expect the issuer to fulfil its obligation to apply the law correctly.

It stated that since a situation can change significantly over time, however, the aforementioned principles also imply that the issuer must check the accuracy of the information and findings throughout the entire period of assignment and, if necessary, withdraw the A1 certificate if it determines that the conditions for issuing it are not (or no longer) met.

The Court continued that Article 5 of Regulation (EC)

No 987/2009, which is the central legal norm concerning A1 certificates, does not require a dialogue and conciliation procedure before withdrawal of an A1 certificate, which is why there is no obligation to adopt such a procedure."
Noerr,Assigning external personnel from one country to work in another country: ECJ judgment defines possibilities for withdrawing A1 certificates,"The Court explains that this also aligns with the purpose and intent of the procedure, which was created as a means of resolving disputes between social insurance institutions of different Member States: if there are no such disputes because the issuing social insurance institution withdraws the certificate of its own motion due to changed circumstances, there is no reason to conduct a dialogue and conciliation procedure.

Finally, although the withdrawing institution is not obliged to consult in advance, the principles of sincere cooperation impose an obligation on it to inform, as soon as possible, both the persons concerned and the other social insurance institutions involved of the withdrawal and to communicate to them all the information and data necessary for the further assessment of the facts under social insurance law.

Withdrawal has far-reaching practical consequences This judgment should make practitioners sit up and take notice as it clearly demonstrates that an A1 certificate’s binding effect is not absolute and its withdrawal will have far-reaching consequences.

The (subsequent) negation of an A1 certificate’s binding effect will often mean that the assigned persons are no longer subject to the social security system of their country of origin, but rather to that of the country of assignment.

It is certainly not difficult to imagine the practical difficulties associated with the retrospective processing of such status changes.

In addition, substantial financial burdens may result from additional claims by the country of origin’s social insurance institution.

In some cases, like in Germany, these burdens are paired with regulations that allow only limited recourse to employees, thus placing the burden of contributions entirely on the employer in cases of doubt.

Although there will usually be a claim for reimbursement against the country of origin’s social insurance institution, the lack of offsetting options, differences in the contribution rates and the special requirements of the procedures to be followed in each case will often mean that this is unlikely to provide significant relief.

In spite of this, employers who use A1 certificates in practice should not be advised to discontinue their use.

Nevertheless, they should be advised to always conduct detailed and well-substantiated preventive checks and maintain documentation to ensure, to the extent that they can, that the prerequisites for issuing an A1 certificate are actually met.

This should be incorporated into future approval processes, if this has not already occurred.

In addition, domestic employers should safeguard their legal interests in contractual arrangements by including notification obligations and rights to verify compliance.

They should also protect themselves commercially by including appropriate remuneration provisions."
Noerr,Updated Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular on the treatment of income from employment under double tax treaties,"On 12 December 2023, the Federal Ministry of Finance published the fourth version of its circular on the tax treatment of income from employment under double taxation treaties (DTTs) (hereinafter the “ Circular ”).

The revision focuses on consolidating various Federal Ministry of Finance circulars and integrating current case law, but also provides specific in-depth comments on subjects like the treatment of signing bonuses (see point 9. below) and new opinions on topics like working from home (see point 15.

below).

The tax authorities’ efforts to offer a clearer overview of the various official statements and increase legal certainty for users, as seen especially by the inclusion of additional examples, are to be welcomed, especially in light of the complexity of the topics.

The Circular is intended to apply to all open cases and replaces the circulars dated 3 May 2018 and 22 April 2020.

The relevant adjustments can be summarised as follows:

1. Limitation of the priority of DTTs by the Tax Haven Defense Act ( Steueroasen-Abwehrgesetz , StAbwG )

The German Tax Haven Defense Act has introduced a treaty override in sec 1 para.

3 sent.

2 that provides that DTTs cannot limit Germany’s domestic taxation rights when the other contracting state is a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction.

The Federal Ministry of Finance has implemented and clarified this requirement (mn. 6) and named Trinidad and Tobago as an example (mn. 407).

2. Residency The Federal Ministry of Finance elaborates on its previous statements and points out that residency for DTT purposes must always be examined independently.

Neither a Certificate of Residence, nor tax treatment in the other contracting state is relevant (mn. 7).

In this context, it is furthermore made clear that residency for DTT purposes and domestic tax liability are to be examined independently of one another (mn. 8).

This distinction is logical since they relate to two different nexus.

Furthermore, the Federal Ministry of Finance regards Art. 4 para.

1 sent.

2 of the OECD Model Convention on Income and on Capital (hereinafter the “ OECD MTC ”) as declaratory.

It provides that a person is not a resident for tax purposes of a contracting state if only source taxation applies in that state.

Residency for DTT purposes therefore only applies to individuals who are taxed on the basis of their world-wide income in Germany, whether or not the applicable DTT includes a provision corresponding to Art. 4 para.

1 sent.

2 of the OECD MTC.

However, a deemed unlimited tax liability ( fiktive unbeschränkte Steuerpflicht ), as is provided for in sec.

1 para.

3 of the German Income Tax Act ( Einkommensteuergesetz , ITA ), is not sufficient to establish residency for DTT purposes (mn. 9).

In cases of dual residency and where a person's centre of vital interests has to be determined, the Federal Ministry of Finance assumes that personal and economic ties should be given equal weight when carrying out the necessary evaluation of these two criteria (mn. 14).

The catalogue of relevant personal or economic ties has been significantly widened, with distinctions now made between income and assets with regard to economic ties (mn. 15, 16).

This will provide legal practitioners with significantly more guidance than before.

Regarding personal ties, the Federal Ministry of Finance upholds the rebuttable presumption, already expressed in the existing examples, that for secondments of up to one year, an individual’s personal ties remain in the state of their usual living place.

Conversely, for secondments exceeding five years, the opposite is presumed to apply (mn. 18).

In addition, further examples to assist in determining residency are provided in marginal numbers 19 to 23.

3."
Noerr,Updated Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular on the treatment of income from employment under double tax treaties,"In addition, further examples to assist in determining residency are provided in marginal numbers 19 to 23.

3.

Definitions: salaries, wages and similar remuneration In the opinion of the Federal Ministry of Finance, the terms “salaries, wages and similar remuneration derived from employment” under DTT law should be interpreted in accordance with the lex fori rule in Art.

3 para.

2 of the OECD MTC and be based on the national tax law of the state applying the treaty.

In Germany, sec.

1 and 2 of the Wage Tax Implementing Ordinance ( Lohnsteuer-Durchführungsverordnung, LStDV ) are relevant for this (mn. 28).

The Federal Ministry of Finance also refers to sections H 19.0 to H 19.2 of the Wage Tax Guidelines ( Lohnsteuerhinweise, LStH ) on the distinction between income from self-employment and employment.

4. Remuneration of partners of a partnership for activities in the service of the partnership The Federal Ministry of Finance has added statements on the treatment of remuneration of partners of a partnership for activities in the service of the partnership (mn. 32 ff.).

The treatment of such remuneration was already based on sec.

50d para.

10 ITA and the Federal Finance Ministry circulars of 26 September 2014 (application of DTTs to partnerships) and 10 November 2021 (corporation tax option pursuant to sec.

1a of the Corporate Income Tax Act ( Körperschaftsteuergesetz, KStG )).

5. Expiry of the limitation period for assessment is not a waiver of taxation The tax authorities have adopted the Federal Finance Court’s ( Bundesfinanzhof, BFH ) previously unpublished judgment of 10 October 2018 (I R 67/16), according to which the expiry of the time limit for a foreign country to assess taxes does not constitute a waiver of taxation within the meaning of sec.

50d para.

8 sent.

1 ITA (mn. 69).

6. Limitations on deducting pension expenses The Circular also contains changes to the statements on handling limitations on pension expense deductions, in particular it addresses the possibility of taking into account pension expenses that are directly economically related to employment income originating from EU/EEA countries or Switzerland (mn. 95).

However, these changes do not provide any new insights beyond those already codified in sec.

10 para.

2 sent.

1 no. 1 ITA.

Furthermore, the Circular now contains an illustrative example how to allocate deductible and non-deductible pension expenses in relation of the taxable remuneration to the total remuneration (mn. 96 ff.).

7.

Employee secondment

The comments on the secondment of employees in the Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular of 9 November 2001 have been incorporated in the present Circular.

As a result, the Circular now contains, for example, a definition of what constitutes a secondment and what is excluded (mn. 149, 150), comments on the company’s operational interest in the secondment, including the factors that are indicative of this (mn. 159, 160) and the effects of a rotation system (mn. 174, 175).

What is also new is that employers are required to certify to their employees the amount of remuneration, employee-related expenses and payroll administration costs passed on in accordance with the arm’s length principle and the amount of these costs borne by the company sending the employee (mn. 167).

This certificate establishes a rebuttable presumption that the costs listed are in line with the arm’s length principle (mn. 167).

In relation to executives, such as managing directors or board members, the Circular takes into account the Federal Finance Court’s judgment of 4 November 2021 (VI R 22/19)."
Noerr,Updated Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular on the treatment of income from employment under double tax treaties,"In relation to executives, such as managing directors or board members, the Circular takes into account the Federal Finance Court’s judgment of 4 November 2021 (VI R 22/19).

According to this judgment, a domestic company can also be the (economic) employer of an executive even if no separate remuneration has been agreed for the work at the domestic company, or if the work is to be specifically performed without a charge, and the part of the salary that is attributable to the executive’s work at the domestic company is already included in the total salary abroad (mn. 178).

8.

Principles for determining taxable/tax-exempt remuneration The Federal Ministry of Finance has introduced punctual changes to the principles for determining taxable and tax-free remuneration.

Employees can now provide evidence of their work activities in another state by submitting a travel diary (mn. 225).

Furthermore, the Federal Ministry of Finance has now provided specific examples of expatriation allowances, which are directly attributable remuneration components (mn. 227).

9.

Signing bonuses The revised Circular provides more comprehensive rules on signing bonuses (mn. 249 ff.).

Unlike the previous administrative direction, the new Circular now distinguishes between repayable and non-repayable signing bonuses that are granted for a specific job yet to be commenced.

For repayable signing bonuses, the right to tax is determined based on the places where the work is performed during the vesting period.

However, for non-repayable signing bonuses, there is no vesting period, which is why the right to tax remains with the state where the employee resides.

Fixed-term employment contracts are an exception to this rule because, in these cases, it is generally not possible to terminate the contract in advance.

The vesting period is then the contract term.

The Federal Ministry of Finance still has not clarified how to categorise signing bonuses that are intended solely as an incentive for an employee to sign an employment contract.

Clarification in this regard from the Federal Ministry of Finance in the course of future amendments to the Circular would be helpful.

10.

Stock options The updated Circular takes into account recent developments favouring employee stock options.

This is reflected in the reference to the introduction of sec.

19a ITA (mn. 278).

However, the tax-free amount pursuant to sec.

3 no. 39

ITA mentioned in marginal number 278 is already outdated due to a recent change in the law (the amount is now €2,000 instead of €1,440).

It is encouraging that a further example for determining the taxable component of employee stock options has been introduced to help practitioners better understand how taxes on employee stock options are calculated (mn. 288).

11.

Phantom shares

The Federal Ministry of Finance has commented for the first time on the treatment of phantom shares (mn. 290 ff.).

According to the Circular, the allocation of virtual dividends should follow the general principles for remuneration that cannot be directly allocated (mn. 292).

12.

Tax equalisation mechanisms The content of this section has been revised and expanded to include even more examples.

A distinction is now made between tax equalisation and tax protection (mn. 317 ff.).

It is pointed out for the first time that the principles also apply to social security contributions assumed as part of a net salary agreement (mn. 323).

The test sequence has also been modified.

Previously, the first step was to check whether there was an employer obliged to withhold wage tax pursuant to sec.

38 para.

1 ITA; now, the first step is to check whether there is a net or gross remuneration agreement (mn. 324 ff.).

13.

Secondment allowances The Circular now addresses the treatment of secondment allowances for the first time (mn. 339)."
Noerr,Updated Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular on the treatment of income from employment under double tax treaties,"13.

Secondment allowances The Circular now addresses the treatment of secondment allowances for the first time (mn. 339).

In general, these allowances are considered salary components that can be directly attributed to the state of the host company if they are intended to compensate the employee for the costs and difficulties of living in the host company’s country.

However, if the allowances are remuneration for work performed for the host company, they are considered compensation that cannot be directly attributed to secondment and must therefore be apportioned.

The Federal Ministry of Finance presumes that remuneration cannot be directly attributed to a secondment if the secondment allowance is granted even though the employee remains in their country of residence for several months (e.g. home office).

This presumption is understandable as it is unlikely in these cases that the allowance is compensating the employee for the difficulties of living in another country.

14.

Assumption of tax consultancy costs Marginal numbers 345 and 346 of the Circular adopt the Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular of 22 April 2020, which itself supplemented the previous circular of 3 May 2018.

However, there are no changes in this respect.

15.

Home office In an endeavour to reflect the increased prevalence of employees working from home in cross-border situations, the Federal Ministry of Finance has laid down some basic rules in marginal number 350 and following and included an example to illustrate them.

Where there is a mix of home- and office-based work within one day, the work should, for example, be divided on a pro rata temporis basis.

This approach by the tax authorities is consistent with the treatment of professional drivers who work in several countries within a single working day (mn. 384) and is therefore logical.

Ultimately, however, the Circular notes that, except for certain DTTs, in absence of specific rules, the general rule of apportioning remuneration on the basis of actual working days applies.

Marginal number 360 provides a specific example illustrating a special feature of tax treaty law for managing directors who work from home under the DTT with Austria.

According to Art.

16 para.

2 DTT Austria, the right of taxation lies with the contracting state where the employing company is based, irrespective of the number of days the managing director works from home.

16.

Employer-funded pension The comments on employer-funded pensions now included in the Circular are mainly based on the Federal Ministry of Finance’s circular of 12 August 2021.

The declaration that remuneration can be considered to arise during the savings phase in the case of external employer-funded pensions, while this is not the case for internal pensions, is therefore not new (mn. 378).

The distinction is nevertheless relevant because when taxation occurs only in the pay-out phase, the right to tax is not generally based on Art. 15 of the OECD MTC, but rather is derived from Art. 18 or Art.

21 of the same Convention (mn. 379).

17.

List update and miscellaneous topics In the list of DTTs, the DTT with Saudi Arabia (Aviation) has been updated with regard to personnel on ships and aircraft (mn. 416 f.).

The list of DTTs containing reversion clauses has also been updated to 1 January 2023.

In addition, for the first time, the DTT with the Netherlands includes an example of how a reversion clause is applied (mn. 421).

In addition, reference is made to the option for employees and employers to request a preliminary consultation procedure pursuant to sec.

89a of the Fiscal Code of Germany ( Abgabenordnung, AO ) for a fee.

This consultation aims to provide legal and planning certainty at an early stage before the envisaged events occur (mn. 425)."
Noerr,New German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation comes into force,"The German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation ( Wertpapierinstituts-Vergütungsverordnung ) was announced in the Federal Law Gazette (2024 I No 5) on 11 January 2024 and came into force on 12 January 2024.

Once the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) published an initial draft for consultation on 4 May 2021 and an updated version on 19 October 2022, the final version of the Regulation as provided for in section 46(3) of the German Investment Firms Act ( Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz ) has now been published after further revision.

The requirements for remuneration systems at investment firms are only rudimentarily regulated in section 46(1) of the German Investment Firms Act.

As the German Banking Remuneration Regulation ( Institutsvergütungsverordnung ) which applies to other credit and financial services institutions is not applicable to investment firms, the specification of the regulatory requirements for remuneration structures is very important in practice.

This article presents the key provisions of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation along with tips for implementation in practice.

Scope

The German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation generally applies only to the remuneration paid to the risk takers of midsize investment firms within the meaning of section 2(17) of the German Investment Firms Act.

However, the provisions of the Regulation may also apply to superordinate companies within the meaning of section 2(12) of the Regulation via groupwide regulations on remuneration (section 1(2) and section 18 of the Regulation); this also applies if the superordinate company is not an intermediate investment firm (second sentence of section 1(3) of the Regulation).

Small investment firms within the meaning of section 2(16) of the German Investment Firms Act which are not covered by the general provisions on remuneration in section 46(1) of the Act still only have to observe the provisions of EU law that are directly applicable (and of a general nature), i.e. Article 27 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565, when designing their remuneration systems.

In contrast, large investment firms within the meaning of section 2(18) of the Act still fall within the scope of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation (see section 4 of the Act in conjunction with section 25a of the German Banking Act).

When identifying their risk takers on their own responsibility, investment firms must apply the criteria set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2154.

The directors of the investment firms are always deemed to be risk takers (section 2(2) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

Appropriateness of the remuneration systems The remuneration systems for risk takers at midsize investment firms must ensure that a clear and transparent distinction can be made between fixed and variable remuneration.

In contrast to the German Banking Remuneration Regulation, specifications are made as to what fixed and variable remuneration should be paid for (section 6(1)(1) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

The fixed remuneration must essentially reflect the risk taker’s relevant professional experience and organisational responsibility in the company as stated in the their job description in their employment contract.

Variable remuneration, on the other hand, must reflect the sustainable and risk-adjusted performance of the risk taker as well as any performance above and beyond the risk taker’s job description.

The remuneration systems must also be gender-neutral, must include measures to avoid conflicts of interest and must not incentivise risk takers to take disproportionately high risks.

If the risk taker performs badly, it must also be possible to at least reduce their variable remuneration; otherwise the remuneration system is not deemed appropriate (section 6(2) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation)."
Noerr,New German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation comes into force,"Furthermore, companies must ensure that no conflicts of interest arise when structuring the variable remuneration for risk takers who are active in control units, and that the remuneration of the risk takers is made up mainly of fixed remuneration components (section 6(3) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

In this respect, the parallel provision of section 9(2) of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation, regarding which BaFin believes that variable remuneration should not account for more than a third of total remuneration, is likely to be useful as a guide in practice.

Severance payments as variable remuneration Severance payments are categorised as variable remuneration and investment firms are required to define principles in writing or electronically specifying a maximum amount or the criteria for determining the severance payment amounts (section 6(4) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

These requirements are well known from the German Banking Remuneration Regulation, as is the inclusion of privileged severance payments, which are exempt from certain regulatory restrictions (fifth sentence of section 6(4) and fifth sentence of section 5(6) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

However, there is a major difference between the provisions of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation and the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation: both of these Regulations ignore the privileged severance payments when measuring the ratio of variable to fixed remuneration and declare the regulations for determining the total amount of variable remuneration and the vesting of retained remuneration components as in applicable (section 11 of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation, section 7 of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation).

However, only the German Banking Remuneration Regulation states that the privileged remuneration does not fall within the scope of the provisions on the pro rata retention of variable remuneration, the pro rata payment in instruments and the reduction or clawback of variable remuneration (fifth sentence of section 5(6) in conjunction with section 20 of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation).

However, the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation does not contain a corresponding reference to the parallel provision of section 8 of the Regulation (see below for regulatory content).

This can have far-reaching consequences: midsize investment firms would probably not be able to pay out severance payments for risk takers as a lump sum upon termination of employment as is customary (and often necessary in practice in order to achieve an amicable exit).

General requirements for variable remuneration As in the German Banking Remuneration, there are general guidelines on how the variable remuneration must be structured (section 7 of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

In practice it should be relevant that, unlike in the scope of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation, there is still no fixed upper limit for the ratio of variable to fixed remuneration (known as bonus cap).

Instead, an “appropriate” ratio is required, taking into account the business activities of the investment firm, the associated risks and the impact that the activities of the risk takers have on the risk profile of the investment firm or the assets managed by it.

It is also stipulated that the proportion of fixed remuneration must be sufficiently high to give the investment firm enough wiggle room on variable remuneration so that, if necessary, payment of variable remuneration can be waived completely.

This rule is supplemented by the fact that the risk takers must not be significantly (financially) dependent on the variable remuneration."
Noerr,New German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation comes into force,"This rule is supplemented by the fact that the risk takers must not be significantly (financially) dependent on the variable remuneration.

Bonus payments of over 200% of their fixed remuneration are therefore still possible, even if payments greatly in excess of this threshold will probably no longer be considered appropriate within the meaning of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation in future.

Entitlements to guaranteed variable remuneration may only be granted for the first year of employment of a risk taker and also require that their immediately preceding job did not take place within the same investment firm group (second sentence of section 7(4) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

When paying these sign-on bonuses, the investment firm may refrain from subjecting itself to the requirements of section 8(3) to (5) German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation on pro rata payment in instruments and pro rata retention.

However, this does not apply if the guaranteed variable remuneration compensates for lost remuneration from previous employment (third sentence of section 7(4) and section 7(5) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

Criteria for variable remuneration, assessment period, performance evaluation Like in the German Banking Remuneration Regulation, criteria for calculating variable remuneration are specified (first sentence of section 8(1) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

Accordingly, the level of variable remuneration is determined by the individual performance contributions of the risk taker, the performance contributions of the business unit concerned and the overall performance of the investment firm.

With regard to the individual performance of the risk taker, both financial and nonfinancial parameters must be taken into account; in the case of risk takers in control units, only nonfinancial parameters may be used (section 8(2) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

The assessment period for the performance contributions must be at least one year, while the final performance assessment must cover a timeline of more than one year (second and third sentences of section 8(1) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

According to the explanatory memorandum to the bill dated 18 October 2022, this rather cryptically worded combination of assessment period and timeline for performance measurement is to be implemented in such a way that the level of variable remuneration can be determined after one year, but an ex-post risk adjustment can then be carried out in accordance with section 8(3) to (6) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation (see below) to take into account the multi-year measurement of performance.

However, the provisions of section 8(3) to (6) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation do not apply to investment firms that do not reach the thresholds set out in the second sentence of section 44(3) of the German Investment Firms Act.

Furthermore, the requirements also do not apply to variable remuneration which is less than €50,000 per year before tax and does not account for more than a quarter of the total annual remuneration of the risk taker concerned (section 10 German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation).

For these investment firms, the question therefore arises as to how performance after one year is to be assessed in concrete terms.

The explanatory memorandum to the bill states vaguely that the requirements can be met by selecting “suitable remuneration parameters”, for example by including the performance assessment from previous years in the decision regarding remuneration or by using remuneration parameters based on a forward-looking policy, such as a multi-year earnings plan).

In practice, this is likely to result in targets achieved at annual level being “logged in” and subsequently adjusted using multi-year assessment factors."
Noerr,New German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation comes into force,"In practice, this is likely to result in targets achieved at annual level being “logged in” and subsequently adjusted using multi-year assessment factors.

This mechanism will have to be taken into account when drawing up future bonus agreements.

Ex-post risk adjustment The provisions on the ex-post risk adjustment of variable remuneration are found in section 8(3) to (6) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation.

They are largely based on section 20 of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation and stipulate that at least 50% of a risk taker’s variable remuneration must consist of instruments with a vesting period of at least one year.

Furthermore, at least 40% of the variable remuneration must be withheld over a period of three to five years; if the remuneration is particularly high – over €500,000 per year before tax according to the threshold in section 8(5) of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation – the proportion to be withheld must be at least 60%.

Finally, malus and clawback provisions must be agreed, based on which the variable remuneration can be reduced or reclaimed in certain circumstances.

In particular, variable remuneration is to be “appropriately reduced” in the event of a “weak or negative financial result” at the investment firm.

This raises the question of what a “weak” financial result is.

In any case, it is to be welcomed that this provision has been significantly toned down compared to the bill of 18 October 2022, which provided for variable remuneration to be reduced by up to 100% in the case of a weak financial result.

This was corrected in the new version, probably also due to the anticipated conflicts with employment law principles.

Transition period The transitional provision in section 19 of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation, which is important in practice, was also added to the final version of this Regulation.

According to this, most of the core provisions of this Regulation that are important in day-to-day business (including those relating to the assessment of severance payments, the commitment to guaranteed variable remuneration, the design of bonus criteria and assessment periods as well as the requirement for ex-post risk adjustment) must be applied for the first time at the beginning of the financial year following the year in which the Regulation comes into force.

At least those midsize investment firms with a financial year corresponding to the calendar year therefore have until 1 January 2025 to adapt their remuneration systems to the new requirements.

Adjusting existing agreements In this context, there is the question of how to deal with existing agreements that do not comply with the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation.

Section 16 of this Regulation (analogous to section 14 of the German Banking Remuneration Regulation) stipulates that investment firms must endeavour to ensure that noncompliant contracts, company or service agreements and company practices are amended without delay, insofar as this is legally admissible.

The adjustment must be made using a sound legal assessment of the legal situation that is comprehensible to third parties and takes into account the specific prospects of success.

The HR departments of the investment firms concerned would be very well advised to analyse the service or employment contracts with the (current and newly identified) risk takers and also to review any collective bargaining agreements on the subject of variable remuneration.

Conclusion The German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation represents a fundamentally welcome fine-tuning of the requirements for structuring remuneration at midsize investment firms, which practitioners have been waiting for some time."
Noerr,New German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation comes into force,"Regarding the provision applicable to the structure of remuneration, different, clearly definable categories of investment firms have been formed: small investment firms with rudimentary provisions in EU law, midsize investment firms, which in turn must be divided into two groups with regard to certain provisions of the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation, and

large investment firms covered by the German Banking Remuneration Regulation.

In terms of content, the German Investment Firms Remuneration Regulation is closely modelled on the German Banking Remuneration Regulation, so there are significant differences to the latter only in certain areas, although these may well be relevant in practice."
Noerr,The “new kid on the block”: the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"The new EU regulation on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market (“ Foreign Subsidies Regulation ”) has been in full force since the end of last year.

It aims to ensure more equal opportunities and a level playing field in the EU internal market.

In addition to EU law on State aid, merger control, public procurement and foreign trade, subsidies granted by non-EU countries to companies can now be thoroughly investigated for their possible effect on the EU internal market.

The standard of substantive investigation, which is still unclear, is likely to be largely based on EU State aid law principles.

The new Regulation provides the European Commission with three tools for investigating foreign subsidies.

The European Commission has announced that it will make increasing use of its new investigative powers in the coming months and intends to progressively create the necessary capacities.

M&A transaction tool From now on, in addition to other possible regulatory notification obligations (such as merger control), companies involved in M&A transactions will be subject to a supplementary notification obligation if certain statutory thresholds are exceeded.

This is paired with a standstill obligation subject to a fine until “clearance” by the European Commission.

Consequently, compliance with the supplementary notification obligation should already be taken into account when drafting contracts and in due diligence processes (“M&A readiness”).

Ascertaining whether or not a company is subject to a notification obligation requires a substantial amount of information and careful preparation.

For this reason, companies should establish an internal reporting system despite the significant expenditure of time and resources.

Similar to clauses regarding merger control notification, the contracts must likewise reflect information gathering, notification and the standstill obligation.

The importance of M&A readiness has become apparent by the appreciable number of notifications and pre-notifications to the European Commission in the first few weeks since the notification obligation entered into force.

It seems that considerably more than the estimated 30 notifications per year are to be expected.

Public procurement tool If the thresholds established in the Regulation are exceeded, the notification obligation also extends to public procurement procedures.

In this case, the notification must be submitted together with the submission of a tender or the request to participate in procurement procedures.

Ex-officio investigation tool Another important wide-ranging control over foreign subsidies results from ex-officio investigative powers.

In this respect, the European Commission has very broad discretionary powers regarding when to initiate an investigation on its own initiative.

Companies may also use complaints to the European Commission to instrumentalise the ex-officio investigation tool against their competitors.

However, the European Commission has responded with restraint to the first complaints, which were lodged by football clubs and associations last year.

The European Commission stated that it would initially prioritise investigations under the M&A transaction and public procurement tool.

Nevertheless, the European Commission recently announced its intention to make use of its new powers with regards to the wind energy sector.

Companies have been explicitly requested to report potentially unfair, competition-distorting circumstances.

Thus, it remains unclear to what extent companies will be able to use the ex-officio investigation tool as a “sharp” or merely “dull” sword against competitors.

Noerr,Almost two years of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and other topics from the world of distribution antitrust law,"Although it is almost two years old, the Block Exemption Regulation on Vertical Agreements (“ Vertical Block Exemption Regulation ”), which was updated in May 2022, and the associated guidelines continue to raise issues in distribution antitrust law.

Vertical agreements between companies at different stages of the production or distribution chain are exempted from the prohibition of cartels under the conditions of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (safe harbour).

In particular, innovations in online sales and distribution, online trading platforms and hybrid platforms, as well as the sharing of information in dual distribution, give rise to a particular need for advice in practice, as already described in our Competition Outlook 2023 .

We expect this to remain the focus in 2024.

Although the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and Vertical Guidelines already contain helpful information clarifying the aforementioned topics compared to the previous versions, which are no longer valid, there are some pitfalls that are not obvious at first glance and that can quickly lead to a breach of antitrust law and should be avoided.

However, there is also room for manoeuvre which can or should be used when designing a distribution model.

In addition, the Super Bock Bebidas decision (case C-211/22) given by the European Court of Justice on 29 June 2023 should be highlighted (see our Noerr News ).

The case concerned the question of whether a supplier setting a minimum price for resale by its customers should always be regarded as a restriction of competition by object.

Such price fixing is a “hardcore restriction” within the meaning of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, and therefore such an agreement is excluded from the safe harbour of the block exemption.

However, it must be examined on a case-by-case basis whether it restricts competition by object or by effect.

The European Court of Justice has clarified that the category of “hardcore restriction” cannot be equated with the category of “restriction of competition by object”.

If an agreement is a restriction by object, a competition authority no longer has to review and prove adverse effects on the market in order to establish that there is an infringement of the prohibition of cartels.

This significantly reduces the effort required by the competition authorities to investigate the matter.

However, according to the European Court of Justice, classifying a restriction as a restriction by object is justified only in exceptional cases.

The mere fact that an agreement constitutes a hardcore restriction does not release the competition authority from its duty to prove that there has been an infringement of EU competition law.

The competition authority must take into account the specific circumstances of each case in order to be able to presume a restriction by object.

It is true that this decision has increased the burden of proof for the authorities.

However, it should not be seen as an open invitation to engage in vertical price fixing, the prosecution of which is a priority for many competition authorities and is likely to remain so.

Noerr,Digital antitrust law in Germany: one step ahead,"The 11th Amendment to the Act against Restraints of Competition (“ ARC ”), which came into force on 7 November 2023, also introduces legislative changes intended to boost the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act (“ DMA ”) (see our Noerr News article ).

The new section 32g of the ARC gives Germany’s Federal Cartel Office the power to investigate designated gatekeepers for possible violations of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the DMA.

As provided for in the DMA, the Federal Cartel Office is thus able to support the European Commission, which is solely responsible for enforcing the DMA.

Besides supporting the European Commission, this investigative power serves to distinguish between DMA proceedings and antitrust proceedings.

Alongside this, the private legal enforcement of the DMA is supported by changes to section 33 onwards of the ARC.

The 11th Amendment to the ARC largely extends the mechanisms for facilitating private enforcement in antitrust cases (introduced to implement the Antitrust Damages Directive) to include breaches of the DMA.

This extension applies to follow-on actions, for instance.

On the other hand, the presumption of harm in the antitrust damages claim (first sentence of section 33a(2) ARC) has not been extended.

It will remain interesting to see how the DMA interacts with section 19a ARC.

There will still be room for the Federal Cartel Office to apply section 19a ARC, especially where gatekeepers are subject to more comprehensive obligations under national antitrust law (see Article 1(6) DMA).

The Federal Cartel Office’s decision on commitments in the Alphabet/Google’s data processing case ( B7-70/21 ) illustrates how these provisions can work together in the future as well.

In addition to closely coordinating its actions with the European Commission, the Federal Cartel Office limited its investigation under section 19a(2) ARC after the designation of Alphabet as a gatekeeper to services that were not designated as a core platform service.

In 2023, the Federal Cartel Office took action against Alphabet/Google in two further proceedings under section 19a(2) ARC.

With regard to the news platform Google News Showcase ( V-43/20 ), the Federal Cartel Office refrained from issuing a commitment decision after Google had made adjustments.

One thing Google did was to abandon its very questionable plans to integrate Google News Showcase into the Google search.

This means that the participation of press publishers in Google News Showcase will not affect the ranking of search results in general Google searches in future.

The Federal Cartel Office is monitoring the implementation of the measures.

The Federal Cartel Office also issued a warning to Google in relation to practices in connection with Google Automotive Services.

To date, the Federal Cartel Office has not yet issued a prohibition order (section 19a(2) ARC) against one of the companies it has classified as being of paramount significance to competition across markets.

The antitrust concerns are to be eliminated by the measures taken.

In addition to Alphabet/Google, only Meta has so far been legally determined as being of paramount significance.

The proceedings against Amazon and Apple have not yet been finalised, as both tech companies have lodged an appeal against the Federal Cartel Office’s determination with the Federal Court of Justice.

On 28 March 2023, the Federal Cartel Office initiated the fifth proceedings in total to review Microsoft’s status as being of paramount significance.

Noerr,Court reviews investment control,"For the first time in the history of German foreign direct investment (“ FDI ”) control, Berlin Administrative Court repealed two decisions of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz , “ BMWK ”) in 2023.

The first decision concerned the acquisition of an interest in PCK Raffinerie GmbH in Schwedt.

The company is the operator of the most important crude oil refinery in eastern Germany, supplying 95% of Berlin und Brandenburg with fuels.

Austrian acquirer Alcmene GmbH, whose parent company is based in Guernsey, had notified the BMWK of the transaction for investment control purposes.

However, a dispute about the validity of the purchase agreement arose between the acquirer and the seller, and the BMWK discontinued the procedure by means of a “decision”, stating that according to the seller’s submissions the share purchase agreement had become invalid.

In the absence of a legal transaction, the BMWK saw no reason for the FDI procedure to continue.

Alcmene took legal action against this decision.

By its judgment of 7 November 2023 (case No. VG 4 K 536/22), Berlin Administrative Court decided that the BMWK should not have discontinued the procedure against the will of Alcmene.

As a general rule, an investment screening procedure initiated due to a notification filed by an acquirer may be discontinued only with that acquirer’s consent.

The law provides no legal basis for a “discontinuation decision” to the detriment of the filing party.

Furthermore, the Court decided that, as a result of the expiry of the statutory screening deadline, the purchase agreement was approved by default.

Even where the validity of the contract is disputed between parties, the approval by default still applies.

Something different may apply where it is obvious that the acquisition can no longer be implemented.

However, this was not the case in the case at hand.

The second decision was about the acquisition of Heyer Medical AG, a German manufacturer of anesthesia equipment and ventilators, by the Chinese Aeonmed group.

Closing of the transaction had already occurred in 2019.

When the BMWK learnt of the transaction in April 2020, it contacted the companies involved, thereby prompting the acquirer to file an application for a certificate of non-objection with the BMWK.

In August 2020, the BMWK initiated a screening procedure and prohibited the transaction in 2022.

The reason given by the BMWK was the significance of ventilator technology during the Covid-19 pandemic.

By its judgment of 15 November 2023 (case number VG 4 K 253/22), Berlin Administrative Court overturned the prohibition.

Firstly, according to the Court, the BMWK had failed to properly hear the acquirer with respect to numerous facts which the BMWK had cited to justify the prohibition.

Secondly, the BMWK hat opened the screening procedure too late.

The period during which a prohibition was possible at the time had already expired when the procedure was opened.

The application for a certificate of non-objection did not cause the period to begin again.

These judgments significantly strengthen companies‘ procedural rights in FDI proceedings.

In particular, the hearing requirement is likely to increase the transparency and predictability of proceedings.

Noerr represented Alcmene GmbH in the FDI procedure and before Berlin Administrative Court.

Noerr,German merger control: Federal Cartel Office has a „second string to its bow“,"On 7 November 2023, the 11th Amendment to the German Act against Restraints of Competition (“ ARC ”) entered into force (see our Noerr News ).

It has significantly extended the intervention powers of the German Federal Cartel Office after the conclusion of a sector inquiry, specifically regarding merger review of transactions affecting the respective business sector (for more, see our Competition Outlook 2023 ).

Federal Cartel Office’s expanded intervention powers in merger control Since July 2005, the Federal Cartel Office has been authorised to investigate individual business sectors or types of agreements if, on the basis of corresponding circumstances, it could be assumed that competition was restricted or distorted (sector inquiry).

The Federal Cartel Office has made extensive use of this power.

Prior to the latest amendment of the ARC, publication of a final report generally constituted the final, formal end of a sector inquiry.

Specific remedial measures could only be taken by the Federal Cartel Office if the authority established in separate proceedings an infringement of the cartel prohibition or an abuse of market power.

Now that the 11th Amendment to the ARC added the new section 32f ARC, the Federal Cartel Office also has the right to take preventive action, even if an actual infringement of the antitrust laws has not yet occurred.

This new power of intervention will also have an impact on German merger control.

Where there are objectively convincing indications that future concentrations will significantly impede effective competition in the sector investigated during the sector inquiry, the Federal Cartel Office can now require undertakings in that sector to notify all future M&A transactions.

The usual turnover thresholds for German merger control will then not apply anymore.

Instead, it will be sufficient for triggering the notification obligation if the acquirer generated turnover of more than EUR 50 million and the target company of more than EUR 1.0 million in Germany.

This special notification obligation initially applies for three years but can be extended by up to three times by three years in each case.

The Federal Cartel Office will now also have the authority to order the divestment of parts of an undertaking or assets.

To that end, the Federal Cartel Office must first establish that there is a significant and continuing distortion of competition on at least one Germany-wide market and that no other appropriate remedial measures are available.

However, such a drastic order can only be issued against a market-dominant undertaking or an undertaking with paramount significance for competition across markets (section 19a(1) of the ARC).

Undertakings without significant market power but whose conduct and relevance for the market structure significantly contribute to the distortion of competition may only be subject to less invasive remedial measures.

Such measures can be conduct-related or of a structural nature and, if necessary to end or mitigate the distortion of competition, can extend to unbundling obligations at most (i.e. the accounting or organisational separation of corporate or business divisions).

Less intrusive remedial measures available to the Federal Cartel Office encompass, inter alia, ordering an undertaking to grant access to data, interfaces and networks, to require the use of certain contract types or contractual terms, or abiding by other requirements, or to establish transparent, non-discriminatory and open norms and standards.

Outlook Orders by the Federal Cartel Office which make use of its new powers of intervention are supposed to be adopted within 18 months after the final report on the sector inquiry has been published."
Noerr,German merger control: Federal Cartel Office has a „second string to its bow“,"The Federal Cartel Office has published two final reports since the new legal provisions entered into force on 7 November 2023 and, respectively, in the preceding 18 months, the Federal Cartel Office published final reports of two sector inquiries: one concerning the Municipal waste collection and hollow glass processing sectoral inquiry (28 December 2023) (currently only available in German, but available as a press release in English ) and the other concerning Online advertising sectoral inquiry (15 May 2023) (currently only available in German, but available as an executive summary and press release in English ).The

Federal Cartel Office may be considering the use of its new powers at least in these two sectors.

This is all the more possible in case of the sector inquiries concerning Refineries and wholesale fuel trade and EV charging infrastructure sectors which are still ongoing (both press releases  currently only available in German).

Noerr,Stricter enforcement of European merger control,"Concentrations in new markets and digital ecosystems are the key drivers for significant changes in the European Commission’s enforcement practice which are accompanied by a landmark judgment on review criteria and the applicable standard of proof handed down by the European Court of Justice.

Inherent uncertainty in merger control without original jurisdiction Parties to a concentration, especially in the pharma and digital economy sectors, are facing a risk that the European Commission will review their proposed transaction despite it not being originally subject to merger control either under European law or national law.

The General Court had already confirmed in 2022 that the European Commission may also review transactions which national competition authorities refer to Brussels without themselves having jurisdiction (T-227/21 – Illumina v Commission ).

The European Commission is already reviewing two other concentrations: Qualcomm/Autotalks and EEX/Nasdaq Power .

The European Court of Justice is expected to decide on the lawfulness of this procedure this year.

In addition, by its judgment of 16 March 2023 (C‑449/21 – Towercast ), the European Court of Justice enabled national competition authorities to review concentrations based on abuse of dominance control pursuant to Article 102 TFEU even where the concentrations do not exceed national thresholds and are not referred to the European Commission.

Less strict requirements of proof can make prohibitions easier In its landmark decision of 13 July 2023 (C-376/20 P – Commission v CK Telecoms UK Investments ), the European Court of Justice settled two fundamental questions: To prohibit a merger, the European Commission only needs to demonstrate that the existence of a significant impediment to effective competition “ is more likely than not” .

Contrary to the General Court’s view, it is not necessary for the European Commission to demonstrate with a “ strong probability” that such impediment exists.

Several criteria are relevant for the legal appraisal, none of which should be interpreted in an overly formalistic manner: for example, there is no general rule as to how close competitors need to be for a merger to lead to a significant impediment to effective competition; in any event, it is not only mergers between “ particularly close” competitors that may lead to such impediment.

The European Commission also does not need to demonstrate in this respect that an undertaking competes particularly aggressively – and especially not only based on competition in terms of price – to be classified as an important competitive force (for further details, please see our Noerr News article).

New theory of harm regarding digital ecosystems results in first prohibition By its decision of 25 September 2023, the European Commission prohibited Booking’s acquisition of eTraveli (M.10615 – Booking/eTraveli ) based on a new theory of harm for digital ecosystems, irrespective of its own guidelines.

Booking would have expanded its ecosystem for travel services by taking over the online flight booking portal as an important customer acquisition channel.

Without examining potential foreclosure effects as is the traditional procedure, the European Commission established that the dominant position of Booking on the market for hotel online travel agencies in the EEA would be strengthened.

The European Commission considers the new approach for digital ecosystems to be necessary and possible within the existing “flexible” framework of competition law.

Noerr,Digital Markets Act,"The gatekeepers have been designated,… The Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector – better known as the Digital Markets Act (“ DMA ”) – entered into force in November 2022 and has applied since 2 May 2023.

The objective of the Regulation is to ensure fair competition and to safeguard the contestability of the markets for digital services by regulating “gatekeepers”, i.e. companies providing the core platform services defined in the DMA.

These services can be considered a gateway between a large number of business users and consumers.

In September 2023, the European Commission designated Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft as initial six gatekeepers with regard to a total of 22 core platform services.

Further reviews are currently being carried out so that other companies may be added to the list (for further details see our Noerr News article).

… must comply with the legal do’s and don’ts,… From the compliance day (7 March 2024), gatekeepers will have to regularly submit reports about their compliance with their obligations under the DMA to the European Commission (for background information in German, see here ).

The list of obligations under the DMA distinguishes between requirements that are applicable without further specification (e.g. the prohibition of tying or bundling and the prohibition of using most-favoured nation clauses) and obligations that are directly applicable but can be further specified for the individual gatekeeper by the European Commission (e.g. the prohibition of self-preferencing).

Non-confidential versions of the compliance reports will be made publicly available by the European Commission, mainly to find out what platform users and competitors think and what their understanding of the market is.

… mainly monitored by the European Commission… The European Commission is the sole enforcer of the DMA.

However, the Member States’ competition authorities are expected to support the European Commission.

It was for this reason, for example, that the German Federal Cartel Office was conferred investigation powers (such as powers to search and seize and the right to demand information from gatekeepers) by the latest amendment to the German Act against Restraints of Competition (“ ARC ”), which has been in force since 7 November 2023 (see section 32g ARC).

… and under the watchful eyes of the market participants.

Undertakings do not only have the possibility to contribute to the gatekeepers’ compliance procedure before the competition authorities in the European Union; they may also consider asserting rights by means of private enforcement.

Steps to facilitate the enforcement of rights have already been taken in Germany.

The provisions of German competition law at least partially expand the mechanisms set out in sections 33 onwards of the ARC, which are most known from the field of cartel damages.

These mechanisms now also apply to breaches of the DMA and should make private enforcement of the DMA easier.

Noerr,Public enforcement – competition authorities active in a broad variety of industries,"Both the European Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office have been actively prosecuting cartels in a broad variety of industries and sectors in 2023.

The European Commission fined a number of players, including ethanol producers , pharma companies and defence companies .

In addition, the European Commission conducted investigations or inspections in the online food delivery sector, the construction chemicals sector, the medical devices sector, the synthetic turf sector, the fashion sector, the energy drinks sector and the fragrance sector.

Furthermore, the European Commission opened an investigation into possible anticompetitive practices by Microsoft regarding Teams (by tying or bundling Teams to Office 365 and Microsoft 365).

The Federal Cartel Office fined road builders for collusive tendering and was very active in numerous other areas.

Even after the 2022 Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, price parity clauses or most-favoured-nation clauses ( Lieferando ; PayPal ), i.e. clauses intended to ensure the best conditions possible for the party using them, remain a focus of the Federal Cartel Office.

The Federal Cartel Office is also examining whether Vodafone infringed competition law by impeding 1&1's options for co-using radio masts.

In addition, the Federal Cartel Office initiated abuse of dominance proceedings, for example with regard to discount structures ( Coca-Cola ) or in abuse of dominance control relating to energy price relief ( energy suppliers ).

As regards sustainability initiatives, the Federal Cartel Office tolerated the help granted to cocoa farmers in the relevant countries of production, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, to earn a living income.

Moreover, there were several interesting decisions by the European courts which competition authorities will have to observe in future (administrative offences and fines) proceedings.

The European Court of Justice ( judgment of 29 June 2023, C-211/22 ) clarified with regard to the concept of restriction of competition by object that it has to be interpreted restrictively and that a hardcore restriction (as defined in the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation) does not necessarily entail a restriction by object.

According to the judgment, competition authorities always have to consider and recognise the specific circumstances of the individual case (see also our Noerr News article).

The European Court of Justice ( judgment of 14 September 2023, C-27/22 ) also further specified the requirements regarding the application of the ne bis in idem principle (""double jeopardy doctrine”).

As a result, several (national) authorities investigating the same undertaking based on the same facts will have to coordinate their steps in the future, among other things.

Besides this, the General Court handed down a noteworthy decision ( judgment of 18 October 2023, T-590/20 ) where the General Court emphasised that the European Commission has particularly wide discretion when determining the amount of fines, especially when taking into account criteria to increase such fines.

However, the General Court also confirmed that the European Commission has to comply with the principle of proportionality and provide sufficient reasons for the amount determined, even in settlement procedures.

As a result of this decision, those affected (in particular companies) now have a little bit more leeway when it comes to successfully defending themselves against certain aspects, even if the competition proceedings were terminated by means of a settlement.

Noerr,Record number of judgments on level of damage in antitrust damages cases,"In the area of antitrust damages, there were more judgments in 2023 than ever before which ruled on the level of damage caused.

Some judgments were in favour of the claimants, while in others the defendants prevailed entirely or predominantly, despite assessments made by the trial judges.

Some of the legal disputes were decided on the basis of expert reports, while others were decided on the basis of a discretionary assessment conducted by the trial judge.

There was a broad range of outcomes.

Neither can it be said that discretionary assessments by trial judges led to a particularly high result (varying between 0.5% and 25%), nor did expert reports commissioned by the courts show any particular trend.

For example, Mannheim Regional Court in its judgment of 23 June 2023 found after several years of expert proceedings in a sugar cartel case that there was an overcharge of just 2%.

In other major antitrust damages cases involving drugstore products, trucks and railways, courts are currently taking evidence via expert reports, in some cases after Germany’s Federal Court of Justice referred the cases back to the lower courts.

Only a few courts are aiming for a discretionary assessment.

The Federal Court of Justice recently clarified in its judgment of 29 November 2022 in the Schlecker case that courts may not refrain from taking evidence even if the claimant’s party expert report is incorrect, due to the principle of experience that states that cartels generally lead to increased prices.

The Federal Court’s competition panel had already given similar instructions when courts rejected the defendants’ regression analyses without further examination.

In 2024, further pending appeal proceedings and upcoming initial appeal judgments on assessing damages will provide more guidance on the parameters to be observed.

This should significantly reduce the duration of antitrust damages proceedings, which are sometimes felt to be overly long.

However, it will only become apparent on a case-by-case basis whether the amounts awarded by the courts will ultimately meet claimants’ expectations of the sometimes large sums of damages they have claimed.

Even if the courts show an increasing tendency to assess the overcharge, this assessment must then be applied in the judgment to the underlying facts of the case.

This requires putting forward a sufficient factual basis for the disputed purchase transactions.

After all, in the absence of a loss-causing event, there is no loss.

Alongside assessing the level of damage, some courts are therefore currently defining the basic requirements for the claimant’s factual submission on purchase processes.

For example, Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court held in its judgment of 27 September 2023 (case number VI-U (Kart) 7/22) that a claimant must not only prove the purchase itself, but also the payment of the specific purchase price.

It remains to be seen to what extent the legislator will intervene in these principles established by the courts.

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action held a public consultation on the 12th Amendment to the Act against Restraints of Competition from 6 November 2023 to 4 December 2023, which also included questions on antitrust damages law.

Some of the questions raised related to the revision of procedural and jurisdictional rules for more effective conduct of proceedings, the involvement of the German Federal Cartel Office in proceedings and a legal presumption on the level of damage caused.

In 2024, we will therefore see which suggestions from practice the legislators will take up.

Noerr,"European State aid law – a key to the European Union’s crisis management, transformation and competitiveness","European State aid law continues to play a major role in addressing current crises and driving the green and digital transformations.

However, another core concern is increasingly to ensure that the European Union remains competitive in an international context.

These aims had a strong effect on the year 2023.

The Temporary Crisis Framework which was again revised and partially extended in March and November 2023, continues to play an important part in overcoming the energy crisis and driving the green transformation.

It continues to facilitate State aid in key areas such as generating renewable energies and the decarbonisation of the industry.

Since March of 2023, Member States have also been permitted to match subsidy initiatives in non-European countries to prevent the diversion of investments from the European Union that are strategically important for the transition to a climate-neutral economy.

The “matching aid clause” is to be understood as a reaction to non-European State aid initiatives, particularly the USA’s Inflation Reduction Act, and to increasingly intense global competition for investments.

A number of large State aid amounts were also approved in 2023 under the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy 2022 , including a State aid award of up to EUR 2 billion to support ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe in decarbonising steel production and to enable faster conversion to the use of green hydrogen.

In addition, in June of 2023 another important project of common European interest (“ IPCEI ”) by 14 Member States entailing public aid of EUR 8.1 billion for the microelectronic and communications technology industries was approved based on the European Commission’s IPCEI Communication of 2021.

The revised General Block Exemption Regulation, which entered into force in July of 2023, is likewise intended to facilitate progress, for example in renewable energies, research and development and broadband infrastructure, by raising notification thresholds.

And finally, the European Chips Act, in effect since September 2023, contributes to implementing the digital transformation.

This law is intended to mobilise public and private investment amounting to EUR 43 billion, thus making it possible to expand the semiconductor industry in the European Union.

However, the extent to which intended aid projects can actually become a reality after the German Federal Constitution Court’s “budget decision” remains to be seen.

This decision, handed down in November of 2023, found that the Second Supplementary Budget Act of 2021 was unconstitutional, thus voiding credit authorisations amounting to around EUR 60 billion for the climate and transformation fund.

Planned support for climate projects or chip factories in Germany may feel the loss of this money.

In summary, as a catalyser for crisis management and transformation, European State aid law has been responsible for some success stories.

However, it remains to be seen whether the State aid framework that has been created will result in sufficient investment to master ongoing crises while also securing the European Union’s long-term international competitiveness.

Noerr,The clean team approach in M&A & PE,"Following on from our article on the principles and content of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) from 05.01.2024 , this article deals with the special features of what is known as the “clean team approach”.

Clean teams are set up in transaction processes as an additional way of protecting highly confidential information.

In addition to an NDA, a clean team approach may be required as a further safeguard due to limitations existing under competition and data protection law.

From the seller’s and target company’s perspective, such an approach is also sometimes desirable in order to provide the best possible protection for highly confidential company data in transaction processes.

1.

General

In the case of highly confidential information, further safeguards may be appropriate or needed so that the disclosing management and the shareholders can weigh up the interests when deciding to disclose such information to a buyer.

If the buyer is a current or potential competitor of the target, a clean team approach may be the method of choice.

Information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the specific market behaviour of the target and/or the seller ( competitively sensitive information ) must be treated with the utmost confidentiality among competitors.

The idea behind setting up a clean team is to ensure that competitively sensitive information will only be exchanged within a restricted group of people.

Where necessary, this group will pass on aggregated information to decision-makers outside the clean team only, but will otherwise be obliged to maintain confidentiality.

Normally, a clean team will consist of external third parties and a limited group of the buyer’s employees who do not perform operational tasks.

Using clean teams consisting solely of external third parties, often referred to as “black boxes”, is especially advantageous for smaller companies.

Overall, the clean team approach serves as an additional safeguard to ensure that the due diligence process preceding a transaction is not misused for the unlawful exchange of competitively sensitive information between competitors under section 1 of the German Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen, GWB ) or Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.

Such a violation of section 1 of the Act against Restraints of Competition or Article 101 of the TFEU can lead to the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to section 81(1) and (2) of the above-mentioned Act and Article 23 of the Regulation on the implementation of the rules on competition law (Regulation (EU) 1/2003).

Fines of up to 10% of the company concerned’s total turnover from the previous financial year can be imposed.

Additionally, there is the risk of damages claims from the parties injured by the cartel.

The more likely it is that a transaction will be concluded (i.e. completed), the less important any safeguards to prevent the unlawful exchange of information under competition law tend to be.

2.

Key terms of a Clean Team Agreement (CTA) Standards have also been developed for the terms of clean team agreements, in particular to ensure compliance with competition law requirements during the exchange of information.

Sellers and buyers often have distinct interests in this respect as well, but they share the common goal of needing to meet minimum standards under competition law.

CTAs typically include the following elements : Parties, transaction, process phase and reference to the NDA: The parties and the transaction definitions generally align with those of the NDA (see our previous article on this), which should be referenced in the CTA.

The status of the negotiations (e.g. reaching a certain later stage in the bidding process) can also be included for clarity."
Noerr,The clean team approach in M&A & PE,"The status of the negotiations (e.g. reaching a certain later stage in the bidding process) can also be included for clarity.

Under competition law, the disclosure of information is often seen as less problematic in practice if there are increasing signs that a contract will be signed and the number of bidders has been significantly reduced.

This will often be the case when a CTA is concluded with selected interested parties at a late stage in the process.

Nevertheless, even at this stage, the conclusion of a CTA should not be waived.

The reason for this is that, especially when it comes to exchanging competitively sensitive information, the parties to the merger continue to be considered independent companies and competitors until closing.

Therefore, no information should be exchanged with persons outside the clean team, not even shortly before signing (and until closing) of the transaction.

Seller’s advisors: While often not yet included in NDAs, advisors to the seller are sometimes named in CTAs (for example, the M&A advisor or the seller’s legal counsel) as they often oversee the process of handling information (“control function”) as part of the clean team approach.

They act as a kind of filter before the information is passed on to the buyer (see below).

Definition of highly confidential information: A key reason for concluding a CTA is to separately define and protect highly confidential information.

This is a level above the “ordinary” confidential information covered under an NDA, which also applies concurrently.

Highly confidential information, i.e. competitively sensitive information in particular, must be managed separately (e.g. in a separate c lean v irtual d

ata r oom (Clean VDR)/ R ed

D ata R oom ).

It should be made clear that the seller can also designate other information as clean team information/highly confidential information at any time during a disclosure (e.g. via e-mail), and thus that the provisions of the CTA apply.

The standard exceptions for confidential information mentioned in the previous article on the NDA generally also apply here.

Clean team members: From the seller’s perspective, it is crucial to know exactly who is part of the clean team on the buyer’s side and to have the freedom to decide whether to allow certain individuals to continue as clean team members.

For this purpose, an annex containing a list of specific names of individuals (not just companies) who are initially authorised as clean team members can be helpful.

In addition, a Declaration of Acknowledgement and Accession should be attached to the CTA as an annex, which initial and subsequent clean team members who have been explicitly approved by the seller can use to accede to the CTA.

From a competition law perspective, particular caution is required if employees of the buyer are to become part of the clean team.

It is important to ensure that these individuals are not active in the operational business , especially not in a business area in which the buyer and the target are already in competition.

This typically relates to areas such as sales, purchasing, research and development and production.

Only employees in administrative and general functions (such as in the areas of finance, controlling, M&A, legal and tax) should be included.

Nevertheless, in certain cases, it may be appropriate to impose a lock-up period of around one year during which the employees concerned may not be involved in the buyer’s operational business.

The closer an affected employee is to the operational business, the more important these additional safeguards become.

Buyers often try to minimise the restrictions and include operational employees in the clean team.

However, it is also in the buyer’s interest to comply with competition law limitations, as the competition law risks apply especially to the buyer.

This is because the due diligence process provides a buyer with extensive insights into the target’s business."
Noerr,The clean team approach in M&A & PE,"This is because the due diligence process provides a buyer with extensive insights into the target’s business.

Competition authorities assume that once competitively sensitive information is exchanged, a rational company would use it to strategically adjust its behaviour.

This could lead to concerted practices among competitors and ultimately to violations of both the German and European prohibitions of cartels under section 1 of the Act against Restraints of Competition and Article 101 of the TFEU.

To avoid a competition law violation, it is also in the interests of the buyer to refrain from using operational business employees as clean team members.

Each specific case must be analysed in consultation with competition law experts.

Disclosure of highly confidential information only in aggregated form: When it comes to the disclosure of highly confidential information, the key distinction from an NDA is that such disclosure is restricted to a select group of clean team members and may not be disseminated beyond this group.

As opposed to, for example, “standard” due diligence, it is not permissible to share information and due diligence reports with the broader group of individuals covered by the NDA without limitations.

Nevertheless, it may be necessary in a specific transaction for deal team members to be informed on a need-to-know basis, at least in aggregated form, about certain insights gleaned from the highly confidential information by the clean team.

In such situations, it is common practice to provide that the buyer may receive aggregated and anonymised reports on specific subjects reviewed by the clean team.

It is necessary to ensure that these reports do not contain any competitively sensitive or other highly confidential information, such as information about customers, suppliers, prices, margins, turnover, sales figures and trade secrets, etc.

As mentioned above, the M&A advisor or, as a rule, even more appropriately, the seller’s lawyer can exercise a neutral control function .

For this purpose, it is necessary that the draft of the aggregated report first be forwarded to the seller and approved by it before being passed on to the buyer.

From the seller’s perspective, it should be ensured that the person exercising the control function has the discretion to request further anonymisation or redaction before the aggregated report is disclosed to the buyer.

Reference to or repetition of individual provisions of the NDA:

The following points are in line with our comments on NDAs in our article dated 05.01.2024 : provisions governing confidentiality; disclosure prohibition with narrow exceptions in the case of statutory disclosure obligations; voluntary disclosure by the seller; return or destruction of information; term of the agreement; protection for third parties; and substantive law, forum for disputes and other general provisions.

In this context, the CTA can also reference the concurrently applicable NDA.

However, it is often advisable to expressly repeat these provisions in the CTA for reasons of clarity.

In some cases, considering the highly confidential nature of the information, it may also be advisable to tighten certain provisions (for example, extending the duration in the CTA compared to the NDA).

3. Concluding comments In transactions where competitively sensitive information is expected to be exchanged as part of the transaction, either due to the business model or the parties concerned, it is advisable to prepare a clean team approach early on (for instance, by setting up a separate clean team data room in advance).

Sometimes, however, it only becomes apparent during the process that a clean team approach is necessary.

It will then be advisable in the individual case to decide in close consultation with competition law experts whether a comprehensive clean team approach with a separate CTA is appropriate."
Noerr,The clean team approach in M&A & PE,"It will then be advisable in the individual case to decide in close consultation with competition law experts whether a comprehensive clean team approach with a separate CTA is appropriate.

In addition to using a clean team (possibly in the form of a “black box”), it may also be possible in individual cases to disclose relevant documents only in a redacted or aggregated form."
Noerr,German Federal Court of Justice holds that arbitration clause in extra-EU BIT is compatible with EU law,"Following its pivotal decisions on the validity of arbitration clauses in intra-EU relations last summer, the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof, BGB ) once again addressed the issue of the validity of arbitration clauses in October.

However, this case did not involve arbitration proceedings between EU legal entities, but rather German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom’s application for the recognition and enforcement of an arbitration award that it had obtained against the Republic of India.

The arbitration award had been issued on the basis of the bilateral investment protection agreement concluded between the Republic of India and the Federal Republic of Germany and the proceedings had been conducted under the UNCITRAL rules.

In the recognition and enforcement proceedings, the Republic of India invoked EU law to defend itself against enforcement.

In its decision of 12 October 2023, the Federal Court of Justice ruled that the arbitration award could not be refused recognition and enforcement, especially not on the basis of EU law.

According to the Federal Court of Justice, arbitration clauses in investment protection agreements between EU Member States and third countries do not contravene EU law.

Decision of the Federal Court of Justice The Federal Court of Justice made a clear distinction between arbitration clauses with an “intra-EU dimension” and those with an “extra-EU dimension” and thus followed the approach taken in the ECJ’s Komstroy decision.

In the Komstroy decision, the ECJ explicitly stated that an underlying multilateral investment protection treaty can require EU Member States to settle disputes before arbitration tribunals if invoked by investors from third countries.

Thus, EU law does not inherently prohibit investment arbitration proceedings.

The ECJ emphasised in the Komstroy decision that only the specific intra-EU arbitration clause violated EU law.

In the opinion of the Federal Court of Justice, the reasoning in the Komstroy decision could be applied to the case before it even though the case involved a bilateral (BIT) rather than a multilateral investment treaty.

The Federal Court of Justice reasoned that after all both instruments govern the reciprocal relationship between two contracting parties.

The Federal Court of Justice did, however, refuse to apply the line of reasoning used in the CJEU’s Achmea decision, as requested by the Republic of India.

This was because the Achmea decision was based, in part, on the principle of loyal cooperation between EU Member States, a principle enshrined in EU law to ensure the application and respect of EU law.

This obligation does not apply to third countries.

The trust that exists between EU Member States that effective legal protection on the basis of a set of common values and the duty to apply EU law will be available in all Member States, including before state courts, does not apply to third countries.

Accordingly, what is referred to as the intra-EU defence, which was raised for the first time in the Achmea decision, cannot be invoked with regard to arbitration clauses in agreements between EU Member States and third countries.

Conclusion and practical implications This decision once again confirms not only the Federal Court of Justice’s commitment to EU law, but also its pro-arbitration stance.

The Federal Court of Justice has once again successfully harmonised the two areas of law by confirming that EU law does not preclude an obligation to arbitrate disputes involving third countries.

The principle of loyalty under EU law only applies in relations between EU Member States."
Noerr,Four things legal depart­ments should do now in relation to NIS 2,"The NIS 2 Directive is the subject of nearly as much heated debate as the GDPR back in 2018.

There is a lack of clarity on many points and the legislative process in Germany, in the form of the bill to transpose the NIS 2 , is still in its infancy.

However, time is of the essence, as the requirements of the NIS 2 Directive have to be transposed into national law by 17 October 2024.

After that date, there are not likely to be any real additional grace periods for companies.

At the same time, the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the responsibility of management, which is why directors ought to be aware of the topic.

Many unanswered questions Companies already dealing with the NIS 2 Directive are asking themselves various questions.

Number one on that list of questions is certainly whether their company comes within the scope of application .

Examining the annexes to the NIS2 Directive in detail often throws out a few surprises.

Is it possible, for example, for a landlord or landlady to become a “provider of managed services” (B2B) because they provide tenants with Wi-Fi access points?

How exactly should “providers of cloud computing services” be defined and are apps included as well?

How do “providers of cloud computing services” differ from “providers of online marketplaces” and “providers of platforms for social network services” which are also affected?

Closely related to this are questions of whether the applicability of the NIS 2 Directive to a group company “infects” the entire group and what thresholds in a group-context exist.

In our experience, question number two is about how comprehensively the risk management measures required by Article 21 of the NIS 2 Directive (see section of the 30 German IT Security Bill Draft) should be rolled out.

Even though the legislative process in Germany has been vague on this so far, companies are opting for a “lean” scope of application and are focussing on the processes and systems necessary for operating the relevant facilities.

From a technical perspective, companies are looking at what exactly the legislator meant by risk management measures, and how standards such as ISO 27001 harmonise with these.

Four tasks for 2024 Inhouse lawyers do not have to (and should not) wait until October 2024, however.

There are tasks they can prepare in advance right now.

Coordinate with stakeholders : Information, IT and cyber security are certainly not topics inhouse legal departments can handle themselves.

Interdisciplinary collaboration is therefore required.

It goes without saying that management and the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) should also be involved.

After all, management must approve the risk management measures and monitor their implementation, as otherwise they may be held liable (see Article 20(1) NIS 2 Directive).

A roadmap should be jointly agreed on how the company aims to handle the NIS 2 Directive.

Check the scope of application: An obvious task for inhouse legal departments is to consider whether the NIS 2 Directive will apply to their company.

However, the next two points can be tackled independently of this.

Revise supply chain contracts : It is advisable to make (important) contracts fit for purpose (see also Article 21(2)(d) and (e) NIS 2 Directive).

Simple information security clauses, which oblige contractual partners to comply with a certain standard (such as state of the art) as well as clauses on proof of certificates/attestations may be sufficient in rare cases.

In any case, if the contracting parties are to deal extensively with information relating to the companies addressed here, then detailed contracts or annexes on cyber-, IT- and information security are advisable.

These should at least include specific measures to be taken by contracting parties, including amendment obligations, audit rights and duties to provide information."
Noerr,Four things legal depart­ments should do now in relation to NIS 2,"These should at least include specific measures to be taken by contracting parties, including amendment obligations, audit rights and duties to provide information.

Old contracts in particular should be reviewed to ensure they are up to date, and renegotiated if necessary.

On this occasion, we also recommend that companies systematically record which business partners are to be informed in the event of a breach of information security protection targets.

Prepare incident plans : We have noticed when advising companies in an emergency (when there is a cyberattack, for example) that most of them do not have (up to date) incident plans (see also Article 21(2)(b) NIS Directive).

People are summoned in a rush, service providers are sought, reporting obligations reviewed for the first time and in the worst case, globally, and companies consider what else can be done and needs to be done.

As a key element of corporate governance, we strongly advise companies to have an incident plan, for example in the form of a policy.

Technically, this can be accompanied by playbooks.

But even the best plan is no use if it is not tested and continuously improved.

Of course, these are just some of the tasks currently required with a view to information and cybersecurity.

Legal departments would be well advised to keep a close eye on the legislative process in connection with the implementation of the NIS 2 Directive.

It remains an interesting time, not least because Brussels and Berlin are currently issuing many pieces of legislation on IT security.

To name but a few: DORA for the financial sector, the CER Directive (and the transposing German KRITIS umbrella act ), the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), various pieces of legislation to do with artificial intelligence, plus the Product Liability Directive and Product Safety Regulation.

We will continue to report on the future legislative processes and our practical experience.

Noerr,Non-disclosure agreements in M&A & PE transactions,"During complex bidding processes and likewise during bilateral negotiations, it is common market practice to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when preparing for a transaction.

This applies equally to strategic M&A and private equity (PE).

However, certain special features should be taken into account during processes involving PE investors.

Besides this, limitations existing under competition and data protection law may require additional safeguards to be taken by adopting what is known as a “clean team approach” or may at least make them desirable from the perspective of the seller and target company.

We will look at the basic features of the clean team approach in a follow-up article.

1.

General At the beginning of every transaction process there is an information gap between the parties involved (this may potentially exist on both sides in a planned joint venture).

An NDA can be used to take into account the differing interests of the parties with regard to the disclosure and handling of confidential information.

Although individual jurisdictions provide a certain minimum level of protection for confidential information (as in Germany, for example, under the German Protection of Secrets Act ( Geheimnisschutzgesetz, GeschGehG )), the boundaries are difficult to determine.

In addition to this, the parties involved are expressly made aware of their duties when handling confidential information.

This means that it is always advisable to enter into an NDA.

The legal consequences of any infringements (but at the same time exemptions from any obligations of the parties already existing) are set out in an NDA.

In practice, the provisions of an NDA will mostly play a role if the transaction is not carried out or individual bidders are not successful in a bidding process and confidential information is misappropriated by an unsuccessful party.

The buyer and seller have to comply with the fundamental prohibition of agreements restricting competition (section 1 of the German Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen, GWB ) (“ARC”) and Article 101 of the TFEU) and any relevant merger control clearances (the prohibition of “gun-jumping” ; for Germany and the EU: section 41 ARC and Articles 4 (1) and (7) of the EU Merger Regulation, for instance).

Other jurisdictions have similar restrictions.

In the light of this, an NDA ensures that confidential information only reaches a specific group of recipients who can only use this information for the purpose of preparing and (where appropriate following clearance) carrying out the intended transaction.

Typically, the initial draft of the NDA comes from the seller or target company, since it wishes to safeguard itself against the disclosure of confidential information.

NDAs are often underrated as standard documentation before the parties start exchanging information.

However, during a bidding process an NDA procedure can already provide an initial indication of how the individual bidders behave .

2. Key topics of an NDA Certain standards have been established for the contents of an NDA, although these focus on individual aspects depending on the market players involved.

Obviously, the interests of sellers and buyers sometimes vary.

In order for an NDA process to run efficiently during a bidding process often involving a large number of interested parties, it may be advisable to draft an NDA that tends to be seller-friendly but does not contain any extreme positions.

This should make it acceptable to most bidders in the context of general market practice without having to make any major adjustments.

a) Standard terms An NDA usually contains the following standard terms : Parties: In principle, the seller, possibly also its (direct or indirect) parent company, and the potential buyer are parties to the NDA.

In some cases, M&A advisors/investment banks and the target are included as parties as well."
Noerr,Non-disclosure agreements in M&A & PE transactions,"In some cases, M&A advisors/investment banks and the target are included as parties as well.

From the seller’s point of view, it should be ensured that the party signing the NDA on the buyer’s side has sufficient financial substance.

Special feature of PE transactions: In order to avoid a permanent establishment of a PE buyer being set up in Germany that is harmful for tax purposes, it may be considered to only include local consultancy or advisory firms and/or independent companies in Germany as parties and to expressly clarify their independence from their foreign funds.

Subject of the transaction: The subject of the transaction and the target company (group) or business should be precisely defined.

In contentious cases, this limitation of scope can be significant when it comes to interpreting the NDA.

As far as the seller is concerned, a broader definition tends to be advantageous.

Definition of confidential information and exceptions: Generally, a broad definition is chosen covering all information (in any form) relating to the transaction (including the fact that negotiations are being held), the business, the target company or companies and their shareholders.

The exceptions from information to be treated as confidential are defined in this context, such as any information that is in the public domain, is subject to a legal obligation to disclose (see below) or that (for the avoidance of doubt) has been obtained or developed independently.

Confidentiality obligation: This obligation requires parties to treat confidential information as strictly confidential and only allows them to disclose it to authorised recipients.

In addition, it should be laid down that the confidential information can only be used for a limited period of time exclusively in connection with the preparation of the transaction ( “need-to-know basis” ) and that sufficient steps must be taken to protect the confidential information.

The seller should be informed immediately if there is a suspicion that a third party has gained unauthorised access and should take steps to counter this.

Finally, it may make sense to refer to any restrictions on the use of a data room for conducting a due diligence at this stage and to include them in the scope of the NDA.

Transfer to authorised recipients:

While a seller intends to limit the group of persons receiving information, a buyer is interested in having the greatest possible flexibility and the least possible effort when transferring information.

As a rule, this includes all bodies and employees of the buyer and companies it is affiliated or partially affiliated to as well as any of their advisors who need access to confidential information in order to prepare the transaction.

Besides this, it is of course always possible to pass on information with the seller’s consent, although the seller will have to be involved beforehand.

This means administrative work for the buyer and some uncertainty as to whether approval will actually be granted.

Special features of PE transactions: Unless an all-equity deal is planned, the “bankability” of the transaction documentation has to be borne in mind.

This starts with the NDA, which should also allow the disclosure of confidential information by the buyer to potential financiers.

From the seller’s point of view, however, it may be advisable to restrict such disclosure so that in the case of a possibly large bidding field potential lenders will not be “conflicted” because they have already been approached by another bidder.

Yet this is often difficult to enforce, and finance providers are usually also able to handle several bidders by establishing different “trees” with Chinese wall agreements.

For this reason, the obligation to only approach financers in separate trees with corresponding Chinese wall agreements should already be provided for in the NDA.

The situation is similar if a seller requires W&I insurance and the bidding field is large."
Noerr,Non-disclosure agreements in M&A & PE transactions,"The situation is similar if a seller requires W&I insurance and the bidding field is large.

In this scenario, the seller also has an interest in ensuring that bidders do not approach insurance companies without its knowledge and in this way potentially block them for other bidders.

This can also be managed indirectly by allowing bidders to only pass on limited information to insurers after obtaining the seller’s approval.

In practice, however, the W&I process (including what is known as “flipping” the process from the seller’s side to the buyer’s side) is mostly only addressed at a later stage, for example in the process letters.

Lastly, financial investors on the buy side generally want the flexibility to pass information on to their portfolio companies , where they are involved in the transaction.

Whether a seller can accept this often also depends on whether there is also a financial investor on the seller’s side (for example in the context of secondaries, tertiaries, etc.) or whether a strategic seller may have to pay particular attention to avoiding arrangements that can be contested under competition law (see also the clean team approach in our subsequent article).

Statutory disclosure requirements: Disclosing confidential information is generally permitted where statutory, official or judicial disclosure obligations exist.

The parties sometimes also negotiate restrictions in this context.

It is customary to inform the seller immediately and to limit disclosures to need-to-know matters only.

The parties often differ in their assessment of the need and intensity with which the buyer is required to take action against such obligations to disclosure.

From the seller’s point of view, it may also be advisable to include a clause obligating the buyer to initially delay such disclosure (to the extent this is possible) and to confer with the seller beforehand.

Prohibition on buyer from contacting anyone outside the deal team: It can be made clear in the NDA at an early stage that the buyer and all parties associated with it may not contact anyone on the side of the seller and the target company/companies unless these contact persons have been expressly approved as points of contact .

In this way, the seller retains control over the flow of information, including within its own company.

Returning confidential information: As a rule, NDAs provide for an all-encompassing duty to return and an alternative duty to destroy or delete all confidential information.

From the seller’s point of view, this should happen unsolicited when the negotiations with the bidder have ended and always after an explicit request is made.

It is sometimes disputed whether the buyer has to prove to the seller that it has fulfilled its duties in this respect without being asked to do so.

It is common practice to include an exception for automated IT back-up systems , since deleting information from such systems can be virtually impossible or at least entail a great deal of effort and expense.

Similarly, a time-limited carve-out from the obligation to return information is often included to the extent the buyer (or its advisors) is temporarily required by law to retain such information.

From the seller’s point of view, it must then be ensured that the NDA continues to apply to such information (where appropriate for an unlimited period of time).

Retention obligations resulting solely from the buyer’s internal rules and regulations are often required by buyers, but are critical for sellers because the requirements are insufficiently specified.

Liability of the buyer: From the seller’s perspective, comprehensive liability of the buyer/the parties to the NDA (including their shareholders and affiliates) is also desirable for acts of infringement committed by their employees, advisors, banks and other authorised and unauthorised recipients of confidential information."
Noerr,Non-disclosure agreements in M&A & PE transactions,"Points to be discussed from the buyer’s perspective are often strict liability for all information recipients in the buyer’s camp and the inclusion of target companies and other parties in the seller’s camp in the scope of protection ( contract for the benefit of third parties , i.e. direct claim against the buyer under the NDA).

Depending on the applicable legal situation, from the seller’s point of view it may be advisable not to include any conclusive provisions on the liability regime apart from specific legal provisions regarding attribution of liability.

For NDAs under German law, the law in the German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB ) regarding damage, which tends to favour sellers, would apply in this respect (including claims for consequential damage).

On the other hand, buyers should work towards establishing a conclusive liability regime incorporating limits on liability.

Exclusion of liability of the seller: Conversely, the seller should exclude any liability for itself, its affiliates, shareholders and their advisors and other auxiliary persons as far as possible.

An exemption from liability for intentional and grossly negligent behaviour by agents acting on behalf of the seller (i.e. usually its lawyers and consultants) is also possible, although it is not always accepted.

It can also be made clear that the NDA does not constitute an obligation to execute the transaction and that the information is disclosed solely at the discretion of the seller.

Term, choice of law, etc.:

NDA terms of between two and three years have become established in the market.

It should also be set down that changes to the NDA can only be made by written agreement in order to ensure that documentary evidence exists.

The parties should explicitly agree on the law applicable to the NDA.

German law should be agreed for transactions in Germany or involving a German seller.

Otherwise, a local counsel from the jurisdiction concerned would have to be brought in to assess the terms and legal consequences of the NDA.

The ordinary courts of law (in Germany) or arbitration tribunals (e.g. German Arbitration Institute (DIS)) are equally customary forums for disputes under an NDA.

However, if an international bidding field is to be expected, agreeing on arbitration (in English) will be an appropriate option.

b) Optional provisions Apart from the above, the following optional provisions may also be useful in an NDA depending on the interests involved: Acting on one’s own account: An initial confirmation from the buyer that it is not acting as an intermediary or nominee of a third party and wants to carry out the transaction itself can already be included in an NDA.

Special feature of PE transactions: Often a PE buyer only wants to include a local consultancy or advisory firm of the fund or a local company (SPV) of the fund as a party to the NDA.

In such a situation, from a buy-side perspective it is important to ensure that funds advised or managed by the party or by companies affiliated with the party are not to be regarded as third parties in this sense.

Non-solicitation, non-disparagement and contractual penalty clauses: It is customary to agree a non-solicitation covenant in favour of the disclosing party, or sometimes on both sides.

Often, periods of two to three years are agreed.

Unsolicited job applications from employees and general bona fide job advertisements are normally excluded.

From a sell-side perspective, it may also be advisable to expressly prohibit any discrediting of the seller and the target companies towards contractual partners and in public.

In addition, a reasonable no-fault contractual penalty may be provided for in the event of breaches and the right to claim further damages may be reserved."
Noerr,Non-disclosure agreements in M&A & PE transactions,"In addition, a reasonable no-fault contractual penalty may be provided for in the event of breaches and the right to claim further damages may be reserved.

Data protection principles: Especially where cross-border transaction processes are anticipated, it may make sense to explicitly require compliance with the EU’s data protection regulations ( GDPR ) and to agree “standard data protection clauses” for flows of information outside the EU/EEA in advance, unless the EU Commission has adopted an adequacy decision for such jurisdictions.

Treatment of inside information and standstill agreements: If listed target companies or listed companies that are otherwise included in the scope of protection of the NDA are involved, the seller should check whether the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation apply (notably the prohibition of insider trading and unauthorised disclosure of inside information).

In order to prevent parties from “sneaking up” on listed companies through public trading venues, a standstill agreement for acquisitions on a stock exchange can also be agreed for a certain period of time.

Supplementary clean team approach (see also the follow-up article): It may make sense to already provide in the NDA that a separate clean team approach is required for particularly confidential information from a commercial, competition or data protection law perspective.

A separate clean team agreement setting out rules for handling particularly confidential information and supplementing the NDA then has to be concluded for this purpose.

As a rule, this is done at a later stage in the process and only with selected bidders.

This means that provisions for the clean team are mostly not found in the NDA yet.

However, where exclusive negotiations take place between just two parties, an additional clean team approach can also be implemented in an extended NDA.

The additional provisions for a clean team approach can then also be integrated into the NDA directly (see details in our follow-up article).

3. Closing comments NDA processes can be finalised quickly and economically on the sell side by being well prepared.

During bidding processes with PE bidders in particular, the process can be speeded up if a seller has already looked at the specific features of a financial investor on the buy side and has taken these into account in a draft NDA.

Although the NDA has now become a standard product with templates used by both sides, in the light of what has been explained above it makes sense to customise the NDA to fit the specific transaction and the interests of the parties.

This is true especially in complex and cross-border situations."
Noerr,Fiscal Court facilitates transfer of operating assets by relaxing “90% test”,"Tax advantage for operating assets The German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act ( Erb- und Schenkungssteuergesetz – “ Inheritance Tax Act ”) provides for various tax advantages for those acquiring business assets as a gift or inheritance.

The basic prerequisite for claiming them is successful completion of the “90% test” that the German legislator introduced in its inheritance tax reform of 2016 based on the requirements set by the German Federal Constitutional Court ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) in its decision dated 17 December 2014, 1 BvL 21/12.

The German Federal Fiscal Authority ( Finanzverwaltung ) conducts the 90% test on a gross basis Certain types of deemed passive assets (e.g. cash on hand, bank balances, receivables, securities, real property leased to an external party or precious metals) must constitute less than 90% of the company’s total value (business related debt is not set off against the value of the deemed passive assets).

If these “gross passive assets” constitute 90% or more of the company’s total value, the tax advantages are lost for all of the transferred company assets (“guillotine effect”).

Some strong criticism against the Fiscal Authority’s opinion has been voiced in expert literature because, at least ultimately, it also undisputedly places operating companies with a lower tangible asset value and/or a higher ratio of current assets to total assets ( Umlaufintensität ) and a larger percentage of borrowed capital at a disadvantage solely due to their business model.

For example, there are known cases on the market in which companies with a large amount of receivables and cash on hand and a high amount of debt were denied all tax advantages due to the impermissibility of setting off debt, even though, if the debt had been set off, such a low amount of passive assets would have fulfilled even the higher statutory prerequisites for “complete exemption” ( Vollverschonung ) from inheritance and gift tax.

Furthermore, the inheritance and gift tax is an “effective-date tax” ( Stichtagssteuer ), and the passive assets existing on the effective date either can only be projected with remaining uncertainties or – in the case of inheritance – are impossible to plan.

Due to the Fiscal Authority’s procedural practice, (unexpected) business events (such as receiving down payments or loan amounts being credited to an account) that occur before the effective date can cause serious tax disadvantages for the parties involved, making it necessary to monitor occurrences such as payments received on a daily basis.

Fiscal Court decision In its judgment dated 13 September 2023 (II R 49/21), which has now been published, the German Federal Fiscal Court (Bundesfinanzhof ) contradicted the opinion of the Fiscal Authority and permitted the deduction of operationally prompted debt, at least for an originally commercially active trading company, even in the context of the 90% test.

The court explained that, although the wording of the law (section 13b(2) second sentence of the Inheritance Tax Act) stated that debts were not to be set off, this wording was not free of contradictions.

The court also stated that, taking into account the law’s systematics, intention and evolution, setting off debt was to be permitted, at least for companies that pursue as their main purpose original commercial operations and that have given no reason to believe that their claim to the tax advantages is illegitimate.

Practical consequences The Fiscal Court’s decision is welcome.

Particularly for companies with comparatively few tangible assets and/or a higher ratio of current assets to total assets (e.g. service providers) and a high ratio of borrowed capital, it creates options for planning an eventual succession.

It remains to be seen whether the Fiscal Authority applies the Fiscal Court’s judgment other than on a case-by-case basis."
Noerr,Fiscal Court facilitates transfer of operating assets by relaxing “90% test”,"It remains to be seen whether the Fiscal Authority applies the Fiscal Court’s judgment other than on a case-by-case basis.

Nevertheless, ongoing monitoring of a company’s passive asset ratio retains its solid position in planning for company succession."

Noerr,12th EU sanctions package: Companies need to take action,"On 18 December 2023, EU Member States agreed on a 12th package of sanctions against Russia.

Once again, particular attention is paid to preventing the circumvention of sanctions.

For instance, exporters will be required to include reexport clauses in supply contracts (A.).

The EU is also trying to counter Russian action against Russian subsidiaries of EU companies (B.).

Import and export restrictions are being expanded, for example through the ban on importing diamonds, which was announced early on (C.).

The EU is also tightening the price cap on crude oil (D.) and adding 147 new entries to the sanctions lists (see E.).

The 12th sanctions package is implemented by Regulation (EU)

No 2023/2873 , Regulation (EU)

No 2023/2878 and Implementing Regulation (EU)

No 2023/2875 , amending Regulations (EU)

No 269/2014 and No 833/2014 which set out sanctions on Russia for individuals, goods and sectors.

The amendments to these Regulations came into force on 18 and 19 December.

A. Focus still on circumvention of sanctions and third-country business The EU’s focus remains  on preventing the circumvention of its sanctions against Russia.

The most far-reaching impact for exporters will be the new obligation to include a clause prohibiting buyers from reexporting certain goods to Russia.

Following on from the obligation to provide evidence for iron and steel imports introduced in the 11th sanctions package, the EU is once again obligating companies to take extensive action in this area.

The new Article 12g(1) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 stipulates that exporters must contractually prohibit reexport to Russia or reexport for use in Russia when selling, supplying, transferring or exporting certain goods and technologies to third countries from 20 March 2024.

The goods and technologies concerned are those listed in Annexes XI (aerospace industry), XX (jet fuels) and XXXV (firearms) of the Regulation; firearms and ammunition as listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU)

No 258/2012; and common high priority goods as listed in Annex XL of the Regulation.

The partner countries listed in Annex VIII of the Regulation – currently USA, Japan, UK, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland – are excluded from the scope of application.

According to Article 12g(2) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, the obligation does not apply to contracts concluded before 19 December 2023 that are fulfilled by 20 December 2024 at the latest or expire before then.

In the same vein, the ban on transit through Russia was expanded again.

Transit is now prohibited for goods and technology listed in Annex XXXVII of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 which are exported from the European Union.

In addition, another 29 entries were added to the list of end users of the Russian military-industrial complex and their suppliers in Annex IV of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014.

Foreign companies, e.g. from Uzbekistan and Singapore, were once again added to the list.

B. EU opposes coercive measures against subsidiaries of EU companies in Russia The EU is also using the new sanctions package to respond to the increasing Russian restrictions on European companies leaving Russia, the increase in the costs of such exits, and Russia using such transactions to reward power elites loyal to the government.

Article 3(1)(j) of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 introduces a new basis for listing persons.

This now allows the listing of Russian companies that were previously owned or controlled by EU companies if the Russian government has forced the transfer of ownership or control.

Natural persons and companies that have benefited from such a forced transfer can also be listed.

In addition, a separate exemption is created for the new listing ground in the new Article 5b of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014."
Noerr,12th EU sanctions package: Companies need to take action,"In addition, a separate exemption is created for the new listing ground in the new Article 5b of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014.

Accordingly, EU Member States can authorise the release of certain frozen funds and resources or provision to such companies in individual cases subject to conditions.

To do so, however, Member States must establish that the resources are to be used as consideration – either contractually agreed or determined by the Russian government – in a forced company transfer.

No companies or subsidiaries known in the market have been listed so far in the 12th sanctions package on this new legal basis.

Therefore, the introduction of the new listing ground seems to be above all a political move.

C. Additional restrictions on the flow of goods and capital The Member States have agreed on a ban on the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of diamonds of Russian origin.

This far-reaching ban applies to diamonds originating in Russia as well as diamonds exported from Russia as well as to diamonds that have been transported through or processed in Russia.

The bans will generally apply from 1 January 2024, with the indirect ban on imports from third countries to be introduced gradually from 1 March to 1 September 2024.

The ban is based on Article 3p of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 and applies to diamonds and products containing diamonds listed in Annex XXXVIIIA, Parts A to C.

The list of goods in Annex VII has also been expanded.

These are relevant to Article 2a of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 and could help boost Russia’s military and technological clout or help the development of its defence and security sector and are therefore subject to an export ban.

The list includes lithium batteries, thermostats, DC and servomotors for unmanned aerial vehicles, machine tools and machine parts.

On the import side, the ban on goods that generate significant revenue for Russia has been expanded in Article 3i in conjunction with Annex XXI of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 to include liquefied propane gas, pig iron and spiegeleisen, copper wire, aluminium wire, foil and pipes.

With regard to payments, Article 5r of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 introduces a notification procedure for payments of over EUR 100,000 from within the EU.

The notification obligation will apply from 1 May 2024 to legal entities, organisations or institutions established in the European Union, of which over 40% is directly or indirectly held by Russian legal entities or natural persons or by individuals living in Russia.

Furthermore, according to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) No. 833/2014, there is a parallel reporting obligation for credit and financial institutions for such transfers of funds from 1 July 2024.

D. Crude oil price cap As part of the price cap on Russian oil products, the obligations to provide evidence in the provision of European services for (external) trade in the oil products concerned are now being tightened up.

The existing embargo/sanction aims to cap the (global) purchase price of Russian oil products by requiring market-relevant EU service providers to verify via a certification procedure within the supply chain that Russian (pre)products were purchased from third parties, i.e. non-EU citizens, at a price within the price cap.

To combat circumvention mechanisms, the 12th sanctions package expands the obligation for EU companies to provide evidence.

According to Article 3n(6)(a) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, EU service providers must now request itemised price information on ancillary costs in the supply chain, especially insurance and freight costs, if the EU service providers do not have the actual purchase price.

The mechanism is also supplemented by the introduction of a new sectoral embargo on trade in tankers for oil transport.

According to the new Article 3q(1) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, such ships may no longer be sold to, or ownership transferred to, Russian individuals."
Noerr,12th EU sanctions package: Companies need to take action,"According to the new Article 3q(1) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, such ships may no longer be sold to, or ownership transferred to, Russian individuals.

For sales of such ships to third countries, a reporting obligation is also introduced in the form of Article 3q(4) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

Past sales of tankers to Russia or third countries between 5 December 2022 and the entry into force of the 12th sanctions package must be reported to the competent authorities by February 2024 in accordance with Article 3q(5) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014.

E. Addition of sanctioned parties The 12th sanctions package again expands the list of individually sanctioned persons and entities in Annex I of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014, adding 61 individuals and 86 entities, in particular from the Russian military, defence and IT sectors.

F. Import of iron and steel products For European importers of iron and steel products, regulations have been established with regard to Russian products with the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes 7207 12 10 and 7224 90, which provide for a gradual phase-out of Russian products by 2028.

For iron and steel products with these two CN codes, direct imports and purchases from Russia are facilitated by extending the time-limited exemptions in Article 3g(4) and (5a) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 until 30 September 2028.

However, the authorised import quantities will decrease every year.

In addition, the transitional period is extended in Article 3g(1)(d) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 for relevant imports from third countries if the imported goods contain Russian iron and steel products under the two CN codes.

For such third-country imports, the import ban will only apply from 1 October 2028 – no import quotas (even decreasing quotas) are planned until then.

A new Annex XXXVI of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 defines Switzerland and Norway as “partner countries for importation of iron and steel”.

According to the definition in Article 1(zc) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, those countries have imposed “materially” equivalent regulations to the EU restrictions on iron and steel in Article 3g of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, and therefore no proof of the country of origin of the iron and steel pre-products is required for imports from those two countries.

G. Conclusion Overall, the 12th sanctions package covers a wide range of topics.

In particular, the new mandatory reexport clause in Article 12g of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 is likely to require companies to take action, as the scope of application covers all third countries with the exception of a few partner countries.

There are clear signs of increased efforts by the EU to increase the effectiveness of its Russia sanctions, especially by updating and, with respect to the oil price cap, expanding anti-circumvention measures.

The activation of the third-country regulation of the 11th sanctions package in Article 12f in conjunction with Annex XXXIII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, which had been expected in some quarters, has not materialised, so it remains unapplied and thus a mere threat.

The new regulations on compulsory transfers of Russian subsidiaries should also be seen as a political warning signal from Brussels for the time being.

While trade will be further restricted due to new bans, particularly in relation to Russian diamonds, the new regulations in the iron and steel sector instead facilitate trade."
Noerr,ECJ judgment: compensation for anxiety and worry following data breach,"The European Court of Justice (ECJ) delivered a landmark judgment on 14 December 2023 on compensation for non-material damage in the event of data breaches.

When a company is the victim of a hacking attack, it often has to spend a lot of money just to deal with the immediate consequences of the attack: business interruption, loss of reputation, correspondence with the data protection authority.

But this is only the tip of the iceberg.

Lurking in the shadows of the acute challenges is another risk that can be enormously costly: people whose data has been affected by the incident may have a claim for compensation.

And that can be a very large number of people - several million in the case of the cyber-attack on a Bulgarian public authority that formed the basis of today's ECJ ruling.

In its judgment, the ECJ clarified the conditions under which such claims can be made.

In particular, it decided whether a company could defend itself by claiming that it had taken precautions against hacking by having good IT security structures in place.

It also explained whether an individual can claim compensation even if nothing has happened to their data and they only have anxieties, concerns and fears about possible misuse in the future.

Background On 14 May 2021 , the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria referred several questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the conditions for a claim for compensation for non-material damage (Article 82(1) GDPR).

The request for a preliminary ruling was based on the following case: in 2019, media reports stated that a Bulgarian authority had been the victim of a cyber attack in which hackers had gained unauthorised access to various tax and social security data of millions of people.

The data was then allegedly published on the internet.

One of the individuals sued for damages, claiming that she had suffered anxiety, fear and worry about possible future misuse.

The Bulgarian court referred the following summarised questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling: (1) Can a company use the defence that it has taken appropriate technical and organisational measures, and how can a company prove that it has taken such measures?

Can a company defend itself by claiming that it was in no way responsible for the data protection incident?

(2) Do worries, anxieties and fears about possible future misuse also constitute non-material damage that can be compensated?

No claim if company has taken sufficient security measures In its judgment, the ECJ emphasises that a claim for damages requires a breach of data protection rules.

The mere fact that a third party gained unauthorised access to data does not automatically mean that the company can be accused of breaching the GDPR.

However, in most cases, a company could be accused of having inadequate technical and organisational measures that made the hacking attack possible.

However, the ECJ allows companies to defend themselves by demonstrating that they have sufficient, up-to-date and appropriate security structures in place and are therefore in no way responsible for the consequences of the attack.

The courts will then have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the measures put in place by the company were sufficient.

This can of course be a very complex and technically challenging question, which the courts can only answer with the help of experts.

Worries, fears and anxieties as non-material damage The ECJ ruled that worries, anxieties and fears suffered by a data subject as a result of possible future misuse of the data could constitute non-material damage for which compensation must be paid.

This decision has a very significant impact, as such anxieties, worries and fears are usually the first harm suffered by an individual, regardless of whether the data is actually misused at a later stage."
Noerr,ECJ judgment: compensation for anxiety and worry following data breach,"Given this, it is not surprising that many claimants base their claims for compensation on the fact that they have suffered such anxiety and fear.

In German case law, it has so far been controversial whether these negative feelings in themselves constitute a compensable damage.

The ECJ judgment therefore strengthens the legal position of claimants.

However, the ECJ also points out that the person concerned must have actually suffered these worries and anxieties and must be able to prove this.

Yet law firms specialising in mass claims often simply use boilerplate to describe people's feelings.

This may not be sufficient evidence.

In particular, the expectation of high payouts that these firms often raise raises the suspicion that some people are also pursuing financial interests and have less need to be compensated for their negative feelings.

As a result, it is likely that many cases will turn on how well claimants are able to present their negative feelings and how far the defending companies are able to challenge this.

Outlook Until now, German case law on this issue has been very divergent.

The ECJ ruling finally provides clear guidance on some key points.

This means that the focus of litigation may increasingly shift from questions of law to questions of fact.

While there are still many good arguments that can be used to defend claims for non-material damages, some legal questions remain open, such as the amount of compensation and other potential forms of damages.

Claims for non-material damages will be on the agenda of the ECJ and German courts for some time to come.

We follow the case law of the German courts on our Noerr Damages Tracker .

We recommend that companies err on the side of caution and establish robust data protection governance structures, implement effective data subject rights management, and professionally assess and manage potential data protection incidents.

Companies should therefore take a strategic approach to the challenges, opportunities and risks of Data Protection Litigation at an early stage.

Our experienced team of recognised data protection and litigation experts are here to help."
Noerr,Update on occupational pension schemes: Calculating part-time workers’ company pensions,"Germany’s Federal Labour Court clarified an issue of practical relevance with its ruling of 20 June 2023 (case 3 AZR 221/22).

It considered whether, in pension schemes based on the employee’s final salary, it is admissible to calculate the size of the company pension based on the level of employment in the last ten years before leaving employment or whether the average level of employment over the entire period of service should be taken as a basis: Pension entitlements may be based on the level of employment over the last ten years The Federal Labour Court clarified that pension schemes may be based on the employee’s level of employment in the last ten years before leaving the company.

According to the pension regulation, the income in the last twelve months before retiring generally determined the size of the pension.

For part-time employees, income was to be adjusted to reflect the employee’s average working hours during the last ten years of service before leaving (i.e. according to the level of employment).

The level of employment prior to that period was not relevant, the court said.

In the case at hand, the employee, who had originally worked full-time but switched to part-time during the assessment period, considered this firstly to be a breach of the prohibition of discrimination against part-time employees under section 4(1) of the German Act on Part-Time and Fixed-Term Employment, and secondly, to be indirect discrimination based on gender, as women were statistically more likely to work part-time than men.

Should the average scope of employment for the entire period of service be used as a basis?

The admissibility of such a regulation was recently called into question because the Federal Labour Court had ruled, in a judgment on 19 April 2016 (case 3 AZR 526/14), that part-time employees must receive company pension benefits of an amount at least corresponding to the ratio of their working hours to the working hours of a comparable full-time employee (the pro rata principle).

From this, a considerable part of the legal authors concluded that it was inadmissible to base the calculation purely on the employment ratio of the last ten years.

A ten-year assessment period does not disadvantage part-time employees and is compatible with the pro rata principle The Federal Labour Court stuck to its established practice.

It had already approved the use of salary figures from the last five years back in 1983, and then in 1998 and 2012 the use of salary figures from the last ten years before leaving employment.

It ruled that in a final salary pension, the average level of employment in the last ten years before leaving employment may be used as a basis in the event of a change in the level of employment.

It stated that firstly it was permissible to base the calculation on the average income received during the last twelve months.

The last income received corresponded to the number of working hours and applied both to full-time and part-time work.

The ten-year assessment period merely extended this twelve-month period.

The purpose of a final salary pension scheme was to maintain the final standard of living earned in their working life.

It was objectively legitimate to base the pay factor on the period of ten years because that was a period in which the standard of living was established, determined by the earnings and relevant for the pension entitlement.

The period did not lead to a disproportionate consideration of years of employment with lower working hours, the court concluded.

Unequal treatment would be objectively justified Finally, the Federal Labour Court clarified that possible unequal treatment of part-time workers would be justified.

Securing the standard of living last achieved by the employee was an objective reason, the court said.

The ten-year period was suitable and necessary in order to achieve that goal, as well as being reasonable."
Noerr,Update on occupational pension schemes: Calculating part-time workers’ company pensions,"The ten-year period was suitable and necessary in order to achieve that goal, as well as being reasonable.

The same applied to possible unequal treatment due to age or gender, the court added.

In practice While doubts had arisen in the meantime about the admissibility of a ten-year employment ratio in final salary pension schemes, the Federal Labour Court has stuck to its previous case law and now once again affirmed such admissibility, which is very helpful in practice.

Companies would be well advised to conduct a regular compliance check on their occupational pension schemes in order to spot any (accounting) risks early on and take remedial action if necessary."
Noerr,European Supply Chain Act (CSDDD) nearing the finish line,"On 14 December 2023, after long negotiations, the European Council and the European Parliament reached provisional agreement regarding the contents of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“ CSDDD ”, or “CS3D”).

The directive, also known as the European Supply Chain Act or “due diligence directive”, is intended to improve the human rights situation, protect the environment and drive efforts towards international climate protection goals.

The provisional agreement must still be formally adopted by both institutions.

Because the final wording of the directive will probably not be published for a few weeks, our findings are based on press releases from the European Council and the European Parliament , including oral statements made at the press conference.

Below we have summarised the essential points (I.) and analysed the extent to which the CSDDD differs from the German Supply Chain Act (II.).

I. Main elements

Scope

The CSDDD will apply to large companies that have more than 500 employees and net worldwide turnover of over €150 million.

Companies with more than 250 employees and net turnover of more than €40 million will be subject to the CSDDD if they generate at least €20 million in a high-risk sector.

High-risk sectors include (i) manufacture and wholesale trade of textiles, clothing and footwear, (ii) agriculture including forestry and fisheries, (iii) manufacture of and wholesale trade in food and (iv) extraction of and wholesale trade in mineral resources.

Companies that have not been established under the laws of an EU Member State are likewise subject to the CSDDD if they have over €300 million net turnover generated in the EU, three years from the entry into force of the directive.

The Commission has announced that it will publish a list of such companies.

Climate and environmental protection The CSDDD commits itself to the 1.5° C goal set out in the Paris Agreement .

Companies subject to the CSDDD are required to adopt a plan ensuring that their business model and strategy are compatible with the Paris Agreement (transition plan).

The due diligence obligations will also address environmental concerns, e.g. harmful soil change, water or air pollution, harmful emissions or excessive water consumption.

Supply chains The due diligence obligations will not extend solely to a company’s own business operations and its suppliers (upstream), but in some cases will also include activities undertaken after production (downstream), such as warehousing, distribution and recycling.

Civil liability The CSDDD establishes a period of five years to bring claims by those concerned by adverse impacts (including trade unions or NGOs).

Injunctive measures and legal aid are intended to enable an effective enforcement.

Supervision and penalties The supervisory authorities of the Member States can initiate investigations and impose penalties, including fines of up to 5% of worldwide net turnover, and impose and publicise violations (“naming and shaming”).

The Commission will establish a network of national supervisory authorities (European Network of Supervisory Authorities).

Financial sector A trouble spot in the trilogue was the issue of whether the financial sector, e.g. credit institutes, asset managers and investment firms, should be exempted from the CSDDD.

In this regard, it was stated at the press conference on 14 December 2023 that financial sector companies should also be obliged to fulfil the due diligence obligations in their own business operations and in regard to suppliers (upstream) as well as to contribute to achievement of the climate protection goal of the Paris Climate Agreement in the context of a transition plan.

It was also stated that the Commission would review whether the financial sector will be completely subject to the CSDDD in the future.

Noerr,European Supply Chain Act (CSDDD) nearing the finish line,"It was also stated that the Commission would review whether the financial sector will be completely subject to the CSDDD in the future.

II.

Schedule and anticipated amendments to the German Supply Chain Act The CSDDD will enter into force on the twentieth day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The Member States will then have two years to transpose the directive into national law.

The German legislator can be expected to make adjustments to the German Supply Chain Act in several places.

The chart below compares the initial information regarding the CSDDD with the provisions of the German Supply Chain Act: Topic German Supply Chain Act CSDDD Scope Companies with a registered office or branch office in Germany at least 3,000 or 1,000 employees respectively in Germany Companies founded under the laws of an EU Member State with net turnover of more than €150 million and more than 500 employees Companies founded under the laws of an EU Member State with net turnover of more than €40 million or net turnover of €20 million in a “high-risk sector”, i.e. (i) manufacture and wholesale trade of textiles, clothing and footwear, (ii) agriculture, including forestry and fishery, (iii) manufacture of and wholesale trade in foods and (iv) extraction of and wholesale trade in mineral resources more than 250 employees Non-EU companies net turnover of more than €300 million in the EU, three years after CSDDD enters into force The Commission will publish a list of companies subject to the due diligence obligations.

Due diligence obligations Companies must implement the due diligence obligations in their own business operations and towards (in)direct suppliers Companies must implement the due diligence obligations in their own business operations, towards indirect suppliers (upstream) and in some cases, also downstream activities (warehousing, distribution or recycling) Climate change/ Climate goals The German Supply Chain Act does not include any climate goals or measures to protect the climate or mitigate climate change Companies subject to the CSDDD must draft and implement a transition plan to mitigate climate change.

Companies are to be climate-neutral by 2050.

Financial sector The German Supply Chain Act applies to all companies that fall under its scope, i.e. including companies in the financial sector.

Apparently, financial sector companies must implement the due diligence obligations in their own business operations and towards their suppliers ( upstream ).

Financial sector companies must also contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Management remuneration The German Supply Chain Act has no influence on company directors’ remuneration.

For companies with more than 1,000 employees, climate goals will apparently have an effect on directors’ remuneration.

Civil liability The German Supply Chain Act does not provide for civil liability.

Civil liability is possible under other German laws.

Civil liability is to be enabled.

Possible fines Up to 2% of average annual turnover if annual turnover averages more than €400 million Up to 5% of worldwide net turnover Information on our range of advisory services for all aspects of supply-chain compliance, including the German Supply Chain Act and the CSDDD, can be found here: https://www.noerr.com/de/themen/lieferketten-compliance"
Noerr,Platform work: Stricter regulation on the horizon,"In an article on this website , we reported on the European Commission’s efforts towards stricter regulation of platform work (work for digital labour platforms).

The main purpose of these efforts is to bring more platform workers into a social security system and broadly expand their rights.

The basis for this was the proposal for a directive on improving working conditions in platform work ( COM(2021) 762 final ).

Elements of the directive proposal The proposal’s core element is the intent to legally classify persons performing such work as employees, in contrast to current widespread practice, if two of the following activities are conducted: effectively determining, or setting upper limits for the level of remuneration; supervising the performance of work by electronic means; effectively restricting the discretion to choose one’s working hours or periods of absence, to accept or to refuse tasks or to use subcontractors or substitutes; requiring the person performing platform work to respect specific binding rules with regard to appearance, conduct towards the recipient of the service or performance of the work; effectively restricting the possibility to build a client base or to perform work for any third party.

There are many situations in which these criteria are probably fulfilled, which means that the workers are to be classified as employees of the platform.

Platform operators can rebut this legal presumption, but the burden of proof, and thus ultimately the expenditure of resources and the risk, will be on the digital labour platform.

For more of the significant content of the proposal and a short contextual explanation, please click here .

Progress in Brussels Although our previous article was written under the assumption, not least due to similar efforts on the part of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, that this project would be pursued with a certain urgency, the opposite happened.

The project seemed to fall into a coma, but now shows signs of waking up.

According to a press release from the European Council and the Council of the European Union, negotiators in Brussels have agreed on a draft directive that will still have the abovementioned classification as employees as its core component, making it nothing more and nothing less than a frontal assault on the current business model of many platform operators.

The draft is also a game changer with significant impact on differentiating between employment and self employment.

This differentiation is currently being made based on an overall weighing of all criteria on a case-by-case basis.

Implementation of the directive would mean that this differentiation would be made based on a specific list of criteria, so that in the vast majority of cases, labour platform workers will be classified as employees subject to mandatory social security coverage.

For this reason, it is advisable to closely monitor the results of the consultations among all Member States’ EU representatives planned for this week.

This situation is unusual in the sense that there is no consensus that the EU Council and the Parliament will definitely give their consent, which is necessary for passage.

The position that each Member State will take remains to be seen.

Many consider additional workers becoming part of the beleaguered social security systems to be desirable.

However, in the current economic environment, consideration will also have to be given to reducing hindrances to investment and the possible deterrent effect the directive could have on investors.

Investors are probably also watching these developments intently because classifying everyone who works for a digital labour platform as an employee would have far-reaching consequences for the profitability of many platforms, and these consequences would often be negative.

In any case, we will continue to closely monitor these developments for you and report all changes here."
Noerr,ECJ judgment on SCHUFA score – what companies now need to consider,"Many companies rely on a person’s credit score from German credit rating institution SCHUFA to assess whether they can trust such person’s willingness and ability to pay and whether they should enter into a contractual relationship with the person.

After all, this score is calculated based on a large number of characteristics and information on a person.

However, in a judgment handed down on 7 December 2023 ( judgment of 7 December 2023 - C-634/21 ), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) expressed doubt as to whether it is permissible under data protection law for credit information agencies to calculate a score which companies will later use as the sole basis for their decisions.

Credit rating agencies’ business models are therefore under great strain, which may also have an impact on companies who rely on them.

Background

In a decision issued on 1 October 2021 , Wiesbaden Administrative Court referred two questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, which essentially concerned the permissibility of SCHUFA scores and business decisions based on them under data protection law.

The reference for a preliminary ruling was based on the following case: The claimant applied for a loan, which her credit institution refused to grant her on the basis of her SCHUFA score.

SCHUFA, which joined the proceedings, had transmitted this score, which was calculated on the basis of certain characteristics, to a credit institution wishing to assess the claimant’s creditworthiness.

The claimant then requested SCHUFA to provide her with data access and erase the personal data it had registered about her.

In response to that request, SCHUFA only informed the claimant of her personal score and outlined the general methods for calculating scores.

Moreover, referring to trade secrecy, it refused to disclose which specific information was used for calculating her score and how the information was weighted.

The claimant then lodged a complaint against the refusal with the Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, but this was unsuccessful.

She subsequently brought an action before Wiesbaden Administrative Court, which initially referred the matter to the ECJ.

In essence, the administrative court wished to know whether the automated establishment of a probability value in relation to a person’s ability to fulfil their future payment obligations (score) constituted automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22(1) o f the General Data Protection Regulation where this score had been transmitted to a third party (in this case, the credit institution) and the latter had used that score for deciding on the establishment, implementation or termination of a contractual relationship with the data subject.

ECJ:

SCHUFA scoring can be an automated decision within the meaning of Article 22(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation The ECJ has now ruled that the creation of such a score by a credit rating agency can constitute automated decision-making under Article 22 GDPR if the decision of a third party draws strongly on this score.

Article 22(1) GDPR confers on data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision solely based on automated processing that produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them.

According to the ECJ, the term “decision” is to be interpreted broadly so that it can also include the result of the calculation of a person’s future solvency as a probability value (score).

The ECJ stated that the automated creation of this score at least also “significantly affects” the data subjects to the extent that the actions of third parties draw strongly on this score.

For example, loan applications are frequently rejected by banks due to a score being insufficient."
Noerr,ECJ judgment on SCHUFA score – what companies now need to consider,"For example, loan applications are frequently rejected by banks due to a score being insufficient.

According to the ECJ, such an approach safeguards the GDPR’s increased requirements for the lawfulness of automated decision-making, which are intended to protect data subjects from the particular risks of such data processing.

Especially in cases where three stakeholders are involved, there would otherwise be a risk of a gap in legal protection.

If the establishment of the score were only to be considered a preparatory act for the actual “decision” (e.g. by a bank) within the meaning of Article 22(1) GDPR, the establishment of the score would not have to fulfil the special requirements of Article 22(2) –22(4) GDPR for automated decision-making.

This would also mean that data subjects were deprived of the opportunity to obtain meaningful information pursuant to Article 15(1)(h) GDPR about the logic involved in and the significance of processing.

They would not be able to assert their right to information against the relevant credit rating agency (in this case SCHUFA) while third-party companies would simply not have the requested information.

Applicability of section 31 of the German Federal Data Protection Act ( Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG ) left open German data protection law does in fact contain a provision that allows scoring and credit reports for the protection of trade and commerce ( section 31 BDSG ).

However, the ECJ left open whether this provision was suitable as a legal basis within the meaning of Article 22(2)(b) GDOR for a decision based solely on automated processing.

In order for this to be the case, the provision would have to fulfil the requirements in the GDPR for a national derogation.

The German courts will now have to examine whether this is the case.

Storage of data from public registers The ECJ also ruled on 7 December on two further requests for preliminary rulings from Wiesbaden Administrative Court in connection with data processing carried out by SCHUFA.

The subject matter of these proceedings (joined cases C-26/22 and C-64/22 ) was whether credit information agencies are permitted to store data from public registers.

Specifically, SCHUFA had stored information on discharged bankrupts for three years and thus for longer than the six-month period for which the data was simultaneously stored in the public insolvency registry.

The ECJ has now ruled that this violates the General Data Protection Regulation.

It was of the view that a discharge from bankruptcy was of existential importance for a data subject and that therefore such data should not be stored by private credit information agencies for any longer than the German legislature allowed for the public register.

It therefore held that to this extent data subjects had the right to have this data erased by credit information agencies.

Furthermore, the ECJ was of the opinion that it was for the referring court to examine whether or not the parallel storage of this data in the databases of credit information agencies was even permissible before the expiry of the (statutory)

six-month period.

Consequences of the scoring judgment for companies In order to protect themselves and act in compliance with data protection regulations, companies should now urgently review the basis on which they make their decisions to enter into contracts with individuals and the role SCHUFA scores play in this.

It is likely that SCHUFA will contact companies again and impose requirements on their use of scores or request them to make certain declarations.

This had already happened in the past in anticipation of today’s ECJ judgment.

We would be happy to advise companies on the options available to them for responding to the rulings."
Noerr,Russian courts disregard arbitration clauses in favour of Russia-friendly/­neutral forums,"Western companies contracting with Russian parties should not feel safe relying on arbitration clauses in favour of Russia-friendly or neutral forums.

In a number of recent cases Russian courts have disregarded arbitration clauses in favour of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).

On 1 December 2023, in the case of VTB Bank PJSC v VTB Bank (Europe) SE (No. А56-84760/2023) the Arbitrazh Court of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Region recognized as unenforceable due to anti-Russian sanctions the HKIAC arbitration clause with the seat in Hong Kong.

Furthermore, on 5 December 2023, in a parallel case between the same parties (No. А56-103943/2023) the same Russian court upon VTB Bank PJSC’s application granted permanent anti-arbitration and anti-anti-suit injunctions and prohibited VTB Bank (Europe) SE from continuing the HKIAC arbitration proceedings under a threat of a court penalty in the amount of EUR 112.6mln.

This was done despite the fact that by the Order of the Hong Kong High Court dated 27 October 2023 VTB Bank PJSC was restrained from pursuing the proceedings in Russia.

In the case of Rosneft v BP Oil International (No. А40-197598/2023) on 29 November 2023 the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow granted anti-arbitration injunctions and prohibited BP Oil from continuing arbitration under the SIAC rules.

Previously, in June 2023, in the case of Ruschemalliance v Linde (case No. А56-129797/2022) the Arbitrazh Court of Saint Petersburg also recognized unenforceable the HKIAC arbitration clause because the anti-Russian sanctions allegedly create obstacles for Russian parties’ access to justice in Hong Kong.

In February 2023, in the case of Sberbank v Glencore Energy UK (case No. А40-237252/2022) the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow recognized unenforceable the SIAC arbitration clause.

Starting from February 2022, Russian courts have readily ignored as allegedly unenforceable arbitration and prorogation clauses in favour of Western arbitration institutions and courts.

Therefore, as the last remaining dispute settlement resort and an acceptable compromise for both the Western and Russian parties, arbitration clauses in favour of Russia-friendly/neutral forums have been widely used, in particular in numerous Russia-exit deals.

This year, the HKIAC and the SIAC have been reported to be among top three most popular arbitration institutions for Russia-related disputes.

Both the HKIAC and the SIAC are recognized by the Russian Ministry of Justice as permanent arbitral institutions authorized to administer international arbitration proceedings.

Even though Singapore is formally included by the Russian authorities in the list of “unfriendly” countries, the SIAC is treated by Russian companies and legal practitioners as a neutral forum.

The above new cases show that Western companies contracting with Russian parties should not feel safe relying on arbitration clauses in favour of even Russia-friendly or neutral forums.

Therefore, additional collaterals and risks mitigation measures need to be considered."
Noerr,US court refuses to enforce DIFC-LCIA arbitration clause,"Disputes about jurisdiction or the right forum for the dispute can significantly increase costs and time for dispute resolution.

They also give room to guerilla tactics employed by a recalcitrant party to undermine swift dispute resolution.

For this reason, clear and enforceable dispute resolution agreements are imperative.

But what happens if an arbitration clause was valid at the time it was drafted – and now no longer is?

In a recent decision dated 6 November 2023, the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Louisiana (2:23-cv-01396-GGG-KWR) had to deal with such a question.

The court found the arbitration agreement in question to be unenforceable since it referred to the former Dubai arbitration institute that no longer exists.

Dubai arbitration institutions In 2021, the government of Dubai issued a decree abolishing the DIFC Arbitration Institute.

The DIFC Arbitration Institute (or DAI) was a joint venture between the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) and the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).

The DIFC Arbitration Institute had an operating agreement with the LCIA to administer arbitrations in the DIFC free zone under an adapted version of the LCIA rules known as the DIFC-LCIA rules.

In 2021, all assets of the abolished institute were transferred by decree to the Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC).

The transfer also included selected staff and cases.

Since the abolition of the DIFC Arbitration Institute, the DIAC has continued to administer cases based on existing DIFC-LCIA arbitration agreements.

The government of Dubai and the DIAC deems existing DIFC-LCIA clauses to remain valid.

Background of the Louisiana court decision The plaintiff is a Saudia Arabian company that supplied materials, products and services for an oil and gas project in Saudi Arabia.

In the Louisiana litigation, the plaintiff claimed payment in the amount of USD 1.355 million from three U.S. affiliates of its Saudia Arabian contract partner, which it claims is merely a shell company.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the payment claim based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens or, in the alternative, to compel the plaintiff to arbitrate its claim.

The defendants argued that the parties had chosen Dubai as the forum for their disputes in the contract.

The arbitration clause contained in the contract states that any dispute between the parties is to be “referred by either Party to and finally resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the DIFC LCIA.”

Court decision: The DIAC is not the same forum as the former DIFC Arbitration Institute

The court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the claim and compel arbitration for the following reasons: The court found that it could not compel arbitration “when the agreed upon arbitration tribunal is unavailable or no longer exists” .

The court stressed that the contractual choice of forum was an integral part of the agreement to arbitrate, rather than an “ ancillary logistical concern ”.

The court emphasized the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract and consent.

It held that neither the court nor the Dubai government has the authority to “ rewrite ” the arbitration agreement and change the forum contractually agreed to by the parties.

The court found that “Whatever similarity the DIAS may have with the DIFC LCIA, it is not the same forum in which the parties agreed to arbitrate.”

Since the agreed upon forum is no longer available, the court could not compel the plaintiff to arbitrate.

Arbitration agreements in contracts pre-dating 2022 referring to arbitration in Dubai likely require amendment Companies that are active on an international level would do well to check the arbitration clauses contained in their “ older ” contracts that pre-date 2022."
Noerr,US court refuses to enforce DIFC-LCIA arbitration clause,"Any arbitration agreement that refers disputes to arbitration under the DIFC-LCIA rules and/or the DIFC Arbitration Institute likely require amendment.

The decision by the Eastern District Court of Louisiana also illustrates why it is important that companies seek legal advice during contract negotiations to decide which dispute resolution mechanism to incorporate into their agreement.

This especially applies when the contract partner proposes smaller, industry specific or local arbitration institutions."
Noerr,The Anti-Coercion Instrument is about to enter into force,"Today, the Regulation on the protection of the Union and its Member States from economic coercion by third countries has been published in the EU Official Journal and will enter into force on December 27 th .

The Regulation lays down the Anti-Coercion Instrument (“ACI”), aiming to discourage foreign states from targeting the EU and its Member States with coercive economic measures in trade and investment.

The European Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) published the proposal for the ACI in December 2021 (see our News Alert here ) and the European Parliament, Council of the EU and the Commission reached a political agreement on the final shape of the law in March 2023 (see our News Alert here ).

Objectives of the ACI The ACI is a “ vital tool to deter economic intimidation and defend EU interests in an increasingly volatile world ”, said EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis.

The ACI is intended to complement the EU’s existing toolkit of trade defence instruments and specifically to allow the EU to dissuade or offset coercive actions by third countries, and as a last resort to expeditiously undertake countermeasures, taking into account the EU’s obligations under relevant international law.

It is, thus, first and foremost a deterrent instrument, having as primary objective the de-escalation of situations of economic coercion through dialogue and engagement.

The new tool represents a building block of the new EU trade agenda .

How does the ACI work?

The procedure envisaged in the ACI-Regulation consists of a series of steps aimed at determining whether there is economic coercion and inducing the third country concerned to comply with its international obligations, to cease the action and, where appropriate, providing reparation for the injury caused.

According to the ACI-Regulation, economic coercion exists where a third country applies or threatens to apply a third-country measure affecting trade or investment in order to prevent or obtain the cessation, modification or adoption of a particular act by the Union or a Member State, thereby interfering in the legitimate sovereign choices of the Union or a Member State.

The Commission and Council together shall formally determine whether there is a case of economic coercion, although the Commission is largely in the lead as regards the conducting of an investigation and implementation of response measures.

The Commission starts the examination of a third country measure ex officio or upon a request received from a Member State, the European Parliament, economic operators or trade unions.

In its examination, the Commission must take into account the national and international context and certain aspects of the measure, such as the intensity, severity, frequency, duration and impact of the measure on trade or investment relations and on businesses.

This process, to be conducted in coordination with Member States and stakeholders, and shall not exceed four months.

If the Commission concludes that the measure indeed constitutes economic coercion, it will submit a proposal to the Council for an implementing act.

The proposal can include a request for the third country to repair the injury to the Union.

The Council shall decide on the proposal by way of qualified majority within eight weeks.

It is important to underline that the third country concerned has the opportunity to be heard by the Commission during the examination and, following the adoption of the Council decision regarding the existence of the economic coercion, the Commission can explore alternative means such as direct negotiations, international adjudication, mediation, conciliation or good offices to cease the coercion and reach an early settlement of the matter.

If the previous phases do not lead to the cessation of the coercive measure and to the reparation of the injury, where requested, the Commission has the power to adopt Union response measures by means of implementing acts."
Noerr,The Anti-Coercion Instrument is about to enter into force,"Prior to the imposition of these measures, interested parties such as economic operators can take part in the consultation with the Commission to show possible impacts of any proposed measures on both upstream and downstream industries and consumers within the Union.

The real novelty of the ACI lies in its voting system: in order for trade remedies to be imposed, the Commission only needs a qualified majority amongst Member States, instead of the unanimous consent needed to adopt measures in foreign policy issues.

However, the Commission stressed that it will work towards solutions which ensure the widest possible support by the EU Member States.

Annex I of the ACI-Regulation lists a number of possible countermeasures related to goods and services such as customs duties, imposition of trade restrictions on the import/export of goods, restrictions in the field of services or public procurement but also regarding intellectual property rights and foreign direct investment.

However, the Commission may also decide to adopt a measure not listed, provided it is proportionate and temporary.

In designing the response measure, the Commission shall take into consideration a series of factors such as the Union interest, the negative implications of the measure for other European policies and any eventual administrative complexity and costs.

These measures can be of general application or specific to certain natural or legal persons or to certain sectors or regions.

The Commission will monitor the economic coercion and the effectiveness of the Union response measure, which can be amended, suspended, and terminated according to the evolution of the situation.

Conclusions The ACI was originally intended as a tool to address economic measures adopted by the then Trump administration, but its focus later shifted to China’s action against Lithuania upon deciding to open a “Taiwan representative office” in Vilnius in 2021.

Nevertheless, in general, the ACI is designed to protect the EU from all kinds of economic coercion from third countries.

This is supported by the fact that the definition of economic coercion set out in the ACI-Regulation is kept broad and could allow the Commission to trigger the ACI in a wide range of circumstances.

The backdrop of the legislative process of the ACI indicated a common understanding amongst Member States of the need to strength the Union’s arsenal against unfair trade practices.

In fact, the rationale behind different policy and legal instruments recently introduced is linked to the need to develop supply chain resilience, improve security of critical infrastructure, and intervene against the so-called weaponization of economic and trade policies.

Even if the ACI is within the scope of the Union common commercial policy, it is conceivable that the instrument will also be used by the EU to pursue foreign and security policy objectives, aiming to strengthen the EU’s strategic autonomy.

The significant shift in competence in favour of the Commission, which will have the power to undertake the investigations and, where needed, impose countermeasures without the need to have the unanimous consent of all EU Member States, could significantly enhance the Union’s response in difficult situations.

For example, as regards the adoption of sanctions against Russia, EU Member States’ opinions have at times been divided.

The ACI could play a role in the future in the EU’s response to the economic consequences of war situations or similar threats or crises.

Nevertheless, the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, in a joint statement stated that the ACI-Regulation is strictly subject-specific and does not represent a precedent for other legislative files within the scope of the common commercial policy."
Noerr,The Anti-Coercion Instrument is about to enter into force,"Lastly, the ACI is meant to protect the Union or Member States’ interests, but given that the broad range of possible countermeasures, it cannot be ruled out that third-country businesses trading or investing in the Union could be affected in their operations."
Noerr,Update to occupational pension schemes: Can remuneration and occupational pensions be combined?,"The Federal Fiscal Court ruled in a judgment on 15 March 2023 (case I R 41/19) on whether paying an occupational pension to a controlling shareholder Managing Director alongside the remuneration for his job as Managing Director constituted a hidden distribution of profit.

The Court emphasised firstly that it would keep to its settled case law, i.e. that coexistence of an ongoing salary and occupational pension (a benefit) was generally not in line with the arm’s length principle (which could result in a hidden distribution of profit), but on the other hand, it ruled there was no hidden profit distribution in this specific case.

A prudent Managing Director would either credit the pension benefits against their remuneration or defer the due date of the pension benefits Hidden distribution of profit is understood to be a reduction in the assets of a corporation that is caused or partly triggered by the corporate relationship and has no connection with an open distribution.

A payment is deemed to have been made as a result of the corporate relationship if the corporation grants its shareholder(s) or a related party a pecuniary advantage that it would not have granted to a non-shareholder if it had exercised the due care and diligence of a prudent and conscientious Managing Director.

Based on this, the Federal Fiscal Court deduces that a prudent Managing Director would either credit the pension benefits against his salary or postpone the due date of the pension benefit until the beneficiary has finally left their position as Managing Director.

It is still possible to receive both remuneration and pension benefits if together they do not exceed the last salary In the specific case, the Managing Director’s pay was significantly reduced after he started drawing his pension, i.e. the total amount of the Managing Director’s new salary and his pension together only amounted to approx.

26% of the Managing Director’s salary last received by him (last salary) before drawing the pension benefit.

Therefore, as long as the sum of the pension benefit and the Managing Director’s new salary is lower than his last salary, it remains possible for salary and pensions to coexist, the nature of the pension is preserved and there is no hidden profit distribution.

Practical tip

The coexistence of salary and pension is a longstanding issue in company succession.

The ruling by the Federal Fiscal Court highlights interesting options for structuring this and incentivises shareholder Managing Directors to continue working for the company after retirement.

Not only crediting pension payments against remuneration, but also postponing the due date for paying the pension in return for an increase in future pension benefits in line with the present value can be an option worth considering.

The ruling is likely to be relevant not only for continuing to work as a consultant, but also for working as a consultant post-retirement."
Noerr,"Update on EU State aid law: Partial extension of the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (""TCTF"")","A. Background Following a consultation with the Member States, the European Commission (“ Commission ”) decided on 20 November 2023 to amend the new TCTF dated 9 March 2023.

The TCTF, which was adopted in its original version on 23 March 2022 and amended several times since then, is intended to make it easier and quicker for EU Member States to approve State aid to promote green technologies and industries under State aid law ( see our article here ) .

In light of Russia’s war of aggression, which is still impacting economic growth in the EU, the current events in the Middle East and the continuing uncertainties in the energy markets, the Commission agreed with some Member States’ demands (especially those of Germany and France).

It extended the period of application for certain measures of the TCTF by a further six months (until 30 June 2024), thus preventing it from expiring at the end of the year.

At the same time, slight changes were made to its content.

B.

The changes in detail Specifically, the period of application for the following measures was extended until 30 June 2024:

Section 2.1 ( limited amounts of aid ): Under the conditions listed in paragraphs 60 onwards, Member States may continue to grant limited amounts of State aid beyond the end of the year.

Eligible recipients are in principle companies affected by the current crisis or the ensuing sanctions and countersanctions.

Section 2.4 (aid for additional costs due to exceptionally severe increases in natural gas and electricity prices):

This section concerns options for granting State aid to compensate for higher energy prices.

In addition, repayable advances, guarantees, loans and other repayable instruments granted on this basis can now be converted into other forms by 31 December 2024 (instead of by 30 June 2024).

At the same time, the ceilings for limited sums of State aid (section 2.1) have been raised slightly (in principle EUR 2.25 million instead of EUR 2 million).

C. Unchanged provisions However, in the Commission’s view, further measures to remedy major disruptions are no longer necessary.

The periods of application of the following sections have not been extended: The provisions in Sections 2.2 (liquidity support in the form of guarantees), 2.3 (liquidity support in the form of subsidised loans) and 2.7 (aid for additional reduction of electricity consumption) will expire on 31 December 2023 as originally planned.

These types of State aid therefore have to be granted before that date.

The provisions in Sections 2.5 (aid for accelerating the rollout of renewable energy and energy storage relevant for REPowerEU), 2.6 (aid for the decarbonisation of industrial production processes through electrification and/or the use of renewable and electricity-based hydrogen fulfilling certain conditions and for energy efficiency measures) and 2.8 (aid for accelerated investments in sectors strategic for the transition towards a net-zero economy) will continue to apply unchanged until 31 December 2025.

D. Outlook

In light of the recent ruling by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court on the Climate and Transformation Fund (judgment of 15 November 2023, case 2 BvF 1/22) and the related uncertainties at present regarding the state’s room for manoeuvre, the partial extension of the TCTF is good news.

At least until the middle of next year, certain subsidies can continue to be granted to companies currently severely affected by the sanctions and higher energy prices in a simplified and legally secure manner on the basis of the TCTF."
Noerr,Vehicle emissions ‒ status of the legislative process for the new Euro 7 regulation,"The legislative process Under the European Green Deal, the European Commission presented a proposal for more stringent air pollutant emission standards for combustion-engine vehicles on 10 November 2022.

Specifically, this concerns the proposal for a regulation on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, with respect to their emissions and battery durability (Euro 7).

On 22 September 2023, the Council announced its position on this and departed significantly from the Commission’s proposal.

The Parliament adopted the Council’s proposed amendments on 9 November 2023.

What changes is Euro 7 likely to bring with it?

In addition to the emissions that are already regulated under current standards, Euro 7 is also intended to set limits for non-exhaust emissions, such as particulates emitted by tyres and brakes.

In addition, minimum performance requirements for the durability of electric vehicle batteries are to be introduced, as are stricter requirements for vehicle service life.

There are also plans to use new technology in the vehicles to monitor emissions.

The Euro 7 standards are designed to consolidate emission limits for all motor vehicles into a single set of rules.

The new provisions are fuel and technology neutral, setting the same limits regardless of what is used to power the vehicle.

Which vehicles and vehicle categories are covered by the Euro 7 regulation?

The standards, now uniformly referred to as Euro 7, are to apply to passenger cars, light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.

The proposal consolidates the successor standards to Euro 6 (Regulation (EC)

No 715/2007) and Euro VI (Regulation (EC)

No 595/2009) in a single, uniform legal instrument.

Testing of emissions and emission limits There is still no consensus with regard to the test standards for determining emissions and on emission limits.

Following the Commission’s proposal for new testing technology, the decision published by the Council makes provision for retaining existing testing methods.

There is agreement that, in addition to the limits for exhaust emissions, limits for emissions from tyre abrasion and brake particles will now have to be met by all vehicle categories.

I. Vehicles in categories M1 and N1 With regard to the test conditions for emissions, the Commission proposes using a differentiated test procedure in Annex III of the draft.

This builds on the requirements under Euro 6, but extends them and is to be more closely aligned with actual driving emission .

As regards emission limits, the Commission is guided by the limits in Euro 6, but no longer distinguishes between spark ignition engines and compression ignition engines.

With regard to the limits and the distinction between spark ignition and compression ignition vehicles in categories M1 and N1, the Parliament agrees with the Commission.

The Parliament makes certain changes to the emission limits based on the Council’s proposal and also advocates moving towards a differentiated test procedure by making slight amendments.

By contrast, the Council proposes that the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) and the Real Driving Emission (RDE) tests as defined in Euro 6e be retained as test conditions for M1 and N1 vehicles.

The Council wishes to revert to Euro 6 for the exhaust emission limits and evaporative emission limits for M1 and N1 vehicles.

The Council opposes limits for refuelling emissions .

II.

Vehicles in categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 The Commission wants the test methods for category M2, M3, N2 and N3 vehicles to reflect the specific characteristics of vehicles, while favouring placing greater emphasis on testing the whole vehicle rather than just the engine.

The proposal also provides for changes to the design of the limits in order to focus on reducing emissions during cold starts, which are particularly important in urban traffic."
Noerr,Vehicle emissions ‒ status of the legislative process for the new Euro 7 regulation,"The proposal also provides for changes to the design of the limits in order to focus on reducing emissions during cold starts, which are particularly important in urban traffic.

On the other hand, the Council also intends to use the Euro 6 test conditions for vehicles in the M2, M3, N2 and N3 categories with combustion engines.

In addition, the Council proposes removing the emission limit for formaldehyde (HCHO) from the exhaust emission limits of these vehicle categories.

The Parliament agreed with the Council on the test conditions, but proposes slightly stricter emission limits over-all.

Effective date of the new regulation The date when the regulation should take effect is disputed between the Commission, Council and Parliament.

In any case, it is foreseeable that the Euro 7 regulation, as is customary in type-approval law, will provide for different provisions on its date for entry into force or temporal scope, and will distinguish in particular between categories M1 and N1 on the one hand and categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 on the other.

Summary Euro 7 is intended to introduce stricter requirements for vehicle emissions and minimum performance requirements for the durability of electric car batteries and stricter requirements for the service life of vehicles.

In addition, there are plans to use new technology in the vehicles to monitor emissions.

However, the specific emissions standards and which emission limits will be binding, as well as the implementation timeline, are currently unknown.

The Council has responded to the Commission’s rather restrictive draft with a more balanced proposal for a compromise, which the Parliament partially supports.

The companies affected will have to keep an eye on the legislative process and adapt their processes to it in good time.

We will continue to monitor the legislative process and will update you as soon as it moves forward."
Noerr,Russia exits – Russian Prosecutors go after Russian Managers of foreign Subsidiaries?,"On 16 November 2023 the former management of the Russian Baltika brewery (“ Baltika ”) - a subsidiary of Carlsberg, which the Russian authorities have placed under external management and thus de facto expropriated in July 2023 - has been arrested in Russia.

The prosecution is apparently related to trademark licenses granted by Baltika to foreign companies affiliated with Carlsberg before Baltika was placed under the external management.

One of the licenses is alleged to have been executed retroactively.

As reported, the criminal proceedings were initially commenced under Article 165 of Russian Criminal Code ( causing property damage by deceit or breach of trus t), but subsequently requalified to fraud (Article 159 of the Criminal Code).

This seems to be the first reported case when the management of a Russian subsidiary of a western investor actually faces severe criminal penalties for business restructuring measures implemented after 24 February 2022.

Until now we had observed only a few attempts of the Russian prosecution authorities to put pressure on the CEOs of Russian subsidiary held by foreign investors - often with the goal to prevent or soften staff redundancies in the relevant Russian subsidiaries.  

Moreover, these attempts were regularly unsuccessful and did not lead to the formal initiation of criminal investigations.

It is likely that the criminal proceedings against the former Baltika managers are a part of a broader dispute between Carlsberg and the Russian authorities, therefore, as such, they do not indicate an increase of the overall risk for the management of Russian subsidiaries.

However, further development of prosecution practice in Russia should be carefully monitored and, where appropriate, personal risks mitigation measures for the local management should be adopted.

These can include the physical relocation of the subsidiaries’ management to the seat of head office, i.e. to a place outside Russia."
Noerr,Update on occupational pension schemes: Employers’ obligation to assume liability for pension reductions,"Germany’s Federal Labour Court has once again ruled on employers’ obligation to assume liability in the event of benefit reductions by pension funds in its judgment of 14 March 2023 (case no. 3 AZR 197/22).

The employer, a charitable wing of the Catholic Church, had granted an employee certain pension commitments in accordance with the Guidelines for Employment Contracts in the Institutions of the German Caritas Association as amended (“Richtlinien für Arbeitsverträge in den Einrichtungen des Deutschen Caritasverbandes (AVR) in ihrer jeweils geltenden Fassung”).

After the employee had been drawing her company pension since 2014, the pension fund informed her in 2019 that it would reduce her pension by around €10 per month.

The employee then claimed compensation from her employer for the pension reductions and the Federal Labour Court upheld her claim for compensation.

In its reasoning, the Federal Labour Court remained true to its usual line.

In several decisions since 2014 on pension reductions by various pension funds, including Pensionskasse der Deutschen Wirtschaft, Kölner Pensionskasse and BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes aG, the Federal Labour Court has obliged the employer in question to make up for the shortfall in pension payments by a pension fund.

For a purely defined contribution commitment, there must be special indications reflected in the pension scheme In the present case, the Federal Labour Court argued that the employer had not merely issued a purely defined contribution commitment outside the scope of the German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG), but instead intended to issue a pension commitment under company pension law by referring to the guidelines for employment contracts in the institutions of the German Caritas Association.

The employer should have presented specific evidence of the existence of a purely defined contribution commitment outside the scope of the German Occupational Pensions Act and reflected in the pension commitment.

The employer would therefore have to compensate the employee for the reductions in pension payments as part of the no-fault claim for fulfilment under section 1(1) sentence 3 of the German Occupational Pensions Act.

Restructuring clauses in the articles of association of a pension fund do not become part of the pension commitment Once again, the Federal Labour Court pointed out that the employer cannot take advantage of the statutory restructuring clauses that apply in favour of the pension fund.

The Federal Labour Court was also not convinced by the objection that the employer was financially overcommitted, as the employee had also planned to maintain her standard of living based on the company pension.

Although reference was made to the pension fund guidelines as a whole, the restructuring clauses do not affect the basic relationship under labour law.

The employer could only have reduced the scope of its own pension commitment if it had been able to intervene in the pension commitments in accordance with the three-stage review scheme developed by the Federal Labour Court (three-stage theory).

Practical tip

When setting up occupational pension schemes, employers should not only select the external pension providers carefully and review them on an ongoing basis, but also act with foresight when it comes to the type of implementation and the specific structure of the pension commitments.

Occupational pension schemes are usually set up to span several decades, and it is advisable to keep options open for changes, such as a change in the pension provider or implementation method, and to make adjustments if problems arise."
Noerr,Entry into Force of 11th Amendment to the German Competition Act,"The 11th Amendment to the German Competition Act (the “Act”) came into force on 7 November 2023.

After a sometimes controversial debate, one of the most comprehensive reforms of the Act since the 1960s has now been finalised.

Essentially, it leads to three changes which extend the powers of the German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”).

In particular, there is now a provision allowing the FCO to intervene following the completion of a sector inquiry.

In addition, the requirements for disgorgement under competition law have been facilitated.

Finally, the FCO now has investigative powers in connection with the Digital Markets Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 – the “DMA”), which came into force at the end of last year and has applied since the middle of this year.

It remains to be seen how the FCO will utilise its newly granted powers in practice.

The requirements for this are high, which is hardly surprising given the broad scope of the powers of intervention.

Accordingly, only time will tell whether the Amendment to the Act really leads to more competition in highly concentrated markets, as hoped for by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, which was responsible for proposing the legislative changes.

Response options in the wake of sector inquiries (section 32f of the Act)

The Amendment has revised the possible consequences of a sector inquiry pursuant to section 32e(1) of the Act by adding a new fourth competition-law element to the Act that gives the FCO far-reaching intervention powers.

Whereas previously a sector inquiry was concluded with the FCO publishing a final report and specific remedial measures were only available if a breach of the prohibition on cartels or rules on abuse was established, the FCO's powers have now been significantly expanded so as to allow it to take specific remedial measures under less stringent conditions.

A competition infringement is no longer required.

Instead, the FCO may intervene if it simply finds a significant and continuing disruption of competition in the sector under investigation and that the addressee substantially contributed to the disruption (section 32f(3), sentence 3 of the Act).

This means that the FCO will in the future also be able to react to market structures that are generally deficient in terms of competition (such as highly concentrated oligopolies).

If these conditions are met, the FCO may in principle order any remedial measure of a behavioural or structural nature that is necessary to eliminate or reduce the disruption of competition (section 32f(3), sentence 6 of the Act).

Under certain circumstances, it may, as a last resort , even order the unbundling of specific dominant companies and require them to sell company shares or assets if there are no milder, equally effective measures available (section 32f(4) of the Act).

Furthermore, in response to sector inquiries, the FCO may order temporary extensions of the notification obligations for mergers as defined in section 37 of the Act more broadly compared to the previous status quo (section 32f(2) of the Act).

Facilitations for disgorgement Due to the strict requirements for determining the exact amount of the benefit, the FCO has not made any use of its power, pursuant to section 34 of the FCO, to disgorge pecuniary benefits derived from a competition infringement.

In the future, two new presumptions will therefore provide relief in this respect.

First, from now on, it will be presumed that an infringement has actually led to an economic benefit.

Second, it will be presumed that the benefit amounts to at least 1% of the turnover generated in Germany with the products or services related to the infringement (section 34(4), sentences 1 and 4 of the Act).

It will only be possible to rebut this presumption by proving that a benefit in the corresponding amount was not in fact generated during the disgorgement period (section 34(4), sentence 7 of the Act)."
Noerr,Entry into Force of 11th Amendment to the German Competition Act,"Furthermore, the benefits to be disgorged can now be estimated in accordance with section 287 of the German Code of Civil Procedure at an amount that is more likely than not to be the correct amount (section 34(4), sentence 3 of the Act).

Investigative powers and private enforcement options with regard to the DMA Finally, the 11th Amendment to the Act confers investigative powers on the FCO in connection with infringements of Articles 5 to 7 of the DMA.

The new section 32g of the Act sets out search and seizure powers as well as a right to information in relation to gatekeepers under the DMA.

However, the European Commission remains exclusively responsible for the actual enforcement of the DMA; the FCO will only provide assistance in this respect.

At the same time, the possibilities for privately enforcing DMA obligations have also been strengthened.

The Act now largely extends the mechanisms and instruments set out in sections 33 et seq.

to breaches of the DMA.

However, the presumption of damages pursuant to section 33a(2), sentence 1 of the Act has not been extended; it still only applies in its previous area of application, i.e. classic cartels."
Noerr,Poland: New State aid instrument,"The Polish government has presented detailed conditions and modalities for providing support to investment projects of strategic importance for the transition to a net-zero-emission economy.

The new State aid instrument implements the EU programme “Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia”.

The new financial support is to be regarded as a further incentive effect to attract new investments to Poland.

On 30 September 2023, the Polish Ordinance of the Minister of Development and Technology on granting public aid for the implementation of investment projects of strategic importance for the transition to a net-zero-emission economy of 29 September 2023 entered into force.

The Ordinance clarifies the conditions and procedure for obtaining the State aid referred to above, which is set out in the Act on the Preparation and Implementation of Investments in the National Data Processing Centre of 7 July 2023.

Low-carbon project Financial support may be provided for investments consisting of: production of: equipment such as batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, electrolysers and carbon capture and storage (CCUS) equipment, key components intended for direct use as materials in the manufacturing of equipment referred to in (a) above and used for that purpose; related critical raw materials necessary for manufacturing the equipment and key components referred to in (1.) above or their recovery.

Granting of this public aid is subject to a number of conditions , including in particular a commitment by the investor to: incur eligible costs equivalent to at least €110 million ; create at least 50 new jobs in connection with the low-carbon project; meet at least five of the 14 supplementary conditions indicated in the Ordinance, i.e.: creation of specialised jobs, net increase in the number of employees above the minimum threshold, eligible costs above the minimum threshold, cooperation with secondary schools or institutions involved in higher education and scientific research, SME status, location of the investment in an area at risk of exclusion, robotisation and automation of processes, investment in renewable energy sources, utilisation of human resources potential, support in the acquisition of education and vocational qualifications and cooperation with vocational education providers, creation of regional links, taking care of employees, carrying on business activities that have a low negative impact on the environment, conducting R&D activities; completion of low-carbon project no later than seven years from the start of the work.

Aid intensity

The aid intensity depends on where the investment is located .

As a general rule, the aid intensity for a low-carbon project must not exceed 15 per cent of the eligible costs and the total amount of this aid for one entrepreneur must not exceed the equivalent of €150 million .

However, if a low-emission project is carried out in the areas belonging to the Lower Silesian and Greater Poland Voivodeships as well as some districts belonging to the Mazovia Region, the aid intensity for a low-emission project must not exceed 20% of the eligible costs and the total amount of this aid for one business owner may not exceed the equivalent of €200 million .

On the other hand, where investments located in the areas belonging to the provinces: Kuyavian-Pomerania, Lublin, Lubuskie, Łódź, Lesser Poland, Opole, Subcarpathia, Podlasie, Pomerania, Silesia, Holy Cross, Warmia-Masuria and West Pomerania and districts belonging to the Masovian Region other than those listed above, the intensity of aid may not exceed 35% of eligible costs, and the total value of this aid for one business owner may not exceed the equivalent of €350 million ."
Noerr,Poland: New State aid instrument,"Provision of support Support for a low-emission project is granted in the form of a targeted grant on the basis of a public aid agreement concluded with the business owner by the ministry of economics.

Support can be granted until 31 December 2025.

An investor who has received aid for a low-carbon project undertakes to maintain the low-carbon project at the location for a minimum of five years, and where SMEs are involved, for a minimum of three years from the date of completion of the project.

This undertaking does not exclude replacing obsolete or defective installations or equipment during this period, provided that the business is maintained at the location for the minimum period."
Noerr,Romania: Important fiscal measures published for reducing the budget deficit,"On 26 September, the Romanian Government approved by way of Law No. 296/2023 (the “Law”) important fiscal measures intended to reduce the budget deficit and ensure long-term financial stability.

After multiple debates, the Law was published in Official Gazette No. 977 of 27 October 2023.

We present below a summary of the most important fiscal changes that companies and individuals will face starting from 1 January 2024.

The majority of the fiscal measures will apply as from 1 January 2024, but there are a few exceptions, which are mentioned below.

1.

Profit tax Companies that registered a turnover greater than 50 million euros in the previous year are obliged to pay a minimum turnover tax in the current year, if the latter is higher than the profit tax calculated by the company according to the applicable general rules or if the company registers a fiscal loss; The turnover is calculated according to the formula CA = VT – Vs, and the minimum tax is calculated according to the formula IMCA = 1% x (VT - Vs - I - A), where the indicators have the following meaning: VT = total revenues; Vs = revenues that are deducted from total revenues: (i) non-taxable revenues; (ii) revenues related to product inventory costs; (iii) revenues related to the costs of work in progress; (iv) revenues from the production of tangible and intangible assets, which are not included in indicator I; (v) revenues from subsidies; (vi) revenues obtained from compensation from insurance/reinsurance companies for damage caused to stocks or tangible assets; (vii) revenues representing excise duties that were simultaneously reflected in the expense accounts.

I = value of fixed assets under construction related to the acquisition/production of assets, recorded in the accounts starting from fiscal year 2024; A = accounting depreciation computed at the level of historical cost related to assets purchased/produced starting from 1 January 2024.

This indicator does not include the accounting depreciation of the assets included in the value of indicator I above.

The minimum tax is determined before the recovery of the fiscal loss from previous years Regulations are introduced for the payment of the minimum tax and in the case of fiscal groups The amounts related to sponsorships/patronage acts can be deducted from the minimum tax, within the deduction limit provided by law Legal entities carrying out activities in the oil and natural gas sectors will owe, in addition to profit tax, a turnover tax of 0.5% for the 2024-2025 period. 

The tax computed using the same formula as above Credit institutions - Romanian legal entities and Romanian branches of credit institutions - foreign legal entities will owe, in addition to profit tax, a turnover tax of 2% for the 2024-2025 period and 1% starting from 2026. 

For these companies, special computation rules will apply 2.

Microenterprise tax The following new tax rates are being introduced: 1%, for microenterprises with revenues not exceeding EUR 60,000 and not carrying out the activities mentioned below; 3% for microenterprises: (i) with revenues over EUR 60,000; or (ii) carrying out activities in the following sectors: IT, HORECA, legal (only for professional companies with legal personality), general and specialized dental assistance, other activities related to human health; 3. Income tax for salary income and related social insurance contributions Starting from November 2023, monthly gross income of over RON 10,000 earned by employees in the IT, construction, agriculture and food sectors are subject to income tax; Starting from November 2023, the exemption from payment of health insurance contributions for the salary income earned by employees in the fields of construction, agriculture and food has been eliminated Meal and holiday vouchers granted to employees will be subject to 10% health insurance contribution 4.

The tax must be calculated, declared and paid by 31 December inclusive of the year for which the tax is due 8.

Other regulations Income earned by individuals whose source has not been identified by the tax authorities will be taxed at an increased income tax rate of 70% (instead of 16%)

In order to ensure compliance with the traceability of road transport of goods in Romanian territory, the RO e-Seal national system has been established - a system based on the use of electronic devices and an IT application that allows the competent authorities to determine the potential diversion points of goods transported by road transport, regardless of whether they are in transit or have as their final destination an economic operator on national territory The possibility of paying within 15 days half of the minimum fines established by the Fiscal Code, the Fiscal Procedure Code, the Accounting Law, the Cash Register Ordinance and the Law on Cash Operations disappears Law No. 70/2015 for strengthening financial discipline regarding cash receipts and payment operations is amended by drastically reducing the ceilings for cash transactions by approx.

Noerr,EU designates first six gatekeepers under the DMA,"The Digital Markets Act (DMA) of the EU is a milestone for EU regulation of digital markets.

The Act aims to ensure fair competition and protect the openness of digital services by regulating so-called gatekeepers.

Gatekeepers are companies providing core platform services defined in the DMA.

These services can be considered a gateway between a large number of business users and consumers.

Who are the first gatekeepers?

The Commission designated Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft as the first six gatekeepers this September.

These companies now have six months to ensure their 22 designated core platform services to fully comply with the DMA.

( Klick here or on the image for enlarged version)

Further review of some services Additionally, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser meet the statutory quantitative user thresholds of the DMA to qualify Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung as gatekeepers, the Commission accepted the companies‘ argument that these services are not „important gateways“ (see above).

They were not designated as core platform services, meaning that Samsung has not been designated as a gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service.

The Commission has additionally opened market investigations to further assess whether Microsoft’s services Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage do not qualify as gateways despite meeting the thresholds and another investigation to determine whether Apple’s iPad OS qualifies as a gateway despite not meeting the thresholds.

A gatekeeper’s obligations Gatekeepers are bound to specific obligations and forbidden from certain practices designed to prevent preferential treatment of their own digital products and services, ensure fair competition and to protect the digital market.

The six designated companies now have six months to submit a compliance report, which will be monitored by the Commission.

Already, gatekeepers must report all intended mergers where the merging entities or the target provide core platform services or any other services in the digital sector or enable the collection of data.

Non-compliance can be sanctioned with significant fines of up to 10 % of the company’s total worldwide annual turnover – up to 20 % in case of repeat infringements – or periodic penalty payments of up to 5 % of the average daily turnover.

Additional remedies may be imposed in the event of systematic infringements, with structural remedies and the divestiture of (parts of) a business as ultima ratio .

What’s next?

Pre-compliance discussions between the Commission and the designated gatekeepers have started, with gatekeepers having to meet DMA obligations by March 2024.

The recent Gatekeeper designations may still be appealed until mid-November 2023.

The above-mentioned market investigations are ongoing, with decisions in the rebuttal investigations expected in February 2024.

The five investigations may result in further designations, although no new companies are currently under review as potential gatekeepers.

Further gatekeepers may be designated in the future if and when more companies meet the designation thresholds.

Additionally, with the latest amendment to the German Act against Restraints of Competition that has been passed by Bundestag in July and Bundesrat on 29 September 2023, Germany extends statutory provisions that grant damages claims in case of antitrust violations to DMA violations.

By this core elements of the German transposition of the Damages Directive and the standard used for private enforcement of Art.

101 and 102 TFEU are applied to the DMA and Commission decisions based thereon.

The implementation of the DMA will continue to raise important and complex questions for companies across the digital sector as it is developed in the years to come.

While we see the European Commission’s first steps in public enforcement of the DMA, private enforcement looms on the horizon as well."

Noerr,20th Ordinance amending German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance is now in force,"On 5 October 2023, the 20th Ordinance amending the German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance ( Außenwirtschaftsverordnung , “ AWV ”) of 27 September 2023 entered into force.

It establishes, inter alia, some new offences ( Bußgeldtatbestände ) that will be subject to fines.

But most important, it lays the foundation for an extensive digitalisation of the investment review procedure.

The new provisions on digitalising administrative processes and on fines are highlighted below.

Digitalising administrative processes Extensive changes have been made to Section 3 AWV to drive the digitalisation of administrative processes in the AWV’s area of applicability.

This makes it possible now for administrative acts passed under the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act ( Außenwirtschaftsgesetz , “ AWG ”) to be passed not only in writing but also electronically (Section 3(1) AWV).

However, as regards investment control, special regulations had already made this possible previously.

Likewise, under Section 3(3) AWV, applications, notifications, information, documents, reports and other documentation that are submitted on the basis of Sections 14a, 15 or 23 AWG or in the context of reviewing corporate acquisitions (chapter 6 part 2 AWV) can be submitted not only in writing but also electronically.

These documents are to be submitted via an administrative portal within the meaning of the German Online Access Act ( Onlinezugangsgesetz ) once it has been made available.

The electronic availability of this administrative portal will be determined by a general order of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz , “ BMWK ”).

One provision that will affect everyday practice is the new Section 3(4) AWV.

Under this provision, the beginning of a Phase 1 review will not be based on the date of submission via the administrative portal.

Instead, the notification or application will be deemed to have been received when the BMWK has imported/downloaded the transmitted documents completely and undamaged from the administrative portal into its IT system.

The BMWK shall immediately confirm receipt of the transmitted documents to the direct acquirer or inform him if documents are incomplete or not intact.

Provisions on fines Besides the changes in regard to digitalisation, some new offences subject to fines have been established.

In addition to adjustments made necessary by recent changes in European Union regulations, now the following additional provisions on fines are in force: First, the prohibition on acquiring a new interest or increasing an existing interest in a legal entity, organisation or institution engaged in the mining and extraction of stone or earths in Russia is now subject to a fine.

The ban on taking a post in any management bodies of Russian state companies is also subject to a fine.

Finally, a fine can be imposed on anyone enabling Russian citizens and individuals residing in Russia to fill a post in a management body of the owner company or operating company of critical infrastructure, European critical infrastructure or critical institutions determined as such under national law.

Impact in practice It will be especially interesting to see the effect on everyday practice of the new Section 3(4) AWV, which provides that the Phase 1 review does not begin until the transmitted documents have been imported from the administrative portal by the BMWK.

The risk of an IT error on the part of the administrative portal, which is yet to be made available, or a transmission error when the BMWK downloads the documents will now be on the applying or notifying party even though that party has no influence on the administrative portal or the downloading process.

To eliminate this risk, it could be advisable in the future to (once again) submit applications and notifications at least also in writing – although they are “supposed” to be submitted electronically."
Noerr,20th Ordinance amending German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance is now in force,"As a result, the 20th Ordinance amending the AWV could prove to be counterproductive to the goal of increased process digitalisation."
Noerr,Criminal record certificate in Franchise Agreements: Permissibility of the request?,"1.

Introduction Franchise agreements often contain a clause according to which the franchisee must present his criminal record certificate to the franchisor if necessary and the certificate of good conduct must not contain any negative entries.

For example, such a clause could read: “(1) Criminal record certificate.

The FRANCHISEE must have a clean European Criminal Record Certificate for the term of the Agreement and provide proof of itimmediately upon request by the FRANCHISOR.”

There is a serious risk that such a clause violates data protection law due to the lack of relevant special legal permission standards in German and EU law regarding the requirement for criminal record certificate.

2. Facts The criminal record certificate contains personal data about criminal convictions and offenses, the processing of which is subject to particularly high requirements under Article 10 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”).

They may only be processed if there is a specific legal basis for this that “ provides for appropriate guarantees for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects ”.

However, as far as can be seen, there is no legal basis under German law: For employees, Section 26 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (“ BDSG ”) only contains regulations for the processing of data about crimes committed by employees .

As franchisees are not employee, Section 26 BDSG is not applicable to franchisees.

The EU framework decision (2009/315/JI) on the European Criminal Record Certificate does not help either.

According to Article 9 (2) of the Decision, personal data transmitted for purposes other than criminal proceedings may only be processed in accordance with national law.

This brings us back to the starting point.

Unfortunately, there is no national legal basis.

It is questionable whether it is permissible to simply take note of the criminal record certificate without saving the personal data it contains in a file system.

However, this creative approach is anything but legally secure.

As far as can be seen, there seems to be no German decision regarding this matter.  

The Spanish data protection authority Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (“ AEPD ”) has already imposed a fine of EUR 2 million on Amazon (see ZD-Aktuell 2022, 01080).

Amazon had required self-employed drivers to have a criminal record certificate without entries.

However, in the opinion of the AEPD, this design was not GDPR compliant: The AEPD was of the opinion that requesting a criminal record certificate, even as a “negative certificate” (and therefore without corresponding entries), constituted the processing of data about criminal convictions and offenses within the meaning of Art. 

10 GDPR and therefore only with consent of the person concerned may be carried out under official supervision or may be based on a special national legal basis.

There was no legal basis in the form of a national law requiring transport personnel to have a criminal record certificate without entries.

In fact, not even state authorities would require this when issuing transport licenses.

Consent was also ruled out because it was not voluntary (it was not possible to progress further in the application process without consent).

The AEPD rejected the argument that the logistics company had a legitimate interest in protecting the safety and trust of its customers through this application requirement.

Such an argument would only be relevant in accordance with Art. 

6 Para. 1 lit.

f GDPR, but even if Art. 6 were applicable (and not Art. 10 GDPR), the obligation to present a negative certificate would exceed the limits of what is reasonable.

3. Conclusion Instead of a criminal record certificate, the franchisor's right to ask questions might be permissible as a milder means."
Noerr,Criminal record certificate in Franchise Agreements: Permissibility of the request?,"3. Conclusion Instead of a criminal record certificate, the franchisor's right to ask questions might be permissible as a milder means.

A franchisor may specifically ask about previous convictions that are relevant to the specific license relationship, instead of simply looking at the criminal record (which can also reveal previous convictions that are irrelevant to the relationship).

In the franchise agreement, the clause could then be formulated in such a way that the franchisee assures that he has not been convicted of any criminal offenses that would make him appear unreliable to carry out the franchise business (e.g. breach of trust, theft, criminal offenses in connection with this Youth Protection Act).

For example, the clause could read as follows: “No Criminal record.

The FRANCHISEE confirms having no criminal record which would make the FRANCHISEE unreliable to operate the Store (e.g. for fraud, theft, offences relating to the Youth Protection Act).”"
Noerr,Landmark decision by the German Federal Court of Justice on disclosure duties in real estate sales – relevant to entire M&A practice,"In certain cases, a seller is subject to a separate disclosure duty even if the buyer has had the opportunity to take notice of a certain issue in a data room.

This applies in any case if such issue may cause the buyer considerable financial loss and is not readily recognisable from the data provided.

In particular, the buyer may usually expect to be informed by the seller if the seller is aware of the issue and can therefore easily disclose it.

In its judgment of 15 September 2023 (V ZR 77/22), the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) further clarified its case law on a seller's pre-contractual disclosure duty and commented on the requirements for the disclosure of documents and information in electronic data rooms.

The Federal Court established that disclosure in a data room suffices to satisfy the seller’s disclosure duty if and to the extent that, based on the actual circumstances, the seller may reasonably expect the buyer to take note of the issue that is subject to a disclosure duty by inspecting the data room.

In case of doubt and if it is apparent to the seller that the issue in question is of considerable importance to the buyer, the seller has to inform the buyer separately.

The decision is highly relevant to preparing and executing transactions in all economic sectors.

A. Facts In the context of a commercial property sale in 2019, the seller made several representations in the sale and purchase agreement, including that the seller had no knowledge of any extraordinary costs in the current financial year or in the future and that the owners’ association had not resolved to make any further special cost allocations.

The agreement also included a clause stating that the minutes of all owners’ association meetings in the last three years had been made available to the buyer.

Prior to the notarisation, the seller set up an electronic data room with various documents relating to the property to be purchased.

On a Friday, three days before the notarisation on the following Monday, the seller uploaded to the data room a collection of documents reflecting decisions taken at owners’ association meetings since 2007.

Among these documents were the minutes of an owners’ association meeting in 2016 according to which the owners decided to claim payment of EUR 50 million from the majority owner at the time due to extensive alterations to the jointly owned property.

However, the originally contemplated special cost allocation payable by the owners of the commercial units with an indemnification of the condominium owners was rejected.

To enforce such a special allocation, another owner brought an action.

The proceedings were terminated by mutual agreement in January 2020, with the parties agreeing on a special allocation of initially EUR 750,000 to be paid by the owners of the commercial units for the refurbishment measures, including an option to increase this special allocation to up to EUR 50 million if necessary.

As the new owner of the commercial unit, the buyer was obliged to bear a proportion of the special allocation.

B. Dispute In the course of the legal dispute, the buyer claimed not to have been adequately informed about the risk of a special allocation of up to EUR 50 million, to which the buyer as the new owner would be required to contribute proportionately.

The buyer pointed out that the minutes of the owners’ meeting held in November 2016 had been “secretly” placed in the data room in an attempt to literally “slip it by” him.

The seller argued that the buyer had not made sufficient use of the opportunity to enquire and ask questions and that, at the time when they entered into the agreement, no special allocation had been decided."
Noerr,Landmark decision by the German Federal Court of Justice on disclosure duties in real estate sales – relevant to entire M&A practice,"C. The Federal Court’s decision While the lower courts had dismissed the action, the Federal Court established that, due to the considerable importance of the potential costs of EUR 50 million in the case at hand, the seller had a responsibility to separately inform the buyer about the possibility of a special allocation of this amount.

According to the Federal Court, issues with the potential to frustrate the contractual purpose or to cause considerable financial loss and which are therefore relevant for the decision to purchase have to be disclosed by the seller not only in the data room; the seller has to expressly advise the buyer of them.

This applies at least in an individual case where the seller cannot reasonably expect the buyer to gain knowledge of a certain issue by inspecting the data room.

The Federal Court did not accept the formal argument that a special allocation did not exist at the time the agreement was entered into and that it was only introduced by the settlement agreement in January 2020.

The Federal Court based its decision mainly on the existing risk of such a special allocation: Since the issue of a special allocation had not been finally resolved, there was a real risk for the buyer, as the new owner, of having to bear a share of the costs for outstanding refurbishment measures, especially if recourse for the costs from the former majority shareholder were to be unsuccessful.

The Federal Court was of the opinion that the seller had to separately advise the buyer of this issue.

Duty to disclose despite existence of a data room The Federal Court first analyzed, without an unequivocal result, the question of whether the establishment of a data room and the performance of due diligence results in the satisfaction of the seller’s duty to disclose.

In this context, the Federal Court focused on whether and when a buyer may be reasonably expected, based on the circumstances of the individual case, to notice an issue subject to a disclosure duty in the course of its due diligence.

According to the Federal Court, it may not be generally concluded solely from the fact that a data room has been set up and due diligence has been carried out, i.e. that the buyer has been given the opportunity to take notice, that a buyer will become aware of the issues subject to a disclosure duty.

This depends on the volume of the data room and its organisation, the correct designation of the documents and systematic sorting and, for example, also whether the buyer is advised of documents added subsequently.

According to the Federal Court, it is also decisive how much time the buyer has to examine the information.

Finally, it also depends on the form of the information from which the issue subject to a disclosure duty is to be ascertained.

As an example, the Federal Court cites the handing over of financing documents or a folder with documents on the property to be purchased.

In such cases, a seller may not simply assume that the documents handed over will be checked for defects.

Material significance of the issue that must be disclosed The decisive factor is the significance of the issue subject to a disclosure duty.

If the issue is of material relevance for the decision to purchase, for example because it may frustrate the contractual purpose or cause considerable financial loss to the buyer, the seller is subject to a disclosure duty.

If, in addition, this significant issue is not readily apparent from the documents made available, the seller must provide information without being asked despite the existence of a data room and the due diligence carried out by the buyer.

This applies in particular if it is not difficult for the seller to disclose the issue and to advise the buyer accordingly.

In such cases, the seller cannot rely on the buyer’s being able to ascertain the issue from the documents independently."
Noerr,Landmark decision by the German Federal Court of Justice on disclosure duties in real estate sales – relevant to entire M&A practice,"In such cases, the seller cannot rely on the buyer’s being able to ascertain the issue from the documents independently.

Late posting of documents in a data room In the case at hand, the Federal Court did not consider the seller's disclosure duty to have been fulfilled by posting the relevant minutes of the owners' association meeting in the electronic data room three days before the notarisation.

The Federal Court holds the view that there is no reason for a buyer to check the data room for new documents three days before the notarisation without separate notice.

It is interesting in this context that the Federal Court holds that a buyer does not have to expect that information will be provided with so little advance notice even where no deadline for the posting of documents in the data room has been agreed.

Finally, the issue subject to a disclosure duty was also not readily apparent from the posted documents, as the posted collection contained all resolutions since 2007.

Duty to enquire vs. duty to disclose The facts on which the decision is based raise the question whether it was possible for the buyer to identify sufficient indications of the potential special allocation.

This could result in a duty of the buyer to make enquiries, from the violation of which, however, the Federal Court does not deduce any direct effect on the disclosure duty.

In the Federal Court’s view, a failure to enquire would only constitute contributory fault for the occurrence of the damage.

D. Impact in practice The Federal Court's ruling once again makes it clear that the mere posting of information and documents in a virtual data room is not sufficient to reliably fulfil a seller's disclosure duty and thus exempt the seller from liability.

If information is posted in the data room that is of significance for the decision to purchase, a seller should not rely solely on the fact that the buyer will independently identify all information in the course of its due diligence, even if this should usually be the case with the assistance of professional advisors.

In order to avoid possible disputes, sellers must carefully examine and analyse, with the help of professional advisors, which information may be of significant relevance to a potential buyer in the run-up to the transaction and when organising and filling the data room.

Such information should be entered in a well-classified and professionally organised data room with unequivocal designation.

In addition, potential buyers should be separately advised of any issues that may be of considerable importance for the buyer, and this should also be documented in the sale and purchase agreement, which should also contain provisions on the depth and scope of the due diligence carried out."
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control investigates possible violations of the Supply Chain Act,"The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für

Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle – the “BAFA”) “) has announced that it is investigating 58 German companies for possible violations of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ‒ the “Supply Chain Act”).

It would appear that this is the first case of its kind and that it raises complex questions which are yet to be clarified by the courts.

Public strikes against Polish company trigger investigation In the spring and summer of 2023, drivers from a Polish transport company held strikes at a service station on a German motorway for several months.

The drivers complained about inhumane working conditions at their employer and unpaid wages.

Several German media outlets reported on the strikes.

When the drivers went on a hunger strike in the summer, the Federal Minister of Labour, Mr Heil, intervened so as to have the BAFA conduct a special audit on the basis of the Supply Chain Act.

This was because there were goods belonging to German companies included in the freight.

In September 2023, employees of the BAFA spoke to the drivers, seized numerous waybills on site for evidentiary purposes and analysed them.

It turned out that there were 58 German companies subject to the Supply Chain Act which were using the services of the transport company.

The Supply Chain Act as a gateway for investigative measures against German companies The case is a novelty and shows that the Supply Chain Act, which only recently entered into force, is already acting as a gateway for official investigative measures, including the possible imposition of fines.

At first glance, what is remarkable is how the companies concerned came to the supervisory authority’s attention “through the back door”.

The starting point for the strike was in fact the precarious working conditions said to prevail at the Polish transport company, but not the work situation at the German companies.

From the perspective of the Supply Chain Act the accusation is a different one: companies obliged under the Supply Chain Act need to check their direct business relationships with other companies for human rights and environmental risks or violations and take appropriate measures if necessary.

Due to the strikes that had occurred in the spring and the associated media coverage, the companies were considered to be aware of the drivers’ working conditions.

Unresolved issues So-called indirect suppliers, such as subcontractors, who are often used in the transport industry, are not subject to the Supply Chain Act’s due diligence obligations from the outset.

A company only has an obligation to act if it has actual indications that a violation of a human rights-related or an environment-related obligation at indirect suppliers may be possible (section 9(3), sentence 1 of the Supply Chain Act).

Some legal scholars have expressed doubt as to whether this provision satisfies the principle of legal certainty under constitutional law so as to allow administrative fines to be imposed.

In addition, in spite of the interpretation guidelines in the BAFA’s FAQ and guidance, the provision raises complex questions that have not yet been clarified by the courts: What kinds of requirements should be placed on the quality and level of detail of the indications that make a violation appear possible?

For example, does a specific company have to be named?

Are publications on the internet or broadcasts on television sufficient?

This at least is doubtful because the Supply Chain Act stipulates that the information has to be available to the company .

This is only likely to be the case if a relevant person within the company is or must be aware of the information, for example through a report in the mandatory complaints channel.

When is there a risk of repetition and what are the requirements for appropriate and effective remedial measures?"
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control investigates possible violations of the Supply Chain Act,"When is there a risk of repetition and what are the requirements for appropriate and effective remedial measures?

Finally, a company only has to terminate its business relationship with the company concerned under narrow conditions and as a last resort (section 7(3) of the Supply Chain Act).

Conclusion and outlook The Supply Chain Act continues to raise numerous complex questions.

At the same time, it is to be expected that the Act will increasingly serve as a gateway for investigative measures by the supervisory authority in the future.

Companies subject to these obligations should be prepared for this and take the necessary measures and document them in a verifiable manner.

In addition, it is foreseeable that companies will have to pay more attention to properly identifying risks or possible violations and, where necessary, take adequate measures."
Noerr,Reporting obligations in Germany in the case of security incidents,"When a company is the victim of a cyber attack, one of the first urgent questions for its legal department is usually what reporting obligation must now be met.

For some reporting obligations very short time limits apply, which the regulatory authorities take very seriously.

This article provides an overview of reporting requirements to authorities in the event of an IT incident.

Depending on a company’s business, it may be subject to several concurrent reporting obligations.

Cyber attacks frequently have international ramifications.

This in turn can mean that a company also must fulfil additional reporting requirements abroad.

Depending on the competent authority, it may be that an authority will inform other authorities as well, at least within Europe.

It can frequently be observed that companies lack an understanding of their contractual obligations to notify their contractual partners of a cyber breach.

In particular, such reporting obligations are often “hidden” in confidentiality clauses.

A processor for the purposes of data protection law also has an obligation to notify a controller of a data breach (Article 33(2) of the GDPR).

In addition, reporting obligations ( Meldeobliegenheiten ) to insurers must also be taken into account.

Issuers of financial instruments must check whether the IT security incident also triggers an ad-hoc publicity obligation under the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR).

Statutory definition of an IT security incident Different laws have different definitions of an IT security incident.

The majority of these definitions have one thing in common, namely that the information security goals of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and/or availability must have been compromised.

In the case of some laws, a reporting obligation only arises when further preconditions are met.

Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft of a new Reorganisation Tax Decree,"On 11 November 2011, the currently applicable Reorganisation Tax Decree (“ Umwandlungssteuererlass ”, the “ Reorganisation Tax Decree 2011” ) was published, and had been urgently awaited by practitioners.

It contains the tax authorities’ view of how to interpret the Reorganisation Tax Act (“ Umwandlungssteuergesetz ”) and thus has considerable practical importance in reorganisations.

On 11 October 2023, the Federal Ministry of Finance has now published the draft of a fundamentally updated reorganisation tax decree ( “ Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree” ).

The draft takes into account significant changes in legislation and supreme court decisions that have been issued since the publication of the current version of 11 November 2011.

The new Reorganisation Tax Decree is intended to apply to all open cases and replaces the Reorganisation Tax Decree 2011 (sec. 00.04a).

In individual cases, however, the Reorganisation Tax Decree 2011 remains applicable (e.g. sec. 34).

1

The main changes can be summarised as follows:

Scope of application of the Reorganisation Tax Act In the scope of application of the Reorganisation Tax Act, adjustments are made to legal changes, in particular with regard to the abolition of section 1(2) of the Reorganisation Tax Act, the introduction of the option model in section 1a of the Corporation Tax Act and the option introduced by the Act on the Modernisation of the Law on Partnerships (“ Gesetz zur Modernisierung des Personengesellschaftsrechts – MoPeG” ) for registered civil-law partnerships to act as legal entities suitable for reorganisation as of 1 January 2024.

Updates are also planned in the substantive scope of application.

For example, it is clarified (at sec. 01.15) that the non-proportional demerger also includes the scenario that a shareholder of the transferring company does not participate in the acquiring company at all (known as demerger at zero).

With regard to cross-border reorganisations, the necessary criteria for comparability with a domestic reorganisation are further specified.

The Federal Ministry of Finance also follows the CJEU’s ruling in the case C-106/16 (Polbud) on cross-border outbound/inbound changes of legal form (sec. 01.38b).

Insofar as an unlimited or limited domestic corporate income tax liability of the corporation continues to exist after an outbound change of legal form (e.g. reorganisation of a German limited liability company into a Luxembourg S.à r.l.), there will be no application of the Reorganisation Tax Act nor a disclosure of hidden reserves or a loss deduction limitation.

Even in the case of an inbound change of legal form (e.g. reorganisation of a Luxembourg S.à r.l. into a German limited liability company), neither the transfer of the centre of management nor the transfer of the registered office will lead to a disclosure of the hidden reserves as there is no limitation of Germany’s right of taxation.

2 Prohibition on offsetting losses in the retroactive period (section 2(4) sentence 3 of the Reorganisation Tax Act) With regard to the loss deduction limitation in the retroactive period pursuant to section 2(4) sentence 3 of the Reorganisation Tax Act, it is clarified that with regard to the losses that can be offset, the remaining loss carryforward, the negative income that has not been offset and the interest carryforward of the acquiring legal entity, there is no time restriction on the retroactive period (sec. 02.40a).

In addition, the loss deduction limitation is applied irrespective of whether there is an intention to abuse the tax system as well as in the case of contributions and also applies to the determination of the trade tax assessment basis."
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft of a new Reorganisation Tax Decree,"3 Allocation of permanent establishments in cross-border reorganisations The Reorganisation Tax Decree 2011 was still based on the principles of the Federal Ministry of Finance’s letter of 24 December 1999 (Permanent Establishment - Administration Principles – “ Betriebsstätten-Verwaltungsgrundsätze” ).

Therefore, in practice the question has increasingly arisen of whether the principal establishment’s central function claimed therein continues to be decisive in the context of the reorganisation.

The Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree at sec.

03.20 now refers to the provisions under treaty law as well as section 1(5) of the Foreign Tax Act (“ Außensteuergesetz ”), the Regulation on the Allocation of Profits of Permanent Establishments (“ Betriebsstättengewinnaufteilungsverordnung ”) and the Administrative Principles on the Allocation of Profits of Permanent Establishments (“ Verwaltungsgrundsätze Betriebsstättengewinnaufteilung ”).

4 Merger of corporations into partnerships In the case of mergers with partnerships, it is clarified that the fair market value is to be reduced for the acquiring legal entity on the tax transfer date if the fair market value of the shares in the transferring corporation is lower than its book value.

If applicable, section 8b(3) of the Corporation Tax Act or section 3c(2) of the Income Tax Act is to be applied to the resulting loss (sec. 04.05).

In addition, foreign shareholders of corporations who become co-entrepreneur of the partnership due to the reorganisation are included in the separate and uniform determination pursuant to section 180 et seq. of the German Tax Code only to the extent that Germany had a right of taxation with respect to the capital gain of the shares in the corporation or the income within the meaning of section 7 of the Reorganisation Tax Act on the tax transfer date (sec. 04.23).

The Federal Ministry of Finance clarifies that capital gains tax can then also be credited against the income pursuant to section 7 of the Reorganisation Tax Act as part of the assessment procedure.

In our opinion, this clarification is only relevant for cases in which the fiction of contribution according to section 5(2) and (3) of the Reorganisation Tax Act does not apply.

This is because in the cases of the contribution fiction, the capital gains tax is creditable for the takeover result irrespective of the existence of a German taxation right (cf.

Stadler/Elser/Bindl, DB 2012, supplement no. 1 to Issue 2, 14 (24); Birkemeier, in Rödder/Herlinghaus/van Lishaut, Reorganisation Tax Act, 3rd ed. 2019, section 7 at para.

63).

In the case of a change of legal form from a corporation to a partnership, the Federal Ministry of Finance applies the Federal Fiscal Court ruling of 11 April 2019 (IV R 1/17).

According to this ruling, the taxation of the corporation’s open reserves under section 7 sentence 1 of the Reorganisation Tax Act in the case of shares fictitiously treated as contributed in section 5(2) of the Reorganisation Tax Act are treated as the profit of the joint ownership and not as the designated profit of the previous shareholder (sec. 05.07a).

5 Asset transfer costs (sec. 04.34)

The allocation of expenses to “asset transfer costs” is based on the principle of causation.

In implementing the Federal Fiscal Court ruling of 23 November 2022 (I R 25/20), the “triggering momentum” for the occurrence of the expenses and their greater proximity to the sale or the current profit must be taken into account.

6 Merger of corporations In the case of a downward merger, applying the Federal Fiscal Court ruling of 30 May 2018 (I R 31/16), the shareholding of the transferring company in the acquiring company that is transferred directly to the shareholder of the transferring company also belongs to the transferred assets within the meaning of section 11 para.

1 sentence 1 Reorganisation Tax Act (sec. 11.06).

According to sec."
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft of a new Reorganisation Tax Decree,"1 sentence 1 Reorganisation Tax Act (sec. 11.06).

According to sec.

11.09a of the Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree, the downward merger of a parent company with shareholders resident abroad into its subsidiary can also be completed tax-neutrally at book values if the taxation of the hidden reserves of the parent company is ensured.

Since the shareholding in the subsidiary is transferred to the shareholder of the parent company in the course of the downward merger, it is important for the recognition at carrying amount whether the hidden reserves in the shareholding continue to be subject to German taxation for this shareholder.

7 Demergers of corporations Furthermore, the Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree now provides an answer to a question that is often critical in practice in the case of demergers of branches of activity.

According to this, assets that can be allocated according to economic connections, which are used by several branches of activity and are not split up, are to be uniformly allocated to the branches of activity in which they are predominantly used (sec. 15.08).

The Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree now expressly stipulates that a takeover gain or loss within the meaning of section 12(2) sentence 1 in conjunction with section 15(1) sentence 1 of the Reorganisation Tax Act must be determined not only in the case of an upward demerger but also in the case of a downward and lateral demerger, in which the acquiring corporation did not previously hold an interest in the transferring corporation.

Accordingly, in line with the Federal Fiscal Court’s ruling of 9 January 2013 (I R 24/12), the cost of the asset transfer is not deductible as a business expense in those cases either (sec. 15.14a).

The Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree contains hardly any changes or clarifications regarding the misuse avoidance provisions of section 15(2) of the Reorganisation Tax Act, which are controversial in practice.

8 Change of legal form (section 25 Reorganisation Tax Act) and contribution of a co-entrepreneur share (section 20 Reorganisation Tax Act)

In a change of legal form from a partnership to a corporation (section 25 of the Reorganisation Tax Act), it is clarified that the object of the contribution is in each case the co-entrepreneur shares in the partnership which is changing its legal form.

In these cases there is also a uniform transaction that can fall under section 20 of the Reorganisation Tax Act as a whole if the transfer of the joint ownership and the special business assets takes place in a temporal and economic context (sec. 20.05).

In the case of contributions of only part of a co-entrepreneur share, for the application of section 20 Reorganisation Tax Act the associated functionally essential asset of the special business assets must be transferred proportionately, i.e. at least in the same ratio of the transferred part of the share in the joint ownership in relation to the entire share in the overall assets (sec. 20.11).

9 Contributions for which other consideration is also granted Extensive changes with examples are also made in the Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree for contributions in which other consideration is granted in addition to corporate rights.

This applies both to contributions under section 20 of the Reorganisation Tax Act (sec.

20.19a) and section 24 of the Reorganisation Tax Act (sec. 24.07) and to the exchange of shares under section 21 of the Reorganisation Tax Act (sec. 21.10).

In addition, the Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree clarifies that the transferring entity cannot oppose the valuation at the acquiring corporation within the scope of its own taxation procedure.

However, in implementation of the Federal Fiscal Court rulings of 8 June 2011 (I R 79/10) and 15 June 2016 (I R 69/15), the transferring party, as a third party, is entitled to a third party right of appeal for the relevant tax assessment of the acquiring corporation (sec. 20.25)."
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft of a new Reorganisation Tax Decree,"10 Contribution profit The contribution profit 1 is not subject to trade tax if the contribution at fair market value would not have been subject to trade tax.

This also applies if not all shares received are sold in one transaction (sec. 22.07).

The same applies to the contribution profit 2, which is also not subject to trade tax if the contribution at fair market value would also not have been subject to trade tax pursuant to section 7 sentence 2 of the Trade Tax Act (sec. 22.13).

The Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree makes an addition for cases in which the transferring party has already sold all or part of the shares received before the time of the retroactive taxation of the contribution profits.

In principle, there is no retroactive taxation of the contribution profit in this case (section 22(2) sentence 5 of the Reorganisation Tax Act).

However, according to the meaning and purpose of the provision, this only applies if the previous sale of the shares received by the transferor resulted in the complete disclosure of the hidden reserves (sec. 22.17).

11 Reorganisations and consolidated tax groups In sec.

Org.12 the Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree contains a stricter stance on the termination of a consolidated tax group within the five-year minimum term to the effect that a reorganisation-induced termination of a profit and loss transfer agreement “may” be an important reason within the meaning of section 14(1) sentence 1 no. 3 sentence 2 of the Corporation Tax Act (wording in the Reorganisation Tax Decree 2011: “is an important reason”).

Furthermore, a change of legal form of a corporation into another corporation does not constitute an important reason (sec. Org.26).

In addition, the Draft Reorganisation Tax Decree also makes further statements in connection with reorganisations of consolidated tax groups, which, among other things, also concern the transition from the adjustment item method to the contribution-/contribution repayment method."
Noerr,New class action – Act on representative actions now in force,"The Representative Actions Directive Implementation Act ( Verbandsklagenrichtlinienumsetzungsgesetz – the “ Representative Actions Act ”) was announced in the Federal Law Gazette on 12 October 2023 and came into force on 13 October 2023.

Germany has thus completed the long-overdue transposition of the EU Representative Actions Directive 2020/1828 (the “ RAD ”).

The core of the Representative Actions Act is the introduction of a collective action for redress in addition to the model declaratory action already available since 2018.

Due to the changes proposed by the judiciary committee of the Bundestag ( BT-Drs. 20/7631 ), the final version of the Representative Actions Act that came into force differs in important points from the ministerial draft and the government draft ( BT-Drs.

20/6520 ) (see for the two drafts our articles on 16 February 2023 and 31 March 2023 (see also Schläfke/Schmitt-Lampe, DATEV magazin, 18 August 2023 and the recording of our Noerr webinar ).

Scope of application Representative actions for redress cover all civil law disputes regarding claims and legal relationships of a number of consumers against an undertaking (section 1(1) of the Consumer Rights Enforcement Act – “ CREA ” ( Verbraucherrechtedurchsetzungsgesetz )).

This means that the area of applicability is significantly broader than that required by the RAD, i.e. with provisions related to not only consumer protection but also, for example, general tort law.

The action for redress could become important in Germany, particularly when it comes to claims for damages under data privacy law , product liability cases , claims for antitrust damages, capital investment cases and the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act.

The Federation of Consumer Organisations ( Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband ) has already told the FAZ newspaper that it will use the new action for redress against energy suppliers, telecommunication companies and financial services providers.

Companies with fewer than ten employees and an annual turnover or an annual balance of not more than €2 million (small-sized enterprises) are considered equivalent to consumers and will also be permitted to join actions for redress (section 1(2) CREA).

In this respect, too, the RAD’s requirements are being exceeded in the implementation.

However, fewer companies are covered than initially planned in the government draft.

Standing to bring an action Consumers themselves are not authorised to bring an action, but rather only eligible (German) consumer associations named in the list in section 4 of the Act on Prohibitory Actions ( Unterlassungsklagengesetz ) that do not receive more than 5% of their funding from companies (section 2(1) no.1 CREA).

The requirement that an association has been on the list for one year makes it seem possible that associations are also founded ad hoc in order to bring actions for redress.

Also, associations from other EU Member States can bring actions in Germany (section 2(1) no. 2 CREA).

The lowered threshold for the associations to bring an action means that representative actions are more likely to be brought in future.

Representative actions are also appealing because the fairly low cost risks for associations eligible to bring an action are fairly reasonable – the value in dispute is capped at €300,000 (action for redress) or €250,000 (model declaratory action) irrespective of the actual economic importance of the case.

Pooling similar types of claims Compared to the government draft, the requirement of similarity of the claims is less strict, allowing for an action if the action concerns “ materially similar ” claims (section 15(1) sentence CREA).

This is the case when the claims are based on the same facts or on a set of materially comparable facts and essentially the same factual and legal issues are decisive for the claims (section 15(1) sentence 2 CREA)."
Noerr,New class action – Act on representative actions now in force,"The broad wording gives the courts a lot of flexibility in handling actions for redress.

Whether the claims at hand are similar enough will most likely be one of the most controversial issues.

Consumer quorum: claims by at least 50 consumers affected Contrary to the government draft, claimants no longer have to provide evidence that claims by at least 50 consumers are affected by the representative action.

Claimants only need to “reasonably demonstrate” that 50 claims are affected (section 4(1) CREA).

How the new representative action for redress works The action for redress, which must be brought before the Higher Regional Court at the defendant’s place of business, is available in three models: In the first model , the association is aware of the identity of the affected consumers and seeks performance directly to the consumers (section 16(1) sentence 2 CREA).

If  the action is successful, the company is ordered to make a payment directly to the consumers.

In practice this model will probably not be used often because an association usually does not know the affected consumers by name.

The second model will probably be the most relevant from a practical point of view.

In this model the association requests performance to unnamed consumers who are only identified by common group characteristics (section 16(1) sentence 2 CREA).

The main procedural steps are the judicial proceedings for redress (interlocutory judgment on redress, settlement phase and final judgment on redress), the implementation proceedings with an optional judicial review on the trustee’s decision and (in some cases) subsequent judicial individual proceedings: In the third model , the parties can adapt the second model and apply for a single judgment which contains all decisions otherwise split between the interlocutory and final judgment on redress (section 16(4) CREA).

In the second and third models, within narrowly defined boundaries, consumers and companies can ask the competent Higher Regional Court to review the trustee’s decision on the claims registered (section 28(4) CREA).

This opens the door to making an already complicated, tedious and drawn-out process even longer and more expensive.

Late pre-judgment opt-in Consumers must actively join the action for redress by registering their claims with a public register.

The deadline for registration was changed several times in the legislative process.

Registration is now possible up to three weeks after the end of the oral hearing in first instance (section 46(1) sentence 1 CREA).

Since a judgment must not be issued earlier than six weeks after the end of the oral hearing (section 13(4) CREA), consumers must always register before a judgment.

This late opt-in option will often make it very difficult for defendants to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations prior to a judgment.

The reason for this is that companies will not be able to ascertain before the start of settlement negotiations who and how many people have registered their claims and accordingly which claims are covered by a potential settlement.

Strict provisions on third party litigation funding Third party litigation funding is permissible in principle.

The requirements are more precise and stricter than in the ministerial and government drafts.

If the litigation funder’s success fee exceeds 10% of the sum to be paid by the defendant, the action is inadmissible (section 4(2)

no. 3 CREA).

The association must disclose the sources they use for funding the action as well as the financing agreement to the court (section 4(3) CREA).

If the action is successful, the claimed amount must first be paid to the individual consumer.

It is not allowed to deduct the success fee from the collective total awarded by the court.

This is due to the structure of the implementation proceeding."
Noerr,New class action – Act on representative actions now in force,"It is not allowed to deduct the success fee from the collective total awarded by the court.

This is due to the structure of the implementation proceeding.

Litigation funding of actions for skimming of profits allowed There is no explicit limit for the success fee in case a qualified entity uses third party litigation funding for financing an action for skimming off profits under section 10 of the German Act against Unfair Competition ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb – “ Unfair Competition Act ”).

However, a prerequisite is that the Federal Office of Justice approves the financing conditions prior to the fling of the claim (section 10(6) of the Unfair Competition Act).

Another significant change is that not only intentional but also grossly negligent violations of the Unfair Competition Act give rise to a claim for skimming off profits (section 10(1) of the Unfair Competition Act).

Finally, such actions are more attractive in the future because the value of dispute  will be capped at €410,000, limiting the costs of the proceedings considerably.

Suspension of statute of limitations Bringing an action for redress only suspends the statute of limitations for claims that have been registered by consumers and small businesses (section 204a(1) sentence 1 no. 4 CREA).

Suspension of the statute of limitations is thus much more narrowly defined than in the case of an action for an injunction which suspends the statute of limitations for all consumer claims affected by the violation without the need to register claims (section 204a(1) sentence 1 no. 2 CREA).

It should be noted that the suspension of the statute of limitations for actions for redress and injunctive actions does not apply to claims arising out of past infringements (Article 229 section 65 of the Introductory Act to the German Civil Code).

Since filing a model declaratory action suspends the statute of limitations even in those cases, it is likely that association will file a model declaratory action alone or in addition to an action for redress (at least in old cases).

Noerr,Update – procedure for precedents at German Federal Court of Justice (as at 5 October 2023),"Germany’s Federal Ministry of Justice prepared a draft bill on introducing a procedure for precedents at the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) in collaboration with a working party consisting of federal and state representatives.

This was followed by a bill prepared by the German government which differed just slightly from the original bill.

The bill sets out that in future the Federal Court of Justice will be able to select one or more cases it regards as being suitable from among the appeal cases currently pending before it and designate them as precedents.

Appeal proceedings on points of law are intended to be suitable as precedents if the appeal raises legal questions involving a decision important to a large number of other proceedings.

Click here for Noerr’s previous article on this topic.

At the time, we criticised the fact that while the aim of obtaining faster decisions by the highest court may be correct, the intended procedure for precedents is unlikely to solve the existing problems.

Although the ministerial draft stresses several times that it is only one element in combatting waves of lawsuits, the draft still seems to fall short.

You can find our detailed analysis of why the Ministry’s draft will not lead to efficient procedures for precedents here .

In its opinion dated 29 September 2023 (Bundestag Document 375/23), the German upper house of parliament, the Federal Council ( Bundesrat ), is now taking the same line.

It finds that the rules planned up to now can only be a starting point and that they will only have a minor effect in practice in their current planned form.

It remarks that the draft act fails to properly satisfy the need called for by the Federal Council for “ Measures to deal with mass actions before the civil courts and to ensure a functioning judiciary ” (Bundestag Document 342/22).

I. Federal Council levels fundamental criticism at planned procedure for precedents The Federal Council says that it is particularly questionable that to be considered as a precedent, a legal action first has to pass through the typical, time-consuming stages in the various courts.

It reasons that this will not lead to any significant reduction in the workloads of the lower courts.

Moreover, it anticipates that the Federal Court of Justice will wait until a large number of appeals have been received before deciding which appeal proceedings are suitable as precedents, adding that that this will also result in delays.

Besides this, the Federal Council would like to strike the planned provision in section 148(4) of the government’s new draft German Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO ) stating that a stay of proceedings which depend on legal issues that are the subject of precedent proceedings pending before the Federal Court of Justice requires the consent of the parties.

It points out that the bill will fail to relieve the workload of the lower courts if it makes a potential stay, which the court can order at its own discretion, contingent on the consent of both parties.

It believes that at least one of the parties will oppose the stay for tactical reasons.

II.

Federal Council sees need for workable overall strategy The Federal Council believes that it is necessary to deal with mass actions within the framework of an overall strategy going beyond the procedure for precedents.

For this reason, it maintains that it ought to be possible to present the key legal issues to the Federal Court of Justice from the first instance as well.

This could be ensured by having supplementary rules (it does not specify which rules exactly) for the procedure for precedents or by adopting other approaches such as references for a preliminary ruling, it states.

We also called for this back in June of this year (see here )."
Noerr,Update – procedure for precedents at German Federal Court of Justice (as at 5 October 2023),"We also called for this back in June of this year (see here ).

This would have to incorporate effective solutions for condensing the taking of evidence and enabling the courts to establish structures for the parties to present their arguments in individual cases and in a condensed manner.

III.

Well-meaning but poorly implemented We already concluded in June of this year that while the aim of rapidly resolving the key legal questions arising in a large number of individual claims may be correct, the Ministry’s bill falls short of the mark.

It remains to be seen whether the Federal Council’s criticism will be heeded or fall on deaf ears.

Until then, the lower instance courts will have to continue to tackle the phenomenon of mass actions with the tools available to them."
Noerr,Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: Implementing Regulation Provides Necessary Guidance For The Transitional Period Starting 1 October 2023,"On 15 September 2023, the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 (“Implementing Regulation”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU.

The Implementing Regulation governs the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (“CBAM” or “CBAM-Regulation”) during the transitional period from 1 October 2023 until 31 December 2025.

During this transitional period, obligations under the CBAM-Regulation are limited to quarterly reporting duties regarding embedded emissions of relevant goods listed in the Annexes.

Obligations to surrender emission certificates will apply from 1 January 2026.

The newly adopted Implementing Regulation specifies these quarterly reporting obligations and provides more detailed guidance on how to calculate the embedded emissions.

Background The CBAM-Regulation was adopted on 10 May 2023 (see our related News Alert here ).

Under the mechanism, CBAM certificates have to be surrendered upon importation of certain goods depending on their greenhouse gas (“GHG”) intensity.

Corresponding certificate prices are based on the EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”), which has been revised in order to ensure compatibility with the CBAM (see our related News Alert here ).

Ultimately, the CBAM aims to prevent so-called carbon leakage, i .

e .

the relocation of production capacities in carbon-intensive industries from the EU with a view to avoiding the EU ETS.

Furthermore, the international outreach of European environmental policies is reinforced: GHG emitted abroad over the course of the production of goods imported into the EU are integrated into an overarching European market-based carbon compensation scheme.

Reporting Duties

The first reports under CBAM’s transitional regime must be submitted by 31 January 2024.

They must cover the imports of relevant goods made within the previous quarter.

Goods placed under inward processing must be included if they have been released for free circulation in the previous quarter.

With a view to facilitating these reporting duties, the Implementing Regulation sets up a so-called CBAM Transitional Registry.

This is an electronic database for communication, checks and information exchange between the European Commission (hereafter “the Commission”), the competent national authorities, customs authorities and reporting declarants.

Through this system, CBAM reports (by the importers in their own name and on their own behalf or by an indirect customs representative) can be submitted.

Under the Implementing Regulation, once CBAM reports have been submitted, they may be modified within two months after the end of the relevant reporting period.

An exception applies to reports submitted for the first two reporting periods: these may be modified up until the submission deadline for the third CBAM report, i.e. until 30 October 2024.

Furthermore, CBAM reports can be modified up until one year after each relevant reporting period upon a “justified request” by a CBAM declarant.

Failure to comply with these reporting requirements will result in penalties between EUR 10 and EUR 50 per tonne of unreported emissions.

Penalties increase further in case of persistent or repeat offences.

Content of CBAM reports The Implementing Regulation provides further details on the contents of CBAM reports, including the quantity and type of goods imported as identified by their code under the EU’s Combined Nomenclature (“CN”).

In a second step, embedded emissions of these goods must be declared.

These consist of direct and indirect emissions during the production process.

Direct emissions encompass emissions from the production process of the goods, including the production of relevant precursors, which are defined in the Annexes to the Implementing Regulation.

Indirect emissions cover the emissions from the production of electricity consumed during the production process."
Noerr,Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: Implementing Regulation Provides Necessary Guidance For The Transitional Period Starting 1 October 2023,"Indirect emissions cover the emissions from the production of electricity consumed during the production process.

The Implementing Regulation likewise lays down the methodology to determine embedded emissions.

Depending on the type of good, the system boundaries of production processes are specified ( i .

e .

the specific chemical or physical process carried out to produce goods within a so-called aggregated goods category).

Likewise, the precursors relevant for the embedded emissions of a given good are determined based on the production process employed.

Calculation Methods The Implementing Regulation moreover provides for the permissible calculation methods in order to determine embedded emissions.

For the purposes of calculating the direct emissions for goods other than electricity , four methods are available: Firstly and primarily, calculations should be based on a monitoring system set up for the purposes of CBAM compliance.

This system can be based on two methodologies: a calculation-based approach based on the amount and GHG intensity of the fuel type utilised or a measurement-based approach measuring the actual emissions caused at the production site; Secondly, until 31 December 2024, the embedded emissions reported may be based on a pre-existing emission monitoring scheme within a given third country; Thirdly, until 31 July 2024, the reporting may be based on other methods if certain input values are missing.

This includes employing default values to be published by the Commission or determined in accordance with the methods provided in the Annexes to the Implementing Regulation.

Moreover, estimated values may be used in order to determine up to 20% of embedded emissions of complex goods ( i .

e .

goods comprised of precursors and fuels also entailing embedded emissions).

When determining the direct emissions for electricity , the embedded emissions are calculated either based on country specific default values to be provided by the Commission or an unspecific default values.

Actual embedded emissions may only be used if the imported electricity stems from a power purchase agreement with a specific supplier of electricity.

For the purposes of determining indirect emissions, three different situations have been identified in the Implementing Regulation: If electricity is sourced from a country’s public electricity grid, a default emission factor provided by the Commission based on data of the International Energy Agency or any other emissions factor based on publicly available data is to be used; If electricity is produced within the production installation itself, indirect emissions are to be monitored as direct emissions would be; If the electricity is supplied through bilateral Power Purchase Agreements with specific electricity suppliers, the supplier ought to monitor its emissions under the rules applying to electricity production within the production installation itself.

Implementation of the CBAM The Commission has developed dedicated IT tools and materials to support importers and more generally businesses in their compliance efforts.

A guidance document on CBAM implementation for importers of goods into the EU and a separate guidance document for third country operators of installations producing CBAM goods have already being published.

These documents are accompanied by an electronic template for information on installations.

The coming months will be crucial for the future of the mechanism.

In fact, during its transitional phase, the Commission will conduct a review of the functioning of the CBAM and of the product scope of the CBAM-Regulation.

Another element might affect the proper implementation of the CBAM in the medium-term.

On 8 August 2023, the Polish Government filed a request with the General Court of Justice of the EU to annul the CBAM-Regulation under Art. 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”)

[1] ."
Noerr,Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: Implementing Regulation Provides Necessary Guidance For The Transitional Period Starting 1 October 2023,"[1] .

Poland argues that the CBAM mainly relates to fiscal policy and that any measures primarily of a fiscal nature would have to be adopted by the Council unanimously, instead of by qualified majority.

[2] The CBAM-Regulation was adopted on 25 April 2023, with Poland voting against the Regulation and Belgium and Bulgaria abstaining.

Already at that time, the Polish Ministry of Climate and Environment stated that the introduction of CBAM would lead to an increase in the cost of imported products and electricity.

However, the action will not have immediate consequences, as it does not lead to the suspension of the CBAM-Regulation; only the Court of Justice of the EU may annul the act in its entirety or certain provisions (Art.

264 TFEU), with Art.

263 TFEU proceedings typically lasting two years minimum.

Additionally, the EU institutions hope the CBAM will become the standard in climate policies, with third countries introducing their own mechanisms and emissions trading systems on the basis of the European framework.

Thereby, understanding the CBAM and its implications is crucial for importers and non-EU producers, and businesses should continue their efforts to prepare for the CBAM compliance obligations.

Noerr,Age verification and protection of minors under the GDPR: Decision on the processing of childrens’ data by TikTok,"On 15 September 2023, the Irish Data Protection Commission published its final decision in the matter of TikTok Technology Limited (TikTok).

In the decision, it issued an order imposing fines of €345m in total due to several infringements of the GDPR by TikTok in processing the data of children aged 13 to 17.

The decision was preceded by a Binding Decision by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) .

Among other things, the EDPB emphasised that data controllers must generally review age verification mechanisms on a regular basis.

Companies that process children’s data should therefore take the EDPB's decision as an opportunity to review the technical design of their services.

Context: Coherence procedure by European data protection authorities with the involvement of the EDPB In the cross-border proceedings against TikTok, the Irish Data Protection Commission, as the lead supervisory authority, submitted a draft decision to the other supervisory authorities concerned for comment in September 2022.

The Italian data protection authority and two German supervisory authorities (the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information and the Baden-Württemberg State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information) each lodged objections to this draft decision, whereupon a binding decision by the EDPB was requested in May 2023.

The EDPB then issued a binding decision on 2 August 2023 in relation to the objections of the Italian and the two German supervisory authorities.

The Italian data protection authority had criticised the age verification mechanisms implemented by TikTok for users under the age of 13, which is why the EDPB addressed this in its decision.

Based on this binding decision, the Irish Data Protection Commission issued its decision on 1 September 2023 and published it on 15 September 2023.

Objections to TikTok’s data processing: Mechanisms for age verification The decision of the Irish Data Protection Commission and the decision of the EDPB concern, among other things, the question of whether TikTok’s age verification mechanisms for children under 13 meet the requirements of the GDPR.

As an ex ante measure, TikTok had categorised the app as “12+” in the Apple App Store and as “Parental Guidance Recommended” in the Google Play Store.

In addition, people had to enter their date of birth when using TikTok.

For users whose age, according to the date of birth entered, was below 13 years, the registration process was automatically cancelled without them being informed of the reason for the cancellation of the process.

Users were only shown a pop-up notification stating that they were not authorised to use the TikTok platform.

People who tried to enter their date of birth again, even after reinstalling the app, were still unable to complete the registration process and were again shown the pop-up notification stating that they were not authorised to use TikTok.

In addition, TikTok had put in place some ex post mechanisms, such as blocking users who were reported to TikTok due to their age (under 13).

In its binding decision, the EDPB expressed serious doubts about the effectiveness of the age verification measures taken by TikTok and ordered the Irish Data Protection Commission to amend its draft decision accordingly.

The EDPB emphasised that these doubts existed in the specific case particularly in view of the seriousness of the risks and the large number of vulnerable people affected .

In addition, the EDPB emphasised that the appropriateness of age verification mechanisms changes regularly due to the constant change in the latest technology and that the data controller is therefore required to regularly review these measures to determine whether they are (still) appropriate, taking into account the criteria set out in Article 25 of the GDPR ( data protection by design and by default )."
Noerr,Age verification and protection of minors under the GDPR: Decision on the processing of childrens’ data by TikTok,"However, the EDPB ultimately left the decision as to whether TikTok’s age verification mechanisms met the requirements of the GDPR up to the Irish Data Protection Commission, as it did not have sufficient information on the latest technology applied in the specific case to conclusively assess TikTok’s data protection compliance.

Contrary to the serious doubts of the EDPB , the Irish Data Protection Commission concluded in its decision that it could not assume that TikTok’s technical and organisational measures in relation to age verification mechanisms infringed provisions of the GDPR.

In its decision, the Irish Data Protection Commission also criticised other aspects of TikTok’s data processing, including design practices in connection with two pop-up windows in which, according to the Irish authority, children between the ages of 13 and 17 are encouraged to make their profiles and videos publicly accessible, i.e. also to non-TikTok users.

The Irish Data Protection Commission saw this as a violation of the principle of data minimisation and of Article 25 of the GDPR.

Reason for companies to revise age verification mechanisms Even if the individual case decision of the Irish Data Protection Commission and the EDPB’s decision only have a direct effect on TikTok, companies that are subject to the GDPR and process children’s data should take the published EDPB decision as an opportunity to review their age verification mechanisms to ensure that they meet the legal requirements .

This is because the EDPB's considerations also contain general statements that can be transferred to other companies, particularly with regard to the obligation of data controllers to review the appropriateness of age verification mechanisms.

The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has issued a comprehensive code relating to the processing of personal data of children.

Even if this is not directly applicable in the EU, it can provide good guidance.

A summary of the considerations of the European Parliament Research Service on age verification measures and current projects in the European Union can be found here ."
Noerr,Ministry of Finance publishes draft of the Act to Improve the Fight against Financial Crime (FKBG),"On 13 September 2023, the German Federal Ministry of Finance published the draft bill for a law to improve the fight against financial crime (FKBG).

The FKBG is a so-called article law, through which on the one hand new laws are to be created and on the other amendments to existing laws are to be made.

The aim of the FKBG is to close the deficiencies identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the context of the 2022 Germany Review and thus to sustainably combat money laundering, as well as to create the basis for comprehensive cooperation and data exchange between authorities at national and international level.

Creation of a new Federal Office for Combating Financial Crime

The core of the bill is the creation of a new higher federal authority, the Federal Office for Combating Financial Crime (Bundesamt zur Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität, BBF).

The BBF is to combine analysis and criminal as well as administrative investigations; in addition, the BBF is to assume the role of coordinating supervisory authority.

The BBF's task is to combat international money laundering with reference to Germany as well as to support and coordinate the supervision of persons obliged under money laundering law.

In addition, the BBF is to coordinate and respond to requests for information from other authorities and persons concerned (Section 2 of the BBF Establishment Act-E).

In terms of organization, both the Central Office for Sanctions Enforcement (ZfS) and the Central Office for Financial Transaction Investigations (FIU) are to be transferred to the BBF.

Establishment of a Money Laundering Investigation Centre For the prosecution of international money laundering with reference to Germany, a Money Laundering Investigation Centre (Ermittlungszentrum Geldwäsche, EZG) is to be established at the BBF.

The EZG is to be given police investigative powers for cases of international money laundering (Section 1 GwEG-E) and thus become active under criminal law.

However, the already existing competence of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) is not only to be maintained in parallel, but even expanded and bundled in a new organizational unit.

It is planned to form a joint investigation group between the BBF and the BKA.

In addition, the EZG is to investigate other significant cases of money laundering at the request of the competent federal or state authorities.

In order to fulfil its tasks, the EZG is to be given extensive powers corresponding to those of the police under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Section 4 GwEG-E).

In addition, it is envisaged that the EZG will also be given powers for so-called ""security and protective measures"" (sections 6 et seq.

GwEG-E), the legal nature of which is likely to be of a danger-prevention nature.

In this respect, the EZG may, among other things, search persons or property without a court order, establish the identity of persons, seize objects or take persons into custody if this is necessary to protect essential assets, life, limb and health of the officers, but also to protect their decision-making and activity.

It is precisely this last connecting factor that allows the EZG to circumvent restrictions on interventions in the legal interests of citizens under criminal procedure law.

In addition, comprehensive regulations on data collection, processing and disclosure are to be created.

Central Office for the Supervision of Money Laundering It is also planned to establish a new Central Office for Money Laundering Supervision (Zentralstelle für Geldwäscheaufsicht, ZfG) at the BBF.

Its task is to ensure a nationwide and cross-sectoral uniform approach of the supervisory authorities and to support them (Section 50a GwG-E)."
Noerr,Ministry of Finance publishes draft of the Act to Improve the Fight against Financial Crime (FKBG),"Its task is to ensure a nationwide and cross-sectoral uniform approach of the supervisory authorities and to support them (Section 50a GwG-E).

In particular, the ZfG is to coordinate the respective national supervisory authorities, assist in the preparation, harmonization and updating of interpretation and application guidelines as well as the implementation of due diligence obligations, provide guidelines for a uniform approach in the exercise of supervisory measures as well as develop criteria to determine the effectiveness of supervisory measures and conduct analyses on this.

In this respect, exceptions are provided for the existing tasks of BaFin.

At the request of a supervisory authority, the ZfG can assist in the implementation of supervisory measures and then has the same powers as the supervisory authority itself (Section 50b GwG-E).

The German states are also requested to establish their own coordinating bodies to coordinate the activities of the respective state supervisory authorities and to ensure cooperation at state level as well as the exchange of information with the Coordination Bodies at the federal level (Section 50c GwG-E).

Amendments to the Sanctions Enforcement Act The regulations on the powers of the Central Office for Sanctions Enforcement (Zentralstelle für Sanktionsdurchsetzung, ZfS) are to be partially reworded.

The ZfS is also to be authorized to search objects or persons (section 2 (2) nos.

7-8 SanktDG-E).

Furthermore, a ban on the disclosure of information is to be introduced.

Persons from whom information or documents have been requested shall be prohibited from informing third parties thereof (Sec. 2 para.

2 sentence 2 SanktDG-E).

In accordance with a practical need, the freezing of real property, ships and aircraft is to be effected by entering a blocking notice in the land register, ship register or aircraft register.

It is also envisaged that the ZfS may also issue orders to legal entities or partnerships that are at risk of violating a freezing order or making available funds or economic ressources to establish or ensure proper business organization, including sanction compliance (Section 9 (1) sentence 3 no. 4 SanktDG-E).

With regard to the register to be kept by the ZfS, only information on the entry of of a sanctioned person will be publicly accessible.

Access to the register should only be possible if there is a legitimate interest whereas obligated persons under the Money Laundering Act shall be entitled to inspect the register for the purpose of fulfilling due diligence obligations or for the purpose of complying with sanctions (Section 14 (3a) no. 2

SanktDG-E).

Amendments to the German Banking Act (KWG) By means of amendments to the KWG, it is planned that auditors, when auditing the annual financial statements of financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies, also examine whether the companies have fulfilled their obligations under Sections 25h - 25m KWG to establish appropriate internal safeguards and to fulfil due diligence obligations under the Money Laundering Act (GwG).

Furthermore, the regulations on the Ownership Control Ordinance are to be amended so that in the future participations in financial holding companies will be subject to ownership control even if a significant participation in an institution is not acquired at the same time.

Amendments to the Money Laundering Act (GwG)

It is also planned to partially revise the regulations on persons subject to money laundering obligations.

It is to be clarified in Section 1 (24) GwG-E that companies which, pursuant to Section 2 (6) No. 5 of the German Banking Act (KWG), as holding companies, provide financial services exclusively for their parent, subsidiary or sister companies and are not considered financial services institutions, also do not have to fulfil any obligations under money laundering law."
Noerr,Ministry of Finance publishes draft of the Act to Improve the Fight against Financial Crime (FKBG),"Financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies are to be explicitly included in the GwG as obligated parties under money laundering law (Section 2 (1) no.

2a GwG-E) and Section 25l of the German Banking Act (KWG) is to be deleted accordingly, which, however, has so far only applied to financial holding companies licensed under Section 2f KWG.

However, this does not entail any change because non-licensed financial holding companies are already considered financial undertakings within the meaning of Section 2 (1) no. 6 in conjunction with Section 1 (24) GwG.

There will also be changes to the group of obligated parties in the insurance sector.

Insurance holding companies, companies pursuant to Section 243 (4) of the Insurance Supervision Act (VAG) as well as companies that exercise a controlling influence on an insurance company or a pension fund shall explicitly become obligated parties under money laundering law (Section 2 (1) No. 7a - 7c GwG-E).

Obligated persons according to the planned § 2 (1) nos.

2a and 7a must register with their respective supervisory authority according to § 51 (5c) GwG-E. Insofar as money laundering officers are only to be appointed by order of the supervisory authority, the latter shall also be able to order the appointment of a deputy (7 (1) sentence 3 GwG-E).

An amendment to Section 8 (2) GwG-E is intended to further clarify that identity cards which do not show the issuing authority, but only the issuing state, are also suitable for identification purposes.

The second sentence of Section 10 (3) GwG-E is intended to clarify that obligated persons must also fulfil their due diligence obligations under money laundering law if the business relationship or transaction is carried out wholly or in part abroad.

Under Section 51 (11) GwG-E, the supervisory authorities are to be able to determine by means of a general decree which notifications, notices, reports, applications or other information are to be submitted electronically, in which data format, to what extent or at what time, and which electronic communication procedures are to be used for this purpose.

Furthermore, the BaFin is to be able to determine by general decree, pursuant to Section 52 (7) GwG-E, which information necessary for banking supervision is to be transmitted to it regularly and at what times.

As a result of the planned new structure of the authorities, the regulations on data transmission by the FIU are also to be changed.

So far, the presidents of the regional court have been the supervisory authority for notaries.

This task is now to be transferred to the presidents of the Higher Regional Court.

It is planned that those obliged under money laundering law register with the FIU by 1.1.2024, regardless of whether they file a SAR.

Failure to register is to be subject to a fine under Section 56 (1) no. 69a GwG-E. The obligation to register for dealers in goods is to be extended until 1.1.2027, while that for acceptance centres for sports betting pursuant to Section 29 (6) of the State Treaty on Gambling is to be dropped (Section 59 (6) GwG-E).

Amendments concerning the transparency register In addition, efforts are to be made to improve the data quality of the transparency register.

For example, the transparency register shall be allowed to request suitable proof of the right of representation from the notifying persons.

In addition, the office keeping the register is to be allowed to query the data to be entered in the transparency register by means of retrievals pursuant to section 24c of the German Banking Act, from the registers of residents, the land registry or the register of foundations.

In addition, with effect from 1 January 2027, not only the date of birth but also the place of birth is to be entered in the transparency register."
Noerr,Ministry of Finance publishes draft of the Act to Improve the Fight against Financial Crime (FKBG),"In addition, with effect from 1 January 2027, not only the date of birth but also the place of birth is to be entered in the transparency register.

If information cannot be verified in connection with discrepancy reports because the company concerned does not cooperate in due time, this will be noted on the register extract.

Establishment of a real estate transaction register In addition, a real estate transaction register is to be set up at the BBF, which concerns reporting data pursuant to § 18 GrEStG from courts, authorities and notaries in the case of acquisitions with a purchase price of EUR 100,000 or more.

In this respect, the BBF is to receive corresponding data records via an interface.

The FIU, the ZfS, the EZG, law enforcement agencies and courts should be able to retrieve data upon request (sections 26b et seq.

GwG-E).

The keeping of the real estate transaction register can also be transferred to a legal person under private law.

Conclusion The FKBG is intended to improve the often criticised fight against money laundering in Germany.

In particular, the work of the FIU has been the focus of criticism for some time, so that the planned organizational changes are to be understood as a reaction to the publicly discussed deficits.

It seems remarkable, however, that an essential part of the intended solution is the creation of a new higher federal authority and the establishment of multiple and parallel structures.

In addition to the BKA, which has been relatively successful in combating cross-border money laundering, the BBF is to be another federal authority with similar tasks.

Furthermore, with the ZfG, a new institution is to be created whose task is to coordinate supervisory authorities.

Here, one could also have thought of concentrating supervisory responsibilities.

In addition, the states are to create independent coordinating bodies.

It remains to be seen whether this approach, which increases rather than reduces the complexity of the authority structure in the area of AML and terrorist financing, will actually lead to progress in the fight against money laundering.

The intended changes in connection with the transparency register may lead to an improvement in data quality.

However, the actual problem that the transparency register is based on reports by the obligated parties and that there is no accuracy control remains.

This gives the impression that the draft FKBG is a path that is certainly well intentioned, but in typical German fashion will lead to (even) more bureaucracy.

Streamlining through concentration at the BKA would be an alternative worth considering."
Noerr,Act to Promote Skilled Worker Immigration – Key simplifi­cations at a glance,"On 18 August 2023, German legislators adopted the Act to Promote Skilled Worker Immigration, thus taking another step towards modernising residence laws.

The following simplifications in the process of immigrating to Germany will come into force step by step between 18 November 2023 and 1 January 2026.

These key amendments to the Residence Act will come into force as of 18 November 2023:

Principle: A skilled worker, i.e., someone who has a vocational qualification (new section 18a of the Residence Act) or has a university degree (new section 18b of the Residence Act), can, unlike before, take on any skilled employment with the consent of Germany’s Federal Employment Agency.

That means the person’s vocational or academic qualification no longer has to exactly match their planned employment.

However, to obtain an EU Blue Card , applicants still need an academic qualification that matches their planned employment.

There are some simplifications in the EU Blue Card process in other areas, though (new section 18g of the Residence Act): In particular, the minimum gross annual salary required to qualify for an EU Blue Card has been lowered to 50% of the annual income ceiling for pension contributions in Germany (in 2023: €43,800.00) for the “big” Blue Card and to 45.3% of that ceiling (in 2023: €39,682.80) for the “small” Blue Card for shortage occupations (STEM subjects).

In addition, an EU Blue Card for young professionals is being launched.

In future, skilled workers who graduated less than three years before applying can, depending on their profession, obtain the small EU Blue Card when they reach the minimum salary threshold (45.3%).

There is a new option of an EU Blue Card for skilled workers who have completed a tertiary education programme (at an institute of applied sciences, vocational college or similar) that is equivalent to a university degree, requires at least three years of education or training and is at least level 6 on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) or level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework in Germany.

This means skilled workers can obtain an EU Blue Card (big or small) even without a traditional university degree.

What’s more, a degree is no longer required for the IT sector (occupational groups 133 and 25 of ISCO-08, the International Standard Classification of Occupations-08).

According to the new section 18g(2) of the Residence Act, a foreigner will be granted a small EU Blue Card to work in IT with the approval of the Federal Employment Agency if the minimum salary threshold is met and the foreigner has at least three years of relevant professional experience, thus having the necessary skills, knowledge and abilities at a level comparable to a university degree or a tertiary education programme.

There are also simplifications regarding long-term and short-term mobility within the European Union for those holding the EU Blue Card, regarding family reunification with EU Blue Card holders when they change employer.

In addition, employment in Germany requiring an EU Blue Card now only has to be for a minimum period of six months.

Previously, a minimum employment term of one year was an (unwritten) requirement.

As of 1 March 2024, the following key simplifications will also come into force: It will become easier to employ students with the introduction of a working days account and an increase in the maximum employment period to 140 working days per year, not counting students’ secondary employment.

If a student is employed part-time, the working time will be credited to the working day account depending on what is most favourable for the student, either (i) on a daily basis (with a working day of up to four hours being counted as half a working day) or (ii) irrespective of the distribution of working time, as 2.5 working days per week.

During the period when lectures are given, students may not work for more than 20 hours per week."
Noerr,Act to Promote Skilled Worker Immigration – Key simplifi­cations at a glance,"During the period when lectures are given, students may not work for more than 20 hours per week.

The following key simplifications will only come into force as of 1 June 2024:

There will be a new points-based residence permit known as the Opportunity Card (new section 20a of the Residence Act.

The Opportunity Card is a one-year residence permit for jobseekers or those taking steps to have their foreign professional qualifications recognised (Jobseeker Opportunity Card).

The Opportunity Card can be issued to a foreigner if they (i) either meet the requirements for skilled workers or (ii) they have at least six points and can cover their living expenses.

Foreigners earn points according to the table below for their qualifications, German and English skills, work experience, links to Germany, age and their spouse’s/partner’s potential:

Factors according to section 20b of the Residence Act Points 1: Foreign professional qualification has been recognised as equivalent or a professional practice permit has been issued for a regulated profession 4 2: Good German-language skills (at least B2 level) 3 3: Satisfactory German-language skills (at least B1 level) 2 4: Adequate German-language skills (at least A2 level) 1 5: English-language skills at C1 level 1 6: Five years of work experience connected to the applicant’s professional qualification within the last seven years 3 7: Two years of work experience connected to the applicant’s professional qualification within the last seven years 2 8: Professional qualification in a shortage occupation 1 9: Age 35 or younger 2 10: Age 36 to 39 1 11: Prior legal residence in Germany for at least six months 1 12: Spouse/partner meets the requirements for the Opportunity Card, is applying for an Opportunity Card from the appropriate authority and entered Germany jointly with the applicant 1

The Opportunity Card allows foreigners to work for an average of 20 hours a week and to undertake trial employment for a maximum of two weeks at a time, which in each case must be skilled, aimed at training or suitable to be taken up as part of a measure for the recognition of foreign professional qualifications under section 16d of the Residence Act.

The Jobseeker Opportunity Card, initially limited to one year, can also be extended by up to two years if the foreigner has an employment contract or a binding job offer for a skilled job in Germany, the Federal Employment Agency has given its consent and no other residence permit can be issued (Follow-on Opportunity Card).

As part of the amendments to the Residence Act, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community also issued the Regulation to Promote Skilled Worker Immigration on 31 August 2023, thus also modernising the Employment Regulation.

The most important changes to the Employment Regulation will affect the following arrangements gradually from 18 November 2023:

The Western Balkans Arrangement in section 26(2) of the Employment Regulation will continue to apply indefinitely from 18 November 2023 .

As of 1 June 2024 , the quota of approvals for residence permits will be increased from 25,000 currently to 50,000.

This means that 50,000 citizens of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, and Serbia will be able to move to Germany each year to work in any kind of employment (including unskilled jobs).

The new section 6 of the Employment Regulation will come into force on 1 March 2024 ."
Noerr,Act to Promote Skilled Worker Immigration – Key simplifi­cations at a glance,"The new section 6 of the Employment Regulation will come into force on 1 March 2024 .

According to this section, the Federal Employment Agency will consent to the employment of a foreigner who holds a vocational qualification or university degree officially recognised in their home country irrespective of German standards, has at least two years of relevant professional experience in the last five years and has a job or has been offered a job in Germany with a gross annual salary of at least 45% of the income ceiling for pension contributions (for 2023: around €39,420.00).

For professions in the field of information and communication technology, the Federal Employment Agency will even grant approval if the foreigner only has the required professional experience and the minimum salary.

Assessment and outlook By amending the Residence Act, the legislators have created a modern and multifaceted residence law.

With this new residence law and a simpler process for issuing the EU Blue Card, Germany can now live up to its claim to be an attractive immigration destination for skilled workers.

The amendments to the Employment Regulation round off the amendment of the Residence Act in a satisfactory manner.

The Western Balkans will not only remain a source of workers but will also be more valuable thanks to the increase in the number of permits issued."
Noerr,Working remotely from another country – Social security law,"Working from locations outside the employer’s premises ( remote working ) has experienced a remarkable boom since Covid, if not before.

This type of work lets employees carry out IT-based activities outside the traditional office environment, especially from home.

Since then, remote working from home, even outside Germany, has become increasingly popular and frequently requested at German companies, especially by employees whose families live abroad.

A taskforce within the EU has therefore developed clear rules in the field of social security law.

The multilateral Framework Agreement on the application of Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC)

No 883/04 in cases of habitual cross-border telework (“ Framework Agreement ”) was drawn up; EU Member States and other countries can sign up to this.

Currently, in addition to Germany, all countries bordering Germany (including Switzerland), with the exception of Denmark, are participating in the Agreement.

The UK, Italy and Greece, among others, have not yet signed the Framework Agreement.

From a German perspective, under the rules of the Framework Agreement an employee who lives outside Germany and wishes to work from there on a regular basis, even if they have a workplace at an employer’s German premises, can remain in the German social security system on certain conditions.

However, this is only possible if remote work in the foreign country of residence makes up less than 50% of the employee’s total work over the next twelve calendar months and the employee therefore is going to spend more than 50% of their working time in Germany.

Since 1 July 2023, employers have been able, with the employee’s consent, to apply to the competent (German) social security authority to enter into an exemption agreement (“ Exemption Agreement ”) on the basis of the newly drawn-up Framework Agreement.

German social security law will then remain applicable on the basis of the Exemption Agreement.

The Framework Agreement has been entered into for an initial period of five years and will presumably be extended automatically for another five years.

Conditions for the continued application of German social security law The requirements for the Exemption Agreement and thus for remaining in the German social security system are: The employee works remotely, i.e. performs an activity that can be done regardless of location and could be done on the employer’s premises.

The employee wishes to carry out that activity on a cross-border basis, i.e. in a Member State other than that in which the employer is established.

The employee’s job involves the use of information technology.

The employee performs their work not only in their country of residence but also in the country of the employer's registered office.

Significance for cross-border remote work Based on the Framework Agreement, German employers can now allow an employee to work from home even if this home is located in a (neighbouring) foreign country and the employee wants to work there for almost half of their working time.

Previously, in cases where the employee performed more than 25% of their work in their (foreign) country of residence, the social security law of the country of residence was applicable (Article 13(1) Regulation (EC) 883/04).

Now, according to the new regulation, German social security law will remain applicable even if the employee works remotely in their country of residence for almost 50% of the time.

Since the employee remains in the German social security system, there is no further administrative burden for the employer regarding payroll accounting.

Caution – Check foreign labour and tax law implications!

However, when employees work remotely across borders, employers must ensure that the mandatory legal provisions of the foreign country are complied with, especially in the area of employment law.

These will usually impact working hours and other employee protection regulations."
Noerr,Working remotely from another country – Social security law,"These will usually impact working hours and other employee protection regulations.

We strongly recommend that employers keep careful written documentation in a supplementary agreement to the employment contract.

In some cases additional obligations to provide evidence according to the law on evidence must also be complied with.

In addition, employers must check whether there are any tax obligations abroad if the employee performs their work there (remotely).

This can have wage tax implications and also raise the issue of a permanent establishment of the employer abroad at the level of income tax.

Outlook:

The future of global remote work Currently, 19 states have acceded to the Framework Agreement, with more expected to follow.

The Framework Agreement marks a significant step in shaping the global remote-work landscape.

While it already offers new opportunities to employees and employers, the future of global remote work looks exciting.

Technological developments and changing working (time) models will continue to influence how employees and employers organise work in a global context.

Companies should maximise the benefits of the Framework Agreement while adapting their employment practices to the changing demands of the global workplace.

Employers based in Germany should check whether employees’ countries of residence are covered by the Framework Agreement and, if required, apply for an Exemption Agreement.

If more than 50% cross-border remote work is to be arranged and German social security law is still intended to apply, there may be the option of a “normal” Exemption Agreement pursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004.

We will be happy to advise you on which option is most suitable for you in each case."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: Updated guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines,"The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) updated its Guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines a while ago.

This is in and of itself a good reason for recalling the (from a company perspective) extensive assistance that the EDPB provides companies for assessing their own risk of receiving an administrative fine.

Already in May 2022, the EDPB published Guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines in which the European supervisory authorities formulated a common methodology for the calculation of fines for the first time.

The five-stage calculation method is intended to contribute to further harmonisation and transparency of the data protection authorities’ fines practice.

Apart from making some editorial changes and clarifying some points, the updated version of the guidelines now includes an Annex with a reference table , which summarises the methodology for calculating administrative fines and contains further examples of the application of the methodology in practice.

The table’s purpose is to illustrate the approach to calculating administrative fines that is set out in the main part of the guidelines and which is already applicable.

The updated guidelines could become an essential tool for companies to better assess the risk of administrative fines in practice, for example in cases involving data breaches.

In practice, the points authorities consider when assessing aggravating and mitigating circumstances on the basis of data controllers’ behaviour are likely to play a central role in their decisions to increase or decrease administrative fines (Step 3).

In this context, both past and present behaviour can have an influence on the amount of an administrative fine.

Present behaviour in particular can thus be a very important strategic factor in every Data Protection Litigation ."
Noerr,Cour de Cassation Requires Parties to Invoke Irregularities Before Arbitral Tribunal and the Arbitration Institution to Avoid Waiver of Rights,"Not invoking any irregularity regarding the constitution of an arbitral tribunal during the arbitration proceedings constitutes a waiver of this objection before the French judge of annulment.

The French Cour de Cassation, the highest court in the French judicial system, held on 7 June 2023 (Arrêt n° 400 F-B, Pourvoi n° Y 21-24.968, Décision - Pourvoi n°21-24.968 | Cour de cassation ) that this applies notwithstanding the fact that the party had already filed two unsuccessful challenges against the same arbitrator before the administering arbitration institution, thus requiring a broad and two-pronged approach.

Factual Background – Arbitrator Challenges Before the ICC Court

The French decision was rendered with regard to an ICC arbitration under the 1998 ICC Rules that had been initiated for alleged non-payment of a loan ( SARL CTI Group Inc. and Pharaon Commercial Investment Group Limited v. CNAN Group Spa and International Bulk Carrier Spa and Mustapha Abdelwahab Laradji , ICC Case No. 17257/ND/MCP).

An arbitral tribunal had been constituted under the auspices of the ICC and during the arbitration proceedings,  one of the respondents had filed two unsuccessful challenges with the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC (“ICC Court”) against the co-arbitrator nominated by the claimants.

Both challenges had been rejected in September 2011 and February 2012, respectively.

Subsequently, these were not maintained before the arbitral tribunal, and a majority award was ultimately rendered in favour of the claimants.

The Annulment Proceedings Before the Cour d’ Appel de Paris Claiming that the arbitral tribunal had not been regularly constituted, the respondents then filed an application for annulment of the award with the competent French courts.

This application, however, was rejected by the Cour d’

Appel de Paris in June 2021.

For the Cour d’ Appel de Paris , the fact that the respondents had not maintained the challenges before the arbitral tribunal was decisive in holding that there were no grounds for annulment.

The Cour d’ Appel de Paris referred to Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure, which provides in relevant parts that “[a] party which, knowingly and without a legitimate reason, fails to object to an irregularity before the arbitral tribunal in a timely manner shall be deemed to have waived its right to avail itself of such irregularity. ”

Relying on a literal reading of this provision, the Cour d’

Appel de Paris expressly confirmed that “the irregularity must be invoked 'before the arbitral tribunal', regardless of the involvement of an arbitration institution.

For the Cour d’ Appel de Paris , “invoking” at the very least meant voicing an express reservation of rights before the arbitral tribunal.

Accordingly, if a party fails to maintain its challenge before the arbitral tribunal, the party has waived their right to rely on that specific ground.

The Cour d’ Appel de Paris saw no room for an exception to the above rule.

While Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure generally provides for an exemption when there is a “legitimate reason” , in the eyes of the Cour d’ Appel de Paris , this requirement was not met in the case at hand.

Remarkably, the fact that challenge decisions rendered by the ICC Court neither are subject to appeal nor have a res judicata effect nor are binding on the French courts did not constitute legitimate reasons for exemption.

On further appeal to the Cour de Cassation , the respondents, inter alia , nonetheless again put forward the argument that both unsuccessful challenges filed before the ICC Court were not subject to appeal under the applicable ICC Rules.

According to the appeal, the respondents had “ a legitimate reason ” under Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure for not subsequently raising the irregularity pertaining to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal before that tribunal."
Noerr,Cour de Cassation Requires Parties to Invoke Irregularities Before Arbitral Tribunal and the Arbitration Institution to Avoid Waiver of Rights,"On 7 June 2023, the Cour de Cassation however confirmed the position of the Cour d’ Appel de Paris , holding that “[t] he fact that an arbitrator has been unsuccessfully challenged by the institution responsible for organising the arbitration on the grounds of an alleged lack of independence or impartiality does not constitute a legitimate reason for not invoking, before the arbitral tribunal, the irregularity of its constitution for the same reason. ”

The Strict Approach Chosen by the Cour de Cassation on Appeal Following the Cour d’ Appel de Paris , the Cour de Cassation also opted for a strict application of Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure and also held that “ invoking of the irregularity ” before the arbitral tribunal could be done either via an express objection or in the form of reservation of rights.

The Cour de Cassation also confirmed that the respondents’ argument regarding the lack of appeal of challenge decisions before the ICC Court does not constitute “ a legitimate reason ” under Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure.

For the Cour de Cassation , while the applicable ICC Rules provided that “[t] he decisions of the Court as to the appointment, confirmation, challenge or replacement of an arbitrator shall be final ”, parties must maintain their objections before the arbitral tribunal in question to preserve the right of setting aside the award based on said grounds at a later stage before the French court.

This was regardless of whether the objections or irregularities were submitted before the ICC Court and rejected by the same as per the Cour de Cassation ’s conclusion.

Conclusion For future arbitrations, in disputes possibly involving French courts during the recognition and enforcement phase, this quite strict interpretation of Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure must be kept in mind.

Whether or not an arbitration institution provides for rules regulating the challenging of arbitrators therefore becomes less important in the face of these decisions – as even in cases where parties have agreed to submit their disputes to arbitration institutions providing for such rules, practitioners must consider the post award phase early on and object to such an irregularity or any other irregularities before the arbitral tribunal to preserve their right of annulment before the French court.

To maintain this right, parties at the very least should submit reservations regarding aspects falling under the power of the arbitration institutions.

Practitioners should also expect French courts to apply the Cour de Cassation ’s interpretation of Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure not only to challenges of arbitrators, but to any procedural irregularity during the arbitration proceedings that a party wishes to raise subsequently.

Indeed, Art. 1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure applies to all annulment grounds listed in Art. 1520 of the French Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for a wide scope of application of this jurisprudence."
Noerr,Update: Effectiveness of jurisdiction ­agreements with business founders,"In its judgment dated 31 May 2021 (Case 10 O 107/19) Berlin Regional Court surprisingly decided that jurisdiction agreements made with business founders in franchise agreements are ineffective.

In doing so, it contradicted the seemingly prevailing case law and literature.

We previously reported on this judgment in our article dated 6 October 2021 .

Berlin Court of Appeal has now repealed Berlin Regional Court’s decision and gone along what is apparently the prevailing opinion.

It has confirmed that jurisdiction agreements agreed with franchisees who are business founders can be entered into effectively.

Judgment of Berlin Court of Appeal Berlin Court of Appeal’s judgment concerned the following jurisdiction agreement contained in the franchise agreement: “ The parties agree that the regional court at the location of the franchisor's registered office shall have exclusive jurisdiction for any lawsuit related to or arising under this franchise agreement. ”

While Berlin Regional Court held that the franchisee already had to be considered a merchant before the franchise agreement was signed in order for the jurisdiction agreement to be effective under section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure, Berlin Court of Appeal justifies the effectiveness of the jurisdiction agreement as follows: It begins by stating that a jurisdiction agreement pursuant to section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure can also be effectively concluded in the contract which establishes the status as a merchant that is required for this in the first place.

It maintains that it is not necessary for the party to already be a merchant at the time the jurisdiction agreement is entered into.

Accordingly, it states that section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure is also to be applied to merchants who are in the process of setting up a business.

The Court points out that no different interpretation follows from the wording of the procedural provision (section 38 of the German Code of Civil Procedure) which refers to “merchants”.

It reasons that as this term is not defined in procedural law, the term for “merchant” used in commercial law must be used (section 1 of the German Commercial Code).

Both terms are thus to be interpreted uniformly.

The Court explains that section 1 (1) of the German Commercial Code states that a “merchant within the meaning of this Code is a person who carries on a commercial business.”

It holds that the phrase “carrying on a commercial business” is certainly to be seen as entering into the relevant contract establishing the commercial activity – in this case the franchise agreement.

By entering into the contract, the franchisee is expressing to a third party in civil-law legal transactions that it will be carrying on a commercial business from that time.

Thus the Court believes that it would not make sense to wish to still regard the decisive entrepreneurial founding act a business as private but to then regard every other subsequent action unquestioningly as being commercial.

The Court of Appeal continues that nothing to the contrary arises from the point of view of consumer protection law, arguing that anyone deciding to carry on a certain commercial or independent freelance activity and to enter into transactions with the aim of taking up an entrepreneurial activity is exposing themselves to the “rougher winds” of commercial business as opposed to consumer transactions.

And they cannot still claim protection in the consumer sphere in relation to their future business partners and possibly competitors.

It adds that above all those acquiring a business or entering into a commercial agency or franchise agreement in order to engage in commercial activities in the future cannot claim protection as a consumer for this “founding transaction”."
Noerr,Update: Effectiveness of jurisdiction ­agreements with business founders,"In view of these arguments, for the jurisdiction agreement to be effective it is sufficient for the enterprise that is to be operated after the conclusion of the franchise agreement to undoubtedly be intended as a commercial business.

Consequences in practice All in all, in its judgment Berlin Court of Appeal follows what appears to be the prevailing opinion in case law and literature and makes clear that it is correct that jurisdiction clauses can also be effectively agreed with franchisees who are business founders.

Berlin Regional Court’s arguments to the contrary were unconvincing.

To date, practically every franchise agreement provides for a jurisdiction agreement favouring the location of the franchisor’s registered office, even if the franchisee is merely a business founder at the time the franchise agreement and jurisdiction agreement are signed.

With this judgment Berlin Court of Appeal now also provides clarity for jurisdiction agreements with business founders intending to designate Berlin Regional Court as the court of competent jurisdiction.

Despite this, since a decision by the German Federal Court of Justice is still outstanding, care should still be taken when agreeing jurisdiction agreements with franchisees who are business founders."
Noerr,Resale price maintenance not automatically a per se infringement of EU competition law,"On 29 June 2023, the European Court of Justice (“ ECJ ”) issued its judgment in Super Bock Bebidas (C-211/22), clarifying some key notions of EU competition law in the context of vertical price fixing agreements.

The judgment clarifies that a hardcore restriction under the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (“ VBER ”) cannot be equated with the category of “by object” infringements of competition law.

Competition authorities will rather have to take into account the specific circumstances of the case irrespective of the conduct in question.

However, the judgment should not be seen as a free pass for resale price maintenance (“ RPM ”) which is and will remain an enforcement priority of many competition authorities in the European Union.

Background Super Bock Bebidas SA, a Portuguese producer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages relied on exclusive distribution agreements with independent distributors for distributing its beverages to hotels, restaurants and cafés.

From 2006 to 2017, Super Bock imposed minimum resale prices on all distributors in essentially the whole of Portugal.

Super Bock established a monitoring and tracking system and required its distributors to report relevant resale data to it.

The distributors generally adhered to Super Bock’s prices because of the retaliatory measures in the event of non-compliance, such as the removal of discounts on the purchase of products or a refusal to supply and replenish stocks.

In 2019, Super Bock was fined EUR 24 million by the Portuguese competition authority.

The authority held that Super Bock’s practices, infringed Portuguese and EU competition rules.

After the Portuguese Competition, Regulation and Supervision Court upheld the decision, Super Bock appealed and the Lisbon Court of Appeal referred the case to the ECJ.

Judgment untangles hardcore restriction and “by object” restriction categories Among other things, the ECJ had to answer the question: Does a vertical agreement fixing minimum resale prices constitute a restriction of competition by object without first examining whether that agreement raises a sufficient level of harm to competition?

The ECJ held that the finding that a vertical agreement fixing minimum resale prices entails a ‘restriction of competition by object’ may only be made after having determined that that agreement presents a sufficient degree of harm to competition.

Background: No safe harbour for hardcore restrictions: The VBER provides a “safe harbour”, in other words a block exemption from the cartel prohibition, for many vertical agreements.

It relieves companies of the often-burdensome self-assessment of the competitive implications of such agreements.

This is justified because vertical agreements “by their nature, [are] often less damaging to competition than horizontal agreements.”

However, they “can also, in some cases, have particularly significant restrictive potential.”

In order to capture agreements with restrictive potential, the legislator decided on a list of agreements for which the safe harbour (block exemption) does not apply.

The agreements on this list are referred to as hardcore restrictions and include vertical price fixing.

By object restrictions: The ECJ judgment untangles the category of the aforementioned hardcore restrictions under the VBER from by object restrictions under the cartel prohibition.

If an agreement is a by object infringement, a competition authority does not have to prove that there are detrimental effects in order to find an infringement of the cartel prohibition.

In other words, the by object concept greatly reduces the investigative effort required by competition authorities.

However, the ECJ made clear that this can only be justified in exceptional circumstances.

The concept of a by object restriction must be interpreted narrowly in as much as it only applies to conduct that shows a sufficient degree of harm to competition."
Noerr,Resale price maintenance not automatically a per se infringement of EU competition law,"The concept of a by object restriction must be interpreted narrowly in as much as it only applies to conduct that shows a sufficient degree of harm to competition.

This requires an assessment of the nature of the agreement’s terms, the objectives that it seeks to attain and all the factors that characterise the economic and legal context of which it forms part.

The ECJ further clarifies that this approach must be applied irrespective of the conduct in question, thus also to vertical price fixing.

In other words, the fact that vertical price fixing constitutes a hardcore restriction and therefore cannot benefit from the safe harbour of the VBER does not release a competition authority from its duty to demonstrate that the agreement infringes EU competition law.

It is still necessary to examine restrictions falling outside the VBER block exemption on a case-by-case basis.

Judgment calls notions in some of the Commission’s guidance documents into question The judgement also calls shortcuts outlined in certain important guidance documents into question.

EU cartel provisions are not applicable where the impact of the agreement on trade between Member States or on competition is not appreciable.

The ECJ held in the past that a by object restrictions [not necessarily a hardcore restriction!]

always qualify as an appreciable restriction.

In light of this, the Commission amended its notice on when agreements do not appreciably restrict competition.

Unlike the ECJ, the Commission does not only include by object restrictions but goes further by postulating that “hardcore restrictions in any current or future Commission block exemption regulation […] are considered by the Commission to generally constitute restrictions by object.”

This now seems unwarranted in light of the Super Bock judgment.

Similarly, in its vertical guidelines, the Commission states that it will apply the following principles when assessing vertical agreements: “where a hardcore restriction […] is included in a vertical agreement, that agreement is likely to fall within the scope of the [cartel prohibition]” and “an agreement that includes a hardcore restriction […] is unlikely to fulfil the conditions of the [individual exemption from the prohibition].

This approach also appears too broad in light of the current judgment.

RPM is likely to continue to be an enforcement priority of competition authorities However, the judgment should not be seen as a free pass for RPM.

Given the significant consequences of incorrectly assessing whether RPM may (exceptionally) be compatible with competition law, every company is well advised to thoroughly check their sales and distribution practices and seek legal advice when assessing the compatibility of such practices with competition law.

Over the last few years, the German Federal Cartel Office (“ FCO ”) has taken a strict approach to vertical agreements fixing minimum resale prices (see for example here and here ).

The adoption of these decisions suggests that RPM enforcement will remain one of the FCO’s enforcement priorities."
Noerr,Government Draft of the Future Financing Act (Zukunfts­finanzierungs­gesetz – ZuFinG) – Opportunities for Real Estate Funds,"From the first draft bill to the government bill On 16 August 2023, the German Federal Cabinet approved the government's draft bill for a law on the financing of future-proof investments [Future Financing Act (Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz – ZuFinG)].

The cabinet decision was preceded by a lobby hearing on the first draft of the bill published by the Federal Ministry of Finance on 12 April 2023 ( see our previous article here) .

For the area of retail real estate funds pursuant to Sections 230 et seq. of the German Capital Investment Code (Kapitalanlagegesetzbuch – KAGB), there have been changes in the government draft bill compared to the first draft bill.

The wording of these amendments is shown in the following table: Click image to enlarge Impact on retail real estate investment funds New assets Notwithstanding the amendments of the government's draft bill compared to the first draft bill, the ZuFinG shall for the first time enable retail real estate investment funds to acquire land with facilities for the generation, conversion, transport or storage of electricity, gas or heat from renewable energies ("" RE facilities "").

Acquisition of land : Contrary to the petitions of some lobby groups, the requirement that ownership of real property must be (co-)acquired has not been abandoned.

In our view, lease structures that are common in Germany, where the operator builds the RE facilities on the basis of a lease agreement on a third-party property but continues to be the owner of the facilities (due to easements), are therefore not covered by section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 3a KAGB (on the eligibility pursuant to section 231 (3) KAGB, see below).

However, such structures can be acquired through retail infrastructure funds within the meaning of sections 260a et seq.

KAGB, special AIFs with an infrastructure focus and foreign funds.

Stages of development : On the other hand, it was clarified that real property with RE facilities in all stages of development is covered: Undeveloped real property intended and suitable for the construction of RE facilities in the near future, Real property on which RE facilities are currently being erected at the time of acquisition, and Real property on which RE facilities have already been erected at the time of acquisition.

For the terminology and the delimitation of the stages of development, we believe that the interpretation of section 231 (1) sentence 1 nos. 

1 to 3 KAGB can be referred to.

Undeveloped real property : In our view, this also applies in particular to the first stage of development, the constituent elements of which are now essentially identical in wording to Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 

3 KAGB due to the addition of ""in the near future"".

Preconditions for the acquisition of undeveloped real property pursuant to Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 3a KAGB are: On the one hand, the real property must be intended for the construction of a RE facilities in the near future.

In our view, this is the case if the intention is to start construction soon and to complete it within a reasonable period of time.

However, the criterion of ""in the near future"" cannot be given a rigid time limit, but it can be further defined on the basis of the stages of development mentioned below.

On the other hand, the real property must be suitable for the construction of a RE facilities in the near future, which can be specified according to the stages of development of wasteland, land awaiting construction, raw building land and land ready for construction.

It is commonly accepted that land ready for construction is suitable for building/erection in the near future.

Raw building land is said to be acquirable if there is a development plan, a division into parcels has taken place and the development is secured.

In contrast, wasteland and land awaiting construction are generally not suitable for construction in the near future."
Noerr,Government Draft of the Future Financing Act (Zukunfts­finanzierungs­gesetz – ZuFinG) – Opportunities for Real Estate Funds,"In contrast, wasteland and land awaiting construction are generally not suitable for construction in the near future.

Leasehold rights : In our view, leasehold rights over RE facilities should also be eligible due to the spirit of the law.

According to the explanatory memorandum to the government's draft bill, the purpose of Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 3a KAGB is to make RE facilities with a reference to real property eligible for real estate funds to the extent of 15 % of the fund assets (see Draft, p. 187).

Pursuant to Section 1 of the German Law on Hereditary Building Rights ( Erbbaurechtgesetz – ErbbauRG ), however, a leasehold right is precisely the right to erect and have a building on a specific plot of land, which qualifies as a real estate in investment law terms within the meaning of Section 1 (19) no. 21 KAGB.

The reference to real property required for a real estate fund is therefore given.

Furthermore, the limitation to 15 % of the fund assets results from Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 3a KAGB itself or could also be derived from Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 5 KAGB.

In our view, it should be clarified in Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 

4 KAGB that the requirements of the new Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 3a KAGB are to be observed.

Management assets Compared to the first draft bill, section 231 (3) KAGB has been expanded by the government's draft bill: RE facilities : Whereas previously only RE facilities for energy production were covered, the provision now covers facilities (i) for the generation, (ii) conversion, (iii) transport and (iv) storage of renewable energy.

If the explanatory memorandum to the draft bill continues to refer in particular to rooftop photovoltaic facilities (see Draft, p. 188), this is too narrow according to the new wording.

Charging stations : In our view, the amendment regarding charging stations, which were previously intended for ""electric vehicles or electric bicycles"" and are now intended for ""electromobility"", is less substantive than semantic, but in any case keeps the wording of the law open to development.

Based on the mere wording of the new Section 231 (3) KAGB, it now appears possible to acquire RE facilities and charging stations even without buildings or real property.

However, this is in contradiction to the original spirit of the provision, which only wanted to allow the acquisition of assets serving buildings or real property and were of minor importance (so called annex assets).

Real estate companies By referring to Section 231 (3) KAGB in Section 1 (19) no. 

22 KAGB, the government's draft bill now clarifies that real estate companies may acquire RE facilities and charging stations in addition to management assets in the narrower sense.

Operating options Finally, it is further provided that a retail real estate investment fund may also operate the RE facilities within the meaning of Section 231 (1) sentence 

1 no. 3a KAGB and also the assets pursuant to Section 231 (3) KAGB ( i.e. , management assets in the narrower sense, RE facilities and charging stations) – in our view, this clarifies at the same time that realizing income from operating these assets is permissible under investment law.

With regard to special AIFs with a real estate focus, it is interesting to note that in the explanatory memorandum to the draft bill, the reference to the fact that the 15 % limit of Section 231 (1) sentence 1 no. 3a KAGB is intended to result in ""funds retaining their asset administrating character overall and not becoming purely operationally active companies"" was deleted.

In our view, this suggests that in the case of special AIFs with a real estate focus, the operation of RE facilities to a significant extent or even exclusively may be permitted."
Noerr,Update Pkw-EnVKV – ­Novellierung der Pkw-Kennzeichnungs­pflichten,"In mid-July, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz ) proposed a new draft amendment to the German Energy Labelling Ordinance for Cars ( Pkw-Energieverbrauchskennzeichnungsverordnung ” – Pkw-EnVKV).

The draft has much of the same content as an earlier draft from the Ministry (then still called the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) from June 2021, which has apparently been on ice since then.

This although the amendment is long overdue, since Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 made it mandatory as of the end of 2018 to calculate new-car fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions using the new worldwide harmonised light vehicles test procedure (WLTP).

Now this step is finally to be taken in regard to fuel consumption and CO 2 labelling obligations for passenger vehicles.

It is to become mandatory to display the WLTP figures.

To make them easier to understand for consumers, the WLTP test modes are to be changed from “low/medium/high/highest value” to “urban/suburban/country road/autobahn” in the Pkw-EnVKV.

It will now also be mandatory to disclose the electric range of electric or hybrid vehicles on all documentation.

The current draft will also necessitate revised versions of the necessary documents at the point of sale and make changes in particular regarding advertising for passenger vehicles.

It also includes several clarifications as a result of case law.

For example, the new draft of the Pkw-EnVKV explicitly states that it is applicable to all advertising on the internet, including social media and video portals.

For the first time, the new draft also includes a definition of the term “new” car – a term that has repeatedly led to difficulties in practice.

Under this definition, a car is to be considered “new” only if it is type-approved and was first registered for use on public roads no more than eight months previously or its odometer reads 1,000 or fewer kilometres.

Several changes to the previous draft version are also included in the new draft.

Following strong criticism of the previous draft, the new draft will retain the previous draft’s abolishment of the “CO 2 efficiency class”.

However, in its place, “CO 2 classes” are to be introduced, and the combined CO 2 emissions will simply be assigned to a class (with no need for troublesome calculations).

The visibility requirement for mandatory notifications will likewise ultimately remain the same.

Where the draft from 2021 required the type size of printed matter to be at least 9 pt, no such impractical provision has been included in the current draft.

The requirement that the mandatory information be constantly visible in videos has likewise been removed.

The new draft also provides for certain practical simplifications.

In digital advertising, it will generally be sufficient if the mandatory information can be found via a clearly recognisable link.

It will be irrelevant how readable advertising on internet platforms is if it “is not or only partially readable solely due to the technical presentation by the platform on which the advertising appears without any influence by the manufacturer or dealer”.

Finally, the new draft provides market supervisory authorities with a right to information that entitles the authority to require manufacturers to name all variations or versions of a model and the fuel consumption and emissions figures for each.

The intent here is to make it simpler for market supervisory authorities to fulfil their supervisory obligations.

Now that the time period for feedback from relevant associations and the German federal states has elapsed, it will be interesting to see the extent to which the changes find their way into the final ordinance and when the long overdue amendment will actually enter into force.

We will be monitoring the situation and will report on any progress in the legislative process."
Noerr,German Digital Services Act complements EU Digital Services Act ‒ new rules for online services,"The future regulatory regime for online intermediary services is taking shape.

On 4 August 2023, the responsible ministry, the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, presented the draft for a German Digital Services Act (“ G-DSA-Draft ”).

The German DSA complements the existing EU legislation of the same name, which is an EU regulation (“ DSA ”).

While the DSA provides for numerous due diligence obligations for providers of online intermediary services and establishes uniform rules for structuring authorities and enforcing providers’ obligations at the EU level, the German DSA defines the authorities’ competences and the procedures applicable in Germany.

Competent authorities In principle, the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) will be responsible for enforcing the DSA (Section 12 (1) G-DSA-Draft).

In addition to regulating traditional infrastructure operators, the Federal Network Agency is thus transforming into a digital authority that supervises the digital economy.

This was preceded by a lively public debate in Germany .

For example, the State Media Authorities ( Landesmedienanstalten ) had also brought themselves into the discussion and there was talk of creating a completely new authority for digital regulation.

This was rejected, and the Federal Network Agency will now act as the Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) within the meaning of Article 49 et seqq.

of the DSA (Sections 1 (4) no. 2 and 14 (1) G-DSA-Draft).

The Digital Services Coordinator will serve as the national focal point for the enforcement of the DSA.

It will bundle the work of the specific authorities and be endowed with special rights and duties in this regard.

In addition, the draft law provides for special competencies for the Federal Department for the Protection of Children and Young People in the Media ( Bundeszentrale für Kinder- und Jugendmedienschutz ), the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information ( Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit ) and the Federal Criminal Police Office ( Bundeskriminalamt ) (Sections 12 (2) and (3) and 13 G-DSA-Draft).

It is not yet clear whether the State Media Authorities will receive any competencies.

There may be constitutional reasons since regulating the media is in principle a matter for the federal states.

The draft law does not reach a conclusion on this issue and indicates that it may be necessary to specify additional competent authorities.

Additional provisions and abrogation of the Telemedia Act and the Network Enforcement Act Article 52 of the DSA requires Member States to provide for rules on effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.

The draft law fulfils this requirement by listing 36 DSA-related regulatory offences punishable by a fine in Section 25 (4) G-DSA-Draft.

It also provides for fines for breaches of obligations arising directly from the German DSA itself (Section 25 (2) G-DSA-Draft) and for violations of the Platform-to-Business Regulation (Section 25 (3) G-DSA-Draft).

If the provider of an intermediary service is a legal person, fines of up to 6% of its worldwide turnover in the preceding year may be imposed (Section 25 (6) G-DSA-Draft).

In addition, the DSA grants the competent authorities operational powers to carry out specific actions such as blocking services.

Such actions taken by a Digital Services Coordinator will be immediately enforceable.

This is because the draft law excludes the temporary suspension of enforcement in the case of an appeal (Section 29 (1) G-DSA-Draft).

Further, in line with the new European terminology, the draft bill replaces the term “telemedia” with the term “digital services” in all national laws and, in its last section, abrogates both the Telemedia Act ( Telemediengesetz ) and the Network Enforcement Act ( Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz ).

The subject-matter of those Acts will in the future be fully covered by the DSA and the German DSA."
Noerr,German Digital Services Act complements EU Digital Services Act ‒ new rules for online services,"The subject-matter of those Acts will in the future be fully covered by the DSA and the German DSA.

For example, the obligation to provide general information, which was previously regulated in Section 5 Telemedia Act, is now located in Section 5 G-DSA-Draft.

The exemption from liability for digital service providers which merely act as conduits in transmitting information will be regulated in Sections 4 et seqq.

of the DSA.

Only the special provisions in national law related to interferer’s liability ( Störerhaftung ) and the liability of WLAN operators are continued in Sections 7 and 8 G-DSA-Draft.

Further procedures and entry into force The draft law is currently the subject of consultations with the federal states and relevant associations and organisations, which can comment on it until 25 August 2023.

Once the consultation process has been concluded, the draft law is expected to be adopted by the federal government and then submitted to the parliamentary legislative process.

It is likely that besides designating additional authorities as competent authorities, certain details of the draft law will also be modified.

The German DSA is scheduled to enter into force on 17 February 2024, just like the DSA.

Outlook With the presentation of the draft, the future rules governing online intermediary services are further materializing.

For very large service providers such as Google and Facebook, the DSA already takes effect as of 25 August 2023.

From 17 February 2024, together with the German DSA, the DSA will also apply to many other digital services.

Providers of platforms and, in particular, online marketplaces will soon be subject to a bundle of new obligations, the violation of which will expose them to substantial risks of penalties and damages.

As a result, affected companies should, in a timely manner, implement new compliance structures and processes.

Detailed information on the DSA can be found in the book “ Das neue Recht der digitalen Dienste ” ( The New Law of Digital Services ), published by Torsten Kraul and edited by Marvin Bartels and Niklas Maamar, among others."
Noerr,New EU Toy Safety Regulation – EU Commission proposal,"On 28 July 2023, the European Commission published its proposal for a new EU Toy Safety Regulation (the “ Proposal ”) to replace the current EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC.

The most important changes for trade and industry As expected, the Proposal includes significantly stricter chemical requirements for toys.

It also introduces a “digital product passport”.

By adding to and specifying details of the current legal situation, overall it will result in an increase in regulatory requirements.

When European toy law is linked with the requirements of the new General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988, which only recently entered into force, stricter requirements will also apply to reporting obligations to authorities and product recalls.

Entry into force and transitional period The Proposal provides for a transitional period of 30 months as of entry into force, which means that compliance with the new requirements will probably not be mandatory until 2027.

A transitional period of another twelve months is currently planned for selling toys that were on the market before the compliance deadline.

Digital product passport The new Toy Safety Regulation could be the first sectoral European harmonising regulation to introduce a digital product passport.

The digital product passport is intended to replace the EU declaration of conformity and to remain available in a digital product passport registry established by the EU Commission for market supervisory authorities, customs offices and consumers alike for at least ten years after the last toy of a particular model has been placed on the market.

With a digital product passport, the manufacturer declares that its toy conforms to the requirements of the new Toy Safety Regulation and with all other applicable European laws.

For example, it will be made available using a QR code and will include information such as a clear product identification code for the product, the name and contact address of the manufacturer, a clear company identification code and the customs tariff number.

It will also list all fragrances for which the new Toy Safety Regulation requires special labelling and all “substances of concern” contained in the toy.

The Proposal does not require any other information, for example related to sustainability.

In this context, the Proposal refers to the expected European-level requirements of the new Ecodesign law.

New obligations for economic operators One aspect that will be significant in practice is the increase in “manufacturers’ labelling” requirements.

Manufacturers and importers will have to list not only their names and complete contact addresses but also an email address on the toys.

It is not possible to ascertain why it is (still) not possible to do without the mailing address despite the generally accessible digital product passport; industry stakeholders would do well to pose critical questions in this regard during the ongoing legislative process.

Manufacturers will also have to provide the public with a telephone number, an email address, a special place on their websites or another fully accessible means of communication by which consumers can contact them regarding safety complaints.

Importers must verify that such communication channels exist and, where necessary, add them if a non-EU manufacturer has not complied with this requirement."
Noerr,New EU Toy Safety Regulation – EU Commission proposal,"Importers must verify that such communication channels exist and, where necessary, add them if a non-EU manufacturer has not complied with this requirement.

Link to the requirements of the General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988 Very important increases in economic operator’ obligations arise from the fact that the Proposal is linked to the newly applicable General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988 that applies to all toys as of 13 December 2024 regardless of when the new Toy Safety Regulation enters into force: Under Article 20 of the General Product Safety Regulation, manufacturers, importers and dealers will be obliged in graduated steps to inform the competent market supervisory authorities regarding accidents in connection with a product that they have placed on the market and of which they have become aware.

These operators are currently only required to report to the authorities if they know or should have known that their product entails a specific safety risk in the field.

When conducting product recalls, companies will have to offer consumers remedies (free repairs or replacements, compensation for lost value) regardless of how old the recalled product is.

This will make product recalls expensive and raise the question as to whether a recall might occasionally be “dispensed with” due to these expenses.

Requirements regarding specific details of recalls and comparable measures will be strict.

For example, according to Article 36 of the General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988, it will be strictly prohibited to use wording such as ‘voluntary’, ‘precautionary’, ‘discretionary’, ‘in rare situations’ or ‘in specific situations’ in a recall notice.

These micro-requirements on the part of legislators will likewise probably not contribute to the likelihood that companies will prematurely decide to take corrective measures which could actually be helpful.

CE marking and warnings The requirements for affixing the necessary labels and warnings are likewise important for the design of products and their packaging.

Where the CE marking affixed to a toy is not visible from outside the packaging, it will also have to be affixed to the packaging.

In addition, any necessary warnings, particularly the warning of unsuitability for children under thirty-six months of age (see figure) will have to be placed after the CE marking (Article 16(3) of the Proposal).

In contrast, one simplification is that warnings will no longer have to be preceded by the word “Warning” (in all necessary languages) and that the pictogram found in Annex III, point 1 (exclamation point in a red triangle) can be used instead.

Stricter chemical safety technology requirements The “general safety requirement” in the Proposal goes beyond the aspects designated up to now in Article 10 of the EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC in that it will include children’s psychological and mental health, wellbeing and cognitive development (Article 5 of the Proposal).

In the “particular safety requirements”, especially the chemical requirements governed by Part III of Annex II will be stricter.

In future, the use of CMR substances in toys will continue to be prohibited, but this prohibition will also apply to substances related to endocrine disruption, respiratory sensitisation or specific target organ toxicity.

In contrast, compared to the current legal situation, the regulations regarding chemical requirements for toys in the Proposal for the new Toy Safety Regulation are significantly simpler and include exceptions.

For example, in Part III of the Appendix to Annex II, migration limits that are also to apply for older children, for example, will not apply to toys or components of toys which clearly exclude any risk due to sucking, licking, swallowing or prolonged contact with skin when used as specified."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"In June and July, the German Federal Ministry of Finance ( BMF ) presented a bundle of proposals of far-reaching tax law changes, namely: GrEStNG : Discussion draft of a law amending the Real Estate Transfer Tax Act (G runderwerbsteuer-Novellierungsgesetz - GrEStNG ) dated 15 June 2023, WCG : Draft bill on strengthening growth opportunities, investment and innovation as well as tax simplification and tax fairness ( Wachstumschancengesetz - WCG ) dated 6 July 2023, and MinBestRL-UmsG : Draft of a law for the implementation of the directive to ensure a global minimum taxation for multinational groups and large domestic groups in the Union and the implementation of further accompanying measures ( Mindestbesteuerungsrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz - MinBestRL-UmsG ) of 7 July 2023.

However, it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the proposals will actually be implemented in the further legislative process.

According to reports, this applies in particular to the GrEStNG.

I. Overview The draft of the GrEStNG is to be seen in particular against the background that the Act on the Modernization of the Law on Partnerships ( Gesetz zur Modernisierung des Personengesellschaftsrechts – MoPeG ) will adjust the so-called joint ownership principle ( Gesamthandsprinzip ) in the case of partnerships with effect from 1 January 2024.

This will call into question certain provisions of the German Real Estate Transfer Tax Act ( Grunderwerbsteuergesetz – GrEStG ).

In addition, the rules on the taxation of share transfers are to be completely revised, the so-called group clause is to be amended and an opening clause for the Federal States is to be introduced to foment the acquisition of real estate for private residential purposes.

The WCG is intended to take tax measures to improve the liquidity situation of companies and encourage companies to invest and innovate on a lasting basis.

However, tax tightening is also envisaged under the slogan of tax fairness.

The MinBestRL-UmsG shall transpose the EU Directive (EU) 2022/2523 on the introduction of a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups into German law (so-called Pillar 2).

As a flanking measure, the draft provides, among other things, for simplifications to the Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) rules and the abolition of the so-called license barrier.

Below we outline the key proposals and their anticipated impact on the following areas: Corporate taxation (see under section II), Tax amendments related to MoPeG (see section III), Real estate tax law (see under section IV), Foreign tax law (see under section V), Fund taxation (see under section VI), Disclosure rules for domestic tax arrangements (see under Section VII); and Other aspects (see under section VIII).

II.

Corporate taxation In the area of corporate taxation, the above-mentioned drafts contain the following proposed amendments: 1. Interest barrier rule The so-called interest barrier rule under §§ 4h of the German Income Tax Act ( Einkommensteuergesetz - EStG ), 8a of the German Corporation Tax Act ( Körperschaftsteuergesetz - KStG ) must be adapted to the requirements of the ATAD by 31 December 2023 at the latest.

This is to be done by the WCG and would lead to a significant tightening of these rules from 2024 onwards.

1.1 Expansion of the concept of interest Currently, the interest barrier rule only applies to expenses and income that are remuneration for the use of debt capital (fundamentally Federal Tax Court, judgement dated 22 March 2023, XI R 45/19, BeckRS 2023, 17483, on arrangement fees).

However, according to the ATAD, the concept of interest/borrowing costs is to be expanded to include expanses and income economically equivalent to interest and expenses incurred in connection with the raising of finance defined in art.

2 (1) of the ATAD."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"2 (1) of the ATAD.

The changes expected to result from this are presented below in tabular form based on ATAD's non-exhaustive list of borrowing costs.

C lick image to enlarge As a result, the material scope of application of the interest barrier rule is to be expanded considerably, in particular to include gains and losses from derivative transactions (cf.

Tax Court of Berlin-Brandenburg, judgement dated 8 January 2019, 6 K 6242/17, BeckRS 2019, 2587), costs for the borrowing in the broader sense and foreign exchange gains and losses related to financing.

1.2 Abolition of exceptions Furthermore, the exceptions currently existing from the interest barrier rule of the so-called ""equity escape"" (cf.

§ 4h (2) (c) EStG) and the so-called ""stand-alone clause"" (cf.

§ 4h (2) (b) EStG) are to be abolished due to an incompatibility with the ATAD (in our view, there is no fundamental contradiction to the ATAD here).

This has different impacts in practice: Equity escape : In practice, this exception is of little significance.

The reason for this is that its prerequisites – in particular proof of the absence of harmful financing within the meaning of § 8a (3) KStG throughout the entire group – are only hardly met or cannot be met at all.

Stand-alone clause :

More practical significance has the stand-alone clause.

This exemption currently excludes businesses that are not part of a group from the interest barrier (e.g., a GmbH without subsidiaries, in which no shareholder is holding more than 50%).

In the future, such structures would be included; this would presumably also be the case for standard securitization vehicles that are regularly held by several foundations (to the extent that debt capital is securitized, however, the actual impact should be minor; in contrast, structures that securitize other assets such as e.g. German real estate, private equity or infrastructure could be called into question.

Different lobby groups have rejected such an abolition without replacement.

1.3.

Allowance, but only once for similar businesses A positive aspect is that the previous EUR 3 million exemption limit is to be converted into an allowance - i.e .

net borrowing costs would only be subject to the restrictions of the interest barrier above this amount.

However, this relief is to be combined with a massive tightening.

In contrast to the current situation, similar businesses that are under the same management are to be considered together, with the consequence that the EUR 3 million allowance can then only be claimed once.

According to the explanatory memorandum to the draft, this is intended in particular to affect structures in which activities (e.g. construction projects) are ""atomized"" in subsidiaries; however, the current wording of the proposal goes significantly and possibly unintentionally beyond this: Similar businesses : For the concept of similar businesses, the explanatory memorandum refers to § 4 (6) sentence 1 no. 1

KStG. The concept of similarity covers not only activities in the same branch of trade, but also activities that partially overlap and/or complement each other; however, the geographical proximity of the businesses concerned is not relevant (cf.

Federal Fiscal Court, judgement dated 13 April 2021, I R 2/19, Federal Tax Gazette II 2021, 777; Tax Court of Münster, judgement dated 21 April 2021, 13 K 3663/18 G, BeckRS 2021, 10713).

Uniform management : With regard to the concept of uniform management, the explanatory memorandum to the draft contains no comments.

This is an indeterminate legal concept which may be defined more precisely by recourse to the group and affiliate concept under company law (cf.

§ 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act)."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"This is an indeterminate legal concept which may be defined more precisely by recourse to the group and affiliate concept under company law (cf.

§ 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act).

Against this background, there is the possibility that customary group structures in which subsidiaries cooperate on the basis of a division of labor, and also investment structures in which there is no undesired “atomization”, could claim the EUR 3 million allowance only once.

This should be reviewed in the legislative procedure and the regulation, to the extent necessary, be limited to genuine cases of abuse.

1.4.

Exception for public infrastructure Art. 4 (4) subpara. 1

(b), (2) and (3) ATAD provides for the possibility that net borrowing costs relating to the financing of public infrastructure projects may be exempted from the interest barrier.

This exemption is to be implemented by § 4h (6) EStG for the financing of (i) long-term public infrastructure projects (ii) under general funding conditions (iii) with a specific source of funds: Long-term public infrastructure projects : This term is not defined in the draft of the WCG.

However, according to the ATAD, it refers to projects for the provision, expansion, operation and/or maintenance of substantial assets that are considered to be in the general public interest by a Member State of the EU (cf. art.

4 (4) subpara.

2 ATAD).

General conditions of eligibility : This term is also not defined in the draft of the WCG; according to the explanatory memorandum to the draft, reference is made to note 94 of the current circular letter to the interest barrier of the Federal Ministry of Finance for specification.

Source of funds : The funds for financing must come directly or indirectly from the public budgets of the EU, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal States, the municipalities or from other public-law corporations or an entity exempt from tax under § 5 (1) no. 2, 17 or 18 KStG.

Moreover, this exemption applies only if all the assets created are located in an EU Member State, the project operator is resident in an EU Member State, and the income from the infrastructure project is subject to taxation in an EU Member State.

In the end it is rather questionable whether the exception for public infrastructure will have a wider scope of application in practice.

1.5

No grandfathering With regard to the changes to the interest barrier, the draft of the WCG does not provide any protection for existing financing (so-called grandfathering).

In other words, the deduction of net borrowing costs may be limited under the new rules from the tax year 20024 onwards, even though the borrowing was taken out beforehand.

2. Interest rate cap In addition to the interest barrier, the deduction of net borrowing costs in relation to financing between related parties within the meaning of §. 1

(2) of the German Foreign Tax Act ( Außen-steuergesetz - AStG ) is to be limited to an interest rate cap by §.

4l EStG (so-called interest rate cap ( Zinshöhenschranke )).

The maximum interest rate shall be 2% p.a.

above the base interest rate pursuant to § 247 of the German Civil Code (currently 5.12% p.a.).

It is questionable at what point in time the base interest rate is to be applied (at the time of taking out the borrowing vs. adjustments over the term).

Moreover, in our view, the link to the statutory base interest rate makes little sense, among other things because this is only adjusted and published every six months.

The following exceptions to the interest rate cap shall exist: Counter-evidence : On the one hand, the taxpayer can prove that both the creditor and, in the case of a group of companies, the ultimate parent company could only have obtained the financing at an interest rate above the maximum rate, all other things being equal.

This brings back (bad) memories of §."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"This brings back (bad) memories of §.

8a (1) sentence 1 no. 2 KStG in the version of the (original) old thin capitalization rules, which the tax authorities already interpreted very restrictively at the time, leading to considerable dispute (cf.

Federal Ministry of Finance, circular letter dated 15 December 1994, Federal Tax Gazette I 1995, 25, note 61; Federal Fiscal Court, judgement dated 25 January 2005, I R 12/04, BeckRS 2005, 24002031).

Proof of substance : On the other hand, the interest rate barrier shall not apply if the creditor carries out a substantial economic activity in the state in which it has its registered office or management; §. 8 (2) sentence 2, 3 and 5 AStG (inter alia, prohibition of outsourcing) are to apply mutatis mutandis.

The substantive exception is excluded if the above-mentioned state does not provide administrative assistance by way of exchange of information, which is required to carry out taxation in the individual case.

The draft of the WCG also does not provide for a grandfathering in relation to the proposed interest rate cap.

3. License barrier rule The license barrier rule pursuant to § 4j EStG, which was introduced in 2018, provides for a prohibition of business expense deductions for the corresponding license expenses in Germany in certain cases of low taxation of license income abroad (e.g., due to a ""patent box"").

However, the practical significance of the license barrier is limited.

Against the background of Pillar 2, the reform(s) of the CFC rules as well as the Tax Oasis Defense Act ( Steueroasenabwehrgesetz ), this barrier is to be abolished again by the MinBestRL-UmsG as of 1 January 2024.

4. Use of tax losses The draft of the WCG provides for the following changes to the use of tax losses: Loss carryback : As of the tax year 2024, the period for a loss carryback for income tax and corporate income tax purposes is to be increased to 3 years; the current maximum amount of EUR 10 million (or EUR 20 million in the case of joint tax assessment) is to apply permanently.

For trade tax purposes, however, there will continue to be no loss carryback.

Suspension of minimum taxation : In addition, the minimum taxation, which currently limits the offsetting of loss carryforwards against current profits in excess of EUR 1 million to 60 %, is to be suspended from the tax years 2024 to 2027.

This will make asset deals and Reorganizations at fair market values significantly more attractive.

Re-introduction of minimum taxation : As of the tax year 2028, minimum taxation will be re-introduced, but only for the total amount of income exceeding EUR 10 million (or EUR 20 million).

Synchronization of trade tax : The minimum taxation is also to be suspended for trade tax purposes from trade tax period 2024 until and including trade tax period 2027 and subsequently only apply above an amount of EUR 10 million.

The changes summarized above are very welcome.

5.

Preferential regime for retained earnings (§ 34a EStG) Members of a commercial partnership are generally taxed on their share of the partnership's profits, irrespective of whether they withdraw or retain them at company level.

An exception to this is provided for by the preferential regime for retained earnings under § 34a EStG.

This allows the respective members, upon application and under certain conditions, to retain all or part of their share of profits at company level at a tax rate of 28.25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax).

Additional (“distribution”) taxation only occurs in the event of withdrawal.

In practice, however, the preferential regime for retained earnings is often not used, in particular because the effective tax rate is significantly higher than 28.25% (see below) and certain events can lead to unwanted subsequent taxation of the reinvested amounts.

With the WCG, practically significant improvements - but also tightening - are to be made."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"With the WCG, practically significant improvements - but also tightening - are to be made.

In particular, the following should be pointed out Increase in the volume of preferentially taxed retained earnings : Under the current legal situation, the amount that can be retained at a preferential tax rate of 28.25% is reduced by the trade tax incurred at company level and the profits withdrawn for the payment of income tax on these retained earnings.

The effective retention tax rate is therefore often at or above 35%.

Both of these aspects are to be changed by the WCG, so that in future full retention at 28.25% would be possible in individual cases (§ 34a (2) EStG-E).

Relief from subsequent taxation : According to the draft of the WCG, the order of application in the case of excess withdrawals will be changed in favor of taxpayers.

Under the current legal situation, excess withdrawals (i.e. withdrawals in excess of contributions and taxable retained earnings) result in tax-privileged retained earnings being deemed to have been withdrawn first.

In this respect, there is currently a subsequent taxation at the rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, church tax), even if tax-exempt or regular-taxed profits were retained in the company.

According to the WCG, the withdrawal of regular-taxed or tax-exempt profits that have been retained in the company so far (post-tax withdrawal amount) is to be given priority; only to the extent that this so-called post-tax withdrawal amount has been used up will there be a taxable subsequent taxation of the profits retained at a preferential rate (§ 34a (4) et seq.

EStG-E).

Tightening of subsequent taxation : At the same time, the events that can lead to subsequent taxation of preferentially retained earnings are to be expanded.

In particular, the transfer of Business units ( Teilbetriebe ) or partial co-entrepreneurial interests ( Mitunternehmeranteile ) for a consideration or free of charge (e.g. also contributions to corporations pursuant to § 20 of the German Reorganization Tax Act ( Umwandlungssteuergesetz - UmwStG ) shall in the future lead to a proportionate subsequent taxation (§ 34a (8) EStG-E).

6.

Corporate tax option (§ 1a KStG)

As an alternative to the preferential regime for retained earnings, a check the box election for partnerships has been introduced for assessment periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

This allows commercial partnerships (Personenhandelsgesellschaften) and partnership companies (Partnerschaftsgesellschaften) to apply to be treated as corporations for income tax purposes.

This option for corporate taxation leads to a far-reaching - albeit not congruent - equal treatment of a partnership with a corporation for income tax purposes.

The WCG is intended to adapt the existing regulations in favor of taxpayers: Scope of application : In the future, the option is to be open to all partnerships and thus, for example, also to civil partnerships and purely internal companies.

For tax-wise asset-managing partnerships, however, this will often not be of interest for tax purposes, because the option would not be carried out in accordance with §§ 25, 20 UmwStG at book values and would therefore lead to the realization of hidden reserves at company level (§ 1a (1) sent.

1-4 KStG-E).

Application on newly established partnerships and changes of legal form : Under the current legal situation, the option can only be exercised up to one month before the beginning of the fiscal year for which the option is to be exercised for the first time.

This excludes the tax option model for newly formed partnerships as well as partnerships that have changed their form in the ""first year""."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"This excludes the tax option model for newly formed partnerships as well as partnerships that have changed their form in the ""first year"".

According to the WCG, these companies shall be able to exercise the option up to one month after conclusion of the partnership agreement or registration of the change of form in the commercial register; corporations can therefore (e.g. due to greater flexibility under civil law) change their legal form to a partnership without changing their tax status (§ 1a (1) sent.

7 KStG-E).

Non-contribution of the general partner shares not harmful : The tax neutrality of the option for corporate taxation requires that the partners ""contribute"" all functionally essential business assets.

This can also include the shares in the general partner in the legal form of a corporation.

As a result, the partners would have to transfer the civil law ownership in the general partner shares to the partnership in the course of exercising the option.

Fortunately, the WCG provides that the retention of these shares shall not result in the failure of the book value carry-over (i.e., the tax neutrality of the check the box election (§ 1a (2) sent.

2 KStG-E).

Taxation of distributions : Under the current legal situation, profits of an opting partnership are deemed to have been distributed to its partners and are subject to distribution taxation there,if these can ""demand payment of the profits"".

In practice, this can lead - depending on the provisions of the partnership agreement - to unintentional distribution taxation despite the fact that the profit shares are not withdrawn but retained.

The WCG provides that, in future, taxation on distributions will only occur in the event of an actual withdrawal (§ 1a (3) sent.

5 KStG-E).

III.

Consequential amendments to MoPeG The MoPeG , which comes into force on 01 January 2024, requires consequential tax changes.

1. Income tax Pursuant to the changes proposed by the draft of the WCG to § 39 (2) no. 2 of the German General Tax Code ( Abgabenordnung - AO ) partnerships with legal capacity shall be treated as joint owners for the purposes of income taxation and their assets as joint ownership assets as from 1 January 2024.

This ensures that, despite the MoPeG, there will be no change in the income taxation of so-called asset administrating partnerships.

In our view, the MoPeG does not require any changes in relation to commercial partnerships, because the relevant provisions do not refer to the civil law concept of joint ownership ( Gesamthand ) but to the tax-wise qualification of a co-entrepreneurship ( Mitunternehmerschaft ) 2.

Inheritance and gift tax In § 2a of the German Inheritance Tax Act, the WCG is to stipulate that partnerships with legal capacity are also deemed to be joint owners for the purposes of inheritance and gift tax and that their assets are deemed to be joint owners' assets as from 1 January 2024.

As a result, partnerships will continue to be treated transparently also for these purposes.

3. Real estate transfer tax The MoPeG is also one reason for the discussion draft of the GrEStNG.

In the view of the legislator, the adjustments to the joint ownership principle mean that the rationale for the tax exemp-tions in §§ 5, 6 and 7 (2) GrEStG does no longer apply.

These provisions are therefore to be designed independently of the legal form for partnerships and corporations.

Irrespective of the changes required in relation to the MoPeG, the discussion draft of the GrEStNG also provides for the following changes: Share unification of 100 % :

The supplementary provisions in § 1 (2a) to (4) GrEStG are to be abolished and, at the same time, the current holding periods and the holding quota of 90 % shall no longer be applicable."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"The supplementary provisions in § 1 (2a) to (4) GrEStG are to be abolished and, at the same time, the current holding periods and the holding quota of 90 % shall no longer be applicable.

Instead, share acquisitions in a real estate company are to be taxed in the future when the entirety - i.e. 100% - of the shares are unified pursuant to § 1a GrEStG; in the event of a concerted action, several share acquirers are to be treated as an acquisition group ( Erwerbergruppe ).

Taxation of unit deals : Currently, no real estate transfer tax is triggered in relation to real estate unit funds in the event of a change of investor.

This shall be changed in the future by § 1b GrEStG.

In this regard, it is problematic that the real estate will then be doubly entangled ( steuerverstrickt ) for real estate transfer tax purposes, i.e. once in relation to a transfer of the share in the capital management companies of the fund ( Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaften ) and once for transfers of the units of the investors in the fund.

Adjustment of the group clause : The current exception under the group clause pursuant to § 6a GrEStG only covers certain restructuring measures under the German Reorganization Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz – UmwG ) and other corporate measures within a group (Konzern).

In the future, an exemption pursuant to § 5 (1) GrEStG shall be available if the significant influence ( bestimmender Einfluss ) of a person over the real estate does not change as a result of a transaction.

This would mean that in future all transfers within a 100 % owned group would be tax exempt.

Favorable treatment for the acquisition of owner-occupied residential property : To foment the acquisition of owner-occupied residential property by individuals, the discussion draft contains an opening clause for the Federal States.

This allows the individual Federal States to tax the acquisition of owner-occupied residential property at a reduced tax rate.

The structure of such tax relief is left to the legislation of the individual Federal State.

However, it remains to be seen whether and to what extent these proposals will be adopted in the further legislative process.

IV.

Real estate tax law

In addition to the GrEStNG, the WCG also results in changes in the area of real estate tax law.

In particular, the limit for harmless additional income from electricity production and sales from photovoltaic systems and charging stations in the context of the so-called extended exemption for real estate income pursuant to § 9 no. 1 sentence 2 et seq. of the German Trade Tax Act ( Gewerbesteuergesetz - GewStG ) is increased from 10 to 20 % already as of trade tax period 2023 (the relief was introduced by the Fondsstandortgesetz ).

The tax authorities have already issued a detailed interpretation guideline on this provision (cf.

Tax Authorities of the Federal States, joint decree dated 17 June 2022, Federal Tax Gazette I 2022, 958).

V. Foreign tax law The MinBestRL-UmsG is intended to transpose the global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups into German law (Pillar 2; see section 1 below).

As a flanking measure, the draft also provides for simplification of the taxation of the addition of profits (see section 2 below).

1.

Pillar 2 Pillar 2 is a minimum taxation which shall ensure a taxation of at least 15% for groups with a total turnover of EUR 750 million or more.

For the implementation of this minimum taxation, the national legislators shall make use of three instruments: Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) : The IIR is the primary mechanism by which minimum taxation shall be ensured.

The IIR represents a form of lump-sum CFC taxation.

The country of residence of the parent company of a group must levy a ""top-up tax"" at the level of the parent company on the income of foreign subsidiaries or of the parent company itself, to the extent that these are subject to income taxation of less than 15%."
Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"Undertaxed Payments Rule (UTPR) :

Secondarily, the UTPR is intended to ensure minimum taxation.

It is only applied if a minimum taxation of 15% is not already achieved by applying the IIR, e.g. if no IIR or a comparable rule applies in the country of residence of the parent company (e.g., because the parent company is domiciled in a third country or the country of residence of the parent company has not (yet) implemented Pillar 2).

Under the UTPR, “top-up tax” is levied in the subsidiaries' countries of residence according to a certain key, provided that income taxation is less than 15%.

Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) :

The STTR takes a special place.

The STTR is an article of a double taxation treaty that gives the source state extended taxation rights with respect to certain payments.

Pillar 2 is to be implemented by the Minimum Taxation Act, which in general is to apply for business years starting after 30 December 2023.

The individual provisions to implement the above-mentioned instruments and complementary as well as accompanying provisions will be presented in a separate news article.

2. CFC rules In addition, the MinBestRL-UmsG also provides for amendments to the AStG and the GewStG to relax the CFC rules: Reduction of the low tax rate : The frequently criticized low tax rate of 25 % shall be reduced to 15%.

This reduction affects both the standard CFC taxation (§ 7 AStG) and CFC taxation for passive capital investment income (§ 13 AStG) as well as the so-called tightened CFC rules (§ 9 of the German act to counter tax avoidance and unfair tax competition).

Trade tax exemption in relation to CFC inclusion : According to the explanatory memorandum to the draft, the real of § 7 sentences 7 to 9 GewStG and the amendment of § 9 no. 3 GewStG are intended to abolish trade tax on the amount of CFC inclusion.

The intention of the legislator is clear.

However, since the draft wording would retain the words ""of this company"" in relation to the foreign permanent establishment, it is questionable whether this intention would also have been unambiguously incorporated into the law (cf.

Federal Finance Court, judgment dated 11 March 2015, I R 10/14, BeckRS 2015, 94759).

This potential issue should be mitigated.

T rade tax exemption of profit shares :

In addition, § 9 no. 2 GewStG is to be amended to the effect that profit shares from foreign commercial partnerships are also exempt from trade tax to the extent that they contain low-taxed passive income and an amount of CFC inclusion.

It should be noted, however, that the trade tax exemption already applies today in these cases for partnerships with substance and partnerships that are to be classified as investment funds.

The above-mentioned changes are to apply as of the tax year / trade tax period 2024.

VI.

Fund taxation

The draft of the WCG also includes changes to the fund taxation: Capital gains from companies with German real estate : By amending § 6 (5) of the German Investment Tax Act ( Investmentsteuergesetz - InvStG ), gains from the sale of shares in corporations that predominantly hold German real estate are to become taxable for investment funds.

This would lead to unequal treatment with respect to corporate structures outside the InvStG, where such gains are fully or largely tax-exempt under § 8b KStG, whereas this is not the case for investment funds pursuant to § 5 (6) InvStG. Whether the German Federal Ministry of Finance is aware of this unsystematic fault is unclear.

This follows not least from the fact that the Federal Finance Ministry has not yet seen any need for action on this point during the recent evaluation process of the investment tax reform in 2018.

Noerr,Tax law changes in 2023/2024: Federal Ministry of Finance publishes several proposals,"Additional income from electricity in the case of special investment funds : The threshold in § 26 no.

7a InvStG for additional income from electricity, above which the status as a special investment fund may be forfeited, is to be raised from 10% to 20% in line with the rules on the extended trade tax exemption for real estate income.

To the contrary, there shall be no change in the material scope of application of § 26 no.

The above changes shall apply as of the tax year 2024.

Notification obligation for domestic tax arrangements From 2025, the obligation to notify cross-border tax arrangements under DAC 6 is to be extended to purely domestic tax arrangements by means of §§ 138l to 138n of the German General Fiscal Code (AO).

However, this notification obligation shall only apply if further requirements ( e.g ., exceeding a turnover, income or revenue threshold, belonging to a group within the meaning of § 18 AktG, investment funds or special investment funds and certain investors) are met.

In addition, as with DAC 6, certain hallmarks must be met; however, unlike DAC 6, these are all subject to a ""main benefit test"" (i.e., the or one of the main benefit(s) of the arrangement must be obtaining a tax benefit).

Notifications are to be made within two months of the event triggering the notification requirement.

VIII.

Other aspects Finally, the draft WCG contains other proposals to change corporate and group taxation, inter alia: Post-spin off lock-up : The ruling of the Federal Fiscal Court dated 11 August 2021, I R 39/18, BeckRS 2021, 41936, is taken as an opportunity to tighten the post-spin off lock-up of § 15 (2) for the German Reorganization Tax Act ( Umwandlungsteuergesetz – UmwStG ).

Noerr,Compliance risks from “outdated” status determination decisions,"Mistakes about the social security status of employees are quite common, but can have serious consequences and even lead to criminal liability under section 266a of the German Criminal Code ( Strafgesetzbuch ).

Companies wishing to avoid such risks when hiring freelancers or having shareholders/partners or shareholder-managing directors work for them, for instance, can have a procedure to establish their employment status pursuant to section 7a of Book IV of the German Social Security Code ( SGB IV ) carried out by Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund (DRV), Germany’s central social security authority.

The DRV issues a decision establishing whether or not the person is a dependent employee and therefore whether obligations to remit social security contributions apply.

This decision has binding effect for all those involved and they, especially the undertaking (company/principal), can rely on this as long as the circumstances underlying the decision continue to exist unaltered.

The German Federal Social Court ( Bundessozialgericht ) recently decided what obligations exist if these circumstances change.

A. Legal certainty from DRV’s decision The decision initially provides companies with clarity about whether an engagement or work relationship constitutes dependent employment or freelance activities, i.e. whether or not there is an obligation to withhold and pay social security contributions.

The notice essentially applies indefinitely , providing employers with legal certainty for the time being.

B. Change of circumstances – change of decision?

However, the DRV reaches its decision on the basis of the files, taking the factual and legal circumstances submitted by those involved into account.

These circumstances can of course change rapidly and continuously in day-to-day business.

The decision issued is based on a snapshot of the circumstances existing at the time the application is made.

So, is a company required to report changes in the factual and/or legal circumstances to the DRV or can it rely on the principle of protection of confidence in this respect?

C. Subsequent notification requirements for companies Section 7a of Book IV of the German Social Code itself does not contain any duty of a company to report any changes in circumstances occurring at a later date to the authority.

Similarly, the typical notification requirements under social security law are not relevant here since they only apply when social security benefits are being applied for or drawn, which clearly does not cover requests to establish social security status (section 11, first sentence and section 60(1), first sentence, no. 

2 Book I of the German Social Code).

However, in its judgment of 29 March 2023 (B 12 KR 1/20 R) the Federal Social Court assumes that there is an unintended loophole in the provisions of the Code and hence that an obligation to report changes in circumstances without delay arises by analogy from section 60(1), first sentence, no. 2 of Book I of the German Social Code in conjunction with section 28a(1) of Book IV of the Code.

It states that changes in the factual or legal circumstances are always to be expected, meaning that companies are obliged to report such changes to the DRV without delay if they are relevant for determining employment status .

D. What do companies have to bear in mind?

Yet the duty to monitor the circumstances relevant for the decision associated with this is not always obvious or easy to manage.

To take one example, increasing the share capital of a limited liability company (GmbH) can lead to the elimination of the decisive blocking minority of a shareholder-managing director and, as a result of that, to the managing director becoming an employee subject to social security contributions."
Noerr,Compliance risks from “outdated” status determination decisions,"Should the company fail to recognise the implications of this change and to notify the DRV, there is a risk that the “old” status determination decision will be repealed with retrospective effect if this is discovered later on.

The company will then have to pay the entire social security contributions retrospectively and may even have to pay additional charges for late payment.

Bearing this in mind, companies should have an overview at all times of possible changes in the circumstances relevant for decisions regarding employment/social security status as part of their compliance processes , so that they are able to inform the DRV about these immediately.

Failing to do so could turn out to be expensive.

Noerr,The German KRITIS umbrella act: strengthening physical infrastructure resilience,"German law regarding critical infrastructure has entered the next round with the goal of increasing the physical resilience of critical facilities (the CER-Directive uses the word ""entities"", but, as the wording of the KRITIS Act states, the German legislator has expressly chosen to use a word that translates as ""facilities"": hereinafter, the term “critical facility” or “operators of critical facilities” will be used instead of “critical entities”). 

A first draft for the German umbrella act for critical infrastructure protection ( KRITIS-Dachgesetz – the “ KRITIS Umbrella Act ”) (available for example here in German only) issued by the Federal Ministry of the Interior to implement the EU Critical Entities Resilience Directive ( CER Directive ) was made public.

Its primary objective is to mitigate non-cyber-related risks.

Figuratively speaking, the KRITIS Act focusses on the outer “shell” of critical systems.

If this outer “shell” is fragile, digital IT security measures are practically useless.

The KRITIS Act governs eleven sectors such as energy, including sectors like transport, health care and information technology.

This article is to provide answers to the most important questions regarding this new law.

What is the KRITIS Umbrella Act?

The KRITIS Umbrella Act is a supplement to the German Act on the Federal Office for Information Security ( Gesetz über das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – “ Cybersecurity Act ”), which governs cybersecurity in Germany and is currently being extensively amended due to the NIS-2-Directive.

As a supplement to the Cybersecurity Act’s wide-ranging requirements for protection from digital dangers such as hacker attacks, the KRITIS Umbrella Act has several measures to strengthen analogue security.

The draft KRITIS Umbrella Act has an “all-danger approach” intended to protect German infrastructure from all hazards of a physical nature, whether natural disasters or danger due to human acts - whether they are due to unintentional or intentional behavior.

The goal of the KRITIS Umbrella Act is to make operators of critical facilities more resilient, i.e. strengthen their ability to prevent or avert an incident or mitigate its impact (section 2 no. 5).

Operators of critical facilities must take “resilience measures”, which are monitored by the German Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance ( Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe – “ Federal Civil Protection Office ” (section 3(2)) or other competent authorities such as BSI, BaFin or BNetzA.

In its capacity as an interface with IT security law, the KRITIS Umbrella Act also includes a number of legal definitions for parties to which the NIS-2 Directive applies and whose obligations will soon be included in the revised version of the Cybersecurity Act.

Who is affected?

The KRITIS Act is aimed primarily at operators of “critical facilities”.

Applicability of the law, which will especially be subject to a Ordinance that is still to be published, to a particular party is determined based on two criteria: whether the facility is used in a particular sector (energy, transport and traffic, financing and insurance, health care, water, food, information technology and telecommunications, outer space, public administration or municipal waste disposal) and whether it functions at or above a particular threshold (section 4).

The threshold value will be determined according to whether the operator supplies at least 500,000 inhabitants with its facility.

Critical facilities thus largely correspond to the definition of critical infrastructure as defined in the BSIG today.

However, the competent supervisory authority can also qualify additional companies as operators of critical facilities.

If an operator runs the critical facility in or for at least six member states, it is identified as a critical facility of particular importance for Europe and is subject to special measures."
Noerr,The German KRITIS umbrella act: strengthening physical infrastructure resilience,"If an operator runs the critical facility in or for at least six member states, it is identified as a critical facility of particular importance for Europe and is subject to special measures.

As an interface with IT security law, the KRITIS Umbrella Act also defines additional entities and facilities that will be subject to more detailed provisions in the (future version of the) Cybersecurity Act, including “Critical Facility” (section 2 no. 3) and “Critical Services” (section 2 no. 4).

The approach found in the draft KRITIS Umbrella Act, i.e. an overarching means to address digital and analogue dangers, is to be seen as positive.

Compared to the previous drafts of this Act, the present draft already appears much “tidier” and more harmonized with the future version of the Cybersecurity Act.

What must affected entities do?

The draft KRITIS Umbrella Act places operators of critical facilities under several obligations that are strikingly similar in form to the requirements for operators of critical facilities according to the Cybersecurity Act (see particularly section 8a of the Cybersecurity Act).

First, operators of critical facilities must register with the competent authority (section 6(1)).

If an operator does not comply with this obligation, the authority can perform the registration itself (section 8(3)).

Operators also must designate a point of contact that must be available around the clock (section 6(1)(1)).

Based on this registration, the authorities are then to conduct government risk assessments and evaluations (section 8), which the operators of critical facilities are also obliged to conduct (section 9).

However, operators’ key task is to implement suitable and appropriate technical, security-related and organisational measures to ensure resilience.

This is a requirement in the KRITIS Umbrella Act that is similarly abstract to that found in the Cybersecurity Act – with the distinction that the measures must now also be “security-related”.

The draft KRITIS Act does not include any detailed requirements regarding the measures, but merely gives examples.

The list of examples in Annex 1 does not provide any reference points that would not already arise from general reasonable consideration.

Physically protecting premises and controlling access rights should actually be a general matter of course.

The Federal Ministries can issue Ordinances to specify the resilience measures for the areas for which they are responsible.

The measures must be documented in a “resilience plan” (section 10).

Proof of compliance with the requirements is to be provided at regular intervals (section 11).

Another component that will probably sound familiar to operators is the “sector-specific resilience standards” (section 10 (6)).

In a manner similar to that of the sector-specific security standards found in section 8a(2) of the Cybersecurity Act, operators of critical facilities and their sector associations can develop their own standards to make the KRITIS Umbrella Act’s abstract requirements more concrete and then have Federal Civil Protection Office certify their suitability.

Operators must immediately report any security incidents to a joint notification center operated by the BSI and the Federal Civil Protection Office (section 12(1)).

The deadlines for this are extremely strict.

The authorities must be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the incident, and a detailed report is due by one month thereafter (section 12(3)).

What are the consequences of non-compliance with the KRITIS Umbrella Act?

There are also many parallels to the Cybersecurity Act in the application and enforcement of the KRITIS Umbrella Act.

The competent authority is authorised to check compliance with all of the legal requirements."
Noerr,The German KRITIS umbrella act: strengthening physical infrastructure resilience,"The competent authority is authorised to check compliance with all of the legal requirements.

To facilitate this, operators of critical facilities must permit the authority to enter their business and operations premises during normal operating hours and provide records and the necessary support (section 11(5)).

If and to the extent that the competent authority is of the opinion that the measures taken are insufficient, it can order an operator to take the necessary measures (section 11(10).

Violations of the KRITIS Umbrella Act are punishable by a fine in many cases, including failure to register or complete a risk assessment in a timely manner or insufficient support of the competent authority Federal Civil Protection Office (section 19).

However, the current draft KRITIS Umbrella Act does not yet set the exact amount of such fines.

When will the Act come into force?

The KRITIS Umbrella Act implements the CER Directive, which requires member states to transpose the requirements into national law by 17 October 2024.

According to the wording of the current draft, the KRITIS Umbrella Act is to be introduced in several stages.

The most important obligations are set to enter into force on 17 July 2026.

These time periods are intended to provide the relevant facilities with sufficient time to comply with the new requirements and implement the necessary resilience measures.

So far, the KRITIS Umbrella Act is only a draft.

Many changes may still come before it is adopted.

However, the essential core content of the KRITIS Umbrella Act is prescribed by European law."
Noerr,Changes to real property-owning private partnerships under the German Civil Code from 1 January 2024 – Q&A list,"On 1 January 2024, the German Act to Modernise the Law on Partnerships ( Gesetz zur Modernisierung des Personengesellschaftsrechts, “ MoPeG ” ) is scheduled to come into force.

The introduction of a partnership register ( Gesellschaftsregister ) for partnerships under the German Civil Code ( Gesellschaften bürgerlichen Rechts (“ GbR ”) ) will result in far-reaching changes, especially for GbR registered in the land register.

The new legislation will offer simplifications for real property-owning GbR , in legal and business transactions, which is why a basic understanding of the matter is worthwhile.

With the following questions and answers, we aim to provide an outlook on changes that are of particular practical relevance: 1. Is it obligatory to register a GbR ?

Rather yes than no.

In principle, the registration of a GbR in the partnership register to be kept as of 1 January 2024 is voluntary.

However, Section 47(2) of the amended version of the German Land Register Ordinance ( Grundbuchordnung, GBO ) will indirectly impose a compulsory registration requirement for GbR.

This is because entries in the land register of a GbR will in future only be carried out if the GbR is entered in the partnership register.

Consequently, a GbR entered in the land register as a beneficiary under the previous law will have to arrange its entry in the partnership register in order to be able to dispose over its real estate rights and acquire or dispose of real property or other real property-related rights.

Article 229, Section 21(4) of the Introductory Book to the German Civil Code ( EGBGB ), as amended, establishes a special rule for all priority notices.

This particular provision will gain practical relevance in cases priority notices have already been entered in the land register before 1 January 2024 or if registration has been applied for and approved before this date.

The claims secured by these priority notices will be satisfied (for land register purposes) in line with currently applicable law, meaning that even GbR that are not registered in the partnership register will be able to dispose over the claims.

2. Is it possible to register a GbR without cause?

Yes, the partners of a GbR do not have to wait for an event requiring a land register entry in order to register the GbR in the partnership register.

Each GbR is free to seek entry in the register from the time the MoPeG comes into force.

3.

Who has to register the GbR ?

Section 707(4), first sentence of the amended German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB ) states that registration in the partnership register has to be carried out by all partners.

The reason for this is that the registration brings the GbR into existence in external relationships (Section 719(1), second alternative of the amended German Civil Code), which entails liability risks for the partners.

However, the partners may be represented when registering by authorized persons.

4.

What information has to be provided in order to register?

The name of the GbR , its place of domicile and an address in an EU Member State have to be provided.

Besides this, the names, dates of birth and places of residence of the partners as well as their powers of representation have to be stated.

If one or more partners are legal entities or partnerships with legal capacity, their company name, legal form, registered office and, if applicable, their competent register and register number have to be stated.

In addition, when registering, the partners have to confirm that the GbR is not already registered in the commercial register ( Handelsregister ) or register for partnership companies ( Partnerschaftsregister )

The information required can be found in Section 707(2) of the amended German Civil Code.

Registered GbR will have to add the suffix “eGbR” to their name; the “e” means that the GbR is “ eingetragen ”, i. e. registered."
Noerr,Changes to real property-owning private partnerships under the German Civil Code from 1 January 2024 – Q&A list,"Registered GbR will have to add the suffix “eGbR” to their name; the “e” means that the GbR is “ eingetragen ”, i. e. registered.

The application for entry in the partnership register must be filed electronically in notarially certified form (Section 707b, no. 2 of the German Civil Code, as amended, in conjunction with Section 12 of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB )).

The procedure is the same as the application for registration in the commercial register.

5.

How much does the registration cost?

A fee of € 100 is charged for the initial registration of a GbR with up to three partners.

This fee increases by € 40 for each additional partner.

In addition, there are costs for the required notarial involvement, which correspond to a commercial register application.

The financial expenditure is expected to amount within € 150 to € 300 (net), depending on the number of partners.

6.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of registration in the new partnership register?

Changes in the partnership’s structure will then only be entered in the partnership register and no longer in the land register.

In future, only the GbR will be entered in the land register, and not its partners.

Therefore, in the event of a change of partner – unlike in the past – it will no longer be necessary to correct the land register (which is more expensive).

In future, representation arrangements agreed for the GbR will be evident from the partnership register.

This is intended to promote trust and legal certainty for all parties concerned.

Through the entry in the register, the GbR can determine a registered office/place of domicile that may differ from where the management is actually located.

The entry in the partnership register does not result in a GbR becoming a “merchant” ( Kaufmann ) in the sense of commercial law, meaning that no commercial obligations (such as accounting obligations) arise.

Similarly, the legislator has not proposed to change the principles of income tax law with regard to the taxation of partnerships by the MoPeG .

Partners of GbR who are concerned about discretion may see it as a disadvantage that the partners can be identified in the register.

Furthermore, registration in the partnership register requires the entry of the partnership’s economic beneficiaries in the transparency register (see amended Section 20 of the German Anti-Money Laundering Act ( Geldwäschegesetz, GwG )).

Once it has been entered in the partnership register, the GbR has to report any changes in its partnership structure, location of its registered office/place of domicile/business and any possible changes to the powers of representation of a partner as soon as possible for entry in the partnership register (Section 707(3) of the amended German Civil Code).

7. Can unregistered GbR also acquire and dispose of property rights?

A GbR that is not registered in the partnership register can acquire real estate by succession.

In addition to this, other (rarer) types of acquisition are possible that do not require any entry in the land register, such as assigning certificated liens on real property or claims secured by priority notices.

8.

What applies if a land register transaction has not yet been executed when the MoPeG comes into force?

Transactions which have to be entered in the land register and which started before 1 January 2024 will continue to be subject to the old law provided that an application requesting entry of this has been filed and this has been agreed or approved.

Similarly, there is no obligation to register the GbR concerned after the acquisition has been completed.

Such an obligation may only arise if subsequent dispositions take place or changes are made to the partner structure of the GbR. 9.

What does a GbR that is registered in the land register, but not yet in the partnership register, have to bear in mind if its partners change?"
Noerr,Changes to real property-owning private partnerships under the German Civil Code from 1 January 2024 – Q&A list,"What does a GbR that is registered in the land register, but not yet in the partnership register, have to bear in mind if its partners change?

As of 1 January 2024, the resulting partners after withdrawal or entry must register the GbR in accordance with the Section 707(1) of the German Civil Code, as amended, and thereupon apply for the correction of the land register.

10.

What are the consequences of the exit of the penultimate partner of a GbR ?

Section 712a German Civil Code, as amended, provides that the withdrawal of the penultimate partner leads to the dissolution of the GbR without liquidation and the partnership assets are transferred to the last remaining partner.

partnership being dissolved without any liquidation process and its assets passing to the last remaining partner.

The land register has to be corrected to reflect this change.

If the GbR has not yet been registered in the partnership register at this point in time, prior registration is not required.

If, on the other hand, the GbR was registered in the partnership register, the withdrawal of the penultimate partner has to be registered and the GbR (which then no longer exists) is deleted from the register.

Noerr will continue to keep a close eye on future legal developments concerning real property-owning GbR .

Noerr,Climate action contracts – first auction in 2023 and new FAQs from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action,"On 6 June 2023, the first preparatory procedure for the “Funding of carbon-neutral production processes in industry via climate action contracts” instituted by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz (the “ Climate Ministry ”)) began.

Companies in energy-intensive industries have the opportunity to participate in this preparatory procedure until 7 August 2023.

On 2 August 2023, the Climate Ministry once again published detailed FAQ s (in German) for interested companies that include additional information on the preparatory procedure and subsequent financial support via “climate action contracts”, a form of carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs).

Companies that do not take part in the first preparatory procedures are excluded from the first auction for climate action contracts.

However, all eligible companies will still be able to take part in new preparatory procedures and auctions at a later date.

A. Background

The German Federal Climate Change Act ( Bundesklimaschutzgesetz ) requires carbon neutrality by 2045.

The national climate goals pose great challenges for industry.

Around one-fifth of Germany’s emissions currently come from the industrial sector.

Although alternative production processes are already possible, companies have been reluctant to switch to climate-friendly production processes due to cost considerations and to avoid being put at a competitive disadvantage; at present, climate-friendly production processes are not often cost-effective.

To promote the decarbonisation of the industrial sector, the Climate Ministry intends to enter into “ climate action contracts ” with companies in energy-intensive sectors and has provided a draft funding policy for this purpose: (“ Policy on funding for climate-neutral production processes in the industrial sector via climate action contracts ” ).

By providing direct, targeted support for climate-friendly production facilities, the climate action contracts are intended to compensate for the additional costs of climate-friendly production facilities and hedge the risks of volatility in prices, for example for CO 2 and hydrogen.

B. Objectives

The instrument of climate action contracts is intended to accomplish two objectives.

Firstly, the products of climate-friendly production facilities are intended to facilitate the growth of green lead markets and expertise in financing, constructing and operating climate-friendly production facilities.

Secondly, the purpose of climate action contracts is not to finance the transformation to a climate-friendly industrial sector, but instead to provide start-up financing for transforming the industrial sector and especially to also promote the expansion of hydrogen infrastructure in Germany.

C. What are climate action contracts?

Climate action contracts are intended to promote the construction and operation of transformative production processes of larger industrial plants in emission-intensive sectors, particularly companies involved in steel, cement and glass production.

Climate action contracts are based on “ carbon contracts for difference ”.

The basis is the bidding price (after awarding, the “(base) contractual price”) that reflects the additional costs of a climate-friendly production facility as compared to a conventional production facility and is calculated in euros per avoided tonne of CO 2 equivalent.

Avoided greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the difference between the remaining emissions of the project and the emissions of the reference system for the project.

The reference systems of the climate action contracts are based on the products regulated by the European Union Emissions Trading Systems (ETS).

Companies offer the bidding price.

The calculation of the bidding price already includes green additional profit and other supports."
Noerr,Climate action contracts – first auction in 2023 and new FAQs from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action,"Companies offer the bidding price.

The calculation of the bidding price already includes green additional profit and other supports.

The effective CO 2 price, i.e. the price that can be achieved via trading in CO 2 certificates, will be deducted from the bidding price.

(The effective CO 2 price is calculated from the difference between the net costs of the greenhouse gas emissions created by conventional production in the reference system that are not covered by free allocations for which CO 2 certificates would have to be acquired and the net profit of the project in the context of EU emissions trading as a result of selling free and unused allocations of certificates on the market.)

Compensation is provided for the difference between the (base) contractual price and the effective CO 2 price in the form of the financial contribution from the climate action contract.

To mitigate the risks of price trends for companies, the contractual price is to be dynamically linked .

This means that the contractual price will be adjusted to reflect real developments in market prices.

If the market price for CO 2 is lower than the costs of the CO 2 avoidance, companies will receive funding.

This means that companies will receive at least the agreed contractual price.

This mitigates the risk of price volatility or changes for avoided fossil energies and protects companies from unforeseen price increases in the climate-friendly energies used in their place (e.g. hydrogen or its derivatives).

If the CO 2 price is higher than the costs of avoiding CO 2 emissions, the funding ends and the financial contribution is transformed into an obligation on the part of the companies to pay the German government.

The objective here is to prevent the country’s budget and/or climate-friendly production facilities from being overly burdened.

This dynamic linking has two results: industrial emissions will begin to decrease immediately, as opposed to being moved abroad, and any extra “green” profits will be taken into account.

D. Term Climate action contracts are to have a term of 15 years.

The contractual term will begin when the project becomes operational, but in principle no later than 36 months after the decision on funding becomes final and unappealable.

If the green product becomes a pricing benchmark, the contract can be terminated early.

E. Eligibility to apply Companies and municipalities, owner-operated municipal enterprises, municipal enterprises and municipal cooperatives that have economic activities are eligible to apply.

F. Minimum requirements The project must have at least absolute average annual greenhouse gas emissions of 10 kt of CO 2 equivalents in the reference system.

Companies that operate smaller plants can join others to form a syndicate; this will give smaller companies an opportunity to participate.

In addition, companies need not already participate in ETS trading; it is only required that the reference system used for the project be subject to the ETS.

The relative decrease in greenhouse gases must be 60% in comparison to the reference system as of the third year after project operations begin.

The technologies used must be technically capable of producing a 90% relative decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the reference system using the corresponding energy sources and raw materials during the term of the climate action contract, and this decrease must be achieved in the last year of the term of the contract (“access criterion: carbon neutrality”).

Projects with a total funding amount of at least €15 million.

The industrial electricity used must come exclusively from renewable energies; if hydrogen is used, the greenhouse gas emissions must be 73% lower than in production methods using fossil-based energy."
Noerr,Climate action contracts – first auction in 2023 and new FAQs from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action,"The industrial electricity used must come exclusively from renewable energies; if hydrogen is used, the greenhouse gas emissions must be 73% lower than in production methods using fossil-based energy.

The hydrogen must satisfy the criteria set out in the EU Taxonomy; green hydrogen can be funded by higher subsidies than blue hydrogen; the latter only qualifies for funding if manufacturing it produces only low amounts of emissions.

Likewise, hydrogen derivatives can be used and climate action contracts can provide for an (increasing) minimum use of hydrogen.

G. Procedure for the auction and awarding criteria Climate action contracts will be awarded as part of auctions which are preceded by a call for bids for funding.

The funds will be disbursed as subsidies.

The bids will be weighted according to funding cost efficiency (at 80%) and according to the relative decrease in greenhouse gas emissions attained in the first five years after project operations begin (at 20%).

This means that the climate action contracts will be awarded competitively to companies that can convert their production processes at the lowest cost.

These costs will form the basis for calculating the contractual price, i.e. the value of the subsidy.

As clarified by the German Federal Government in the FAQs and in an answer to a question submitted by the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, around five auctions are planned.

The first one is to be conducted at the end of 2023; two more are to be conducted in 2024 and 2025.

H. Outlook

The electricity used for the project must come exclusively from renewable energies, and the auctions can be limited to certain technologies or sectors ( limited auctions ).

It is not yet clear whether the first auction will be limited to certain technologies and sectors.

According to the FAQs published on 2 August 2023, the Climate Ministry will decide this in cooperation with the EU Commission on the basis of the information submitted in the preparatory procedure.

A limited auction will probably result in a decrease in the number of companies eligible to apply and could possibly lead to proof-of-source documents for electricity from renewable energies becoming more expensive.

Climate action contracts are not only hedging contracts based on derivative risk hedging instruments but are also subsidies in the form of the contractual price granted.

The funding instrument “climate action contracts” is thus to be notified by the EU Commission; the funding scheme has not yet been notified.

The German Federal Government has not released any recent statement regarding the ongoing notification process.

It can be assumed that the Commission will approve the funding instrument; similar schemes already exist in other Member States, for example the Netherlands.

As a result, the Climate Ministry assumes that it will be able to conduct the first auction by the end of this year.

Companies must participate in the preparatory procedure in order to be able to participate in the subsequent auction.

Companies that have not participated in the preparatory procedure are to be formally precluded from participating in the subsequent auction.

It is still possible to submit questions regarding the auction during the currently ongoing preparatory procedure; the deadline for submitting the information and documents required in this procedure is 7 August 2023.

The Climate Ministry has published the corresponding forms, a model contract and additional information on its website.

Noerr,White Collar Criminal Law Meets Foreign Arbitration in Recent U.S. Supreme Court Ruling,"The U.S. Supreme Court recently handed down a slew of decisions from its October 2022 term.

One such decision, decided 22 June 2023, combined two legal worlds when it decided a case involving U.S. white collar crime and foreign arbitration.

In Yegiazaryan, aka Egiazaryan v. Smagin et al .

, the Court held that a foreign arbitration award could be enforced through the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“ RICO ”), 18 U.S.C. §§1961-1968 , so long as the circumstances surrounding the plaintiff’s injury indicate it arose in the U.S. Just last year, the Court ruled on another arbitration-related matter but with much less success for the foreign arbitration world in ZF Automotive US, Inc. v. Luxshare, Ltd. and AlixPartners, LLP v. Fund for Protection of Investors’ Rights in Foreign States (holding that private arbitrations can no longer use Section 1782 to obtain discovery from persons or entities in the U.S.).

While the Yegiazaryan decision is much more favorable for foreign arbitration, those seeking to enforce arbitration awards in the U.S. should not be so quick to celebrate.

Some Background Ashot Yegiazaryan, a Russian national, committed fraud in Russia against Vitaly Smagin, also a Russian national.

To avoid a Russian criminal indictment, Yegiazaryan fled to California where he resided since 2010.

In 2014, Smagin won a multimillion-dollar arbitration award in London against Yegiazaryan for the Russian fraud.

Smagin then successfully filed suit in the Central District of California pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“ New York Convention ”) to freeze Yegiazaryan’s assets and collect the award.

In the interim, Yegiazaryan himself won a multimillion-dollar arbitration award in another matter and concealed the funds to keep Smagin from collecting them.

Smagin then filed a civil suit in 2020 in California under RICO, alleging that Yegiazaryan and others worked together through wire fraud and other racketeering acts to frustrate his abilities to collect the arbitration award.

The District Court dismissed the complaint stating that Smagin failed to plead domestic injury since the parties were Russian and the arbitral award stemmed from activities that occurred in Russia.

The Ninth Circuit reversed, rejecting a residency-based test for intangible property, which had been followed by the Seventh Circuit.

Instead, the Ninth Circuit applied a context-specific approach, which it found consistent with the approaches of the Second and Third Circuits and concluded that Smagin did indeed plead a domestic injury since he was trying to execute on a California judgment against a California resident and the racketeering activity had largely occurred in California.

A “Contextual Approach” The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari due to the federal circuit split as to what constitutes “domestic injury” under RICO when foreign parties are involved.

The U.S. Supreme Court had already dealt with RICO and its extraterritorial reach in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community , 579 U.S. 325 (2016), wherein it stated that “ absent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application .”

In RJR Nabisco, the U.S. Supreme Court had utilized a two-step test and looked first to whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially and second but only in the negative, to whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute considering the respective statute’s focus.

For RICO’s private right of action, §1964 (c), the U.S. Supreme Court in RJR Nabisco held that there is no clear indication that Congress intended to create a private action for injuries that are suffered outside of the U.S.; therefore, a private RICO plaintiff must prove a domestic injury in step two."
Noerr,White Collar Criminal Law Meets Foreign Arbitration in Recent U.S. Supreme Court Ruling,"The U.S. Supreme Court failed, however, to clearly define “ domestic injury ”, leaving the circuits to disagree on the definition.

The U.S. Supreme Court in Yegiazaryan v. Smagin now resolved the circuit split, ultimately agreeing with the Ninth Circuit.

The U.S. Supreme Court held that courts should look to the circumstances surrounding the injury to see if they sufficiently tie the injury back to the U.S. Applying this principle, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the circumstances surrounding Smagin’s injury made clear that the injury arose in the U.S. since Yegiazaryan’s scheme to avoid collection was carried out in the U.S. and was directed toward frustrating the California judgment.

Future Foreign Arbitration Awards in the U.S. under RICO While at first glance, it sems great that the enforcement of foreign arbitration award can benefit from the regulations under RICO, it should be noted that there were numerous U.S. ties in this particular case.

Yegiazaryan lived in California, and the judgment had been issued by a California District Court.

Further, the underlying RICO activity occurred in the U.S., e.g. the creation of U.S. shell companies to hide his U.S. assets, submission of a forged doctor’s note to a U.S. District Court and intimidation of a U.S.-based witness.

Moreover, all of the rights attached to the California judgment pursuant to the New York Convention existed only in California (including the right to obtain post judgment discovery, seize assets in California, and seek other appropriate relief from the California District Court).

All these ties to the United States played a significant role in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision.

In view of this, it is unclear what and how a U.S. district court might decide when there are fewer U.S. connections.

In any event, the newly found expansion of possibilities of enforcement of arbitral awards is limited to the RICO statute.

Thus, while this opens the door for RICO lawsuits by foreign arbitration award creditors, plaintiffs must still allege a sufficient pattern of racketeering activity to implicate RICO.

Moreover, U.S. Supreme Court has left open which factors may be relevant to the establishment of a “domestic injury” for RICO purposes and how those factors are to be weighed against one another.

These issues remain to be decided in future cases.

It could therefore prove quite difficult to bring a RICO action against those seeking to avoid arbitration judgments in most cases.

Further, Justice Alito points out in his dissent in Yegiazaryan v. Smagin that the foreign arbitral award is “not ‘domestic’ in any way” and that the U.S. Supreme Court has failed to address this point.

While it is in the dissent, the argument could be expounded upon by parties opposing foreign arbitral award enforcement via RICO.

Conclusion Foreign plaintiffs can in principle now utilize RICO to enforce foreign arbitration awards in the U.S. and take advantage of the statute’s treble damages and attorneys’ fees provisions.

However, the hurdles faced in pleading a RICO claim remain high, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision has made clear that this is a contextual, fact-intensive inquiry.

Above all, the plaintiff’s injury must still have sufficient nexus to the U.S. to indicate it arose there.

Lower courts will now begin to hash out just what constitutes enough of a nexus."
Noerr,New EU Battery Regulation published in the Official Journal ‒ important rules for the growing battery market,"The new Regulation concerning batteries and waste batteries (Regulation (EU) No 2023/1542) (hereinafter the “Regulation”) has now, shortly before the summer break, been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. 

The majority of the provisions will apply from 18 February 2024 and, by 2027, have gradually replaced the previous requirements under the Battery Directive, which was implemented in Germany pursuant to the Battery Act.

The new Regulation is considerably more comprehensive than the previous directive.

For example, there are now 15 Annexes and the number of articles has more than tripled.

Particularly in terms of its content, the Regulation contains numerous new or more far-reaching provisions.

In the following, some of the most important provisions in practice will be highlighted.

Instead of the previous three battery types (portable, automotive and industrial batteries), the Regulation now provides for five battery types: portable batteries, batteries for light transport vehicles such as e-bikes (also referred to as LMT batteries), electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries and starting, lighting and ignition batteries (SLI batteries).

In this way, the EU is responding to the growing importance of electromobility and creating legal certainty by adding a separate category of electric vehicle battery.

In addition, by renaming automotive batteries SLI batteries, the EU has eliminated conceptual ambiguities.

The Regulation now regulates batteries throughout their entire life cycle, i.e. from production to reuse and recycling.

The plan is for the battery industry to also develop into a circular economy.

In particular, the requirements for the batteries themselves were previously only set out in broad terms.

For example, in order to ensure the reduction of CO2 in relation to electric vehicle batteries, LMT batteries and certain rechargeable industrial batteries, it will now be necessary to provide a carbon footprint declaration.

The requirements for the information in the declaration will be gradually tightened and finally result in maximum values (see Article 7).

In addition, the Regulation introduces requirements for the durability and performance of batteries (Articles 9 and 10).

Furthermore, industrial and electric vehicle batteries with a capacity above 2 kWh, LMT batteries and stationary battery energy storage systems will have to have a battery management system.

This is an electronic component which, among other things, can control and monitor the battery, store data and enable communication with the vehicle (see Article 14).

The manufacturers of the batteries will be primarily responsible for compliance with these obligations.

In the future, the manufacturer must be distinguished conceptually from the producer.

The latter term covers not only the actual manufacturer of a battery, but also the distributor or importer subject to further conditions.

The conformity assessment procedure for obtaining a CE marking as well as the corresponding obligations of the economic operators with regard to batteries are now set forth in detail in the Regulation.

In the future, economic operators of batteries whose turnover is at least €40 million will have to fulfil certain due diligence obligations, e.g. with regard to the raw materials used for the batteries (Article 47 ff.).

This will include, for example, the introduction of a risk management system and the disclosure of information.

An independent notified body will be responsible for verifying that producers fulfil their obligations.

The area of (extended) producer responsibility, which is familiar from the Battery Act and the registration, collection and recycling obligations contained therein, is also regulated in greater detail (Article 54 ff.).

In some cases, national legislation will continue to be required with regard to implementation."
Noerr,New EU Battery Regulation published in the Official Journal ‒ important rules for the growing battery market,"In some cases, national legislation will continue to be required with regard to implementation.

It can be assumed that the German foundation that maintains a record of all electronic equipment placed on the market (stiftung ear) will continue to be responsible for performing this task.

In addition, the mandatory collection targets for portable batteries will be gradually increased (Article 59).

The Regulation also introduces collection targets for LMT batteries (Article 60).

The recycling and recovery targets for certain raw materials are also being gradually increased (see Annex XII).

Finally, as from 2027, each LMT battery, each industrial battery with a capacity greater than 2 kWh and each electric vehicle battery will have to have a battery passport (Article 77 ff.).

This will, for example, have to contain information relating to the battery model so as to enable tracing.

From the consumer’s point of view – and consequently also for all producers and distributors – the provisions in Article 11 are likely to be the most interesting: Thus, beginning in 2027, end-users will have to be able to remove and replace all portable batteries installed in appliances, such as mobile phone batteries.

These brief highlights show that all market players in the battery industry will face new, far-reaching obligations as a result of the new Battery Regulation.

For the companies concerned, this means that they should carefully review their existing processes, production and procurement in order to be adequately prepared for the new European battery law."
Noerr,Binding EU rules for recharging points and hydrogen refuelling stations ‒ Council adopts the AFIR,"On 25 July 2023, the Council of the European Union adopted the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), thereby concluding the European Union’s long legislative process in relation to the Regulation.

The AFIR replaces the 2014 Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Development Directive (AFID), which was implemented in Germany through the Charging Points Ordinance (Ladesäulenverordnung).

One of the AFIR’s main goals is to promote the establishment of charging stations for electric vehicles and refuelling stations for alternative fuels in Europe’s cities and along the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) in the future.

As part of the Green Deal, the AFIR is one of the measures to achieve the EU’s goal of reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 as compared to 1990 levels and becoming climate neutral by 2050 (“Fit for 55”).

Alternative fuels as defined by the AFIR include electricity, hydrogen, gas (LNG and LPG) and biofuels.

Besides the installation of charging stations for passenger cars and light and heavy-duty vehicles, seaports and airports are also to be better supplied with electricity and hydrogen refuelling points will be established.

In addition, the AFIR contains numerous important new requirements for the operators and users of the infrastructure facilities.

The AFIR will enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Unless any special provisions have been made, it will in principle apply six months from the date of its entry into force.

Regulatory framework for recharging points Articles 3 and 4 of the AFIR contain detailed deployment targets for recharging infrastructure that are binding on Member States.

These requirements partly specify the objectives of the German Fast Recharging Act (Schnellladegesetz).

It remains to be seen whether the rollout of the recharging infrastructure, which is being driven forward by award procedures for the “Germany Network” set forth in the German Fast Recharging Act, will also be able to implement the European targets.

As regards everyday practice, the requirements in Article 5 of the AFIR for the operation of publicly accessible recharging infrastructure will be particularly important.

They will largely replace the German Charging Points Ordinance and section 14 of the German Price Indication Ordinance (Preisangabenverordnung) in the future.

The requirements in Article 5(1) of the AFIR on ad-hoc charging go beyond the current provisions in section 4 of the Charging Points Ordinance.

In the future, it will be possible to recharge on an ad-hoc basis throughout the EU using a payment instrument that is widely used in the EU.

Operators of newly established recharging points with a power output below 50 kWh will, as from the date the Regulation takes effect, have to provide payment card readers, devices with a contactless functionality that is at least able to read payment cards or a specific Quick Response (QR) Code as electronic means of payment.

Operators of recharging points with a power output equal to or more than 50 kW that are located along the TEN-T road network in safe and secure parking areas will have to be equipped with payment card readers or devices with a contactless functionality that is at least able to read payment cards.

A QR code, which is an electronic means of payment, will not be sufficient for these recharging points.

These payment method obligations will also apply as from 1 January 2027 to infrastructure with a power output equal to or more than 50 kW that was established before the AFIR came into force.

Articles 5(10) and 21 of the AFIR in conjunction with Annex II No. 1 contain technical requirements that will replace section 3 of the Recharging Station Ordinance, but do not set forth any new content requirements.

Further requirements for operators of recharging points can be found in Article 5(4) of the AFIR."
Noerr,Binding EU rules for recharging points and hydrogen refuelling stations ‒ Council adopts the AFIR,"Further requirements for operators of recharging points can be found in Article 5(4) of the AFIR.

It sets out the requirements for how prices must be displayed at all publicly accessible recharging points established after the date the AFIR enters into force and will replace section 14(2) to (4) of the Price Indication Ordinance in this regard.

Unlike German law, the AFIR requirements distinguish between recharging points with a power output equal to or more than 50 kW and those with a lower power output, both in terms of how price components are displayed and which ones must be displayed.

Furthermore, Article 5(3) and (5) also lay down rules for mobility service providers (EMSPs) for the first time.

Charging point operators (CPOs) are not permitted to discriminate between the prices charged to mobility service providers and the prices charged to end users nor between prices charged to different mobility service providers.

As is the case with CPOs, EMSPs must also be transparent with regard to their prices for end customers.

Member States are required to ensure that these regulations are complied with and that potentially unfair business practices are monitored (cf.

Art.

5(6) AFIR).

Requirements for hydrogen refuelling stations The AFIR sets targets for the build-up of the hydrogen network that must be met by 31 December 2030.

This is because hydrogen-powered vehicles still have a low market penetration rate.

To the extent that there are any existing hydrogen refuelling points in the Member States, these are largely unsuitable for heavy-duty vehicles.

Accordingly, a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is to be deployed across the TEN-T core network to allow for the seamless travel of hydrogen-fuelled passenger vehicles and light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles throughout the Union.

Publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling stations with a cumulative capacity of at least 1 t/day and equipped with at least one 700 bar dispenser for liquid hydrogen are to be deployed along the TEN-T core network.

These refuelling stations may only have a maximum distance of 200 km in-between them.

As a rule, hydrogen-powered vehicles are to be able to refuel in urban areas and thus refuelling stations are to be available at urban nodes.

Consequently, at least one publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling station must be put in place at every urban node by the end of 2030 (see Article 6(1) of the AFIR).

In addition, hydrogen refuelling stations must be designed with a cumulative capacity of at least 1 t/day.

It can be assumed for now that market-penetration of hydrogen vehicles in the short term will be possible primarily in the heavy-duty vehicle segment.

Nonetheless, the AFIR requirements are intended to allow passenger cars and light-duty vehicles to be refuelled with hydrogen already now.

Moreover, Article 7 of the AFIR also contains further provisions for ensuring the user-friendliness of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, including through minimum requirements on payment options, price transparency and contractual choice.

These provisions are similar to those for charging point infrastructure.

Article 21 of the AFIR in conjunction with Annex II No. 3 of the AFIR also lay down technical specifications for the dispensers and the quality of the hydrogen.

Requirements for the provision of data Finally, another important new provision is found in Article 20 of the AFIR.

This Article contains requirements for the provision of data as these play a “fundamental role in the adequate functioning of recharging and refuelling infrastructure” (recital 69).

For example, Member States are to appoint an Identification Registration Organisation (“IDRO”), which will be able to identify operators of recharging points and mobility service providers using a unique identification code (“ID”) (see Article 20(1) of the AFIR)."
Noerr,Binding EU rules for recharging points and hydrogen refuelling stations ‒ Council adopts the AFIR,"Energie Codes & Service GmbH, a private company belonging to the German Association of Energy and Water Industries ( Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft ‒ BDEW), is currently responsible for carrying out this task in Germany.

It was hired by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs to perform this work.

In the future, operators of publicly accessible charging points and refuelling points for alternative fuels will have to provide more detailed static and dynamic data on the infrastructure they operate or the associated services at no cost.

Static data includes things such as the geographic location of the recharging or refuelling points for alternative fuels, the number of connectors, operating hours, maximum power output of the charging station/point and type of current (see Article 20(2) of the AFIR).

Dynamic data includes the operational status, availability, ad hoc price and the origin of the electricity from renewable sources.

Finally, Member States must ensure by 31 December 2024 that data is made available to all data users, such as customers or EMSPs, on an open and non-discriminatory basis (Article 20(4) of the AFIR).

Conclusion The AFIR creates important, uniform rules throughout Europe.

Whether these will have the desired effect on the continued expansion of electromobility will ultimately depend also on whether the provisions in Article 5(4) and (5) of the AFIR are interpreted and applied in a manner that makes them suitable for use in practice.

In the end, to encourage a large number of people to transition to electric vehicles in the coming years, a widespread, customer-friendly, and consequently affordable recharging infrastructure will be needed."
Noerr,EU Proposals for a Revised Legal Framework for Payment Services (PSD3) and Financial Data Access (FIDA) Published,"Numerous technological innovations and new types of services have significantly changed the market.

The EU Commission is now responding to these developments as well with a proposal to adapt the regulatory framework for payment services (“ Legislative Proposal ”) as currently laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (” PSD2 ”).

The Commission concludes that although the PSD2 has led to significant improvements in the payment services sector since its entry into force, in some areas its objectives have not fully been achieved.

In particular, the following shortcomings have been identified: consumers remain exposed to fraud risks (especially social engineering fraud) and show a lack of trust in the integrity of payment transactions despite the implementation of strong customer authentication (“ SCA ”); market barriers in the open banking sector, especially inadequate interfaces for data exchange; regulators have insufficient powers and the implementation of PSD2 varies among Member States; and unequal opportunities for banks and other payment service providers, especially regarding access to payment systems.

In order to address these shortcomings, the Legislative Proposal not only provides for a revised payment services directive (” Draft PSD3 ”, available here ), but also for a payment services regulation (“ Draft PSR ”, available here ) which will be directly applicable in the Member States.

While the requirements for the licensing of payment institutions will be contained in the Draft PSD3 and thus as before in a directive to be implemented by the Member States, all other requirements for the provision of payment services are to be regulated in the Draft PSR and thus in a regulation which applies uniformly throughout the EU.

Simultaneously, the Commission has presented a proposal for a regulation on a framework for financial data access (Financial Data Access Regulation, ” Draft FIDA ”, available here ), which extends access to certain account data introduced with the PSD2 (“open banking”) to a range of other financial data (“open finance”).

In the following, we provide an overview of the main changes envisaged by the Legislative Proposal compared to the existing legal framework for payment services, and outline the main features of the Draft FIDA.

Integration of the Regulatory Frameworks for Payment Services and E-Money As the requirements for payment and e-money institutions are already largely congruent, the Legislative Proposal widely removes the systematic distinction between payment and e-money services.

Accordingly, a separate e-money directive shall no longer be required in the future.

This approach stems from the fact that the boundaries between both types of services are increasingly blurred, not least due to the development of innovative products which cannot always satisfactorily be assigned to one of the two areas.

Only as regards features specific to e-money, such as capital requirements or the issuing or the redeeming of e-money, separate provisions shall remain.

Both payment service providers and e‑money institutions will have to submit a processing plan with their licence application (Art. 3(3)(s) Draft PSD3).

As a further consequence of harmonisation (and concurrently of an adjustment for inflation), capital requirements for non-bank payment service providers will be increased ( cf.

Art. 5 et seqq.

Draft PSD3).

In contrast to the current provision in Art. 9 PSD2, capital requirements for payment service providers which do not provide e-money services shall in the future generally be calculated using ”Method B”, which is linked to the total volume of payment transactions (Art. 7(2) Draft PSD3).

As part of the harmonisation, basic definitions will also be supplemented or rephrased, such as “payment account”, “payment instrument” or “funds”."
Noerr,EU Proposals for a Revised Legal Framework for Payment Services (PSD3) and Financial Data Access (FIDA) Published,"As part of the harmonisation, basic definitions will also be supplemented or rephrased, such as “payment account”, “payment instrument” or “funds”.

Furthermore, it is clarified that in accordance with the requirements of the recently adopted MiCA Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on markets for crypto assets – see our Newsletter ) e-money tokens shall also be classified as e-money.

Strengthening of Anti-Fraud Measures In response to new fraud methods since entry into force of the PSD2, more efficient anti-fraud measures shall be taken.

The Commission is focusing in particular on the types of fraud known as “spoofing”, i.e. the pretence of a trusted identity by a fraudster (especially by claiming an affiliation with the customer’s payment service provider), and social engineering fraud, i.e. a manipulation of the victim in order to induce them to make payments or disclose account information.

In the future, for all transfers in Euro it shall be mandatory for payment service providers to verify that the IBAN and the name of the recipient account holder match, and to inform the payer of any discrepancies before initiating the payment transaction ( cf.

Art. 50 Draft PSR).

In general, there are stricter requirements for transaction monitoring ( cf.

Art. 83 and 88 Draft PSR).

Payment service providers shall also be given the opportunity to exchange fraud-related information amongst each other in compliance with the GDPR (Art. 83 Draft PSR).

Payment service providers shall further to be obliged to train their employees on fraud methods and to inform their customers accordingly (Art. 84 Draft PSR).

The above provisions will be bolstered by planned changes to the provisions regarding strong customer authentication ( cf.

Art. 85 et seqq.

Draft PSR).

Especially, its areas of application shall be more clearly defined.

In order to simplify the handling of SCA in the context of payment account information services, SCA shall only be required for the first access to payment account data, thereafter only if there are grounds for suspected fraud (Art. 86(3) Draft PSR).

In the context of digital passthrough wallets, an SCA shall be performed when a payment instrument is first registered in the wallet.

A planned obligation for payment service providers to conclude a respective outsourcing agreement with the wallet operator is intended to ensure that payment service providers are liable for possible authentication defects.

In addition, payment service providers shall ensure that all customers have access to a selection of SCA methods which are not all subject to the same technical requirements ( e.g. possession of a smartphone, cf.

Art. 88 Draft PSR).

These additional provisions on fraud prevention are accompanied by an expansion of consumers’ compensation rights in the event of fraud: consumers shall receive full compensation if the payment service provider has failed to correctly check the IBAN of the payee against their name, or has failed to notify the payer of a discrepancy (Art. 57 Draft PSR).

Spoofing victims shall also to be entitled to full compensation from payment service providers, provided that they have reported the fraud to the police and have informed the payment service provider without undue delay.

No right to compensation shall exist if the payer was grossly negligent; however, the payment service provider bears the burden of proof in this regard (Art. 59 Draft PSR).

Strengthening of the Rights of Non-Bank Payment Service Providers In order to reduce entry barriers for non-bank payment service providers and thereby promote competition between banks and other payment service providers, banks shall only be allowed to reject applications by payment service providers to open a payment account under strict conditions ( e.g. in case of serious grounds to suspect defective money laundering or terrorism financing controls, or in case of an excessive risk profile)."
Noerr,EU Proposals for a Revised Legal Framework for Payment Services (PSD3) and Financial Data Access (FIDA) Published,"In particular, banks shall be required to disclose the reasons for refusal to the payment service provider, which shall be able to appeal to the competent supervisory authorities (Art. 32 Draft PSR).

The provisions regarding the admission of payment institutions as participants in payment systems are also to become more transparent in the future and shall leave less room for discrimination (Art. 31 Draft PSR).

The access requirements established by the Finality Directive (Directive 98/26/EC) shall in effect thus be transferred to non-bank payment service providers.

Lowering of the Entry Barriers to Open Banking The entry barriers for service providers in the area of open banking shall also be lowered.

Account servicing payment service providers providing payment accounts with online access functionality shall be required to provide dedicated data interfaces ( cf.

Art. 35 et seqq.

Draft PSR) which account information services providers and payment initiation service providers can use to access any required data.

On the other hand, the obligation to provide fall-back interfaces in case of malfunction shall fall away.

Instead, account servicing payment service providers shall be obliged to offer alternative solutions in case of malfunction of the interface and, if necessary, provide access to the interfaces they themselves use vis-à-vis their customers (Art. 38(2)(f) Draft PSR).

In order to ensure that customers have a transparent overview of any granted access permissions, account servicing payment service providers shall provide their customers with access to a dashboard containing a summary of the granted data access rights, including the name of the beneficiary, and allowing customers to revoke or re-establish individual permissions (Art. 43 Draft PSR).

Increased Consumer Protection Also beyond the areas already mentioned, further measures shall be taken to strengthen consumer protection.

For example, in the context of credit transfers and money remittance transactions payment service providers shall be required to state currency conversion fees as a percentage mark-up over the latest available applicable foreign exchange rates issued by the relevant central bank (Art. 13(1)(f) Draft PSR).

To increase transparency, on account statements the payees’ commercial trade names shall be shown (Art. 25(1)(a) Draft PSR).

Additional information obligations ( e.g. regarding fees for the use of domestic ATMs of other networks) are laid out in Art. 20 Draft PSR.

Strengthening of the Powers of Supervisory Authorities In order to strengthen the powers of supervisory authorities, among other measures additional investigative powers vis-à-vis technical service providers, operators of payment schemes and outsourcing companies are envisaged.

Pursuant to Art. 97 Draft PSR, violations of the provisions regarding the opening of payment accounts for payment service providers pursuant to Art. 32 Draft PSR or the provisions on fraud prevention shall be sanctioned with maximum administrative fines of at least 10 % of the annual turnover in the case of legal persons, and in the case of natural persons with maximum administrative fines of at least EUR 5 million.

In the interest of consumer protection, the EBA shall be granted wide-reaching powers of intervention, including the power to prohibit individual types of payment services if the national supervisory authorities fail to act ( cf.

Art. 104 Draft PSR).

Increased Availability of Cash Finally, in order to increase the availability of cash the Legislative Proposal provides that  retail businesses shall be allowed to dispense cash to customers even without a previous purchase by the customers.

However, in order to limit competition with ATMs a maximum amount of EUR 50 per payment is envisaged.

Framework for Financial Data Access (Draft FIDA)"
Noerr,EU Proposals for a Revised Legal Framework for Payment Services (PSD3) and Financial Data Access (FIDA) Published,"However, in order to limit competition with ATMs a maximum amount of EUR 50 per payment is envisaged.

Framework for Financial Data Access (Draft FIDA)

The proposal for a regulation on a framework for financial data access provides for uniform rules on access to customer data for a range of financial services.

This is intended to supplement the account access rights introduced by PSD2 (“open banking”) with further access rights (“open finance”).

Systematically, payment account data shall continue to be subject to the regulatory regime for payment services ( i.e. in future the PSR), while access to data in connection with other financial services is to be regulated by the Draft FIDA.

The aim of the Draft FIDA is to enable customers to effectively control the use of their financial data.

The Draft FIDA is intended to apply to financial data which financial institutions process and store in the normal course of their business with customers, regardless of whether the customers are consumers or entrepreneurs.

However, financial data for the credit assessment of consumers as well as for life, health and medical insurance shall be excluded.

Customers shall be given a right to direct electronic access to data that financial institutions have stored about them.

Furthermore, customers shall be given the right to grant other service providers access to this data.

However, these other service providers must be licensed as financial institutions or regulated as financial services information providers.

While customers shall be able to access their data free of charge, it is planned to allow financial institutions to charge other service providers for data access granted by customers.

In order to create transparency for customers also in this regard, financial institutions shall maintain dashboards (similar to those envisaged under the Draft PSR) containing information on any granted data access permissions and enabling customers to easily revoke such permissions.

Outlook The Legislative Proposal submitted by the Commission and the Draft FIDA will now undergo the further legislative process which may well last into 2025.

It is envisaged that the PSR shall take legal effect 18 months after its entry into force (with 24 months, the implementation period for name verification is even longer).

The entry into force of the PSD3 will insofar be synchronised with the PSR in that the Member States will have 18 months to transpose it into national law.

This time is likely to be necessary to adapt the national laws to the new requirements.

In Germany, this applies in particular to the civil law aspects of payment services, regulated in Sect. 675c et seqq.

German Civil Code (BGB) and in the Introductory Act to the German Civil Code (EGBGB).

It is currently envisaged that in large parts FIDA will not take legal effect until 24 months after its entry into force.

For payment service providers, it would seem advisable to tackle the upcoming changes at an early stage and to review the effects on their own business model or business organisation.

This applies both with regard to the economic consequences of the necessary changes to their business model and with regard to the analysis of further legal details.

As an example, although licences already granted for the provision of payment services or the e-money business do not automatically lapse when the new regulations enter into force, licensed financial services providers will have to document vis-à-vis the competent supervisory authorities that they also meet the amended licensing requirements (Art. 44(1) Draft PSD3).

In particular FIDA will provide room for innovative business models.

It will be intriguing to observe how the market for data on financial services evolves.

The drawback is, however, that the financial institutions which possess the relevant data will have to expect additional organisational efforts in order to be able to ensure the provision of such data."
Noerr,EU Proposals for a Revised Legal Framework for Payment Services (PSD3) and Financial Data Access (FIDA) Published,"In any case, it is evident that payment services regulations will continue to be a dynamic and innovative area of law.

The Draft PSR clearly paves the way to greater harmonisation within the EU.

The innovations envisaged by the Draft FIDA in relation to open finance also demonstrate that payment services regulations, which years ago introduced open banking via the PSD2, remain a strong driver of innovation in the financial sector."
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft letter on anti-hybrid rules (§ 4k EStG),"On 13 July 2023, the German Federal Ministry of Finance ("" BMF "") published a draft letter on the so-called anti-hybrid rules of § 4k of the German Income Tax Act ("" EStG "") and sent it to the lobby groups for comments ("" Draft "").

The Draft is available here .

I. Introduction § 4k EStG was introduced by the Act Implementing the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive ( ATAD-Umsetzungsgesetz - ATADUmsG ), in principle with effect after 31 December 2019.

The purpose of the provision is to deny the deductibility of expenses in Germany to the extent that the resulting income is not taxed or is taxed at a low rate or deductions are made twice due to a hybrid mismatch (so-called deduction/non-inclusion, double deduction, imported mismatch).

The basic problem with the provision is that its application essentially depends on the tax treatment of the income and expenses in question abroad, so that determining and proving these foreign tax consequences is critical.

With the Draft, the tax authorities are now commenting for the first time on questions of interpretation and doubt.

The Draft is rather descriptive and mostly only covers the basic structures with examples.

It does not contain a complete overview of all issues relevant in practice, but this is difficult to achieve.

In the following, we outline the most important statements of the Draft, which is more than 50 pages long (with reference to the marginal notes of the Draft).

II.

General Aspects Important general statements are: Implementation of ATAD : The Draft emphasizes that § 4k EStG serves to implement art. 9 and 9b of ATAD (see mn. 1 et seq.).

Without explicitly addressing it, we believe that this also means that, as a matter of principle, an interpretation in conformity with ATAD has to be applied.

Temporal scope of application : With regard to the temporal scope of application pursuant to § 52 (8c) EStG, the Draft differentiates between expenses from continuing obligations and other expenses (see mn. 3 et seq.).

Expenses from continuing obligations are generally covered by § 4k EStG from 1 January 2020, even if the underlying contract was concluded before this date.

According to the Draft, an exception shall only apply if the continuing obligation could not have been terminated without significant disadvantages.

With these statements, the BMF reverses the rule-exception relationship provided for in § 52 (8c) sentence 2 EStG.

In our view, however, the burden of proof remains with the tax authorities (see mn. 119).

In the case of other expenses, on the other hand, there shall be no deduction prohibition if the expenses were legally incurred before 1 January 2020, even if the reduction in income does not occur until after 31 December 2019.

The potential constitutional issues of an inadmissible retrospective effect are not addressed though.

Personal scope of application : § 4k EStG is applicable to both business and private income (§ 9 (5) sentence 2 EStG).

The personal scope of application relates to situations between related parties, between companies and their permanent establishments located in other countries and in the context of structured arrangements (§ 4k (6) sentence 1 EStG).

The Draft defines and explains the relevant terms (see mn. 7 et seq.).

Tax incongruence : In mn. 12 et seq.

the Draft does not conclusively explain the concepts of taxation mismatches in the forms of deduction/non-inclusion (D/NI mismatch), double deduction (DD mismatch), imported mismatch and hybrid elements including sub-forms.

III.

§ 4k (1) EStG

The deduction prohibition of paragraph 1 relates to certain expenses in connection with financial instruments whose income is not taxed or is taxed at a lower rate due to a taxation mismatch pertaining to hybrid financial instruments (i.e. qualification conflicts) and to hybrid transfers (i.e. attribution conflicts) (see mn. 19).

The following statements are made in the Draft:"
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft letter on anti-hybrid rules (§ 4k EStG),"The following statements are made in the Draft:

Capital assets : For the concept of capital assets, the Draft refers to the identical concept of § 20 EStG (without taking into account § 20 (8) EStG and § 8 (2) of the German Corporate Income Tax Act ("" KStG ""); see mn. 20).

The concept of expenses for the use of capital assets are to be understood accordingly (including accruals, i.e. an effective payment is not required); fees as well as compensation payments in the case of securities loans and repo transactions are to be considered as expenses in connection with the transfer of capital assets (these payments would generally be encompassed in § 22 no. 3 EStG, not in § 20 EStG; see mn. 21 et seq.).

The concepts are thus broader than, for example, those of the interest barrier under § 4h EStG.

Non-inclusion : the Draft contains important statements on the concepts of non-taxation and low-taxation: Non-taxation occurs if the income corresponding to the expenses is not included in a taxable base.

According to the legislative reasoning, also the inclusion under Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules constitutes taxation in this sense (cf. BT-Drs.

19/28652,  35).

In our view, this applies accordingly to an inclusion under special CFC rules such as US Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).

However, a specific statement from the BMF on this would be desirable.

On the other hand, there is no non-taxation if, for example, there is no actual tax payment after offsetting against negative income, deduction of loss carry forwards, consideration of a basic allowance or alike, or crediting or deduction of foreign taxes (see mn. 27 et seq.).

Low-taxation of the income corresponding to the expenses is deemed to exist if this income is subject to a lower effective tax burden abroad than that which would result if the capital assets were qualified or attributed in accordance with German law.

The extent of the lower taxation should thus result from the difference between the actual taxation of the income abroad and the hypothetical taxation of the income abroad if the capital assets were qualified or attributed in accordance with German law (see mn. 30).

Causality :

The Draft's emphasis on the causality between the taxation incongruence and the non-taxation or low-taxation.

On this basis, § 4k (1) EStG can only be applied if a qualification or attribution conflict, alone - or together with another qualification and attribution conflict - is causal for the relevant taxation incongruence; other causes for non-/low-taxation – such as, for example, a personal tax exemption of the recipient of the income and, in our view a tax exemption with regard to an inclusion pursuant to the application of CFC rules – exclude the application of § 4k (1) EStG (see mn. 26).

This also corresponds to an interpretation in conformity with ATAD (cf. art. 

2 (9) subpara. 

3 (e) sentence 2 ATAD).

IV.

§ 4k (2) EStG

The deduction prohibition of paragraph 2 relates to expenses in the case of a different tax treatment of a taxpayer as well as in the case of a different tax qualification of assumed debt relationships; this regularly concerns D/NI incongruencies.

Important statements of the Draft are: Expenses : The BMF clarifies that the term ""expenses"" is not limited to payments but covers expenses of all kinds (including accruals and depreciations) (see mn. 38 et seq.).

Somewhat irritating is the statement that ""expenses for the acquisition (e.g. purchase price payment)"" are also considered expenses (see mn. 39) - however, the legal consequence in this case seem to be limited to the actual reduction of the profit (see mn. 51).

In the case of such acquisition transactions, all expenses recorded by the purchaser are taken into account by the seller as ""corresponding income""."
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft letter on anti-hybrid rules (§ 4k EStG),"In the case of such acquisition transactions, all expenses recorded by the purchaser are taken into account by the seller as ""corresponding income"".

What the BMF means is that the proceeds from the sale are considered and therefore in particular no distinction is to be made for the prohibition of deduction according to whether or to what extent the seller does not pay tax on a capital gain (see mn. 41 in conjunction with example in mn. 63).

Deviating tax treatment : The concepts of a deviating tax treatment of a taxpayer or of an assumed debt relationships are explained and provided with examples in mn. 42 et seq.

Causality : Here, the Draft again emphasizes the requirement of sole causality (""solely causal"") between the mismatch and the non-taxation (for § 4k (2) EStG, in principle, are low-taxation is not relevant; see mn. 49); however, it should be noted for § 4k (2) EStG that the BMF also extends causality to the treatment in other countries than that of the direct recipient of the income (see mn. 47).

Double-considered income : With regard to the exception for double-considered income under § 4k (2) sentence 3 EStG, there is discussion in particular as to the level at which the income must accrue in order to be considered income of the same taxpayer.

In line with the legislative reasoning (cf. BT-Drs.

19/28652, p. 37), a tax group parent can also benefit from § 4k (2) sentence 3 EStG with respect to income attributed as income by tax group subsidiaries, provided that this income is also recognized abroad (see mn. 52).

The income does not have to be related to the double-considered expenses.

However, a double consideration/taxation requires, in addition to a domestic taxation, additional taxation in the country of the recipient, the partner (if the recipient is a partnership) or the other part of the enterprise (see mn. 53, also on a ""carry-back"" of income).

V. § 4k (3) EStG

The deduction prohibition of paragraph 3 relates to expenses whose income is not taxed due to a D/NI incongruence not already covered by paragraph 2.

This covers, among other things, payments to reverse hybrid entities and allocation conflicts in the case of permanent establishments (including disregarded permanent establishments) (see mn. 63 et seq.).

Noteworthy in this context is the complicated example 13, which deals with the coexistence of § 4k (2) and (3) EStG and arrives to the conclusion that an indirect tax incongruence in the context of the application of CFC rules can be a reason for the application of § 4k (3) EStG (see mn. 67 et seq.).

VI.

§ 4k (4) EStG

The deduction prohibition of paragraph 4 neutralizes DD incongruencies resulting from the double deduction of expenses, once in the domestic country and in at least one foreign country, without the need for a hybrid element.

The expenses in another country do not have to be taken into account by the entity to be regarded as the taxpayer in Germany, but can also be taken into account by another entity.

A double deductions presupposes a reduction of the taxable base (also an increase of a loss carry forward without taking into account local offsetting restrictions is encompassed), whereby also a reduction in the context of CFC rules shall be encompassed (but not the application of a negative progression proviso; see mn. 74).

With regard to the double-considered income, reference is being made to the comments on paragraph 2 (see mn. 83 et seq.).

VII.

§ 4k (5) EStG For imported mismatches, paragraph 5 provides for a deduction prohibition to the extent that the mismatch was not already eliminated by the paragraphs 1 to 4.

Important statements of the BMF in this regard are: Linkage :

In this respect, the Draft states that the income resulting directly and indirectly from the expenses is income that arises from legal/tax relationships, without it being important that there is a uniform cause or economic connection."
Noerr,Federal Ministry of Finance publishes draft letter on anti-hybrid rules (§ 4k EStG),"For example, the domestic expenses may be rental expenses, while the direct or indirect recipient pays e.g. - possibly harmful - royalty expenses to an indirect recipient (see mn. 94).

Such income is ""offset"" by expenses if it is abstractly possible to offset the respective expenses against the income (see mn. 96).

Sequence of examination : In the opinion of the BMF, a certain sequence must be observed when examining expenses in multi-level chains.

A hypothetical application of the paragraphs 1 to 4 must be carried out step by step from the direct recipient of income of the German taxpayer through the chain of indirect recipients (see mn. 103).

Double disallowance : If both Germany and another country deny a deduction of expenses at the same level under the rules for imported mismatches, the Draft provides for a pro rata application of the deduction prohibition (see mn. 115 et seq.).

VIII.

Burden of proof As already indicated above, the determination and proof of foreign taxation consequences within the scope of § 4k EStG is of central importance.

Regarding the burden of proof, the BMF refers to the general principles.

Since the deduction prohibition is a tax-increasing fact, the burden of proof lies with the tax authorities; however, the taxpayer has an increased duty to cooperate pursuant to § 90 (2) of the German General Tax Code ("" AO "") (see mn. 119).

The Draft mentions, among other things, accounting documents of the legal entities involved and rulings from foreign tax authorities on specific cases as possible information to be submitted; purely abstract descriptions of the foreign legal situation, on the other hand, are generally not regarded to be sufficient (see mn. 121).

For the exceptions of § 4k EStG, in particular for a double-considered income, the taxpayer bears the burden of proof and must take precautions to provide evidence (see mn. 122 et seq.).

Against the background of the strict requirements, a de facto reversal of the burden of proof may occur."
Noerr,BaFin notice on insurance brokerage by group insurance policy­holders,"In its judgment of 29 September 2022 (C-633/20) the CJEU ruled that legal persons whose activities consist of offering customers voluntary membership in return for a fee in a group insurance policy, the legal person took out previously from an insurance company, can be regarded as insurance brokers.

In response to the CJEU’s judgment, the German financial regulator BaFin ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht ) published a regulatory notice together with the German Chamber of Commerce (IHK) on 4 July 2023.

In the regulatory notice, BaFin and IHK examine specific cases in which the policyholder of a group insurance policy is to be classified as an insurance broker.

The CJEU judgement Previously, it was the understanding of both BaFin and IHK that the policyholder of a group insurance policy could not be an insurance broker at the same time.

It was argued that in a true group insurance structure there is only one uniform insurance contract and no individual contract is entered into between the various insured persons and the insurer.

The CJEU now ruled that the policyholder of a group insurance policy acts as an insurance broker if the following criteria are met cumulatively: The policyholder must receive a fee or pursue an own financial interest.

Membership of the group insurance contract must be voluntary for the customers.

The insured persons must have the right to claim insurance benefits from the insurance company.

Regulatory notice from BaFin and IHK

The CJEU ruling relates to all group insurance contracts, existing ones as well as new ones.

In principle, according to BaFin and IHK the policyholder of a group insurance contract conducts insurance brokerage activities if the customer is offered to join the group insurance policy voluntarily and the business model is focused on generating profit.

By contrast, there is deemed to be no insurance brokerage by the policyholder of a group insurance contract if the policyholder does not receive a fee (criterion of consideration) or joining the group insurance policy is not up to the discretion of the insured person (criterion of voluntariness).

Consideration

In the view of BaFin and IHK, the criterion of consideration is met if the financial interest is the primary focus and if it is the policyholder´s intention to make a profit.

Pure reimbursement of expenses is not regarded as a fee.

To determine whether the group insurance policyholder does have a financial interest, it is key to consider whether brokering insurance coverage is the main purpose of the activity or merely a subsidiary purpose.

For example, in the view of BaFin and IHK, the criterion of consideration is met if a rental car company is acting as the policyholder of a group insurance contract offering passenger accident insurance and the rental car company receives a fee for every party joining the policy.

By contrast, no consideration exists if for example an employer takes out incapacity insurance for its employees in the form of a group insurance policy and the employer only receives the actual expenses as reimbursement but not part of the premiums.

In that case the employer has no personal financial interest in the employee joining the group insurance and is therefore not an insurance broker in the eyes of BaFin and IHK.

The argument that a financial interest may lie in being a more attractive employer must be rejected given that the brokering of insurance only represents a subsidiary purpose in that case.

Voluntariness BaFin and IHK assess the voluntary nature of membership in the group insurance contract according to whether the insurance is compulsory or whether membership in the group insurance contract is automatic, for example through a provision in the statute of an association.

In those cases, joining the group insurance is not voluntary."
Noerr,BaFin notice on insurance brokerage by group insurance policy­holders,"In those cases, joining the group insurance is not voluntary.

If, for example, a compulsory insurance policy for notaries is designed as a genuine group insurance policy, the criterion of voluntariness is not met, so that the Chamber of Notaries, being the policyholder, is not an insurance broker in the view of BaFin and IHK.

The same applies to associations that automatically add new members to e.g. a legal expenses insurance policy.

On the other hand, if, for example, an optical store offers customers the opportunity to join a group insurance contract for glass breakage when buying glasses the customers join the group insurance contract on a voluntary basis.

This applies equally to the previously mentioned passenger accident insurance offered in connection with a rental car.

Insured parties’ rights As a third criterion, BaFin and IHK state that the insured persons must have the right to claim insurance benefits from the insurance company.

No further details are given, though.

This requirement is usually fulfilled in the case of group insurance policies, if only because of the basic legal concept in section 44 para. 

1 sentence 1 of the German Insurance Contracts Act ( Versicherungsvertragsgesetz ).

Recommendation Policyholders of a group insurance policy should thoroughly check whether the requirements set out by the CJEU apply to their business.

If so, the next question is whether the policyholder requires a licence according to section 34d of the German Trade Regulation ( Gewerbeordnung ) or whether one of the exemptions from the licensing requirement applies.

The regulatory notice from BaFin and IHK provides for some guidance but in the end the assessment will depend on the individual case."
Noerr,European Court of Justice backs up European Commission’s tough approach to EU merger control enforcement,"On 13 July 2023, the European Court of Justice (“ ECJ ”) delivered a landmark decision in relation to EU merger control (Case C-376/20 P).

It is the first time that the highest court of the European Union has dealt with the interpretation of the substantive merger control test – “significant impediment to effective competition” (“ SIEC ”) – as applied to non-coordinated effects in oligopolistic markets.

The Judgment settles the dust on the interpretation of important concepts of the substantive test, the framework for the assessment of efficiencies and the applicable standard of proof pursuant to the European Merger Regulation (“ EUMR ”).

Background In 2016, the European Commission (“ Commission ”) blocked the contemplated acquisition of Telefónica Europe Plc (O2) by CK Telecoms (Hutchison/Three) (Case M.7612) which would have reduced the number of mobile network operators on the UK market from four to three.

With a remarkable judgment of 28 May 2020 (Case T-399/16), the General Court of the European Union (“ GC ”) had annulled the Commission’s prohibition decision – shaking the very foundations of EU merger control enforcement (see our analysis here ).

Given the central issues at stake, it was not surprising that the Commission appealed the GC’s decision.

Judgment The ECJ – sitting as Grand Chamber which highlights the exceptional importance of the case – quashed the preceding GC judgment with all clarity when it referred to “ the breadth, nature and scope of the errors made by the [GC], identified in the present judgment, which affect the [GC’s] reasoning as a whole ”.

Most notably: The GC applied the wrong standard of proof.

Unlike the GC held, the Commission is not required to demonstrate with a “strong probability” the existence of a significant impediment to effective competition.

The Commission only has to demonstrate by means of a sufficiently cogent and sufficient body of evidence that such an impediment is “more likely than not”.

The GC confused important concepts, which were applied to interpret the SIEC test, namely “elimination of an important competitive constraint” (recital 25 EUMR), “important competitive force” (para.

37 Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines), and “close competitor” (para.

28 Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines).

According to the EUMR, “ concentrations involving the elimination of important competitive constraints that the merging parties had exerted upon each other, as well as a reduction of competitive pressure on the remaining competitors, may, even in the absence of a likelihood of coordination between the members of the oligopoly, result in a significant impediment to effective competition ”.

The ECJ recalls the objective of the EUMR to establish effective control of all concentrations, including those giving rise to non-coordinated effects.

Unlike the GC held, the Commission is therefore not required to demonstrate cumulatively (i) the elimination of important competitive constraints that the merging parties had exerted upon each other and, (ii) the reduction of competitive pressure on the remaining competitor, to establish a significant impediment to effective competition.

The Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines recognize that a merger involving firms that have more of an influence on the competitive process than their market shares or similar measures would suggest, may significantly impede effective competition, in particular when the market is already concentrated.

The ECJ confirms this approach.

But unlike the GC held, the Commission is not required to demonstrate that an undertaking competed particularly aggressively – and certainly not only based on competition in terms of price – to classify it as an “important competitive force”."
Noerr,European Court of Justice backs up European Commission’s tough approach to EU merger control enforcement,"According to the Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, the higher the degree of substitutability between the merging firms' products (i. e., the closer competitors the merging firms are), the more likely it is that they will raise prices significantly and that the merger will significantly impede effective competition.

The ECJ confirms this approach.

However, unlike the GC held, it cannot be concluded that only a concentration between “particularly close competitors” could significantly impede effective competition.

The ECJ recalls that high pre-merger margins – which may indicate that the parties to the concentration are neither the closest competitors nor particularly close competitors – may also make significant price increases more likely.

Therefore, no general principle can be inferred from the Judgment as to how close competitors must be in order for a merger to lead to a significant impediment to effective competition.

Closeness of competition is only one of the factors relevant for the assessment.

The ECJ reiterates that these concepts are only some of the factors relevant for the substantive assessment of a transaction that should not be understood too formalistically.

Finally, the GC did not properly interpret the framework for the assessment of efficiencies.

The Commission is not required to always take “standard efficiencies” into account which may be specific to all concentrations.

The burden of proof to demonstrate the existence of all kinds of efficiencies is solely borne by the undertakings concerned.

Comment The preceding GC decision was a major setback for the Commission’s approach to the assessment of non-coordinated effects, as the GC dismissed key elements of the Commission’s own interpretation (and expansive application) of the SIEC test.

The standard of proof suggested by the GC was seen as unreasonably high making it too difficult for the Commission to block anti-competitive mergers.

The Judgment of the ECJ therefore can be seen as a win for the Commission as it reaffirms the previously settled state of the law, the ECJ’s case law and the Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines.

The GC will now have to take into account the clarifications provided by the ECJ in its new judgment.

While the ECJ’s clarifications are welcome (see, e.g ., the recent confusion about the applicable standard of proof which is also apparent from the different terminology applied by the GC in its thyssenkrupp judgment, Case T-584/19, para.

280), the importance of the Judgement follows from its counterfactual.

Any other decision would have had significant implications for the Commission’s case handling and the effectiveness of EU merger control enforcement as a whole.

The Judgment grants the Commission flexibility in the application of the concepts of the EUMR and in the assessment of a SIEC in oligopolistic markets without demanding a very high standard of proof.

The Judgment will likely give the Commission some comfort in challenging problematic mergers in the future.

At the same time, the Judgment does not raise the bar for judicial review.

The standard of review is not confined to manifest errors of assessment and the Commission is only granted a margin of discretion with regard to economic matters for the purpose of applying the substantive rules of the EUMR.

However, subsequent appeals will remain difficult.

CK Telecoms was only the sixth case in which the EU courts annulled a prohibition decision.

Potential appellants will take good note of the ECJ’s position."
Noerr,Constitutional concerns about planned framework law on nationalisation of housing companies,"On 28 June 2023, the commission presented its final report on the “Referendum on a Resolution on the Drafting of a Bill by the Berlin State Senate on Nationalising the Housing Stock of Large Housing Companies”.

In the report, the expert commission considers whether the nationalisation of housing companies with more than 3,000 residential units by the State of Berlin would be legally possible and how such a law could be designed.

The main content of the final report is presented below.

Based on the final report, the Berlin Senate plans to pass a framework law on nationalisation, which it would like to have reviewed by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court.

In order to be able to make a substantiated assessment of the constitutionality of a nationalisation framework law, the specific details of the law will need to be examined.

However, if its provisions are based on the material legal assumptions made by the Commission majority, it would be open to constitutional challenge.

A. Background On 26 September 2021, a majority of 57.6% in Berlin voted in favour of the referendum initiated by the campaign group Deutsche Wohnen und Co. enteignen (Expropriate Deutsche Wohnen and Others) on nationalising the housing stock of large housing companies.

The then governing coalition in Berlin consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left agreed to set up an expert commission to clarify the constitutionality of nationalising the housing stock of large housing companies.

The commission was also called upon to explore legally watertight methods of nationalisation and to make recommendations.

The commission, appointed on 29 March 2022, had 13 members, three appointed by each of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left and three by the campaign group Deutsche Wohnen & Co enteignen .

The commission was chaired by Herta Däubler-Gmelin, former Federal Minister of Justice.

B. Main content of the commission report The 156-page commission report focuses on the legislative competence of the State of Berlin, the factual requirements of Article 15 sentence 1 of Germany’s Basic Law (= Constitution) and the amount of compensation to be granted under Article 15 sentence 2 of the Basic Law.

I. Legislative authority The commission concluded that the State of Berlin has the authority to enact provisions on the nationalisation of large housing companies.

The federal government has not made use of the relevant competing legislative powers of Article 74(1)

no. 15 of the Basic Law to transfer land, natural resources and means of production into common ownership or into other forms of a social economy, so the State has full regulatory authority.

Other provisions of social tenancy law such as rental prices do not have a blocking effect on nationalisation by the State, as they are based on a different rule, namely Article 74(1)

no. 1 of the Basic Law.

II.

Requirements of Article 15 of the Basic Law

According to Article 15 of the Basic Law, land, natural resources and means of production may be transferred to common ownership or other forms of a social economy for the purpose of nationalisation by a law regulating the type and extent of compensation.

As regards the amount of compensation, Article 14(3), sentences 3 and 4 of the Basic Law apply mutatis mutandis .

Most commission members considered the factual requirements of Article 15 sentence 1 of the Basic Law to be met.

Nationalisation could also cover real estate, including heritable building rights and apartment ownership, the commission said.

The majority of the commission also assumed that the requirement of proportionality, the legal consequences of which had to be considered, would be observed in the nationalisation of properties belonging to large housing companies in Berlin."
Noerr,Constitutional concerns about planned framework law on nationalisation of housing companies,"It follows from the absence of material requirements for nationalisation, the commission said, that it was impossible to examine the proportionality of nationalisation for the pursuit of the common good, as the aim and means of nationalisation were identical.

The principle of proportionality was therefore only to be applied in a modified form, it added.

In addition to nationalisation as an end in itself, putting Berlin housing into public ownership would also promote general welfare such as ensuring affordable rents for people on lower incomes, both directly in the publicly owned stock and indirectly in the rest of the stock.

The transfer of housing into public ownership was appropriate for achieving the purpose of nationalisation and the other purposes of general public interest.

The commission majority held the view that examining the need for nationalisation was limited to the question of finding means which are obviously less drastic but equally suited to achieving the other purposes of general welfare.

At present, no obviously less drastic means were apparent, according to the commission.

In the opinion of the commission majority, more new construction was not an obviously less drastic solution, since it was not certain new construction would have a significant effect on rent levels.

As part of examining appropriateness, in the view of the majority of the commission, the general purpose of nationalisation and the recognition therein of a public interest in the non-profit management of the property referred to in Article 15 sentence 1 of the Basic Law were of particular importance.

The commission majority concluded that the project of nationalising the housing stock of large housing companies was appropriate, partly because it was urgent to solve the drastic housing shortage and the associated above-average rent increases.

The majority opinion of the commission was not supported by three commission members.

In a special vote, those three members believed less weight should be attached to the matter of nationalisation than claimed by the majority of the commission and that a conclusive assessment of appropriateness was not possible at that time, as the necessary findings based on facts were missing.

III.

Amount of compensation Even in the run-up to the referendum, one of the key points of discussion was whether the housing companies affected could be compensated with sums below the market value of the properties in question.

The commission majority concluded that this was possible.

Under Article 15 sentence 2 of the Basic Law, Article 14(3) sentence 3 of the Basic Law was applicable to compensation, in other words the amount of compensation should be determined by a fair weighing of the interests of the general public on the one hand and the interests of the parties involved on the other.

The majority of the commission believed the legislator had a wide margin of discretion in calculating compensation.

It proposed various different assessment approaches: One conceivable compensation approach was the income from non-profit management for the remaining useful life of the residential property, based on a total useful life of 40 years, which is usually applied to valuations.

Secondly, assessment by fiscal feasibility could be considered.

If, in principle, nationalisation cannot be realised for financial reasons if compensation of market value is paid for the expropriated or nationalised properties, the government would be authorised to pay compensation in line with its fiscal means.

A further assessment approach could be the hypothetical market value based on a potential restrictive provision.

Restrictive provisions that could be drawn up in view of the general interest purposes, which are to promote the project beyond the purpose of nationalisation, would have to be accepted by those affected without compensation and at the same time reduce the value of the property."
Noerr,Constitutional concerns about planned framework law on nationalisation of housing companies,"The remaining value would then be the compensation sum for the loss of rights brought about for the “purpose of nationalisation”.

Three commission members took a different view in a special vote.

In their opinion, because Article 15 sentence 2 of the Basic Law referred to Article 14(3) sentence 3 and 4 of the Basic Law, the same standards applied in principle to nationalisation as to expropriation.

Thus, in principle, the market value was to be taken as the basis for assessing the amount of compensation, they said.

Deductions due to the nature of nationalisation were conceivable – however, there had not yet been any clarification in case law, they added.

C. Assessment and outlook In the coalition agreement of the new Christian Democrat-Social Democrat State government in Berlin, the parties agreed to launch a nationalisation framework law if the expert commission deemed nationalisation constitutionally admissible.

According to the coalition agreement, the nationalisation framework law is meant to establish a legal framework and objective qualitative indicators or criteria for nationalisation in accordance with Article 15 of the Basic Law in the business areas of public services (e.g. water, energy, housing) as well as principles for the appropriate compensation required in each case.

It is to come into force two years after its promulgation.

During this time, the Berlin Senate would like to have the nationalisation framework law reviewed by the Federal Constitutional Court.

One of the main focuses of a review by the Federal Constitutional Court would most likely be the “modification” of the proportionality principle advocated by the commission majority.

According to the established case law of the Federal Constitutional Court, all state conduct must be proportionate.

The principle of proportionality or the elaboration of its sub-conditions (legitimate purpose, appropriateness, necessity and proportionality in the narrower sense) is an essential achievement of the modern rule of law, whose origins, however, can be traced back to ancient doctrines of justice.

It is an indispensable vehicle for effecting fundamental rights.

Although case law recognises that the principle of proportionality is subject to different levels of scrutiny, the argument that with respect to Article 15 of the Basic Law this pivotal principle of the rule of law is to be understood differently than in the case of other state conduct is therefore met with reservations.

In this context, one must also ask whether the supposed “special status” of Article 15 of the Basic Law, which is justified based on legal history in particular, perhaps represents a constitutional relic from a time in which, at least in German legal circles, the meaning and scope of the principle of proportionality still had to be fully absorbed and accepted.

It is therefore obvious that Article 15 of the Basic Law must be re-evaluated in the light of more than 70 years of constitutional case law.

The US constitutional theory of originalism, which posits that legal sources are to be interpreted primarily in the spirit of the time of their origin, was never able to establish itself in German constitutional jurisprudence and theory.

The question of whether and how the principle of proportionality is to be understood in the context of Article 15 of the Basic Law also has an impact on the question of possible compensation.

The methods of calculating compensation advocated by the commission majority would amount, to varying degrees, to a partial deprivation of property without compensation, which, if one rejects the said modification of the principle of proportionality, would not be proportionate – especially given that the State itself has contributed to higher rents through its housing and construction land policies."
Noerr,Constitutional concerns about planned framework law on nationalisation of housing companies,"The wording of Article 15 sentence 2 of the Basic Law also suggests that the type and manner of compensation cannot be understood any differently than in the context of the property guarantee under Article 14 of the Basic Law.

Regarding Article 14 of the Basic Law, the Federal Constitutional Court has indicated that owners may have to accept certain deductions due to the socially binding nature of property.

However, this probably would not have meant unlimited reductions based on what is (allegedly) fiscally feasible.

In order to be able to make a substantiated assessment of the constitutionality of a nationalisation framework law, we need to wait to see what specific form it takes.

However, if its provisions are based on the material legal assumptions made by the commission majority, it would be open to constitutional challenge for the reasons set out above."
Noerr,German Federal Cartel Office: vehicle infotainment system services licensing not compatible with new German antitrust provision,"In a press release on 21 June 2023 (only in German), the German Federal Cartel Office ( Bundeskartellamt ) announced that it intended to prohibit Alphabet, Inc., i.e. its subsidiary Google Germany GmbH (hereinafter: “ Google ”) from continuing various practices in connection with licensing “Google Automotive Services” that it considers anti-competitive.

Google Automotive Services consist of Google Maps, a version of Google Play and Google Assistant.

Its operating system is an Android base platform for vehicles.

According to the Cartel Office, Google offers vehicle manufacturers these functions only as a package and with additional requirements, particularly regarding how the services are presented in a vehicle’s infotainment system.

The Cartel Office’s preliminary opinion is that Google’s conduct fits the description of various offences set out in the new (2021) section 19a of the German Act Against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbwerbsbeschränkungen ) (hereinafter “ Section 19a ”).

The purpose of Section 19a is to provide the Cartel Office with a more effective control mechanism in the digital environment, enabling it to counteract at an early stage any dangers to competition posed by “digital giants” (companies having “paramount cross-market significance for competition”).

As early as the end of 2021, the Cartel Office declared that Section 19a could apply to Google because Google has paramount significance for competition across markets ( see its decision – only in German).

The Cartel Office has also declared that Meta /Facebook, Amazon and Apple have paramount significance for competition across markets as defined in Section 19a.

Amazon has lodged an appeal against this declaration with the German Federal Court of Justice ( press release from 14 November 2022 – only in German).

Declaratory proceedings have also been opened against Microsoft ( press release from 28 March 2023 – only in German).

Companies that fall under Section 19a’s area of applicability can be prohibited by the Cartel Office from engaging in anti-competitive practices, except in the case that the company can provide objective justification for such practices.

In its press release, the Cartel Office criticises four of Google’s practices in connection with its Google Automotive Services: 1. Services are only offered to vehicle manufacturers as a package The Cartel Office sees the combination of navigation, media content access, telephony and messenger services in connection with speech control of vehicle functions as essentially a complete infotainment system for vehicles.

It believes that Google’s packaging of Google Automotive Services could be anti-competitive in that Google could leverage its dominant market position with one of the services in the package to expand into another market, specifically into a market for one of the other services where its position is not yet as strong.

2. Services are pre-installed as standard equipment and/or given a prominent position in the screen In the Cartel Office’s opinion, Google’s practice of placing vehicle manufacturers under obligation to install its services as standard equipment and/or to present them more prominently than other companies’ applications on the screen means that alternative services could often be overlooked and thus more seldom used, which would constitute an obstacle to market access for other companies.

Here, the Cartel Office apparently sees parallels to Google’s past practices with mobile devices.

3. Services’ interoperability can be restricted The Cartel Office also assumes that Google is capable of hindering or preventing its services in the Google Automotive Services infotainment platform from being interoperable with other companies’ services, for example if Google Maps could be used only to a limited extent or not at all with another company’s virtual voice assistant.

4."
Noerr,German Federal Cartel Office: vehicle infotainment system services licensing not compatible with new German antitrust provision,"4.

Some vehicle manufacturers share in Google Assistant’s profits The Cartel Office also sees a problem in the fact that Google has an agreement with some vehicle manufacturers to pass along to them a share of its advertising income from the use of Google Assistant as long as these vehicle manufacturers agree in return to install only Google Assistant as the virtual voice assistant in the Google Automotive Services infotainment platform.

Outlook Google now has the opportunity to present its position on the accusations.

If the Cartel Office ultimately prohibits Google’s current practices in connection with Google Automotive Services, and Google requests court review, the question will probably arise as to the extent to which the Cartel Office must bow to the applicability priority of the Digital Markets Act, which entered into force in May.

This act is intended to safeguard contestability and fairness in digital markets, promote innovation and ensure better protection for consumers.

It is aimed at the digital giants that have been identified as “gatekeepers”.

However, the responsibility for enforcing it lies with the EU Commission and not the German Cartel Office.

So the Cartel Office’s close cooperation with the EU Commission in these proceedings is not surprising.

In summary, it can be said that antitrust authorities are closely watching further developments regarding vehicle infotainment systems."
Noerr,Update: New class action – Bundestag passes representative action for redress,"On 7 July 2023, the German Bundestag passed the Representative Actions Directive Implementation Act ( Verbandsklagenrichtlinienumsetzungsgesetz – the “ Representative Actions Act ”), thus moving forward the long-overdue implementation of the EU Representative Actions Directive 2020/1828 (the “ Directive ”).

Because the legislative procedure involves the Bundesrat , the Representative Actions Act will most likely enter into force in September only.

The core of the new Representative Actions Act is the introduction of a collective action for redress in addition to the model declaratory action already available since 2018.

Due to the changes proposed by the judiciary committee of the Bundestag ( BT-Drs. 20/7631 ), the version of the Representative Actions Act that has now been passed differs in important points from the ministerial draft and the government draft ( BT-Drs.

20/6520 ) (see for the two drafts our articles on 16 February 2023 and 31 March 2023 .

Scope of application The representative action covers all civil law disputes regarding claims and legal relationships of a number of consumers against an undertaking (section 1(1) of the Consumer Rights Enforcement Act – “ CREA ” ( Verbraucherrechtedurchsetzungsgesetz )).

This means that the area of applicability is significantly broader than that required by the Directive, i.e. with provisions related to not only consumer protection but also, for example, general tort law.

The representative action could become important in Germany, particularly when it comes to claims for damages under data privacy law , product liability cases , claims for antitrust damages, capital investment cases and the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act.

Companies with fewer than ten employees and annual turnover or an annual balance of not more than €2 million (small and medium-sized enterprises) are considered equivalent to consumers and will also be permitted to join representative actions (section 1(2) CREA).

In this respect, too, the Directive’s requirements are being exceeded in the implementation.

However, fewer companies are covered than initially planned in the government draft.

Standing to bring an action Consumers themselves are not authorised to bring an action, but rather only eligible (German) consumer associations named in the list in section 4 of the Act on Prohibitory Actions ( Unterlassungsklagengesetz ) that do not receive more than 5% of their funding from companies (section 2(1) no.1 CREA).

The requirement that an association have been on the list for one year makes it seem possible that associations are also founded for one specific situation ( ad hoc) in order to bring actions.

Also, associations from other EU Member States can bring actions in Germany (section 2(1) no. 2 CREA).

The lowered threshold for the associations to bring an action means that representative actions are more likely to be brought in future.

Representative actions are also appealing because the fairly low cost risks for associations eligible to bring an action are fairly reasonable – the value in dispute is capped at €300,000 (representative action) or €250,000 (model declaratory action) irrespective of the actual economic importance of the case.

Pooling similar types of claims Compared to the government draft, the representative action for redress substantially lowers the requirements for similarity of the claims covered.

An action redress is only admissible if the claimant asserts that the action concerns similar claims.

However, the relevant claims only have to be “ materially similar ” (section 15(1) sentence CREA).

This is the case when the claims are based on the same facts or on a set of materially comparable facts and essentially the same factual and legal issues are decisive for the claims (section 15(1) sentence 2 CREA).

The broad wording gives the courts much more flexibility in handling representative actions."
Noerr,Update: New class action – Bundestag passes representative action for redress,"The broad wording gives the courts much more flexibility in handling representative actions.

Whether the claims at hand are similar enough will most likely be one of the most controversial issues.

Consumer quorum: claims by at least 50 consumers affected Contrary to the government draft, claimants no longer have to provide evidence that claims by at least 50 consumers are affected by the representative action.

Claimants only need to “reasonably demonstrate” that 50 claims are affected (section 4(1) CREA).

How the new representative action for redress works The new representative action for redress, which must be brought before the Higher Regional Court at the defendant’s place of business, is available in three models: In the first model , the association knows the affected consumers by name and seeks performance directly to the consumers (section 16(1) sentence 2 CREA).

If this succeeds, the company is ordered to pay directly to the consumers.

In practice this model will probably not be used often because an association usually does not know the affected consumers.

The second model will probably be the most relevant from a practical point of view.

In this model the association requests performance to unnamed consumers who are only identified by common group characteristics (section 16(1) sentence 2 CREA).

The main procedural steps are the judicial proceedings for redress (interlocutory judgment on redress, settlement phase and final judgment on redress), the implementation proceedings with an optional judicial review on the trustee’s decision and (in some cases) subsequent judicial individual proceedings: In the third model , the parties can adapt the second model and apply for a single judgment which contains all decision otherwise split between the interlocutory and final judgment on redress (section 16(4) CREA).

In the second and third models, within narrowly defined boundaries, consumers and companies can ask the competent Higher Regional Court to review the trustee’s decision on the claims registered (section 28(4) CREA).

This opens the door to making an already complicated, tedious and drawn-out process even longer and more expensive.

Late pre-judgment opt-in Consumers must actively join the representative action by registering their claims with a public register.

The deadline for registration was changed several times in the legislative process.

Registration is now possible up to three weeks after the end of the court proceedings in first instance (section 46(1) sentence 1 CREA).

Since a judgment must not be issued earlier than six weeks after the conclusion of the trial (section 13(4) CREA), consumers must always register before a judgment.

This late opt-in option will often make it very difficult for companies to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations prior to a judgment.

The reason for this is that companies  will not be able to ascertain before the start of settlement negotiations who and how many people have registered their claims and accordingly which claims are covered by a potential settlement.

Strict provisions on third party litigation funding Third party litigation funding is permissible in principle.

The requirements are more precise and stricter than in the ministerial and government drafts.

If the litigation funder’s success fee exceeds 10% of the sum to be paid by the defendant, the action is inadmissible (section 4(2)

no. 3 CREA).

The association must disclose the sources they use for funding the representative action as well as the financing agreement to the court (section 4(3) CREA).

If the representative action is successful, the claimed amount must first be paid to the individual consumer.

It is not allowed to deduct the success fee from the collective total awarded by the court.

This is due to the structure of the implementation proceeding."
Noerr,Update: New class action – Bundestag passes representative action for redress,"It is not allowed to deduct the success fee from the collective total awarded by the court.

This is due to the structure of the implementation proceeding.

Litigation funding of actions for skimming of profits allowed There is no explicit limit for the success fee in case a qualified entity uses third party litigation funding for financing an action for skimming off profits under section 10 of the German Act against Unfair Competition ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb – “ Unfair Competition Act ”).

However, a prerequisite is that the Federal Office of Justice approves the financing conditions prior to the fling of the claim (section 10(6) of the Unfair Competition Act).

Another significant change is that not only intentional but also grossly negligent violations of the Unfair Competition Act give rise to a claim for skimming off profits (section 10(1) of the Unfair Competition Act).

Finally, such actions are more attractive in the future because the value of dispute  will be capped at €410,000, limiting the costs of the proceedings considerably.

Suspension of statute of limitations Bringing a representative action only suspends the statute of limitations for claims that have been registered by consumers and small businesses (section 204a(1) sentence 1 no. 4 CREA).

Suspension of the statute of limitations is thus much more narrowly defined than in the case of an action for an injunction which suspends the statute of limitations for all consumer claims affected by the violation without the need to register claims (section 204a(1) sentence 1 no. 2 CREA).

It should be noted that the suspension of the statute of limitations for representative actions for redress and injunctive actions does not apply to claims arising out of past infringements (Article 9 of the Representative Actions Act).

Since filing a model declaratory action suspends the statute of limitations even in those cases, it is likely that association can be expected to file a model declaratory action alone or in addition to a representative action for redress (at least in old cases).

Next steps: involving the Bundesrat Before the Representative Actions Act can enter into force, the Bundesrat must be involved (consent to the Act is not required, however).

This will not be the case before early September.

This means that, like many other Member States, Germany will not met the deadline for implementing the Directive (25 June 2023).

Noerr,Cast off for EU-US data transfer – European Commission publishes adequacy decision for new EU-US Data Privacy Framework,"On 10 July 2023, the European Commission published the long-heralded adequacy decision for the transfer of personal data to the United States on the basis of the new “EU-US Data Privacy Framework”.

In its adequacy decision, the European Commission concludes that there is an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU to a company in the US that is certified under the new Data Privacy Framework.

On the basis of this adequacy decision, personal data can now be transferred from the EU to certified companies in the US without further measures for third country transfers or official authorisations.

Background: ECJ’s “Schrems II” decision, new “Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework” and US Executive Order on “Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities”

On 16 July 2020, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued its high-profile “ Schrems II ” decision, in which it invalidated the European Commission’s adequacy decision on the EU-US Privacy Shield, without any provision for a transitional period , thus dealing a harsh blow to transatlantic data transfers.

On 25 March 2022, the European Commission and the US published a joint declaration on a new “Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework”, stating that the successor to the “EU-U.S. Privacy Shield”, which the ECJ had found to be inadequate, should also address the concerns expressed by the ECJ in “Schrems II”.

On 7 October 2022, US President Biden signed an Executive Order “Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities” , which is intended to implement the agreements with the European Commission on the new Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework in US law.

As a result, the Commission announced on the same day that it would prepare an adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and a draft of this was published on 13 December 2022.

Data transfers to the US will be facilitated US companies will now be able to join the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework and become certified under it.

Under this new certification scheme, US companies commit to a set of data privacy principles issued by the US Department of Commerce and contained in Annex 1 of the adequacy decision.

First and foremost, in order to participate in the Data Privacy Framework, US companies must also be subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the US Department of Transportation (DoT).

These data privacy principles apply immediately after certification for US companies that join the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and they must recertify their compliance with the principles annually.

In the future, data transfers to such certified US companies will be able to take place without further appropriate safeguards, in particular the standard data protection clauses provided by the Commission will no longer be required.

The new rules for US intelligence services , which will apply in the future under the Executive Order on “Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities” issued by US President Biden, are also intended to facilitate data transfers to US companies that have not (yet) signed up to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.

This is because the order aims to provide better protection for personal data accessed by US authorities for national security purposes in the future.

This includes strengthening the protection of privacy and civil liberties by ensuring that US intelligence activities must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuit of defined national security objectives.

In addition, a new redress mechanism has been established and the existing oversight of the activities of the US intelligence services has been improved."
Noerr,Cast off for EU-US data transfer – European Commission publishes adequacy decision for new EU-US Data Privacy Framework,"In addition, a new redress mechanism has been established and the existing oversight of the activities of the US intelligence services has been improved.

According to the European Commission , data transfers to US companies that are not based on the European Commission’s adequacy decision but on other appropriate safeguards such as standard data protection clauses or binding corporate rules will generally be made easier as a result of the new rules for US intelligence services.

Nevertheless, companies that transfer personal data to US companies should carefully review the basis on which a data transfer can take place and, if necessary, incorporate the new standard data protection clauses issued by the European Commission in 2021 into their contracts.

Despite the significantly improved legal situation in the US, the use of standard data protection clauses or other appropriate safeguards will still require the conduct of a transfer impact assessment , in which it must be determined whether national law precludes the transfer.

A transfer impact assessment need not be carried out only if the transfer actually takes place on the basis of the new adequacy decision, i.e. the transfer is made to a company certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.

Although the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework has already been harshly criticised, the European Commission is very confident that its new adequacy decision will withstand another ECJ review.

We can expect that the new adequacy decision will also soon end up before the ECJ.

However, at least for the time being, companies will be able to base data transfers to the US on the Commission’s new adequacy decision."
Noerr,Final Implementing Regulation for the Foreign Subsidies Regulation published,"On 10 July 2023, the European Commission (“ Commission ”) published the final version of the Implementing Regulation for the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“ FSR ”) (see our articles on this topic here and here ).

The Implementing Regulation clarifies practical and procedural aspects of applying the FSR and is of considerable importance in particular for M&A transactions and public procurement procedures.

The standard forms for merger notifications (“ Form FS-CO ” ) and notifications of public procurement procedures are included as annexes to the Implementing Regulation.

The Commission must now be notified of M&A transactions signed on or after 12 July 2023 and closed on or after 12 October 2023 that reach the applicable thresholds.

If notification is required, a standstill obligation applies, i.e. such mergers may not be consummated while the Commission’s review is ongoing.

The Commission can impose fines of up to 10% of total annual turnover for breaches of this standstill obligation.

Key points of the new Implementing Regulation The following points are now of particular relevance to parties to M&A transactions: In its Form FS-CO, the Implementing Regulation now contains various amounts of information or levels of detail required for different types of financial contributions from non-EU countries: Comprehensive information requirements : These apply to financial contributions that are most likely to distort the internal market (Article 5(1)(a) to (d) of the FSR; “ Article 5 - Contributions ”).

In addition, these must individually amount to at least EUR 1 million .

The categories of Article 5 - Contributions (financial contributions to ailing undertakings, unlimited guarantees, export financing measures not in line with the applicable OECD Arrangement and financial contributions to facilitate a merger) have largely been adopted from EU State aid law.

There, these categories are also considered to be particularly distortive of competition in principle.

With regard to Article 5 - Contributions, the Form FS-CO requires parties to (i) answer extensive questions (including on the granting entity, the conditions and the purpose of the financial contribution) and (ii) submit extensive documentation on these financial contributions.

Limited information requirements : These apply to all other financial contributions that do not constitute Article 5 - Contributions.

The prerequisite is that they (i) individually amount to at least EUR 1 million and (ii) together with other financial contributions from the same non-EU country amount to at least EUR 45 million . 

For these “minor” financial contributions, only a cumulative brief description of the purpose of the financial contribution and the granting entity must be provided for each type of financial contribution.

Furthermore, only the range within which an aggregated value of the financial contributions per non-EU country falls must be reported.

No information requirements : For (i) individual financial contributions of less than EUR 1 million (regardless of their nature) and (ii) financial contributions that do not constitute Article 5 - Contributions and that (together with all other financial contributions) do not amount to at least EUR 45 million from the same non-EU country, no information must be provided in the notification.

The same applies to financial contributions granted through certain universal tax rules and tax reliefs for avoidance of double taxation as well as to the provision/purchase of goods/services (except financial services) at market terms in the ordinary course of business.

In addition, special rules apply to the necessity of providing information in the context of investment funds.

However, it cannot be ruled out that the Commission will examine such financial contributions in separate proceedings if it suspects a distortion of competition."
Noerr,Final Implementing Regulation for the Foreign Subsidies Regulation published,"However, it cannot be ruled out that the Commission will examine such financial contributions in separate proceedings if it suspects a distortion of competition.

Please note : The simplifications do not apply with regard to the financial contribution threshold of EUR 50 million in the past three years.

Companies must therefore record and take into account all financial contributions when assessing this threshold.

Therefore, companies must still systematically record all financial contributions of all kinds from non-EU countries .

The simplifications then take effect with regard to the level of detail to be provided in the notification.

Structured bidding processes : Here as well, the FSR will require less information, primarily in the preliminary phase of a structured bidding process: In particular, it is no longer necessary to indicate the number of candidates contacted or candidates who have expressed interest and withdrawn.

It is also no longer mandatory to submit a detailed description of a due diligence or complete due diligence reports.

However, summaries of due diligence reports, such as those provided to members of the management board or supervisory board, are still required.

A detailed description of the structured bidding process and a description of the profiles of all candidates known to the notifying party/parties must also be provided.

Outlook The FSR and the now published Implementing Regulation present companies with additional difficult challenges in M&A transactions.

Comprehensive information on financial contributions from non-EU countries is required both for the assessment of any notification requirements and for a notification, regardless of whether these are ultimately determined to be subsidies.

If the relevant information is not available internally or is incomplete, there is a risk of significantly delaying or even completely jeopardising an M&A transaction.

In order to ensure their own “M&A readiness”, companies should therefore set up a suitable reporting system for all relevant stakeholders.

In addition, in the case of M&A transactions that are due to take place soon, comprehensive contractual provisions should already be drafted now for any relevant FSR notification requirement (such as a closing condition or mutual information obligations).

It is therefore advisable to draft clauses for such cases in advance.

Finally, timely pre-notification contacts with the Commission can be very useful in upcoming M&A transactions (e.g. to discuss a waiver regarding certain information at an early stage).

With regard to the remaining uncertainties about how the FSR will actually be applied in practice, we expect that EU State aid law in particular can be relied on as a valid source.

The topic remains challenging – we will continue to keep you informed and will be happy to answer any questions."
Noerr,Romania: Country-by-Country public reporting implemented by Romania starting 1 January 2023,"By Order no. 2.048/2022 amending accounting regulations applicable to economic operators (“ the Order ”), published in Official Gazette no. 878/07.09.2022, the Romanian authorities have transposed into national law the provisions of EU Directive 2021/2101 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2021 (“ the EU Directive ”) amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards the disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches.

The provisions of the Order entered into force on 1 January 2023.

Although the Directive requires EU Member States to transpose it into national legislation by 22 June 2023, with the first financial year of reporting being the year starting on or after 22 June 2024 at the latest, Romania elected for an earlier adoption date.

Therefore, the new rules entered into force on 1 January 2023, and the first report will need to be filed in 2024 for the financial statements corresponding to the 2023 financial year.

Controversies regarding early implementation The early implementation of the EU Directive in Romania has raised some concerns in the business environment in Romania due to: A possible negative impact on the capital market – investors believe that reputational risks arising from public scrutiny and competitive disadvantages outweigh the potential benefits of an extended information environment or more sustainable corporate tax strategies [1] Lack of time to implement the new reporting requirements – the electronic reporting templates and the accompanying instructions are set to be published by the European Commission in the third trimester of 2024, whilst the first report for some Romanian companies would be 31 December 2024, which would leave Romanian companies very little time to ensure proper implementation A possible commercial and competitive disadvantage – immediate disclosure of the data to be included in the report could, in certain cases, be seriously prejudicial to the commercial position of Romanian reporting companies [2] , as commercially sensitive information will be made available to competitors and business partners in other jurisdictions where such disclosure is not yet enforced.

The public disclosure could also negatively affect companies' future profitability due to reputational damage resulting from public discussions about low effective tax rates.

Alternatively, firms may adjust legal tax arrangements to avoid public scrutiny [1] .

Romanian companies subject to reporting obligations Romanian ultimate parent companies and standalone companies with a consolidated turnover in their balance sheet exceeding a total of RON 3.7 billion (the equivalent of €747,474,740 at the exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 21 December 2021) for each of the previous two consecutive financial years, as reflected in their consolidated financial statements Romanian medium-sized and large subsidiaries controlled by an ultimate non-EU parent company, with consolidated turnover in their balance sheet exceeding a total of RON 3.7 billion for each of the previous two consecutive financial years, as reflected in their consolidated financial statements Romanian branches opened by non-EU companies with net turnover exceeding the threshold of RON 37 billion for each of the previous two consecutive financial years.

If the total consolidated revenue in their balance sheet falls below RON 3.7 billion for each of the previous two consecutive financial years as reflected in their consolidated financial statements, the aforementioned companies are no longer required to submit the CbC report.

Content of the CbC public report The CbC public report includes information on all the companies’ activities, including those of all affiliated entities consolidated in the financial statements for the relevant financial year."
Noerr,Romania: Country-by-Country public reporting implemented by Romania starting 1 January 2023,"The report consists of: the name of the ultimate parent/standalone company, the financial year concerned, the currency used for the report and, where applicable, a list of all subsidiaries consolidated in the financial statements of the ultimate parent company for the relevant financial year established in the EU or in tax jurisdictions included in Annexes I and II to the Council conclusions on the revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (so called “black list” and “grey list”)

[3] a brief description of the nature of their activities the number of employees on a full-time-equivalent basis revenue, which is to be calculated as the sum of net turnover, other operating income, income from participating interests, excluding dividends received from affiliated companies, income from other investments and loans forming part of the fixed assets, other interest receivable and similar income the amount of gross profit or loss the amount of income tax accrued during the relevant financial year, which is to be calculated as the current tax expense recognised on taxable profits or losses of the financial year by companies and branches in the relevant tax jurisdiction the amount of income tax paid on a cash basis, which is to be calculated as the amount of income tax paid during the relevant financial year by companies in the relevant tax jurisdiction; and the amount of accumulated earnings at the end of the relevant financial year.

Romania allows for one or more specific items of information to be temporarily omitted from the report if their disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the commercial position of the companies to which the report relates.

Any omission is to be clearly indicated in the report, together with a duly reasoned explanation.

However, all omitted information is made public in a later report, within no more than five years of its original omission.

Publication methods The CbC reporting is to be made accessible to the public free of charge on the website of the reporting companies in at least one of the official languages of the EU no later than 12 months after the close of the financial year for which the report is drawn up.

If the report is simultaneously made accessible to the public on the website of the Romanian Trade Registry, the website of the reporting companies must contain a reference to the website of the Romanian Trade Registry where the report can be accessed.

The report must remain accessible on the website for a minimum of five consecutive years.

Conclusions The early adoption of CbC public reporting has created a stir in the Romanian business environment for the reasons detailed above, but also due to the fact that many companies are still struggling to implement SAF-T reporting [4] and to comply with e-invoicing requirements in their ERP/accounting systems.

Lately it seems that all that Romanian companies do is prepare one new report after another.

And if that were not enough, there is ever-increasing frustration that the Romanian authorities still do not have the IT infrastructure and capacity to correlate all the data they receive by electronic means, and thus it cannot be properly reviewed and processed.

This means that the effort that goes into complying with all the new requirements will not reduce tax evasion and profit shifting, but rather put pressure on compliant companies.

Noerr,Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 on machinery ‒ a legal regime for machinery in Europe,"At last it’s here.

Long-awaited Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 on machinery (the “ Machinery Regulation ” ) was published in the EU Official Journal on 29 June 2023.

Private industry and public authorities alike will now have a new set of rules on the safety requirements for machinery, which will replace Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery (the “ Machinery Directive ” ) that has been in force for 17 years.

Even though the Machinery Regulation does not constitute a paradigm shift for industry, it nevertheless introduces numerous changes that will be relevant in practice and with which economic operators will have to deal in order to ensure product compliance.

I. Old wine in new bottles?

In keeping with the current European regulatory trend in product safety law, this central piece of legislation for machinery and equipment will in future be directly applicable as a European regulation.

Although during the legislative process calling the regulation the “Machinery Products Regulation” remained an option to the very end, ultimately the less cumbersome name “Machinery Regulation” was adopted.

On the other hand, for no apparent reason, European legislators decided to turn the numbering of the numerous annexes, with which users of the Machinery Directive were familiar, upside down.

For example, the essential health and safety requirements are no longer to be found in Annex  I, but are now in Annex III.

This is unfortunate because it makes it more difficult to compare old and new law and, for no good reason, hinders the seamless application of the new provisions in practice.

The material scope of application of the new Machinery Regulation, on the other hand, corresponds largely to that of the Machinery Directive.

It covers not only machinery and partly completed machinery, but also interchangeable equipment, safety components, lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing, and removable drive shafts.

However, the definition of safety component has been expanded to include software and other digital components that stand alone and perform safety functions.

The non-exhaustive list of safety components can now be found in Annex II of the Machinery Regulation, instead of in Annex V of the Machinery Directive as before.

II.

Adaptation of European machinery law to the New Legislative Framework (NLF)

The new regulation is based on a package of legislation known as the New Legislative Framework.

As a result, machinery law has now been brought up to date in terms of its methodology and terminology with the latest European regulatory techniques in relation to product compliance.

On the one hand, this adaptation means that importers and distributors will now be covered by machinery law and will also have to satisfy obligations with regard to machinery that are already familiar from the New Legislative Framework.

It is worth mentioning here in particular that the obligation to notify the authorities where product risks are identified can now affect manufacturers, importers and traders alike.

On the other hand, the time period over which the Machinery Directive will apply has been extended.

III.

Codification of material changes Since time immemorial the question of how machinery may be modified after it has been placed on the market or put into service without it thereby becoming new machinery and therefore having to undergo, among other things, a new conformity assessment procedure has been discussed.

The Machinery Directive was silent when it came to distinguishing between new and used machinery, which is why authorities and market operators had in practice to seek guidance from interpretation aids (e.g. the European Commission’s “Blue Guide” and the Federal Ministry of Labour’s “Interpretation Paper”).

The principles laid down in the interpretation aids are now codified in the Machinery Regulation."
Noerr,Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 on machinery ‒ a legal regime for machinery in Europe,"The principles laid down in the interpretation aids are now codified in the Machinery Regulation.

A “substantial modification” is now defined as any modification of a machinery product, by physical or digital means after that machinery product has been placed on the market or put into service, which is not foreseen by the manufacturer.

This modification must create a new hazard or increase an existing risk so that new safeguard procedures are required.

Any person who substantially modifies machinery expressly becomes a manufacturer and is subject to the associated obligations listed in Article 10 of the Machinery Regulation.

Partly completed machinery, on the other hand, is not covered by the requirements for substantial modification as it is only intended to be integrated into machinery.

IV.

Extension of essential health and safety requirements The essential health and safety requirements in Annex III of the Machinery Regulation have been revised and extended.

Particularly noteworthy are the new health and safety requirements on cyber security and artificial intelligence.

In future, manufacturers will have to take sufficient safety measure precautions to adequately protect machinery against accidental or intentional attacks by third parties.

The safety requirements for artificial intelligence were inserted into the existing legal structure without mentioning the term “artificial intelligence”.

Manufacturers are required to take the “learning phase” of AI into account in their risk assessment and to define the limits of learning in advance and protect them with safeguard procedures.

Unfortunately, European legislators did not succeed in their original plan of dovetailing the new European AI Regulation with the Machinery Regulation.

As a result, there is a risk of inconsistencies arising in future between the two regulations.

These may have to be eliminated by adapting the Machinery Regulation at short notice.

V. Half-hearted digitalisation Digitalisation has also found its way into the Machinery Regulation, but not nearly to the extent that is currently being discussed in connection with the digital product passport (DPP).

Legislators remain half-hearted, especially when it comes to the requirements for instructions.

While manufactures will in future always be able to provide declarations of conformity and declarations of incorporation in digital form, this only applies to a very limited extent to extensive instructions.

These currently have to include different language versions and require a considerable amount of paper.

In the case of B2B sales of machinery, digital instructions will generally be permitted.

However, paper versions will have to be made available within one month of purchase if requested by the end customer.

This means that where machinery is sold through a distributor, a manufacturer can, long after a product has been placed on the market, be confronted at short notice with requests for instructions in paper form.

If a manufacturer is able to foresee that machinery will be used by private users, it must, on the other hand, continue to ensure for an unforeseeable period of time that the machinery is accompanied by at least the safety information in paper form.

In view of the widespread use of smartphones by European consumers nowadays, it is difficult to understand the logic behind this provision or the necessity for it.

VI. 

Outlook

The new Machinery Regulation comes into force on 19 July 2023 and will be mandatory after a transition period of three and a half years.

By such time, machinery may, in addition, already be subject to the new requirements of the European AI Regulation.

Economic operators should keep an eye on further developments and familiarise themselves with the numerous changes.

This applies in particular to the extended health and safety requirements and the new catalogues of obligations for manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors."
Noerr,Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 on machinery ‒ a legal regime for machinery in Europe,"This applies in particular to the extended health and safety requirements and the new catalogues of obligations for manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors.

For companies, it is a matter of adapting their product compliance management to the new legal regime in good time."
Noerr,11th hour? EU Imposes Another Round of Sanctions Against Russia,"On June 21, 2023, EU member states agreed on the eleventh package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, walking a tightrope between enforcing sanctions compliance and not alienating third countries.

The sanctions package was published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 23, 2023.

This News Update provides an overview of the topline provisions.

The package focuses on cracking down on sanctions circumvention and includes a novel “anti-circumvention tool” (A.) potentially targeting third countries circumventing EU sanctions.

Further, the transit ban for EU exports through Russia has been extended (B.) and the list of entities sanctioned under Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 (amending act available here ) expanded to include for the first time entities in countries other than Russia and Iran.

Equally, additional persons have been added to the personal sanctions under Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 (C., amending acts available here and here ).

Lastly, restrictions on trade have also been intensified (D.).

Commission President von der Leyen welcomed the agreement, noting the sanctions package would “deal a further blow to Putin’s war machine with tightened export restrictions, targeting entities supporting the Kremlin.”

She added: “Our anti-circumvention tool will prevent Russia from getting its hands on sanctioned goods.”

A.

The New Anti-Circumvention Tool

In a softening of the Commission’s initial proposal, the anti-circumvention tool enshrined in newly added Art. 12f of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 allows the Council – as an exceptional measure of last resort – to restrict the sale, supply, transfer or export of certain goods and technology to third countries that are at a continued and particularly high risk of sanctions circumvention.

The tool is to focus on specific high-risk goods that are under EU sanctions and have been proven to make their way to Russia nonetheless.

These goods and the third countries concerned will be listed in Annex XXXIII added to Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014.

Per Art. 12f para.

3 of this Regulation, sensitive dual-use goods and technology or goods and technology that might contribute to the enhancement of Russia’s military, technological or industrial capacities or to the development of Russia’s defense and security sector can be added to Annex XXXIII.

As for the third countries potentially listed in Annex XXXIII, Art. 12f para.

3 of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 stipulates that only countries can be listed which the Council has determined to have “systematically and persistently failed to prevent the sale, supply, transfer or export to Russia of goods and technology, as listed in that Annex, exported from the Union, despite the Union’s prior outreach and assistance to the country in question.

“

Notably, this provides for several off-ramps and ways for diplomatic engagement before any country could be listed.

The exceptional nature of the tool is further underscored by the requirement that the EU “inform and actively seek the views of the government of” the third country in question before including it on the list.

Moreover, the EU Commission in its FAQ highlights that the Annex XXXIIII, which is currently empty, “would only be populated if no other solution could be found.”  

In addition, the inclusion of a third country and targeted goods to Annex XXXIII would first require a unanimous Council decision.

B. Extended Ban on Transit through Russia of Certain EU Exports As an additional measure to tackle sanctions circumvention, per newly added Art. 2a para. 

1a and Art. 

3c para.

1a Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, goods and technology exported from the EU listed in Annexes VII and XI of this Regulation, respectively, may not transit through Russia."
Noerr,11th hour? EU Imposes Another Round of Sanctions Against Russia,"1a and Art. 

3c para.

1a Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, goods and technology exported from the EU listed in Annexes VII and XI of this Regulation, respectively, may not transit through Russia.

Annexes VII and XI include goods that could contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement or to the development of its defense and security sector, or are suitable for use in the aviation or space industry.

By forcing EU exporters to bypass Russian territory altogether, the EU seeks to minimize the risk of such sensitive shipments being diverted whilst in Russia.

Further, access to EU ports is to be denied to vessels that have participated in ship-to-ship transfers suspected of violating the ban on importing Russian seaborne crude oil.

On land, Russian trailers and semi-trailers are fully banned from transporting goods to the EU.

C. Expanded Listings Extending the remit of sanctions to include companies and third countries through which Russia has been able to source sanctioned goods emerged as one of the most contentious issue in the drawn-out negotiations.

Per reports, the Commission had initially proposed adding eight Chinese entities to Annex IV of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

Following EU member states’ concern over the ramifications of listing Chinese companies, the sanctions package now lists only three Hong Kong-based companies.

Media reports suggest the EU Commission expects China to address the circumvention of EU sanctions by the other five entities.

A total of 87 new entities were added to the list, including in third countries other than China (Armenia, Hong Kong, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan).

Besides Iran, this marks the first time EU sanctions against Russia include entities in third countries.

The eleventh package also adds another 71 individuals and 33 predominantly Russian entities to the list of natural and legal persons subject to asset freezes and the prohibition to make funds and economic resources available to them per Art. 2 of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 in conjunction with Annex I of this Regulation.

Amongst the additions to Annex I are senior military officials, persons involved in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, Russian IT companies providing critical technology and software to Russian intelligence as well as two banks (CMRBank and MRB Bank).

D. Trade Restrictions Other notable changes include applying restrictions on the import and export of goods at a higher classification level, i.e. on the four-digit customs code of the Combined Nomenclature (“CN”) instead of the previous six-digit level.

Whilst serving the proclaimed goal of simplifying compliance monitoring by customs, this also means the export bans apply to a much wider range of goods than previously.

For example, the import ban on iron and steel products per Art. 3g para.

1 of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 now uniformly applies at the four-digit level and encompasses headings 7206 CN to 7229 CN and 7301 CN to 7326 CN.

Likewise, the export ban per Art. 3k of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 on goods listed in Annex XXIII of this Regulation now predominantly targets the four-digit level.

Notably, Annex XXIII now applies to headings 8477 CN (machinery for working rubber or plastics) and 8482 CN (ball or roller bearings).

Further, exports of all cars with an engine size exceeding 1.900 cm³ are now banned, as are exports of yachts.

E. Background & Outlook Von der Leyen had outlined the EU’s most recent round of sanctions on the margins of her visit to Kyiv in early May.

Von der Leyen promised the EU would do “everything in our power to erode Putin’s war machine and revenues” and reiterated sanctions were working."
Noerr,11th hour? EU Imposes Another Round of Sanctions Against Russia,"Von der Leyen promised the EU would do “everything in our power to erode Putin’s war machine and revenues” and reiterated sanctions were working.

This package, Von der Leyen said, would focus on “cracking down on circumvention” of EU sanctions – specifically by expanding the transit ban to include advanced tech products and aircraft parts, introducing a last resort tool for EU member states to ban specific exports to third countries, and banning so-called shadow entities from Russia and third countries intentionally circumventing sanctions.

The regulations were published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 23, 2023 and entered into force that day (additions to Annex I of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014) and the day after (amendments of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014).

Once again, the publication of the new sanctions package was delayed by discussions between the member states.

The public wrangling over this iteration again may indicate troubled waters ahead as sanctions take a toll on EU member states’ economies.

It remains to be seen whether EU member states can return to the relatively quick and silent process on previous sanctions packages."
Noerr,Procedure for precedents at the Federal Court of Justice,"Germany’s Federal Ministry of Justice has drafted a bill on introducing a procedure for precedents at the Federal Court of Justice, in collaboration with a working party consisting of federal and state representatives.

The aim of the bill is to bring about faster decisions by the highest court on legal issues that are relevant to a large number of individual legal disputes.

This is to help to prevent a wave of many individual legal actions from arising in the first place.

As correct as the aim of achieving rapid decisions by the highest court may be, the intended procedure for precedents is unlikely to solve the existing problems.

Although the ministerial draft stresses several times that it is only one element in combatting waves of lawsuits, the bill seems to fall short.

I.

How precedents work The bill states that in future the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) may select one or more proceedings it considers suitable from among the pending appeal proceedings and designate them as precedents.

According to the bill, appeal proceedings are suitable as precedents if the appeal on points of law raises legal questions on which the decision is important to a large number of other proceedings.

In principle, the proceedings for a precedent at the Federal Court of Justice are to be carried out in the same way as appeal proceedings to date.

What is new, however, is that the Federal Court of Justice will set a precedent by way of an order even if the proceedings that have been made into a precedent have been settled, for example by withdrawal of the appeal (due to an out-of-court settlement, for instance).

This is intended to ensure that the appeal court can comment on fundamental legal questions even if a judgment on the appeal with substantive reasons can no longer be handed down.

The precedent is not intended to have a formal binding effect or an influence on the specific appeal proceedings.

If the Federal Court of Justice has designated certain proceedings as precedents, the lower-instance courts will in future be able to stay proceedings pending before them more easily if their decision depends on legal issues that are the subject of the precedent proceedings.

However, this is only possible if the parties to the individual proceedings agree.

II.

Efficiency of the planned precedent procedure is in doubt The goal of relieving lower-instance courts by providing them with supreme-court guidelines as early as possible can probably only be achieved to a limited extent with the planned precedent procedure.

A precedent requires that the relevant proceedings make it to the Federal Court of Justice quickly.

Experience to date shows that preventing supreme-court decisions for procedural reasons is already common practice at the stage of the first appeal on questions of fact and law.

The introduction of the precedent proceedings is likely to intensify this trend.

What is remarkable about the bill is that the final appeal court is only supposed to determine proceedings for a precedent after receiving the response to the appeal or after the expiry of a time limit set for the response to the appeal.

Until that time, the litigating parties remain in charge of the proceedings, which may prevent or delay clarification by the Federal Court of Justice of legal issues relevant to the decision.

The workload of the lower courts would be reduced more effectively if the lower courts themselves could designate proceedings as precedents at the end of the appeal process, rather than the Federal Court of Justice.

A referral procedure similar to referrals to the ECJ or the pooling of many individual proceedings as in the German Capital Investor Model Proceedings Act ( KapMuG ) would be worth considering.

Lower courts are able to identify legal questions relevant to the decision for a large number of proceedings of the same type more quickly."
Noerr,Procedure for precedents at the Federal Court of Justice,"Lower courts are able to identify legal questions relevant to the decision for a large number of proceedings of the same type more quickly.

They should be given the opportunity to submit key legal questions to the Federal Court of Justice for a decision.

At the same time, there must be an option to stay other proceedings to which the same legal questions apply.

This would allow mass proceedings to be managed more efficiently from the first court instance onwards and legal certainty to be achieved much faster.

Despite all the criticism, the bill now presented shows that the Federal Ministry of Justice places a high priority on new legal instruments to combat the phenomenon of mass actions and reduce the judiciary’s workload.

Legislative activity is continuing with the capital investor model proceedings, model declaratory actions and representative actions currently in the legislative process.

Noerr is a pioneer in defending against class and mass actions of all kinds, and has successfully defended clients in four sets of capital investor model proceedings and the first model declaratory action in Germany."
Noerr,EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism – Public Consultation on Draft Implementing Regulation Until 11 July 2023,"The European Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) is inviting interested parties to submit feedback on the draft Implementing Regulation which lays down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter “CBAM” or “Regulation”), which entered into force on 17 th May 2023.

Context The CBAM is one of the key pillars of the “ Fit for 55 package ”, a roadmap of policy initiatives designed to make the EU’s economy more sustainable.

The principal objective of the CBAM, which targets energy-intensive companies exporting specific goods into the EU, is to equalise the carbon price between domestic products and imports, addressing the risk of carbon leakage.

The mechanism is designed to accompany the phase-out of free emissions allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter “EU ETS”) which will end in 2034 (see our previous News Alert for more information on the links with the EU ETS reform).

The CBAM will apply to imports from sectors at greater risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity generation, hydrogen, certain precursors as well as some downstream products such as screws and bolts and similar articles of iron or steel, with the exceptions of imports from third countries participating in the EU ETS or a similar mechanism (see Annex I of the CBAM for the concerned CN codes, hereafter “CBAM Goods”).

Transitional Phase To allow companies and authorities to adequately prepare, the CBAM will be progressively “phased in”.

The Regulation foresees a transitional period from 1 st October 2023 to 31 st December 2025, during which importers will be obliged to report emissions embedded in their goods without paying a financial adjustment.

The rules governing the reporting obligations of the CBAM during this phase and the provisional methodology for calculating the embedded emissions released during the production process of CBAM goods are now under consultation.

Interested parties are invited to submit feedback until 11 st July 2023 on the draft Implementing Regulation.

At the end of the feedback period, the Commission will review and present the feedback to the CBAM Committee (a body in which ever EU Member State is represented).

According to the examination procedure, the Commission is expected to formally adopt the Implementing Regulation by the end of the Summer, after a positive vote by qualified majority by the CBAM Committee.

The draft Implementing Regulation During the transitional phase, importers of CBAM goods have a reporting obligation.

By 31 st January 2024 importers should submit a first report on the quantity of imported goods, embedded direct and indirect emissions and any carbon price paid in a third country in respect of goods imported during the fourth quarter of 2023.

The obligation to report quarterly will end on 31 st January 2026 with respect to goods imported during the fourth quarter of 2025.

The draft Implementing Regulation lists the information required to be submitted in these quarterly reports.

The information includes the quantity and type of CBAM goods, as identified by their CN codes, embedded emissions and carbon price paid in the country of origin for embedded emissions.

Notably, the draft Implementing Regulation specifies the calculation methodology for embedded emissions and foresees two alternatives: determining emissions from source streams on basis of data obtained by measurement systems and laboratory analyses or data obtained by means of continuous measurement of relevant greenhouse gases.

Exceptions are nonetheless foreseen until 31 st July 2024, enabling importers to choose other calculation methods if not all necessary information from third country operators is available or if other methods lead to similar coverage and accuracy.

Dedicated IT tools, guidance and training materials will be made available to support importers in their reporting obligations."
Noerr,EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism – Public Consultation on Draft Implementing Regulation Until 11 July 2023,"Dedicated IT tools, guidance and training materials will be made available to support importers in their reporting obligations.

The draft Implementing Regulation also lays down the submission procedure for the reports and provides for the possibility to modify a submitted report until two months after the end of the relevant reporting quarter.

In case of failure to comply with the reporting obligations a penalty will be imposed for each tonne of unreported embedded emissions (between EUR 10 and 50).

End of the Transitional Phase The draft Implementing Regulation contains provisions regarding the reporting obligations during the transitional period.

Please note that, as of 1 st January 2026, importers will also be subject to the financial impact of the carbon levy, as well as additional compliance obligations.

Furthermore, only authorised CBAM declarants will be allowed to import goods into the customs territory of the EU; therefore, any importer established in a Member States must apply for the status of authorised CBAM declarant.

See our previous News Alert for more information on the full CBAM regime.

Implications for Businesses Following the publication of the draft Implementing Regulation, affected businesses are strongly advised to closely examine the draft and to submit their feedback on the draft text to weigh in on its final shape.

Additionally, preparing for the quarterly reporting obligations requires immediate action and companies should conduct data assessment in terms of data required on imported goods, embedded emissions and carbon prices paid in countries of origin of the CBAM goods or manufacturing locations.

Finally, it is important to remember that the scope of the CBAM is likely to be expanded in the near future to additional sectors, which is why it remains important to keep a close eye on further legislative developments in this domain.

The Commission plans to conduct a review of the mechanism during its transitional phase and will prepare a report to the European Parliament and the Council with proposals (if necessary) to modify the regulation by mid-2025, before the entry into force of the definitive system.

At the same time, the product scope of the CBAM will be reviewed to assess the feasibility of expanding it to include goods already covered by the EU ETS by 2030.

Moreover, a new calculation methodology for the definitive phase will be developed in 2025 and other Implementing Regulations on certain procedural aspects of the mechanism will be released and open for feedback in due time before the CBAM becomes fully operational."
Noerr,The new EU Deforestation Regulation – What companies need to do to ensure supply chains do not involve deforestation,"Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 on the on the making available on the Union market and the export from the Union of certain commodities and products associated with deforestation and forest degradation (EU Deforestation Regulation) was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 9 June 2023.

The Regulation will come into force on 30 December 2024.

Given the short transition period of just under 18 months, manufacturers and traders urgently need to clean up the supply chains with regard to deforestation and to ensure the necessary documentation.

I.

What does the Regulation govern?

In the last 30 years alone, an area larger than that of the European Union has been deforested worldwide.

The EU is responsible for around 10% of this deforestation due to its consumption.

The new EU Deforestation Regulation (Regulation on deforestation-free products – “EUDR”) is intended to reduce the European contribution to global deforestation and also promote human rights and the rights of indigenous communities.

Therefore in future certain products can only be legally distributed in Europe or exported from the EU if they have been produced without involving deforestation and if the laws of the country of production have been complied with.

II.

What products are affected and what needs to be done?

The EU Deforestation Regulation covers the relevant commodities of cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya and wood, as well as all products listed in Annex I of the Regulation, if they contain or have been produced using or fed with those relevant commodities.

The list in Annex I refers to the proven system of the Combined Nomenclature, a basis for the classification of goods and tariff determination under customs law.

The products concerned must be deforestation-free from 30 December 2024.

This means that there has been no conversion of forests to agricultural land in the production areas of the relevant commodities and that there have been no unsustainable harvesting operations resulting in a reduction or loss of biological or economic productivity and complexity of forest ecosystems.

In addition, the relevant laws of the country of production must have been complied with.

This does not only include laws on forest and nature conservation, but also in particular labour rights, human rights, indigenous peoples’ rights and local anti-corruption laws.

III.

Which companies is the EU Deforestation Regulation aimed at?

All companies that place products on the market within the EU (manufacturers and importers), make them available (traders) or export them from the EU are affected.

They are all considered “ operators ” with a full set of obligations.

The Regulation sets out (a few) facilitations only for small and medium-sized companies within the meaning of Directive 2013/34/EU.

Contrary to the EU Parliament’s original intentions in September 2022, financial institutions are not affected after all.

However, two years after the start of application of the Regulation, a future extension of the scope of application to financial institutions will be considered.

Therefore financial institutions and the insurance industry in particular should keep an eye on the issue.

IV.

What obligations do companies have?

In order to ensure freedom from deforestation and compliance with local laws in the country of production, the EU Deforestation Regulation requires all operators in the supply chain to comprehensively document relevant information demonstrating compliance with the provisions (e.g. geolocation data of producers), to conduct a risk assessment for each product concerned, and to submit a due diligence statement electronically to the competent authorities.

This is a considerable set of obligations given that it applies not only to European companies first placing the products on the market, but also to traders."
Noerr,The new EU Deforestation Regulation – What companies need to do to ensure supply chains do not involve deforestation,"This is a considerable set of obligations given that it applies not only to European companies first placing the products on the market, but also to traders.

Operators must proactively establish and document that there is no risk of a breach of the EU Deforestation Regulation or at most a negligible risk.

To do this, they must collect and keep information available on the product, the country of production, the specific production areas and the supply chain.

The workload required for this will be significantly influenced by the European Commission’s country benchmarking system.

The European Commission will classify countries into certain risk categories by 30 December 2024.

Depending on the risk level, stricter requirements will apply to the risk assessment to be carried out by the operators for each product.

V.

What are the consequences of breaches?

In the event of breaches of the provisions of the EU Deforestation Regulation, companies may face hefty fines of up to 4% of their annual turnover.

Furthermore, the competent market surveillance authorities can not only prohibit distribution, but also force companies to withdraw affected products from the market or to recall non-compliant products from end customers.

The latter in particular entails not inconsiderable liability risks for suppliers, for example if products have to subsequently be removed from other downstream products due to a lack of conformity with the requirements of the EU Deforestation Regulation.

VI.

How should affected companies prepare?

All companies, whether manufacturers, importers or traders of products made from relevant commodities, must adapt their compliance structures in order to be able to meet the requirements of the EU Deforestation Regulation from 30 December 2024.

Those who cannot prove at the beginning of 2025 that affected products pose no risk or only a negligible risk of non-compliance with the Regulation may face large fines, official withdrawal and recall orders and reputational damage from the publication of those breaches.

Manufacturers, importers and traders should therefore quickly get to grips with the new requirements, and check the extent to which their products are affected.

They should then review their supply chains, set up processes to ensure compliance with the Regulation for newly handled products and consider how they can ensure existing products (including stored goods) comply with the requirements of the Regulation as efficiently as possible."
Noerr,Increase of the Documentation Obligations for Cross-Border Transactions in Germany,"For companies with cross-border transactions, there have been documentation and cooperation obligations for many years in Germany, which have now been significantly increased and tightened, not only for transactions with associated companies and permanent establishments.

Two essential increases of the obligations to document and cooperate in cross-border transactions are presented below.

Tightened Obligations to Submit Transfer Pricing Documentation

The transfer pricing documentation pursuant to Section 90 (3) Fiscal Code of Germany (“ FC ”; Abgabenordnung ) for business relationships within the meaning of Section 1 (4) Foreign Tax Act (“ FTA ”; Außensteuergesetz ) with related parties (e.g. affiliated companies and significant participations) and permanent establishments - in the form of the ""master file"" and the ""local file"" - can now no longer only be requested by the tax authorities within the scope of tax audits within a period of generally 60 days, but for financial years from 1 January 2025 at any time with a period of notice of 30 days.

However, the tightening is by no means a problem only for the financial years starting on 1 January 2025, because the new regulations also apply to old cases if a tax audit order for previous financial years is issued after 31 December 2024, which may be the case for permanently audited companies - for which, for example, the last audit period was 2018 to 2020 - already for the audit of the financial statements for the years 2021 to 2023.

Since the preparation effort for the transfer pricing documentation is very high, the transfer pricing documentation should already be prepared now - parallel to the preparation of the tax returns.

Further details on the amended obligations to submit transfer pricing documentation can be found at our article “Tightened Obligations to Submit Transfer Pricing Documentation” .

Increase of Documentation Obligations for Business Relations or Participations in Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions for Tax Purposes If companies operating across borders maintain business relations or shareholdings in or with reference to so-called non-cooperative jurisdictions ( Link ) there are increased obligations for documentation and cooperation with the German tax authorities pursuant to Section 12 of the Tax Haven Defense Act (“ THDA ”; Steueroasenabwehrgesetz) .

Those are in addition to the general obligations to cooperate pursuant to Section 90 FC.

Pursuant to Section 12 THDA, records of these business relationships - similar to transfer pricing documentation - must be prepared no later than one year after the end of the business year and must be transmitted to the locally competent tax office or the Federal Central Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt für Steuern ) without being requested to do so.

Noerr,New draft citizenship law,"On 6 January 2023, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (Interior Ministry) forwarded the draft of a new citizenship law to the other federal ministries for consultation.

Based on the draft and after discussing it at length, the German government has reached consensus on a new “Draft Act to Modernise Citizenship Law”.

This draft also draws from the government’s white paper on a modern immigration act [ Key issues paper on a modern immigration act (noerr.com) ] issued last fall.

According to Germany’s Interior Minister, Nancy Faeser, the aim is “[to create] incentives for integration instead of setting up hurdles and requiring long waiting periods”.

How would acquiring citizenship be simplified?

The draft provides for significant changes in the rules on acquiring citizenship found in section 10 of the German Citizenship Act ( Staatsangehörigkeitsgesetz – StAG).

Relaxing requirements for German language proficiency If passed, the draft law will relax the requirements placed on proficiency in the German language for certain categories of people.

For everyone who is at least 67 years old, the draft will lower the requirements for proving proficiency in German and eliminate the obligation to take a naturalisation test.

For younger people wishing to become German citizens, there will be a hardship clause for proving language proficiency.

By way of exception, for example if a family member needs care, proficiency that makes it possible to communicate in German in everyday life without significant problems will be considered sufficient.

However, evidence will be required that despite serious, sustained efforts, acquiring sufficient language proficiency has proved impossible or will always pose significant difficulty for the foreign person.

For foreign workers who have been in western and eastern Germany for many years ( Gastarbeiter and Vertragsarbeitnehmer , respectively), everyday language competency will be deemed sufficient, and no corresponding proof of efforts to learn the language will be required.

Reducing the minimum residence period The draft law also intends to reduce the length of the required residence period in Germany.

If the draft is passed, it will be possible to acquire citizenship after only five years of residence in Germany instead of eight years.

This will even be possible after only three years’ residence if there have been “extraordinary integration achievements”, for example special academic, vocational or professional achievements or volunteer work and a particularly good command of German (passing the level C1 language test).

If the draft becomes law, the same shorter period of residence in Germany will also apply to children born to foreign parents in Germany.

The current requirement for German citizenship is that one parent must have been a resident of Germany for eight years, but under the new law, a mere five years will be sufficient.

Dual citizenship to be possible The principle of avoiding dual citizenship enshrined in section 10(1) first sentence, no. 4 StAG is abandoned in the draft law.

If the law is passed without changes, those who attain German citizenship will no longer be required to give up their existing citizenship.

The general acceptance of dual citizenship is said to be justified in the light of the fact that aspects such as language proficiency, education, occupational integration, the basic ability to provide for one’s own living necessities, social participation, civic engagement, an understanding of one’s civic rights and responsibilities and a commitment to Germany’s free and democratic constitutional order are far more important for integration into German society than the issue of whether a person is a citizen of one or more countries.

Accordingly, the current rules on “dismissal” from German citizenship would be repealed under the draft."
Noerr,New draft citizenship law,"Accordingly, the current rules on “dismissal” from German citizenship would be repealed under the draft.

The loss of German citizenship would then be limited primarily to cases of renunciation, rescission of illegal naturalisation and entry into the armed forces of a foreign country or concrete participation in combat operations of a terrorist group abroad.

“Conforming to the German way of life” no longer required The requirement to “conform to the German way of life”, which was only introduced as a prerequisite in 2019, mainly to prevent people with more than one spouse from becoming citizens, would be deleted again under the draft law.

Nevertheless, to prevent polygamy in Germany, this would be included in section 11 StAG as grounds for exclusion from German citizenship.

Another new reason for exclusion would be disregard for the principle of equal rights for men and women.

Exclusion from citizenship due to certain crimes Instead, the new law would exclude those who commit antisemitic, racist or xenophobic acts or other violations of human dignity, particularly criminal offenses, from attaining German citizenship because such acts are incompatible with the principle of the German Basic Law (Constitution) that “human dignity is inviolable” and thus constitute a violation of Germany’s free and democratic constitutional order.

Outlook The Interior Ministry’s draft includes several significant changes to current citizenship law, most notably abandoning the principle of avoiding dual citizenship.

Shortening the required residence periods is also intended to pave the way for attaining German citizenship sooner.

It remains to be seen whether these changes will be watered down in the political discussions in the German federal states or whether the draft’s plans to modernise the law will remain intact.

In any case, the law is intended to be passed this summer and enter into force promptly."
Noerr,How important is the new Whistleblower Protection Act to public undertakings?,"Public undertakings have already been harder hit by claims for information and disclosure than private-sector companies (I.).

The existing risk of an uncontrolled outflow of internal company information could now be even greater due to the German Whistleblower Protection Act ( Hinweisschutzgebergesetz ), due to come into force on 2 July 2023 with special features for public undertakings (II.).

I. Public undertakings have limited control over their information due to third parties’ rights to information Public undertakings’ control over their own information is already limited by third parties’ rights to information.

These rights, some of which will be considered below, are linked to special public-law obligations of public undertakings.

According to the general definition of the term, public undertakings have the legal form of a legal person under private law which are majority-controlled by a public corporation or a legal person under public law (institution under public law, corporation, foundation), although the addressees of the claims to information vary depending on the specialist law concerned.

Rights to receive information from public undertakings arise first and foremost from the laws on freedom of information and transparency at federal and state level .

This may be illustrated by looking, for example, at the German federal government’s Freedom of Information Act, which provides a right of access to official information.

The right is directed toward the public authority that uses the undertaking to fulfil its public duties, irrespective of the ownership situation.

The Federal Networks Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ), for example, was obliged by the Freedom of Information Act to disclose internal company information belonging to a municipal grid operator.

As a public undertaking, the operator did not have fundamental constitutional rights and, as a monopolist, could not invoke the protection of trade and business secrets provided by sub-constitutional law (Cologne Administrative Court, judgment of 25 February 2016, case 13 K 5017/13).

In addition, the Federal Environmental Information Act and the Environmental Information Acts of the federal states provide a right to free access to environmental information held by a body obliged to provide information.

This may also apply to legal entities under private law, for example where they perform public tasks related to the environment and are subject to federal control.

The broad expression “environmental information” includes activities with an impact on environmental elements.

For example, a third party was able, based on the Federal Environmental Information Act, to successfully assert the right to information from a company which supervised nationwide funding schemes for biological safety research as a project sponsor on behalf of the federal government (Hesse Higher Administrative Court, judgment of 31 October 2013, case 6 A 1734/13.Z).

The media’s rights to information from public undertakings can also be derived from the press laws of the federal states , irrespective of the organisational structure.

Last year, for example, a ruling was made that a private foundation is obliged to provide information like a public authority if it performs public tasks, uses public funds for that purpose and the public sector has a controlling influence over the foundation (Rostock Higher Regional Court, decision of 11 July 2022, case 6 U 19/22).

Back in 2017, the Federal Court of Justice upheld a claim by the press to information from a public limited company providing services in the area of services of general interest and controlled by the public sector, due to suspicion of indirect campaign financing (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 16 March 2017, case I ZR 13/16).

Public undertakings are also subject to parliamentary rights to request information and conduct questioning, which are rooted in the federal constitution and the constitutions of the federal states."
Noerr,How important is the new Whistleblower Protection Act to public undertakings?,"Public undertakings are also subject to parliamentary rights to request information and conduct questioning, which are rooted in the federal constitution and the constitutions of the federal states.

In the federal constitution, for example, Article 38(1) sentence 2 is authoritative.

Although the relevant government at federal or state level is obliged to provide information, the information to be provided may ultimately also be about public undertakings.

Information on government action must also be disclosed if the government uses third parties to perform its functions.

Only in this way can the Bundestag control the budgetary and economic management of the government, also with regard to the activities of the public sector in the context of its participation in private-sector enterprises.

Thus, the federal government was obliged to provide information to complaining members of the Bundestag on financing agreements for requirement plan agreements as well as profitability calculations for the Stuttgart 21 rail project, which were available to Deutsche Bahn AG (Federal Constitutional Court, judgment of 7 November 2017, case 2 BvE 2/11).

Parliamentary committees of enquiry should also be mentioned in this context.

They have far-reaching rights to information and to investigate, which are comparable to the powers of a public prosecutor in criminal proceedings.

Finally, there are rights to information under budgetary law.

For example, the Federal Budget Code ( Bundeshaushaltsordnung ) obliges the federal government to inform the Bundestag about all fundamental and essential questions concerning the federal government’s holdings in private-sector companies.

Furthermore, obligations to disclose information to the Audit Offices ( Rechnungshöfe ) must be observed.

The Federal Audit Office ( Bundesrechnungshof ) must be provided with documents it deems necessary for the fulfilment of its duties, and it must be provided with the information requested.

It may also inspect the books and records of certain public enterprises.

The Federal Audit Office not only communicates its audit results to public authorities, but may also grant third parties access to the audit result if it is final.

II.

Significance of the new Whistleblower Protection Act for public undertakings’ already limited control over information In principle, the Whistleblower Protection Act affects all undertakings equally.

The newly created legal certainty for whistleblowers (see here ) limits companies’ control over their own information as a whole.

However, there are also special features for public undertakings.

This is because certain breaches falling within the material scope of the Act can only be committed by civil servants or employees of public undertakings.

These include, among others, provisions on the acceptance of advantages and bribery in the Criminal Code as well as provisions of public procurement law.

In addition, the Whistleblower Protection Act breaches the civil servants’ obligation of confidentiality under civil service law.

Overall, this results in a different, ultimately broader scope of application for public undertakings than for private companies.

The existing rights to information and disclosure from public undertakings could gain new relevance through the Whistleblower Protection Act.

Third parties (press, members of the Bundestag , audit offices, competing private companies, private individuals) have so far sometimes simply failed to assert claims because they had no basis for doing so.

The new Whistleblower Protection Act could change this.

In the future, under its protection, more sensitive company information is likely to be disclosed to the public, which will then enable interested third parties to make their requests for information and disclosure in a targeted manner.

This in turn could encourage company employees to report further abuses."
Noerr,How important is the new Whistleblower Protection Act to public undertakings?,"This in turn could encourage company employees to report further abuses.

The existing rights to information and disclosure and the new Whistleblower Protection Act could therefore interconnect and reinforce each other.

Public undertakings’ even more restricted control over information due to these new circumstances should lead to a new way of dealing with information, especially in a company crisis following a compliance violation.

Since third-party access to sensitive information cannot, or can no longer, be controlled with sufficient certainty, it may be advisable (more so than at private companies) to proactively publicise compliance violations and to make transparent handling of compliance violations part of the corporate strategy."
Noerr,Financial Implications and Increased Documentation Obligations Tax Haven Defense Act in Germany,"The newly introduced Tax Haven Defense Act (“ THDA ”; Steueroasenabwehrgesetz) came into force on January 1, 2022.

The aim of the law is to combat tax evasion, tax avoidance and unfair tax competition with the help of tax havens.

By sanctioning business relations in non-cooperative jurisdictions (""Tax Havens""), the shifting of income or the flow of money to Tax Havens is to be made more difficult and economically unattractive for companies.

Take Aways Companies should build the monitoring of business relationships or participations in or with reference to so-called non-cooperative jurisdictions into their internal control system so that these business relationships can already be identified at the initiation stage and an early exchange on the tax consequences can take place with the tax department or the tax advisor.

If there are business relations or participations in or with reference to so-called non-cooperative jurisdictions, it is mandatory to set up a standardised documentation system, since according to Section 12 THDA records - similar to transfer pricing documentation - must be prepared at the latest one year after the end of the business year and must be transmitted to the locally competent tax office or the Federal Central Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt für Steuern ) without request.

Which Countries or Territories are Considered Tax Havens?

The relevant jurisdictions to which the THDA applies are updated once a year at the end of the year in the Tax Havens Defense Ordinance (last updated on December 16, 2022 Link ).

The measures under the THDA are generally applicable as of 1 January of the following year after a state has been included in the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions.

Currently (as of December 16, 2022), the following states are on the list: American Samoa (since December 24, 2021), Anguilla (since December 21, 2022), Bahamas (since December 21, 2022), Fiji (since December 24, 2021), Guam (since December 24, 2021), Palau (since December 24, 2021), Panama (since 24 December 2021), Samoa (since December 24, 2021), Trinidad and Tobago (since December 24, 2021), Turks and Caicos Islands (since December 21, 2022), American Virgin Islands (since December 24, 2021), Vanuatu (since December 24, 2021).

EU List of Non-Cooperative States It should be noted, however, that the domestically applicable annually updated list is based on the EU list of non-cooperative countries and territories for tax purposes (so-called "" black list ""), which is updated twice a year.

After the EU added four countries to its ""black list"" on February 14, 2023, the following countries are expected to be included in the next amending regulation: British Virgin Islands Costa Rica Marshall Islands Russia

However, it is important to keep an eye not only on the ""black list"", but also on the EU's so-called "" grey list "".

This lists countries that have been given deadlines for adapting promised changes to their laws.

Both the ""black list"" and the ""grey list"" can be accessed the EU-Homage ( Link ).

When Does the Tax Haven Defense Act Take Effect?

The THDA applies to business relationships or shareholdings in or with reference to a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction.

This also applies to assumed debt relationships with permanent establishments abroad (Section 1 (4) Foreign Tax Act (“ FTA ”; Außensteuergesetz )) as well as to transactions that are merely based on an agreement under company law.

A shareholding relationship is therefore not a prerequisite for the law to apply.

In principle, the measures are to be applied from 1 January of the following year after a state has been included in the list of non-cooperative countries.

However, individual measures are to be applied with a time lag of two or three years.

The points in time from which the measures take effect are regulated in Section 3 (2) THDA.

What Are the Consequences of the Application of the Tax Haven Defense Act?"
Noerr,Financial Implications and Increased Documentation Obligations Tax Haven Defense Act in Germany,"The points in time from which the measures take effect are regulated in Section 3 (2) THDA.

What Are the Consequences of the Application of the Tax Haven Defense Act?

In the event of a business relationship or a shareholding in or with reference to a tax haven, the following sanctioning measures come into consideration in Germany, whereby the THDA takes precedence over double taxation agreements (Section 1 (3) THDA, keyword ""treaty override""): Tougher taxation of additions: Income from a direct or indirect (share-)holding in a tax haven is taxed by addition in Germany, irrespective of its activity in the home country.

This shall apply with effect from the following year after inclusion in the list.

Withholding tax measures: The withholding tax of 15% is to be withheld on payments to a company resident in a Tax Haven based on the following benefits: No. 1: Financing relationships, but not globally securitised and centrally administered bearer bonds and debt instruments tradable on a recognised exchange No. 2: Insurance benefits No. 3 Provision of services, but no transfer of use No. 4: Trade in goods or services No. 5: Letting/disposal of rights entered in a domestic public book or register (so-called ""register cases"")

There is no exemption limit, i.e. every payment leads to the deduction of withholding tax!

This applies with effect from the following year after inclusion in the list.

Measures in the case of profit distribution and sale of shares: Tax exemptions or tax concessions for income from a shareholding in a company in a non-cooperative state are denied (Section 8b Corporate Income Tax Act, relief in double taxation agreements, partial income procedure, flat rate withholding tax)

This shall apply with effect from the third subsequent year after inclusion in the list.

Prohibition of deduction of business e xpenses:

Expenses from business transactions may not reduce the profit or the surplus of income over income-related expenses in Germany.

However, this is subordinate to the aggravated attribution taxation and the withholding tax measures as well as Section 49 German Income Tax Act and the normal attribution taxation.

The prohibition of deduction of business expenses shall apply with effect from the fourth subsequent year after inclusion in the list.

Increased Obligations to Cooperate Furthermore, the applicability of the THDA results in increased obligations to cooperate.

Records - similar to transfer pricing documentation - are to be prepared no later than one year after the end of the business year and transmitted without request to the locally competent tax office and, in cases where the requirements of Section 138a FC are met, to the Federal Central Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt für Steuern ).

Section 12 THDA provides, in addition to the existing (general) duties of cooperation under Section 90 FC, for increased duties of cooperation for business transactions within the meaning of Section 7 THDA.

Pursuant to Section 12 (2) THDA, the following records must be kept: Presentation of the business relationships as well as underlying contracts and agreed contractual terms; Listing of agreements with reference to intangible assets The functions performed and risks assumed by the parties involved in the business relationship, the material assets used; The chosen business strategies as well as the market and competitive conditions that are relevant for taxation; The natural persons who are directly or indirectly partners or shareholders of a company in the non-cooperative tax jurisdiction with which the taxpayer has a business relationship (for an exception to this, see Section 12 (2) no. 8 THDA).

In practice, the most important consequence of a violation of the record-keeping obligations pursuant to Section 12 (3) THDA is the opening of the tax authority's power of assessment."
Noerr,Financial Implications and Increased Documentation Obligations Tax Haven Defense Act in Germany,"In practice, the most important consequence of a violation of the record-keeping obligations pursuant to Section 12 (3) THDA is the opening of the tax authority's power of assessment.

Conclusion With the tax consequences resulting from the law, the legislator achieves that business relations, participations or investments in countries designated as Tax Havens are economically unviable.

Particularly with regard to the countries on the ""grey list"" and companies with production facilities and sales companies located there, the effects are immense if they are included in the regulation, which is amended annually at the end of the year.

It is therefore strongly recommended to keep a constant eye on both the EU black and grey lists and to closely analyse the tax consequences of the THDA when selecting business partners or the local establishment of subsidiary or permanent establishments.

Processes for auditing business partners and complying with possible withholding tax measures should therefore be established at an early stage.

In order to comply with the increased duties to cooperate, a standardised documentation system must be established for the business relationships concerned."
Noerr,Tightened Obligations to Submit Transfer Pricing Documentation to German Tax Authorities,"The DAC 7 Implementation Act has resulted in significant changes in the area of the reasons for submitting transfer pricing documentation pursuant to Section 90 (3) Fiscal Code of Germany (“ FC ”; Abgabenordnung ) as well as the submission deadlines.

These changes affect financial years that are already in progress, although the new Section 90 (4) FC is in principle only applicable to taxes arising after December 31, 2024.

Old Legal Situation Previously, according to Section 90 (3) sentence 5 FC (old version), the transfer pricing documentation - in the form of the ""master file"" and the ""local file"" - generally only had to be submitted for the purpose of a tax audit and even then only upon request within 60 days.

Normatively, the discretion of the tax authority with regard to the request for submission was largely limited to submission within the scope of the tax audit by using the term ""shall"".

Like optional provisions, mandatory provisions give the tax authorities discretionary powers.

However, the ""shall"" provision limits this considerably.

Thus, the tax authority could only deviate from the regulated case - the submission within the scope of a tax audit - within the scope of its discretion in atypical cases.

New Legal Situation In contrast, the new Section 90 (4) sentence 1 FC now formulates, using ""may at any time"", that submission may also be requested in other cases - for example, in the context of the tax assessment.

The change of the previous legal situation to an optional provision means that the request for submission within the scope of the tax audit no longer has to be the rule.

Instead, the tax authority has a much broader discretion, which is further emphasised by the use of ""at any time"".

In addition, the tax auditor no longer has to request the documentation anyway due to the new regulation.

This is because the obligation to submit the documentation pursuant to Section 90 (4) sentence 2 FC (new version) is already triggered by the announcement of the tax audit order.

Regardless of the reason for the obligation to submit the records - whether as a result of a request or an audit order - the records must be submitted within a period of 30 days.

This is a considerable shortening of the previous deadline.

These tightening is by no means a problem only for financial years from January 1, 2025.

Because the new regulations also apply to old cases if a tax audit order is issued for these financial years after December 31, 2024.

The aggravation becomes particularly clear when looking at a timeline: Conclusion The German legislator has tightened the obligation to submit transfer pricing documentation in terms of content and time.

It can be assumed that the transfer pricing documentation will not only be requested during the tax audit, as has been the case so far.

Instead, it must be expected that such a request can already be made during the tax assessment.

Against the background that there is only a deadline of 30 days for the submission of the records, a preparation parallel to the tax return is recommended.

For permanently tax audited companies - for which the last audit period was 2018 to 2020 - another problem arises with regard to the subsequent audit period 2021 to 2023.

This is because the tax return for the last relevant business year 2023 will probably not be filed until 2025.

Therefore, Section 90 (4) FC (new version) already applies to the tax audit order for the period 2021 to 2023.

As a result, the transfer pricing documentation for the years 2021 to 2023 must already be submitted on the basis of the tax audit order - without any further request by the tax authority - within 30 days of notification of the tax audit order.

Since the preparation effort for the transfer pricing documentation is very high, the transfer pricing documentation should already be prepared now - parallel to the preparation of the tax returns."
Noerr,Additional information on unresolved issues in the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"On 6 June 2023, the European Commission (“ Commission ”) published non-binding questions and answers (“ Q&As ”) on EU Regulation 2022/2560, which governs the Commission’s control of foreign subsidies (Foreign Subsidies Regulation – “ FSR ”) and will enter into force from 12 July 2023.

The Q&A also addresses some issues of the draft FSR Implementing Regulation which the Commission will finalize before July.

The FSR is of particular relevance to companies engaged in mergers and acquisitions and public tenders, for which the Q&As summarised below are likely to be of particular interest.

Pursuant to Article 21 FSR, a notification is required for all transactions signed between 12 July 2023 and 12 October 2023 (and closed on or after 12 October 2023) that constitute concentrations within the meaning of Article 20 FSR (mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures (“ JVs ”)).

The prohibition to close (standstill obligation) pursuant to Article 24 FSR also applies to such transactions.

In contrast, the notification obligation applies neither to transactions signed before 12 July 2023 nor to those that are agreed on 12 July 2023 or later but are closed before 12 October 2023.

Companies impacted by this regulation are now explicitly advised by the Commission to contact it in good time before making notifications, as is usual and established practice in merger control proceedings.

How efficient and pragmatic pre-filing contacts will be in FSR matters remains to be seen.

The notification thresholds pursuant to Article 20(3)(b) FSR are to be calculated based only on financial contributions by third countries granted in the three years preceding the signing of the agreement, the announcement of the public takeover bid or the acquisition of a controlling interest.

Importantly: whether or not the financial contributions were granted at market conditions is not relevant – all financial contributions count towards the notification thresholds.

Proceeds from sales of goods and services to companies attributable to a third country and tax relief granted to companies of third countries may also be considered financial contributions.

A financial contribution is deemed to have been granted from the moment the recipient acquires a legal right to receive it.

Thus, the relevant date is not necessarily that of the actual disbursement.

Further clarification has been given on some previously unresolved issues regarding turnover calculation in connection with establishing a JV: The FSR applies only to “full-function joint ventures” (i.e. those that perform all the functions of an independent economic entity on a permanent basis).

When a JV is established, the FSR’s turnover threshold is met if (i) the JV is established in the EU and (ii) the total turnover of the joint venture itself in the EU is at least EUR 500 million.

It has now been clarified that newly established JVs (greenfield JVs) are definitely excluded from the scope of application of the FSR because they do not meet the turnover threshold on a stand-alone basis.

Thus, unlike in EU merger control, the decisive factor is the stand-alone turnover of a JV – not the turnover of the parent companies, even in the case of a change from sole to joint control.

The final Implementing Regulation, including the notification forms in the annex, will be published in a timely manner before the FSR becomes applicable on 12 July 2023.

The Implementing Regulation will clarify practical and procedural aspects of the application of the FSR and contains important guidance on required notification of M&A transactions.

Noerr,Romania: Procurement principles to obtain project funding under the PNRR,"Romania's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), designed to ensure an optimal balance between EU priorities and Romania's development needs, provides significant opportunities for the private sector to benefit from financing to build and/or consolidate infrastructure capacity.

However, whether expenditures incurred in a development project are eligible for funding depends on how precisely the private beneficiary has developed and organised its procurement procedures.

In this context, private beneficiaries, which are not public authorities or assimilated authorities and to which public procurement legislation does not apply, must pay particular attention to the manner in which they select partners to collaborate on projects financed with PNRR funds, keeping in mind that the management authority could refuse to fund non-compliant procurements.

Practical issues in acquisitions organised by private beneficiaries The legislation and official guidelines available at the moment do not provide clarity on each stage involved in a procurement procedure nor on how the general principles of public procurement should be followed.

Thus, in practice, many controversies have arisen concerning the boundary between procurement procedures organised by private beneficiaries and the general rules applicable to traditional public procurement.

Only a few economic operators benefit from internal procurement policies, usually only those that generally work with contracting authorities or have implemented internal rules on procurement.

In the absence of express regulations, procedures organised by private beneficiaries are established on a case-by-case basis according to customary practices.

Consequently, we propose addressing certain practical issues related to the principle of transparency, a principle that must be followed by private beneficiaries in their procurement procedures.

The principle of transparency is the guarantee for interested economic operators that the procurement procedure will be organised and carried out properly and that principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination, etc. will be observed.

In order to comply with this principle, the procurement documents must not contain restrictive requirements and must be accessible to all economic operators interested in taking part in the procurement procedure (notice of commencement of the procurement, tender book, etc.).

One problem encountered in practice is unclear or incomplete tenders, which often lead to delays in finalising the procurement and even to the disqualification of certain bidders.

Not all bidders comply with certain standards of tender writing, which causes private beneficiaries to be unable to compare the tenders, or even to be obliged to penalise bidders that have not understood the project requirements by disqualifying their tenders.

Conversely, when the tender book is overloaded with all technical details related to the project (e.g. indicating the technical specifications of a certain type of equipment according to the technical data sheet or including the timetable for the execution of the work directly in the tender book), the contributions of the tendering economic operators are drastically reduced.

Excessively detailed tender books may jeopardise the authenticity of the procurement if the private beneficiary's procurement file contains only one admissible tender, possibly identical to all the technical specifications of the tender book.

The wording of the tender book plays a crucial role in supporting tenderers in drawing up their technical and financial tenders, and it is advisable to make the project structure as clear as possible, indicating each piece of equipment to be supplied or each activity/work needed for the execution of the project."
Noerr,Romania: Procurement principles to obtain project funding under the PNRR,"In this manner, each economic operator interested in participating in the procedure has all the data necessary to clearly understand the purpose of the procurement and decide on its own ability to fulfil it without the need for further clarification, and the tenders in the organising private beneficiary’s procurement file will reflect this fact.

Each tenderer is also given the opportunity to present its own proposals for implementing the project in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the private beneficiary, thus reducing the risk of receiving only one tender identical to the provisions of the tender book.

The principle of transparency is further reflected in various documents that become public/are communicated, such as the report on the procedure.

The purpose of this report is to check all the admissibility criteria of the tenders and compare them in order to declare the winning tender.

Publishing this report or sending it to the tenderers safeguards their right to understand the reasons for selecting the winning tender and their ability to contest this result.

On the other hand, the principle of transparency is not absolute, but is subject to certain limitations in terms of information that could distort the competitive environment.

Not all the information received from tenderers can be made public, as publishing some information could be detrimental to tenderers’ business.

Article 57 of Law no 98/2016 on public procurement (which, as stated above, applies to procurement by private beneficiaries only in principle) reveals the categories of information in technical and financial proposals that may be confidential: personal data, technical or trade secrets or information protected by an intellectual property right.

It is even more difficult to determine what information should not be disclosed since tenderers do not indicate the information as confidential in most cases.

In this context, it is advisable to analyse each tender on a case-by-case basis and to draft the procurement report protecting the confidentiality of the abovementioned categories of information as well as possible.

Transparency in the context of acquisition value The public nature of a procurement process also extends to the estimated value of the procurement.

In order to facilitate the process of verifying eligible expenditure, certain official guidelines oblige private beneficiaries to state the estimated acquisition value for each category of eligible expenditure.

The question that arises in practice is how this distribution of the total amount by category of fundable expenditure will be reflected in the tenders.

Although in principle it is not mandatory to prepare a tender form (to be used by tenderers and attached to the tender), this may be an optimal procedure for projects requiring more than one type of equipment and/or implementation stage.

Thus, private beneficiaries may publish, together with their tender books, tender forms containing the categories of eligible expenditure to be completed by the tenderers and attached to the financial proposal, ensuring a correlation between the amounts estimated by the private beneficiary and the winning tender.

Conclusion Organising a procurement procedure can be a challenge for private beneficiaries in the absence of rules setting out in detail all aspects of how tenders should be submitted and evaluated.

However, a clear procurement file, which follows the general principles of procurement procedures, determines the eligibility of project expenditures and will also help the competent authority to analyse the eligibility of expenditures and approve the funding requested by private beneficiaries."
Noerr,Regulatory framework for FinTechs in Germany in 2023,"The regulatory framework is undoubtedly of utmost importance for fintech companies and investors as regulatory requirements often represent a significant market entry hurdle, which ultimately determines whether fintechs can offer their innovative business models.

In the sixth issue of the Financial Technology Law Review published in May 2023, Dr Jens H. Kunz addresses some of the key regulatory issues for the fintech industry in Germany such as financial and licence requirements for typical fintech business models as well as guidelines and main legal provisions applicable to offering fintech and related services.

Current topics discussed in the paper include peer-to-peer lending, cryptoassets and MiCA Regulation, decentralized finance (DeFi) as well as initial coin offerrings.

This contribution may be of interest not only to German companies, but also to foreign companies and investors who intend to enter the German fintech market and seek information on regulatory requirements for cross-border provision of services to German customers.

Noerr,The draft bill to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction,"The federal government’s plans to further strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction are taking shape.

Following the key points paper that was published in January 2023, the draft bill on the act to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction is now available.

In this article, we take a closer look at what are arguably the biggest changes compared to the existing system, i.e. the possibility of using English as the language of the proceedings throughout the court instances and the confidentiality of the proceedings.

We already analysed the key issues paper in detail here: Plans to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction (noerr.com) English as the language of proceedings According to the draft bill, the Bundesländer will be authorized to set up special divisions at the Regional Courts ( Landgerichte ) where proceedings can be conducted entirely in English.

In addition, the Bundesländer are to be allowed to set up specialised senates for certain commercial disputes at the Higher Regional Courts ( Oberlandesgerichte ).

These trial courts, referred to as “commercial courts”, will then have first instance jurisdiction for certain commercial disputes and will also be able to conduct their proceedings in English.

The idea behind this approach is to enable certain courts to concentrate on and specialise in specific subjects to ensure high-quality jurisprudence tailored to typical problems arising in commercial disputes.

In the future, it will not only be possible to conduct the oral proceedings in English, but also to draft both the written submissions and the judgment handed down by the court in English.

This would be a big step towards the internationalisation of German court proceedings.

Under the current law, only the hearing itself can be held in English, and this only if both parties agree and waive the use of an interpreter.

Written submissions and decisions such as judgments or orders currently must be drafted in German.

Due to these restrictions, there have only been a few cases in which the parties have made use of the option to conduct proceedings in English.

However, the issue of adequate and sufficient language skills already came up in the past and it is still unclear how the judiciary intends to ensure the linguistic quality of the hearings and the decisions handed down in English for the newly introduced English-language Commercial Courts.

The draft bill now also provides that appeal proceedings can be conducted in English in the future.

This represents a major change compared to the current legal situation and should contribute to legal certainty, especially for international parties.

Indeed, under the current law, the English language cannot be used in courts of second instance.

This has not exactly contributed to German courts being attractive as a dispute resolution forum at an international level.

Even in those of the Bundesländer where so-called commercial courts have already been installed at the level of the regional courts through special allocation in the regional laws, such as in the cities of Stuttgart and Mannheim in Baden-Württemberg, appeal proceedings are currently only held in German.

Regarding the third instance for appeals on points of law, the draft bill further provides that proceedings conducted in English at the previous instances can also be conducted in English at the competent senates at the Federal Court of Justice.

However, it is envisaged that the competent senate of the Federal Court of Justice will have to agree to proceedings being conducted in English.

In connection with the conduct of proceedings, the draft bill now contains a provision on the holding of an organizational meeting.

In arbitration proceedings, a so-called case management conference involving the parties and the arbitral tribunal already is regularly held.

At these conferences matters such as deadlines for written pleadings and the date of the oral hearing are discussed and coordinated."
Noerr,The draft bill to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction,"At these conferences matters such as deadlines for written pleadings and the date of the oral hearing are discussed and coordinated.

This facilitates the planning of the proceedings for all parties involved.

It is therefore a great step forward that the draft bill now expressly provides the option of such organizational meeting for proceedings before the Commercial Courts.

Confidentiality In the German judicial system, the principle of public hearings is a procedural law maxim.

Thus, oral hearings before the courts are generally open to the public, although there are restrictions on this principle under specific laws.

In the past, this principle has been perceived as a disadvantage compared to arbitration, where closed hearings and thus confidentiality of the proceedings are usually considered to be essential elements.

These criteria have often proven to be decisive for the parties’ decision on which dispute resolution mechanism to choose.

The disclosure of a major civil dispute can cause lasting damage to a business relationship, and to the reputation of a company.

The current legal situation thus does not give companies the necessary assurance that their internal affairs or trade secrets will not be disclosed in legal proceedings.

The draft bill now provides for the possibility of classifying certain information in international commercial disputes before German courts as confidential as of the filing of the statement of claim at the request of one of the parties.

This means that all the parties have to treat the proceedings as confidential, which should also increase the attractiveness of German courts as dispute resolution forum.

Furthermore, there is the possibility of explicitly excluding the public from hearings.

This combination of an exception to the principle of hearings being public and the broad application of the law on the protection of trade secrets meets the desire for more confidentiality frequently expressed by internationally operating parties.

Conclusion: The draft bill is a step in the right direction towards strengthening Germany as place of jurisdiction.

The fact that German arbitration law is also to be revised almost in parallel (cf. the recently published key issues paper on this topic: BMJ | Pressemitteilungen | Modernisierung des deutschen Schiedsverfahrensrechts: Bundesjustizminister legt Vorschläge vor , German version only) shows that the Federal Government is comprehensively addressing the issue of Germany’s attractiveness as place of jurisdiction."
Noerr,Bill to Transpose the NIS2 Directive,"The Network and Information Security Directive 2.0 ( NIS2 Directive, full text ), passed in December 2022, is currently the subject of debate almost as heated as that regarding the General Data Protection Regulation in its day.

The Directive sets minimum harmonising standards for the Member States, which in turn must each transpose them into national law.

Companies are therefore observing the national transposition acts closely.

In Germany, a very early draft of the bill to transpose the NIS2 Directive and to regulate essential features of information security management in the federal administration ( NIS-2-Umsetzungs- und Cybersicherheitsstärkungsgesetz ) has now become public .

The bill completely revises and extends Germany’s Act on the Federal Office for Information Security.

As part of the bill to comprehensively reform this Act (the “Bill”), the number of sections will increase more than fourfold.

Many provisions are aimed at private companies.

In addition, the Bill contains numerous specifications and requirements for the federal government’s information security management.

A law that was originally only intended to regulate the tasks and powers of an authority is thus increasingly becoming a comprehensive legal code for cybersecurity in Germany.

The following article provides an overview of the requirements that could be imposed on private companies.

What will change for those concerned?

The Bill takes over the full list of minimum security requirements from Article 21 NIS2 Directive.

The intensity of the required measures will vary between the categories of entities for reasons of proportionality.

Operators of critical facilities will be subject to the strictest requirements (Article 30(3) of the Bill).

Although the Federal Office for Information Security has comprehensively supported the fairly concise requirements of the Act to date with publications (such as on the use of systems for attack detection ), the list of requirements is now clearly defined: Concepts related to risk analysis and security for information systems Managing security incidents Business continuity such as backup management and disaster recovery, as well as crisis management Security measures in the acquisition, development and maintenance of information technology systems, components and processes, including vulnerability management and disclosure Concepts and procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber security risk management measures Basic cyber hygiene procedures and cyber security training, Concepts and procedures for the use of cryptography and encryption Staff security, access control concepts and asset management Use of multi-factor authentication or continuous authentication solutions, secure voice, video and text communications and, where appropriate, secure emergency communication systems within the facility Key topic: Supply chain This list is supplemented by another controversial aspect, demanding “ supply chain security, including security-related aspects of the relationships between individual entities and their direct providers or service providers ”.

This makes it clear that entities subject to the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security will have to enter into concise contractual agreements with their service providers in future in order to comprehensively implement cyber security.

Management’s responsibility for cyber risk management These legal requirements for cyber risk management must be approved by the management and implementation of the requirements must be monitored by the management (section 38(1) of the Bill).

This provision once again emphasises what has long been recognised in the German law on limited companies and stock corporations, namely that cyber security is the management’s job.

If the managing directors of the entities concerned do not comply with this obligation, they are liable to the entity for any resulting damage (section 38(2) of the Bill)."
Noerr,Bill to Transpose the NIS2 Directive,"If the managing directors of the entities concerned do not comply with this obligation, they are liable to the entity for any resulting damage (section 38(2) of the Bill).

The German legislator is thus meeting the European legislators’ demand for personal liability of the managing directors to the company, which tallies with the system of internal liability of the corporate bodies under German stock corporation and limited liability company law even without a special legal standardisation in the Bill.

It is also noteworthy that the Bill’s explanatory memorandum clarifies that both claims for recourse and fines will be covered by the concept of damage in the liability rule of section 38(2) of the Bill.

The ability to seek recourse against executive board members in the form of corporate fines is highly controversial in the legal literature and, where published case law exists, has thus far been rejected by the courts with reference to the penalising nature of the fine.

But the Bill provides for further penalty instruments to encourage management to comply with the legally required risk-management measures.

In the case of especially important entities, the Bill even goes so far as to allow the Federal Office for Information Security to temporarily ban directors from performing their managerial duties if they disregard the Office’s orders (section 64(6) no. 2 of the Bill).

Procedure for reporting security incidents In the case of security incidents, there will be a four-stage reporting process in future: (i) early initial report within 24 hours, (ii) an update within 72 hours, (iii) ad-hoc responses to enquiries from the Federal Office, and (iv) a final report within one month.

Finally, the Bill sets out a significant extension of the scope of application.

See below for more details.

Completely revised entity categories To date, the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security has used knows “operators of critical infrastructure”, “providers of digital services” and “companies of special public interest”.

The Bill greatly expands the list of those potentially concerned.

Although the Federal Ministry of the Interior obviously tried to simplify the complex definitions in the NIS2 Directive when drafting the Bill, legal practitioners now face a new level of definitions that are hard to understand.

Accordingly, the Bill will have the following categories of entities in future (see section 28): Operators of critical facilities : What constitutes a critical facility will be defined in a future ordinance.

Thus, it is clear the German legislator will base its definitions very closely on the previous critical infrastructure.

Operators of especially important entities : Firstly, these are large companies according to the European Commission’s definition of SMEs from specific sectors (such as traffic and transport, banking or healthcare).

Here, too, a statutory instrument will specify more details, which will presumably be largely based on Annex I of the NIS2 Directive.

Regardless of size, specialist companies such as DNS service providers also fall into this category, as well as midsize companies providing telecommunications services or publicly accessible telecommunications networks.

Operators of critical facilities are also assigned to this category.

Operators of important entities : This is to initially include medium-sized enterprises according to the European Commission’s definition of SMEs from the sectors mentioned above.

It also includes medium-sized and large enterprises in other sectors (such as logistics, manufacturing or production).

This list will probably be largely based on Annex II of the NIS2 Directive.

The previous companies of special public interest in categories 1 and 3 (known as the foreign trade and incident regulation special public interest companies) also fall into this category."
Noerr,Bill to Transpose the NIS2 Directive,"The previous companies of special public interest in categories 1 and 3 (known as the foreign trade and incident regulation special public interest companies) also fall into this category.

Interestingly, companies due to be given this status because of their power to add value (called value-added special public interest companies or special public interest companies 2) will be removed from the Bill.

These lists are just examples.

The Bill contains exceptions and also some specific entities that are to be assigned in the same way.

Penalty regime There is a range of fines, as there has been to date (see section 60 of the Bill).

Fines of up to €20 million can be imposed for breaches of enforceable orders.

In the case of important entities, the fine is €7 million or up to 1.4% of the company’s total worldwide turnover in the previous financial year.

For operators of especially important entities and critical facilities, the fine is up to €10 million or up to 2% of the previous year’s turnover.

What else is planned?

The European legislator has given the Member States time until 17 October 2024 to transpose the NIS2 Directive into national law.

In view of the current state of threats in cyberspace , it is hard to imagine the German legislator will actually take all that time.

The current draft assumes the amending act in question will be passed in spring 2024.

In addition, the European Union has given the Member States more homework to do in the form of the CER Directive .

This act of law aims to increase the physical security of critical entities, albeit the exact scope of application is still to be defined.

Since the end of last year, the key points of an umbrella act on critical infrastructure have been available.

A first glance at the draft paper suggests there will also be stricter legal obligations in this area.

Noerr,EU regulation establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism has entered into force,"The Regulation establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter “CBAM”) has been published in the EU Official Journal on 16 May 2023 and thus officially entered into force the day after, on 17 May 2023.

The publication thus triggers the timely adoption process for related delegated and implementing acts.

To provide businesses and authorities with legal certainty and stability, the CBAM will be implemented gradually and will initially apply only to a selected number of goods at high risk of carbon leakage: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen as well as some precursors and downstream products made from cement, iron, steel, and aluminium (see Annex I of the CBAM Regulation for the concerned CN codes).

Only imports of these goods from non-EU countries, with the exclusion of third countries who participate in the EU’s Emissions Trading System (hereafter “ETS”) or have a similar emission trading system are covered.

The mechanism does not, however, establish quantitative limits on imports, therefore trade flows are not restricted.

The CBAM will gradually replace the EU ETS for the goods covered by the new mechanism, and the corresponding phasing-out of ETS free allowances will take place in parallel with the phasing-in of the CBAM, starting in 2026 and ending in 2034.

During the transitional phase, which starts on 1 October 2023, EU importers will be obliged to report greenhouse gas emissions (hereafter “GHG”) embedded in their imports on a quarterly basis.

The last CBAM quarterly report should be submitted by 31 January 2026.

From 1 January 2026, the CBAM will apply in its integrity, obliging EU importers to declare, by 31 May each year, the quantity of goods and the embedded emissions imported into the Union the previous year, and to surrender so-called CBAM certificates, whose price will be calculated based on the weekly average auction price of the EU ETS allowances, expressed in euro/tonne of CO2 emitted.

The first CBAM declaration should thus be submitted by 31 May 2027.

During the transitional phase, the European Commission (hereafter “Commission”) will monitor the functioning of the CBAM, with a review of the CBAM planned before the end of the transitional phase, by mid-2025.

As part of this evaluation, the Commission will assess the product scope of the regulation, with a view to including further goods by 2030.

In addition to this evaluation, the Commission will adopt implementing acts, which will specify the rules and requirements for the reporting of emissions and the procedures for the submission of the declarations.

The draft implementing act should be published in the second week of June 2023 and will be adopted by the Commission after consultation of the so-called CBAM Committee, which will be composed of experts from EU Member States.

Noerr,"Similar, yet Different – the Rendering of Evidence Before the UPC","On 1 June 23, the UPC finally takes up its work.

The UPC’s procedural framework, which parties are about to witness practically, shows vast similarities but also some distinct and important differences to German procedural law.

As laid out below, this is particularly true when it comes to the evidence procedure.

The evidence procedure before the UPC is governed solely by the Rules of Procedure, Art. 53 (2) UPCA, Rules 170 et seq. of the RoP. As in German patent proceedings, the evidence procedure can be divided into the request for evidence (the offer of evidence by the parties), the taking of evidence and the assessment of evidence.

I. Request for Evidence The party making a factual claim that is disputed or likely to be disputed by the other party must offer proof of this fact, Rule 171 No. 1 of the RoP.

This offer of proof is the party’s request for evidence.

Unlike in the German system, evidence does not have to be offered only when the opponent disputes a fact, but already at the time when this fact is presented .

In principle, each new statement of facts in the written pleadings thus requires a simultaneous offer of evidence in order to prevent the opposing party from claiming that the evidence in question is belated.

The kinds of evidence that can be rendered before the UPC are not exhaustively prescribed, cf.

Art.

53 UPCA and Rule 170 of the RoP. According to Art.

53 (1) UPCA, the admissible evidence includes in particular the following means of evidence : Hearing of the parties, obtaining information, production of documents, examination of witnesses, expert reports, taking of visual evidence, comparative tests or trials, and submission of an affidavit (affidavit).

II.

Taking of evidence The rules applicable for the taking of evidence vary based on the respective evidence, Rules 175 to 201 of the RoP. Of particular interest are the rules on witness and expert evidence.

1. Witness evidence The party seeking to offer witness evidence shall lodge a written witness statement or a written summary of the evidence to be given, Rule 175 No. 1 of the RoP. Whether this written summary constitutes evidence of its own kind or is also a prerequisite for the subsequent examination of the witness remains to be clarified.

Rules 176, 177 of the RoP, which regulate the examination of witnesses, can be understood independently of Rule 175 No. 1 of the RoP and do not require a prior written summary of the evidence for the personal examination of the witness.

Until the relationship between Rules 175, 176 and 177 has been clarified by the UPC, the submission of a written summary of the witness' statement is recommended.

The hearing of the witness takes place after their identity has been established and after the witness has declared that they will testify truthfully, Rule 178 No. 1 of the RoP.

If the witness has previously made a written statement, the hearing of the witness begins with the confirmation of the evidence given therein, Rule 178 No. 3 of the RoP. During the examination, not only the presiding judge and the judges of the panel, but also the parties (under the direction of the presiding judge) may put questions to the witness, Rule 178 No. 4 and 5 of the RoP. 2.

Expert evidence The UPCA differentiates between whether an expert was nominated by a party (Rule 181 of the RoP) or appointed by the court (Rule 185 et seq. of the RoP).

The parties may provide expert evidence at their own discretion, Rule 181 No. 1 sentence 1 of the RoP (""any expert evidence that it considers necessary"").

The rules on witness evidence - the already discussed Rules 175 ff. of the RoP - apply accordingly, Rule 181 No. 1 sentence 2 of the RoP.

The appointment of a court expert takes place if the court must resolve a specific technical or other question in relation to the action, Art. 57 UPCA, Rule 185 No. 1 of the RoP. For this purpose, a non-binding list of experts is kept by the court, cf.

Art. 57 (2) UPCA."
Noerr,"Similar, yet Different – the Rendering of Evidence Before the UPC","Art. 57 (2) UPCA.

The parties are free to propose a person for the role of court expert, cf.

Rule 185

No. 2 of the RoP. Parties must also be heard before the expert is appointed, cf.

Rule 185

No. 1 of the RoP. Materially, the differences between the parties' experts and the court-appointed expert are minor.

The expert appointed by the parties also has a duty to assist the court impartially on matters relevant to his area of expertise.

This duty overrides any duty to the party retaining him, Rule 181 No. 2 (a) of the RoP. Also the evidentiary value of the evidence given by court appointed and (mere) party nominated experts is – in principle – equal before the UPC.

This is substantially different under German civil procedure law, where only court-appointed experts can provide evidence, whereas the opinion of a party-appointed expert merely accounts for a substantiated party submission.

III.

Assessment of evidence The principle of free and independent judicial assessment of evidence also applies before the UPC, cf.

Art. 76 (3) UPCA.

In contrast to German procedural law, there however is a fundamental obligation to present the evidence before the UPC, cf.

Rule 172 No. 2 of the RoP. If the party fails to produce the evidence, the court may decide the question of evidence to the detriment of that party, cf.

Rule 172 No. 2 sentence 2 of the RoP.

The UPC is generally free to assess the evidentiary value of various means of evidence.

There is also no distinction between formalized and lesser regulated types of evidence, cf.

Art.

53 UPCA, Rule 170

No. 1 of the RoP.

A distinction e.g. according to the type of evidence is not provided for, cf.

e.g. Rule 104 (e), Rule 112 No. 2 of the RoP.

Thus, if two means of evidence lead to contradictory results, the UPC may give preference to one or the other means of evidence at its own discretion.

The UPC does also not limit some means of evidence to certain procedural constellations , as is the case e.g. for evidence by affidavit or party examination in German civil proceedings.

This is reasonable.

The unlimited admissibility of an affidavit as evidence is particularly suitable to simplify and accelerate the proceedings, especially if the person that would otherwise need to be summoned is unable to attend a hearing.

It is unlikely that this will lead to a substantial amount of questionable evidence being submitted via affidavit.

In that case, the other party would still be able to challenge the contents of the affidavit, in which case the court could still order the personal examination of the witness/expert according to Rule 177 No. 1 of the RoP."
Noerr,Extension of the EU’s Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation and adjustment of the Guidelines for the motor vehicle sector,"On 17 April 2023, the European Commission extended the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation (the “MVBER”), which is actually due to expire on 31 May 2023, for another five years.

The European Commission continues to consider the MVBER an effective tool for ensuring that vertical agreements in the automotive sector comply with EU competition rules.

This is because, in the Commission’s view, the competitive situation in the motor vehicle sector has not changed significantly since its last evaluation in 2010.

However, the Commission also notes that the motor vehicle industry is currently undergoing an ecological and digital transformation (for example, through the increasing establishment of electromobility and the digitalisation of vehicles), which is putting the entire sector under great pressure to transform.

Probably in order to take account of this change during the extended period of validity of the MVBER, the Commission has updated its Supplementary Guidelines for the motor vehicle sector, in particular to address the increasingly important issue of vehicle-generated data.

For example, in its Guidelines the European Commission no longer focuses solely on “technical information”, but only refers more generally to “input”, which in addition to technical information also includes tools, training and vehicle-generated data (see point 62 of the Guidelines).

Another change is that the Commission provides a test for deciding whether the withholding of certain inputs will result in the agreement at issue being caught by Article 101 of the TFEU.

Accordingly, the decisive factors are a) whether the input is essential for repair and maintenance, b) whether the input is made available on a non-discriminatory basis to authorised repairers and independent operators alike, and c) whether the input in question is ultimately used for the repair and maintenance of motor vehicles, or rather for another purpose, such as for the manufacturing of spare parts or tools (see point 62a of the Guidelines).

Insofar as the withholding of input is to be justified on security grounds, the principle of proportionality must be observed (see point 62b of the Guidelines).

Finally, the Supplementary Guidelines contain an explicit warning in point 68a to the effect that the unilateral withholding of certain input, including the withholding of vehicle-generated data, may constitute abuse under Article 102 of the TFEU.

In its updated Guidelines, the Commission has provided guidance to motor vehicle manufacturers on the legal treatment of “inputs” in relation to independent operators.

It is now important for companies to review existing agreements and their practices to see if they meet the new requirements set by the Commission."
Noerr,Social media guidelines in franchise systems,"I. Introduction The use of social media by companies has become increasingly important in recent years.

Also, the vast majority of franchise systems are represented on social media.

Both franchisors and franchisees accounts can be found on various platforms (such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Xing).

In practice, the franchisor regularly gives the franchisee binding instructions through so-called social media guidelines ("" SMG "") as to which platforms the franchisee may be active on and which content he may publish.

This newsletter provides an overview of the legal issues involved.

II.Binding SMG The franchisor may provide binding SMG, provided that the SMG are compatible with (i) antitrust law and (ii) the law governing general terms and conditions.

1. Compatibility with antitrust law It is generally compatible with antitrust law for the franchisor to provide binding SMG to the franchisee, provided that the following principles are observed.

The provisions of the SMG do not breach antitrust law if they ensure the standardised appearance and image of the franchise system; or are necessary to protect the franchisor’s know-how.

Under antitrust law, sales intermediary must in principle be allowed to set up a website and market its goods and services via the internet.

This also includes the franchisee’s right to use social media.

Social media guidelines that interfere with this freedom are in principle in breach of the ban on cartels (Article 101(1) TFEU).

However, there is an exception to this if the interference in question is indispensable for the functioning of the franchise system concerned (so-called Pronuptia case law of the ECJ).

This covers interferences which are necessary either (i) to protect a uniform appearance and image of the franchise system or (ii) to protect the franchisor’s know-how.

The latter is to ensure that the support from the franchisor only benefits the franchisee – to preserve the identity and reputation of the “system” – but not the competition.

The ECJ explicitly states: “ Finally, since advertising helps to define the image of the network’s name or symbol in the eyes of the public, a provision requiring the franchisee to obtain the franchisor’s approval for all advertising is also essential for the maintenance of the network’s identity , so long as that provision concerns only the nature of the advertising .”

According to this ruling, it appears possible under antitrust law to establish binding quality criteria for the protection of a uniform marketing concept (which is to be enforced across platforms and media) and for the protection of the brand of the franchise system and to declare them binding.

2. Compatibility with the law on general terms and conditions The binding provisions of SMG are also compatible with the law on general terms and conditions, insofar as the individual provisions of the SMG withstand a review of their content, i.e. they are compatible with the prohibition of discrimination and the requirement of transparency (section 307 (1) German Civil Code).

a)

No violation of the prohibition of discrimination (Section 307 (1) sentence 1 German Civil Code)

A clause in general terms and conditions is invalid if it unreasonably disadvantages the contractual partner of the user contrary to the principles of good faith.

For the examination of reasonableness, the interests of the respective contracting parties must be weighed, which in turn depends on the type and subject matter as well as purpose of the contract in question.

On the one hand, the following interests of the franchisor are exemplary: Uniformity of the franchise system: The franchisor regularly has an interest in his franchise system appearing uniformly on the market.

In particular, there is an interest in a uniform advertising and marketing concept as well as a uniform brand presence in order to strengthen its market position."
Noerr,Social media guidelines in franchise systems,"In particular, there is an interest in a uniform advertising and marketing concept as well as a uniform brand presence in order to strengthen its market position.

The binding nature of the SMG ensures that the various social media channels and accounts of the franchisees are uniformly designed and thus the franchise system is perceived uniformly by the public.

At the same time, this protects the integrity of the brand from behaviour that damages its reputation and from dilution of the brand essence.

Maximising the potential of social media:

Furthermore, the franchisor regularly has an interest in maximising the potential of social media through SMG.

Specific guidelines on social media presence and behaviour on social media can ensure an optimal presence of the franchise system and its franchisees on social media and increase the overall reach of the franchise system on social media.

Further development of the franchise system: In addition, the franchisor has an interest in the continuous development and further optimisation of its franchise system.

The SMG can ensure that the franchise system continues to develop and remain competitive in the digital market, especially on social media.

In contrast, the interests of the franchisee as an independent entrepreneur are exemplary: Preservation of entrepreneurial independence: The entrepreneur has a particular interest in ensuring that his or her entrepreneurial independence and freedom of economic activity are not excessively and thus unreasonably curtailed.

This also includes the ""whether"" and ""how"" of promotional activities.

In addition, the franchisee has a legal and practical interest in ensuring that the franchisor does not restrict the possibility of effective use of the internet - in particular social media - which is granted to him by antitrust law.

The franchisee also has an interest in being able to present himself authentically and individually on the internet (especially on social media).

No additional financial burden : It is also in the strong interest of the franchisee that the further development and change of the franchise system is not associated with additional major financial burdens which are not simultaneously compensated with improved earnings opportunities.

Application of non-discriminatory criteria: The franchisee also always has an interest in not being treated less favourably than other franchisees in the franchise system.

This requires the establishment and application of uniform, objective, objectively justified, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria regarding the use of social media.

The interests mentioned by way of example are to be weighed against each other within the framework of the balancing of interests .

If the interests of the franchisee do not outweigh the interests of the franchisor, the SMG are appropriate.

The following are examples of possible considerations: No inadmissible restriction of entrepreneurial freedom: An argument against an inadmissible restriction of entrepreneurial freedom by binding SMGs is that they are regularly limited to maintaining the corporate identity of a franchise system and thus a uniform appearance of the system.

The necessary restrictions have to be accepted by the franchisee as a rule (e.g. specifications of the use of the trademark, avoidance of images damaging to the reputation and the like).

As long as the SMG limit themselves to the necessary requirements, the franchisee still has sufficient entrepreneurial freedom to make decisions.

For example, the franchisee can continue to freely design the content of his account and make individual posts within the permissible framework.

No unreasonable financial burden on the franchisee : It should be noted that the implementation of the binding SMG does not contain an unreasonable financial burden on the franchisee."
Noerr,Social media guidelines in franchise systems,"No unreasonable financial burden on the franchisee : It should be noted that the implementation of the binding SMG does not contain an unreasonable financial burden on the franchisee.

Clear guidelines on the use of social media will regularly increase the brand's reach on social media and thus achieve higher customer interest and sales volume.

Non-discriminatory design of the social media guidelines : The (binding) SMG must not lead to unequal treatment among the franchisees.

There must also be no indirect discrimination through supposedly neutral specifications that exclude certain franchisees or make their social media work excessively difficult.

b)

No violation of the transparency requirement (Section 307 (1) sentence 2 German Civil Code)

Furthermore, the transparency requirement (Section 307 (1) sentence 2 German Civil Code) must be respected.

The SMG can also unreasonably disadvantage the franchisee if they are not clear or not comprehensible (Section 307 (1) sentence 2 German Civil Code).

It is necessary that a franchisee who is not familiar with the law is always able to recognise provisions that are disadvantageous to him without seeking legal advice.

It follows from this that the SMG must in principle be concretised and defined as far as possible.

At the same time, however, the requirements for transparency must not lead to an unreasonable disadvantage for the franchisor in the sense that general clauses, vague legal terms or paraphrases become generally inadmissible.

III.

Individual cases Ultimately, it depends on a case-by-case assessment of the SMG in question.

By way of example, the following specifications seem permissible: Specifications on social media channels : The social media guidelines can, for example, specify on which social media channels the franchisee may be active and which social media channels are reserved exclusively for the franchisor.

In principle, there are no objections to this binding specification under antitrust law, provided the prohibition on unreasonable disadvantage is respected.

The exclusive reservation must apply to all franchisees.

Exceptions for certain franchisees may only be made as long as there is an objective justification for this.

The regulation also appears to be permissible under civil law, as the interests of the franchisor to operate certain accounts itself and to determine their contents in order to ensure a uniform appearance of the franchise system and a uniform corporate identity usually outweigh this.

Specifications for account names : The franchisor also typically specifies in its social media guidelines how the franchisees’ accounts are to be named.

The name of the franchise system is usually required as a prefix to the account name.

Making such a requirement compulsory appears to be possible as well, as it is usually necessary to ensure the identity and integrity of the system and to avoid unreasonably disadvantaging a franchisee’s interests.

Specifications for the visual design of the account : Examples include specifications on the use of the brand, the choice of colours, and the use of images, samples and templates provided by the franchisor.

Such requirements are usually very likely be unobjectionable under antitrust law and the law on general terms and conditions.

This is because the franchisor has a legitimate interest in ensuring that its franchise system presents itself uniformly on the market.

This also includes a uniform social media presence.

Specifications for the content of the social media presence : Examples of this are provisions on refraining from the depiction of alcohol or drug consumption, the depiction of minors without the consent of their legal guardians, the depiction of an exaggeratedly luxurious or extravagant lifestyle as well as the depiction of third parties, their intellectual property or comparable content without consent."
Noerr,Social media guidelines in franchise systems,"Such content-related provisions - depending on the specific design - are often more problematic than purely visual provisions, since the franchisee following the image of the independent company is restricted in the content-related design of his posts and thus in the development of his own (company) personality.

However, as a rule, it is likely to be permissible to provide content that is obviously damaging to the reputation and brand, since it must be kept away from the franchise system - for the protection of all parties involved.

IV.

Conclusion In the course of the change from the classic economy to the digital age, it is usually advisable to professionalise the grown structures of the franchise system through SMG in order to maximise the potential on the increasingly important social media channels.

Just as in the analogue world, where advertising and the sales outlet are professionally uniformly designed, these standards are also to be applied to the digital shop window in social media.

In principle, it is therefore possible under both antitrust law and the law on general terms and conditions for the franchisor to stipulate SMG as binding within its franchise system.

In light of the variety of the specific design of the SMG, however, it must always be carefully examined whether the respective provision is appropriate.

Noerr,German Whistle­blower Protection Act on the home straight,"After a few detours, the German Whistleblower Protection Act (the “Act”) now finally seems to be on the home straight.

In its meeting yesterday, parliament’s cross-party mediation committee (the “Mediation Committee”) adopted a resolution with recommendations for amendments for submission to the Bundestag (Lower House of the German legislature) 20/6700 ).

Prior to that there were reports that the federal and state governments had reached a compromise in a night session at the end of last week and that it would be submitted to the Bundestag by the Mediation Committee as a recommendation for amendment.

Background On 16 December 2022, the Bundestag passed the German Whistleblower Protection Act (20/4909) to implement the European Union’s Whistleblowing Directive ( we reported here ).

However, in the session of the Bundesrat (Upper House of the German legislature) on 10 February 2023, the proposed law did not receive the required majority of 35 votes.

The federal states in which the Union parties CDU/CSU are in government refused to give their consent, citing an excessive burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.

The federal government then made another attempt to have the law passed.

On 14 March 2023, it presented draft amendments (“formulation aids”) to introduce two new bills from the body of the Bundestag.

To this end, it divided the bill, which had been passed by the Bundestag but failed in the Bundesrat, into two parts.

Part 1 (20/5992) was largely identical in content to the original failed bill, but it explicitly excluded from its scope civil servants working for the federal states, municipalities and municipal corporations and other public corporations, establishments and foundations subject to the supervision of a federal state as well as judges employed by a state.

Part 2 (20/5991) then removed this restriction on the law’s scope.

According to the explanatory memorandum, this artificial distinction was made solely in order to circumvent the necessity for the Bundesrat’s approval of Part 1.

At a hearing of the Legal Affairs Committee, the experts invited by the committee expressed considerable constitutional concerns about the division since it had not been made for objective reasons.

As a result, after the members of the parliamentary groups on the Bundestag’s coordination committee (the “Council of Elders”) had agreed on this, the final readings of the new draft in the Bundestag scheduled for 30 March 2023 were removed at short notice from the agenda.

Finally, on 5 April 2023, the federal government decided to refer the law originally passed by the Bundestag and vetoed by the Bundesrat to the Mediation Committee.

Amendments to the previous drafts We have already reported extensively on the draft originally passed in several news articles ( Bundestag beschließt Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz and Kein Ende der Hängepartie ) and in a podcast with Michelle Althen-Punjabi and Daniel Happ .

In this article we will briefly outline the changes proposed by the Mediation Committee.

Scope of application Section 3(3) of the Act defines what is meant by “information on breaches”: Information on breaches only falls within the scope of the Act if it relates to an employer or another organisation with which the whistleblower was in contact through his or her work.

Relationship between internal and external reporting Section 7(1) sentence 2 of the Act now provides that if effective internal action can be taken against a reported breach and the whistleblower does not fear retaliation as a result of their reporting, they should give preference to reporting the breach to an internal reporting channel.

However, the right to choose between internal and external reporting channels is retained so that this is arguably simply a request to whistleblowers and is not intended to carry any legal weight."
Noerr,German Whistle­blower Protection Act on the home straight,"However, the right to choose between internal and external reporting channels is retained so that this is arguably simply a request to whistleblowers and is not intended to carry any legal weight.

What has remained unchanged is that employers should create incentives for whistleblowers to contact their internal reporting channel.

No obligation to set up anonymous reporting channels Section 16(1) of the Act now contains the most far-reaching amendment: it makes clear that there is no obligation to design reporting channels so that they enable anonymous reporting.

Nevertheless, according to the resolution with recommendations for amendments, internal reporting channels should also process incoming reports anonymously.

However, there is no express obligation to do so.

At the end of the day, the same applies to external reporting channels.

This is a remarkable step backwards as the obligation to establish anonymous reporting channels was only included in the failed bill on the recommendation of the Legal Affairs Committee and was not originally envisaged by the federal government.

Reversal of burden of proof only in case of assertion The reversal of the burden of proof in section 36(2) of the Act has been somewhat watered down.

Although there is still a general presumption of the existence of retaliation where a whistleblower suffers a detriment as a result of reporting a breach, this will only be the case if the whistleblower themself also asserts this.

Consequently, a whistleblower would be required to plead a connection between the detriment and the reporting.

Reduction in the amount of fines The maximum potential fine for certain offences has been reduced.

Pursuant to section 40(6) of the Act, it will now only be EUR 50,000 instead of the previous amount of EUR 100,000.

The fine applies to offences such as obstructing reporting, obstructing communication between whistleblowers and the reporting channel and retaliatory action against whistleblowers.

It also covers attempts to commit these offences and breaches of the confidentiality of the identity of the reporting person and other persons.

Attention: Entry into force within one month The planned entry into force of the Act is particularly relevant for practitioners.

Unlike in the case of the rejected bill which, if passed, would not have entered into force for another three months from its publication in the Federal Law Gazette, the date for entry into force has been brought forward significantly.

Thus the revised versions of the law will enter into force just one month after its promulgation.

This significantly increases the pressure on companies to act.

It is true that it provides that failure to establish internal reporting channels can only be prosecuted as an administrative offence six months after promulgation of the law.

However, this grace period should not obscure the fact that the obligation to establish a reporting channel will apply beforehand and that if it is not established promptly, there is a risk that whistleblowers will immediately turn to external reporting channels.

Employers which usually have 50 to 249 employees will still only have to establish their internal reporting channels as from 17 December 2023.

In this case too, however, proactive establishment should be in the interests of most companies.

Outlook

If the Mediation Committee’s amendments deviate from those of the Bundestag, a new vote in the Bundestag is necessary.

The Bundestag is to vote on the Mediation Committee’s recommendations for amendment on Thursday, 11 May 2023.

There are no plans to debate the recommendations beforehand.

As early as Friday, the Bundesrat is expected to give its consent and the law will then be submitted to the Federal President for signature.

Since the key points have already been agreed between the federal government and the federal states, the bill is expected to succeed."
Noerr,German Whistle­blower Protection Act on the home straight,"Since the key points have already been agreed between the federal government and the federal states, the bill is expected to succeed.

Thus after lots of bends and twists, the German Whistleblower Protection Act is finally on the home straight and expected to enter into force as early as mid-June 2023 .

Companies should therefore now at the latest consider what requirements the Act places on them and whether any whistleblower systems already in place meet these requirements.

Noerr,Notarisation of SPA or APA,"In any strategic M&A or private equity transaction with a German company as target, the parties are faced with the question in the run-up to signing whether the purchase agreement (SPA or APA) has to be read to the parties before by a German notary public.

Especially for foreign stakeholders, this notarisation requirement and the function of the notary public is a peculiarly feature of German law with implications for the signing process as well as for the costs of the transaction.

A. Notarisation requirement The need for notarisation may exist irrespective of whether the target company is to be acquired via share deal or asset deal.

In the case of a share deal , notarisation is required if a German limited liability company ( GmbH ) is the target company.

The obligation to assign (Sec. 15 para.

4 German limited liability company code, GmbHG ) and the assignment in rem (Sec. 15 para.

3 GmbHG ) of shares in a GmbH require a contract concluded in notarised form.

According to the established case law of the German Federal Court of Justice ( BGH ), this requirement is intended to make a transfer of GmbH shares more difficult and, in addition, facilitate the proof of share transfers.

In the case of an asset deal , notarisation is required if real estate or property located in Germany is to be transferred as part of the transaction.

Furthermore, it is disputed whether the asset deal is generally subject to a notarisation requirement as a result of Section 311b para.

3 German Commercial Code, BGB .

The relevance of this legal discussion follows from the lack of a possibility to cure a violation of Section 311b BGB.

According to a persuasive opinion, the general notarisation in the case of an asset deal is not required though if the transferring assets are expressly and conclusively listed in the sale and purchase agreement.

Particular attention should be paid to the use of catch-all clauses , which are not uncommon in the context of asset deals and may require the involvement of a notary.

The sale and assignment of shares in a German stock corporation ( AG ), on the other hand, is possible without notarisation, as is the transfer of interests in a limited partnership ( KG , OHG or GbR).

B. Notarisation on site Although the Digitalisation Directive is a first step towards virtual notarisation from 1 August 2022, a notarised acquisition of a business in Germany must still be read out by a German notary to the parties or their representatives (authorised representatives) present.

This means that at least one representative of each party to the contract must be physically present in the presence of the notary in order for the formalised notarisation procedure to take place.

A subsequent approval by a party present before the notary but not duly represented is possible, but increases the uncertainty of the other party with regard to the security of the transaction and is therefore the exception.

On the other hand, the power of attorney of a representative for the conclusion of the SPA/APA does not require a notarial form, although in practice the parties will expect a notarised signature on the power of attorney as a precaution.

C. Duties of the notary Notarisation of the SPA/APA not only limits the parties' freedom of choice as to the procedure for signing the agreement, but also increases the amount of coordination required prior to signing.

With the notary public, the transaction is extended by a party whose legal assessment of the contracts and assets, and generally whose availability, must be planned for.

The notary public must ensure that the contract complies with legal requirements.

In the contract, the notary is obliged to identify the parties involved and the persons acting on their behalf.

In particular proof of the existence and legal capacity of each contracting party, as well as verify the power of representation of each person appearing."
Noerr,Notarisation of SPA or APA,"In particular proof of the existence and legal capacity of each contracting party, as well as verify the power of representation of each person appearing.

In the case of German companies as contracting parties, these issues can be resolved in an uncomplicated manner via the German commercial register.

In the case of foreign companies as contracting parties, depending on the jurisdiction, more time or additional effort may be required.

Furthermore, the notary, as an obligated party under the Money Laundering Act, is obliged to check the beneficial owners behind the contracting parties in advance..

D. Costs The payment of the notary costs by the purchaser can be considered as a common market practice.

This must be taken into account when planning the transaction costs.

Notary fees are formally determined according to the value in dispute and can be estimated, for example, here (link to fee calculator | Notar.de ).

The general maximum amount for the value in dispute in the notarisation procedure is EUR 60,000,000.00.

Based on this amouint, notary fees of EUR 53,170.00 (plus VAT, if applicable) are incurred, based on the typical fee for sale and purchase agreement.

This amount is usually increased by further ancillary fees.

In the case of additional fees, there are always two constellations to be taken into account in the context of sale and purchase agreements, unless the maximum value pf the business value has been reached: The execution of the notarisation procedure in a foreign language increases the transaction value by 30%.

The agreement of a choice of law clause that is not merely declaratory also increases the transaction value by 30%.

E. Completeness of the deed - consequences for typical ancillary agreements The notarial deed must contain all the relevant agreements relating to the transaction made between the contracting parties.

In the case of the purchase of a company, in addition to the definition of the object of purchase and the determination of the purchase price, there are, of course, a vast number of other agreements, such as guarantees relating to the sold company or the obligations of the parties until closing.

All ancillary agreements between the contracting parties in the context of the transaction which, according to the will of the parties, are essential to the purchase agreement or are inseparably connected with it as part of an overall agreement must be notarised.

Typical areas of discussion regarding notarisation in the context of SPA/APA are: Financing commitments or equity commitment letters of third parties, with which the acquisition company secures the payment of the purchase price vis-à-vis the seller, do not need to be notarised, since the seller will not make the effectiveness of the sale and purchase agreement dependent on the financing of the purchase price as part of the buyer's sphere of risk.

The W&I insurance to secure the buyer’s warranty and indemnity claims under the sale and purchase agreement does not generally need to be notarised either.

The seller usually has no interest in the invalidity of the S&I insurance negotiated and concluded by the buyer affecting the validity of the sale and purchase agreement, so that there is usually a lack of uniformity of intent approved by the seller."
Noerr,Hungarian DPA imposes first fine for website cookie management,"Until recently, news reports regarding cookies have only discussed the gigantic fines imposed by foreign data protection authorities (DPAs) on tech giants (Google, Amazon, Meta).

For economic reasons, operators of simple websites are continuing to use their illegal practices without risk until the last possible moment.

This moment has arrived for Hungarian data controllers, as the National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) has recently published its first, and so far only, official decision on cookie management.

Although NAIH imposed a relatively small fine of only HUF 10,000,000 (approximately €25,000), the reasons given for the decision state that the low fine is justified by the fact that this is the first time the Hungarian authority has opened an investigation into cookie management.

It is no use putting forward the defence that “everyone does it”.

NAIH has stressed that the widespread nature of the infringement does not make it legal.

In this context, NAIH also pointed out that operating under the IAB Europe framework does not necessarily guarantee compliance.

The authority has ruled that the information stored in cookies is personal data, since they assign unique identifiers to a person in order to identify a specific user.

Some aspects of the use of cookies rejected by the NAIH: It is unlawful to make it more difficult to “reject all” than to “accept all ”.

The “accept all” option was available at the first level (one click), whereas the “reject all” option was only available at the second level (two clicks).

The “object” option, i.e. to refuse permission to place cookies for reasons of legitimate interest, was only available at the third level (after at least three clicks).

We note that a similar decision was taken by the CNIL, the French Data Protection Authority in December 2022, when it fined Microsoft €60 million for its cookie management practices on the bing.com website for reasons that included that acceptance was possible with one click, but rejection required two clicks.

The information was too complicated and difficult to read .

The website displayed too much information about cookies in an unreasonably small area of the screen and in a way that was readable only a few lines at a time.

Overall, the information provided did not comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.

Specifying the name of the data controller as “we and our partners” was not sufficiently clear, even in case of 754 partners.

Misuse of legitimate interest .

The website used the term “legitimate interest” in a misleading way.

It is unfair to state the same processing purposes for cookies based on consent and cookies based on legitimate interest.

In the case of cookies necessary for the technical functioning of websites, the use of consent as a legal basis is excluded, but the controller did not provide an appropriate interest balancing test.

Data transfers to third countries .

In several cases, the data collected by the cookies were transferred to third countries via the 754 designated partners, but the risks of transferring data to third countries were not managed and data subjects were not informed of this.

It is worth noting that civil organisations can also actively contribute to the mass proceedings by authorities against websites and apps.

For example, the NOYB, led by Austrian activist Maximilian Schrems, filed nearly 300 complaints with national data protection authorities in the summer of 2022 against websites using OneTrust cookie banners.

It is therefore clear that it is now the last moment for website operators to review their websites’ cookie management practices and cookie banner settings before the NAIH does it for them."
Noerr,CJEU judgment: Right to compensation for non-material damage for violation of GDPR,"On 4 May 2023, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled for the first time on a claim for non-material damages under Article 82(1) of the GDPR ( judgment of 4 May 2023 - C-300/21 ).

The judgment was eagerly awaited by many, as there had previously been disagreement on the conditions for private enforcement following violations of the GDPR.

The CJEU clarifies that a claim for damages exists only if the individual has actually suffered non-material damage.

However, it is not necessary that the proven non-material damage exceeds a certain threshold of seriousness.

If a claim for damages is established, the company must make a payment to the individual that fully compensates for the damage.

Increased legal certainty, and the CJEU's data protection-friendly interpretation, may now encourage many people to sue for damages following violations of the GDPR.

This trend could be further strengthened by more collective enforcement of claims.

Background of the case On 12 May 2021 , the Supreme Court (of Austria) referred several questions to the CJEU on the interpretation of Article 82(1) of the GDPR.

The reference for a preliminary ruling was based on the following case: since 2017, Österreichische Post, an address broker had been collecting data on the political affiliation of the Austrian population.

Based on social and demographic characteristics, an algorithm predicted that the claimant had a certain political affiliation.

This data was stored by Österreichische Post without the claimant's consent but was not passed on to third parties.

The claimant stated that he felt insulted, upset, exposed and that his trust had been violated by the political affiliation attributed to him.

The Austrian court referred the following questions to the CJEU: (1) Is the breach of the GDPR in itself sufficient to award non-material damage to an individual, or must the individual also prove that he or she has suffered damage?

(2) How should the amount of non-material damage be assessed?

(3) Is non-material damage only present if the damage exceeds a certain threshold or does, for example, anger already constitute a compensable damage?

No claim without damage The CJEU first clarified that there is a claim for damages only if the individual proves that three conditions are met: violation of the GDPR, material or non-material damage, and a causal link between the violation and the damage.

The Court reached this conclusion by dogmatically applying the various methods of interpreting European Union law.

The result was not surprising.

In European and German liability law, damages claims only compensate the claimant for the causal damage.

The rare German judgment awarding compensation irrespective of damage should therefore be a thing of the past.

Non-material damage does not have to exceed a certain threshold of seriousness The CJEU ruled that non-material damage does not have to exceed a certain threshold of seriousness.

This was the most important decision in the judgment.

Individuals therefore only need to prove that they have suffered non-material damage.

This could encourage individuals to claim compensation for less serious non-material damage in many more cases than before.

The Court's reasoning was based on the wording of the GDPR, its meaning and purpose, and the methodology of the regulation.

For example, the CJEU stated that in order to maintain a uniform and high level of data protection within the meaning of recital 10 of the GDPR, it is necessary for all courts to apply the same broad concept of damage.

According to this reasoning, all open legal questions must be decided in favour of the most data protection-friendly view.

This reasoning means that other interests, such as the interests of companies and society in economic and social progress, are not sufficiently taken into account."
Noerr,CJEU judgment: Right to compensation for non-material damage for violation of GDPR,"This reasoning means that other interests, such as the interests of companies and society in economic and social progress, are not sufficiently taken into account.

The Advocate General, in his Opinion (case C-300/21), argued for a much more balanced understanding, assuming a de minimis level.

The CJEU expressly left open the question of which harm constitutes non-material damage.

In many cases before German courts, claimants allege that they have suffered a loss of control over their data as a result of a data breach.

It is questionable whether such a loss of control constitutes non-material damage.

This is likely to be the subject of future referrals.

Damages suffered must be fully compensated The CJEU points out that the amount of the claim for damages is initially assessed according to national law.

However, the principle of effectiveness requires that the claim for damages is not made practically impossible or excessively difficult.

In this context, the CJEU also points out that the claim for damages must have a compensatory function, i.e. the actual damage suffered must be fully compensated.

Neither Union law nor German law provides for a deterrent or punitive effect of a claim for damages.

The criteria for establishing a claim and how to determine the amount of damages are matters for national courts.

To date, German courts have often provided little detail in justifying the amount of damages.

There are many possible methods, including economic ones, to determine more precisely the amount of compensation necessary to compensate for the damage.

Outlook The professionalised claimant industry has waited a long time for these clarifications, which the CJEU has now provided.

An increase in damages claims is likely.

In addition, from summer 2023, consumer associations will be able to sue for damages directly for consumers in a collective action for redress, which may further boost enforcement.

For companies, the worst-case scenario for violations of the GDPR can therefore be both fines from supervisory authorities and direct claims for damages from individuals.

However, claims for damages still depend on a number of unresolved legal issues, and there are many good arguments for defending against such claims.

The interpretation of Article 82(1) of the GDPR is likely to keep us, the German courts and the CJEU busy for some time to come.

We will continue to monitor and document German case law in our Noerr Damages Tracker .

We advise companies to be on the safe side by putting in place robust data privacy governance, effective data subject rights management and professional assessment and handling of potential data privacy incidents.

Companies should therefore address the challenges, opportunities and risks of data privacy litigation strategically and at an early stage.

Our team of recognised data privacy and litigation experts will be happy to advise you."

Noerr,Foreign Requests for Evidence: Has Germany Found a Better Solution or Opened Pandora’s Box?,"The Federal Republic of Germany (Germany) has amended its Implementing Act to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters.

The amendment went into force on 1 July, 2022 and now allows court assistance to foreign parties seeking pre-trial discovery of documents.

The move is a complete departure from the previous no-assistance stance, and affects cross-border discovery issues between Germany and the U.K. and U.S.

This news article explains how the amendment affects parties in Germany and the U.K. and U.S.

The Situation Prior to the Amendment Until now, parties outside of the European Union (EU) who sought assistance from German courts in obtaining evidence located in Germany faced quite a challenge.

Such requests are governed by the Hague Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (Hague Evidence Convention, HBÜ), to which 64 countries are signatories.

Importantly, this includes Germany, the U.K. and the U.S.

The purpose of the Convention is to improve mutual judicial cooperation, particularly between civil and common law states, and to facilitate the transmission and execution of Letters of Request (also known as Letters Rogatory).

Under Article 23 of the Hague Evidence Convention, however, “[c]ontracting States may declare that they will not execute Letters of Request issued for the purpose of obtaining pre-trial discovery of documents as known in Common Law countries. ”

The pre-trial discovery of documents allows the lawyers of the parties in common law countries to request and obtain evidence in the form of emails, letters, invoices, meeting minutes, etc. from opposing parties to a lawsuit.

The fear of many civil law countries is that discovery in this manner could quickly become overwhelming and used nefariously as a fishing expedition or inundate the other side with so much evidence that they don’t have the manpower nor time to review it all.

While many other countries laid ground rules for how and what evidence could be requested, Germany utilized Article 23 to declare a general reservation with exceptions for requests that did not conflict with “ fundamental principles of German procedural law ” or “ interests of the persons concerned that are worthy of protection. ”

The result was essentially a blanket denial of any requests for pre-trial discovery from foreign parties.

This frequently led to foreign courts reaching extraterritorially and utilizing their own civil procedure rules to issue discovery orders.

The Amendment The amended Section 14 of the Implementing Act now allows letters rogatory of the pre-trial discovery of documents so long as: the request specifies in detail the documents to be produced, (thereby eliminating vague requests which can be overburdensome and expensive)

the documents clearly relate to and are important for the proceedings, the documents are in the possession of a party to the proceedings, the request for production of documents does not violate essential principles of German law and the GDPR applies in the case personal data is involved.

The Max Planck Institutes in both Luxembourg and Hamburg proposed deleting amended Section 14’s restriction regarding documents that are only in the possession of parties to the proceedings, stating that no other state has declared a comparable reservation and that it would contradict the aim of the bill.

In fact, the Institutes pointed out that Section 142 paragraph 1 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) actually recognizes a third-party document submission subject to conditions intended to protect the third party.

Further, the Institutes indicated that a public policy/ ordre public exception for requests is unnecessary to protect privacy and that it would also be counterproductive for the Hague Evidence Convention’s purposes."
Noerr,Foreign Requests for Evidence: Has Germany Found a Better Solution or Opened Pandora’s Box?,"The Future of Foreign Pre-trial Discovery Requests As can be seen in the final version of the amendment, the restrictions regarding third parties and public policy remained.

Regardless, the amendment provides German parties with more guidance when a common law court orders them to comply with certain discovery requests.

Previously, German parties risked tough sanctions from foreign courts for non-compliance while also risking costly punishment in Germany for compliance (e.g. violations of privacy laws).

It may also encourage common law countries to utilize the Hague Evidence Convention rather than trying to enforce their own civil procedure laws, therefore reducing lengthy and costly back and forth disputing.

Lastly, common law countries are known for their extensive and broad discovery requests.

Cooperation through the Hague Evidence Convention could actually act to reign this in through Germany’s restrictions regarding vague requests and relevance."
Noerr,Climate Change in SEP Licensing? - The European Commission’s Newly Released Draft of an SEP Regulation,"Following last minute changes to a prior leaked version, the first official version of the European Commission’s draft of an SEP Regulation (“ SEP Draft Regulation ”) was presented on April 27, 2023 .

It still contains highly controversial provisions such as new competencies for the EUIPO and dispute resolution mechanisms that strengthen the parties’ chances of achieving a FRAND license agreement but which may also require additional effort on the part of patent holders to obtain an injunction in the European Union.

I. Legislative Impetus:

Lack of Mechanisms to Establish FRAND SEP License Rates The issues that the SEP Draft Regulation is trying to resolve are as old as standardization in the patent world itself:  SEP holders and implementers often have different views about which and how many patents of a portfolio are actually standard essential.

Even if that can be established, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) license conditions remain extremely difficult and time-consuming to determine given that the market for SEP licensing is plagued by a lack of transparency .

Finally, suitable dispute resolution mechanisms are seldom available to the parties.

These deficits impede the fairness and efficiency of the SEP system and lead to excessive administrative and transactional costs .

To address these issues, the SEP Draft Regulation is putting forward both institutional reforms and new mechanisms to more efficiently establish patent essentiality and FRAND licensing rates.

For SEP holders, these reforms may entail obligations that come on top of existing FRAND obligations under antitrust law (such as obligatory pre-litigation dispute resolution before an EUIPO “conciliator”), but could also help them license their patents more efficiently.

The SEP Draft Regulation may also lead to an increase in transparency in SEP licensing.

This increase in transparency and the additional dispute resolution mechanisms proposed by the draft could also help to bring implementers to the table and resolve licensing disputes before any litigation is filed.

II.  

A Competence Center for Determining Standard Essentality and FRAND Rates A centerpiece of the SEP Draft Regulation is a “ Competence Center ” which would be established at the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).

The Competence Center would set up a register for SEPs for recording information on relevant standards, essentiality, SEPs in force in the EU, FRAND terms and conditions as well as licensing programs.

The SEP Draft Regulation also provides options both for SEP holders and implementers to produce information that is essential for setting the SEP license rate.

On the one hand, contributors to a standard could jointly inform the Competence Center of an aggregate royalty for the standard which they had agreed upon themselves or request a conciliator to help them determine the aggregate royalty.

On the other hand, the Competence Center will be able to provide a non-binding expert opinion on the appropriate aggregate royalty upon an implementer’s or SEP holder’s request.

Further, the Competence Center would also be tasked with conducting “ essentiality checks ” through independent evaluators to determine whether registered SEPs are in fact standard essential.

According to the SEP Draft Regulation, these essentiality checks would either be conducted randomly based on a sampling from SEP portfolios or after a proposal of up to 100 registered SEPs annually from any single SEP holder or implementer.

Finally, the Competence Center will also provide a FRAND determination procedure , which can be initiated by both SEP holders and implementers and would result in a confidential decision by an EUIPO conciliator, which under certain circumstances can be binding for the parties."
Noerr,Climate Change in SEP Licensing? - The European Commission’s Newly Released Draft of an SEP Regulation,"According to earlier leaked draft versions, the FRAND determination procedure was designed to be a de facto requirement for the filing of imitating litigation before the Unified Patent Court or EU national courts.

The version published now does not require a FRAND determination procedure prior to the filing of an SEP lawsuit by one party, if  the other party does not commit to comply with the outcome of the procedure within a set deadline.

III.

Pros and Cons:

The SEP Draft Regulation’s Potential for Implementers, Patent Holders and Other Market Participants The version of the SEP Draft Regulation which was leaked in March has faced significant criticisms , especially from patent holders.

This criticism focusses on issues such as a lack of expertise at the EUIPO in patent or SEP matters and the fact that (obligatory) dispute resolution proceedings at the EUIPO could significantly delay patent infringement litigation.

Another source of criticism focusses on the fact that patents that are declared as not standard-essential by the EUIPO could create even bigger problems for implementers, given that FRAND rules under antitrust law do not apply when such patents are litigated and a FRAND defense would therefore not be available.

Still, the SEP Draft Regulation’s potential should not be underestimated.

Essentiality checks at the EUIPO promise increased transparency and may help avoid a potential over-registration of SEPs .

In the long term, they could have a substantial impact on per-standard license fees, which may also lead overall to reduced prices on downstream markets and for consumers.

Similar effects may be achieved if the SEP Draft Regulation’s concept of establishing aggregate royalties per standard succeeds.

Considerations that go into such a fee determination may well take into account top-down-calculation principles, which would satisfy many implementers’ requests for more balanced and predictable license fee calculations , especially when compared to the current approach based on “comparable license agreements” that is prevalent in FRAND rate determinations in particular before German courts.

Finally, the highly criticized FRAND determination procedure before a conciliator at the EUIPO also provides substantial benefits.

Apart from setting the stage for a potential settlement, it could prevent premature litigation and allow more time for license negotiations .

This could substantially reduce the pressure to settle that is typically created through speedy patent litigation and often very detrimental to establishing a FRAND license rate.

The official release of the SEP Draft Regulation on April 27, 2023 only sets the scene for further heated discussions on the topic of regulating SEP licensing.

As indicated by the criticism levelled against the previously leaked draft version, heavy lobbying for changes to the content of the SEP Draft Regulation will certainly continue.

To what extent this will shape the final version of the legislation in the coming months, and whether the European Commission will be able to substantially resolve the prevalent issues in the SEP licensing space through this piece of legislation remains to be seen."
Noerr,"Flexible Case Management, Strict Deadlines? The Procedure Before the UPC","In just a few weeks, the UPC will officially start operating.

Companies and law firms are eagerly awaiting the first UPC proceedings.

This warrants a closer look at what the proceedings before the UPC will look like.

I. First Instance Proceedings Before the UPC

The first-instance procedure before the UPC includes the written procedure , which is where the parties exchange their mutual briefs; the interim procedure , which follows the written procedure, which serves to prepare the oral procedure and is conducted by a single judge from the panel (the judge-rapporteur); the oral procedure , which particularly includes the oral hearing before the entire panel.

The oral procedure is conducted by the presiding judge.

The parties can present their oral arguments and additional evidence can be collected, e.g. via witness testimony.

The Rules of Procedure provide that the entire first-instance proceedings are to be concluded within one year (cf.

Rule 7 of the Preamble to the Rules of Procedure).

Plaintiffs can expect a first-instance decision as early as one year after the filing of their action before the UPC.

In order to achieve this ambitious goal, not only the UPC has to work quickly and efficiently.

The parties’ submissions are also subject to a strict deadline regime.

II.

Typical Sequence of Deadlines Before the UPC In general, the response to an infringement action will not be limited to briefs on non-infringement, but also entail a nullity counterclaim.

In this constellation, the parties’ deadlines before the UPC are as follows: After service of the complaint, a three-month response period for the defendant begins.

This period applies both to the statement of defense and to nullity counterclaim (cf.

Rules 23 and 25 No. 1 of the Rules of Procedure).

Submissions concerning the validity of the patent must be made in the form of a nullity counterclaim (cf.

Rule 25 No. 1 of the Rules of Procedure).

The plaintiff may respond to the statement of defense and the nullity counterclaim within two months from the date of service of the statement of defense and to their nullity counterclaim (cf.

Rule 29 (a) of the Rules of Procedure).

The defendant may reply to the plaintiff’s response on the statement of defense and nullity counterclaim within two months (cf.

Rule 29 (d) of the Rules of Procedure).

Finally, the plaintiff has one month to make a final statement on the defendant's nullity counterclaim (cf.

Rule 29 (e) of the Rules of Procedure).

The deadline regime before the UPC is thus conceivably tight.

Since infringement and nullity proceedings share the same, relatively short deadlines, a strong coordination of infringement and nullity arguments and thus between attorneys-at-law and patent attorneys is required.

III.

Possibility of Deadline Extensions – But Also Shortenings A party’s first request to extend a deadline is generally granted by German courts; further deadline extensions will be considered and granted at least if the opponent agrees.

These standards do not equally apply to the UPC.

For a deadline extension, the Rules of Procedure require a reasoned request.

The decision on the request is at the discretion of the court (wording: ""may"" in Rule 9 No. 3 (a) of the Rules of Procedure).

How the UPC will exercise its discretion and whether German precedent for deadline extensions will apply is still unclear.

In addition, the Rules of Procedure also provide for the possibility of a shortening of the deadline under identical requirements (cf.

Rule 9 No. 3 (b) of the Rules of Procedure).

How the UPC intends to apply this provision is currently also still unknown.

In principle, it can be assumed that the UPC will only shorten a deadline in special atypical cases.

This is because the UPC is also required to ensure that both parties are sufficiently heard.

This requires that both parties receive ample time to respond to the submissions of the other party."
Noerr,"Flexible Case Management, Strict Deadlines? The Procedure Before the UPC","This is because the UPC is also required to ensure that both parties are sufficiently heard.

This requires that both parties receive ample time to respond to the submissions of the other party.

Against the background of the already strict deadline regime (cf. II.)

, there seems to be little room left for a (further) shortening of the deadlines detailed above.

IV.

Belated Submissions The Rules of Procedure only contain rudimentary provisions on how belated submissions are to be dealt with.

So what happens if a brief is not submitted to the UPC within the deadline set by the court?

Rule 9 No. 2 of the Rules of Procedure clarifies that the UPC may disregard a belated brief.

How the UPC will exercise this discretion and whether (unlike under German law) not only disputed submissions on the facts but also undisputed submissions on the facts and even submissions on the law can be belated, remains to be decided by the UPC.

These questions are of great importance, since both undisputed submissions and submissions on the law can have substantial impact on patent disputes.

V. Court’s Discretion in Matters of Deadlines And Belated Submissions It remains to be seen which guidelines the UPC will develop for the exercise of its discretion in rendering deadlines and dealing with belated submissions.

The UPC aims for a streamlined procedure, which is subject to a strict deadline regime (cf. II.).

The discretionary powers granted to the Court – whether in granting deadline extensions (cf. III.)

or in deciding on belated submissions (cf. IV.)

– should also be understood as a potential corrective to its strict deadline regime.

Making use of these discretionary powers may be appropriate where the strict deadline regime of the Rules of Procedure could affect a party’s right to be (equally) heard or where disregarding a belated submission could result in an unjust or factually incorrect decision.

On the UPC, the authors have already published the following additional articles: UPC Divisions And Locations: Where Can I File Which Action?

The Unified Patent Court Goes Live"
Noerr,Anti-Coercion Instrument,"On 28 March 2023, negotiators of the European Parliament (hereafter “the Parliament”), the Council of the European Union (hereafter “Council”) and the European Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) reached a provisional political agreement on the Proposal for a Regulation on the protection of the Union and its Member States from economic coercion by third countries, the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument (hereafter “ACI”).

A landmark project of the von der Leyen Commission, intended to complement the Commission’s existing trade policy toolbox, providing it with an additional legal instrument to deal with economic coercion by powerful foreign states such as China and Russia but also the United States, is thus steadily approaching final adoption.

Background The Proposal was presented by the Commission on 8 December 2021, at the request of the Council and the Parliament, following a significant increase in coercive practices by third countries trying to influence the decisions of the EU and its Member States.

The intention of the Commission was to provide the EU with an instrument that could deter economic coercion against the Union and its Member States while preserving the European trade agenda.

See our previous News Alert on the Commission’s Proposal and its implications for the EU trade agenda here .

Key Features of the ACI The ACI lays down a framework for the Union to respond to economic coercion by third countries.

The provisional agreement is largely in line with the Proposal, according to which economic coercion refers to a third country seeking to pressure the Union or a Member State into making, refraining from or modifying a legitimate sovereign policy choice by applying measures affecting trade or investment against the Union or Member State.

The ACI aims to ensure effective protection of the interests of the Union and its Member States by providing for deterrence and desistence measures such as dialogue with the third country, but legitimising counteracting measures as a last resort.

The Proposal stipulates the criteria to be taken into account when determining whether economic coercion is being exerted, the procedure to be followed pursuant to the determination, the possibility of engagement and cooperation, and, in a final step, response measures, including criteria for selecting a suitable response measure.

Moreover, the Proposal lays down deadlines for the EU action.

Negotiators decided on a precise timeframe for the different phases in order to ensure prompt reaction: not more than a year can elapse from the initiation of the investigation to the adoption of the decision.

A possible countermeasure must be adopted by way of an Implementing Act, subject to the so-called comitology procedure, meaning the Commission would be entitled to adopt the measure if approved by a qualified majority by a Committee composed of representatives of EU Member States.

Annex I to the Regulation lists the different measures the EU may adopt, including: restrictions to trade, increased customs duties, import or export licences, restrictions in the field of services or public procurement, imposition of retaliatory tariffs and quotas, restrictions to EU funded research programs, tighter controls on export of dual-use items, restrictions to foreign direct investment, market restrictions on certain products (for example chemicals), measures related to intellectual property, et al.

Although the text of the political agreement has not yet been published and it may take several weeks before it is, it is understood that the political agreement provides for a strengthening of the Council’s role in the determination of economic coercion.

The agreement also ensures increased involvement of Member States in selecting countermeasures.

A prominent recent coercion case involves China’s adoption of coercive trade sanctions against Lithuania after the EU country opened a diplomatic representation of Taiwan in its capital."
Noerr,Anti-Coercion Instrument,"A prominent recent coercion case involves China’s adoption of coercive trade sanctions against Lithuania after the EU country opened a diplomatic representation of Taiwan in its capital.

Mr Bernd Lange, negotiator for the Parliament, did not hesitate to name China and the US (the latter pursuant to threats of punitive tariffs in case the EU were to implement a digital tax against big US corporations) during negotiations of the political agreement.

The Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, in a recent speech on EU-China relations, also stressed that the Union should rebalance its relationship with China, by making more and better use of its trade instruments.

Next Steps Technical discussions concerning the Proposal will continue in the coming weeks.

The agreed text must then be endorsed by the negotiators at a final meeting and formally adopted by the two co-legislators, Council and the Parliament, most likely before the third quarter of 2023.

Once the legislative procedure is completed, the Regulation will be published in the EU Official Journal and it will enter into force 20 days afterwards."
Noerr,Hungary: Introduction to the new Company Act,"The procedural rules applicable to the registration of companies in Hungary have been largely unchanged since the entry into force of the present Company Act of 2006 ( Act V of 2006 on Public Company Information, Company Registration and Winding-up Proceedings ).

Now, these long-established practices are about to change, as a new Company Act ( Act XCII of 2021 on the Registration of Legal Persons and the Registration Procedure ) is being introduced by the legislator.

The new Company Act was originally expected to enter into force on 1 July 2023 .

However, an amendment bill is currently being debated in the Hungarian Parliament that would postpone the entry into force of the law until January 2026.

This article will introduce the most important practical changes brought about by the new Company Act.

The objective behind the new rules is to ease the burden on company court judges by introducing an automatic decision-making procedure for registration.

In the automatic decision-making procedure, the role of the company court judge is significantly reduced by the legislator; however, the new law places greater responsibility on lawyers and in-house counsels.

As of July (or as of the postponed entry date), lawyers and in-house counsels will be required to make an additional statement on the specific content of the documents submitted with the registration application, confirming that they have carried out a legal review of the documents.

The aim is to replace legal review by a company court judge .

This means an increase in the responsibility of lawyers and in-house counsels for the legality of the registration procedure.

A further aim of the reform is to standardize and speed up the registration procedure .

Companies will no longer be permitted to remedy deficiencies in their registration applications during the registration procedure upon individual court order (in Hungarian: ‘ hiánypótlási végzés ’) of the acting judge.

Under current practice, such individual orders have been issued by company court judges at their discretion, creating a diverse legal practice that varies from court to court.

By eliminating individual orders , the new rules are intended to provide more standardized court practice.

Technical errors will still block the registration procedure.

If the system detects an error in the application for registration, the application will be rejected automatically, and the application will have to be resubmitted by a short deadline.

The exact scope of errors the system will be able to detect is yet to be known, but we will probably be able to answer this question when the new application forms are published.

Another intention is to put more emphasis on and define a different role for the judicial oversight procedure .

Rather than being used as a ‘last resort’ to restore lawful operation, as it has been until now, this procedure will take over the role of remedying procedural shortcomings upon judicial request, which was common in the registration and registration amendment procedures in the past.

During the post-judicial inspection, the company court judge will randomly perform the same formal and substantive inspection that it currently performs each time the court receives a registration application.

As a result of the automatism introduced by the legislator, registration is expected to be almost immediate.

However, if the court detects an error during the post-judicial inspection, post-registration procedural tasks may arise, and companies may find themselves facing judicial oversight procedures or even procedural fines.

Such post-registration processes could increase the legal costs of registration procedures for the companies as compared to current practice.

Adjustments that have been long-anticipated for privacy reasons will include that the ‘ address of the natural person’ (e.g. managing directors and shareholders) listed in the new register will no longer be public information."
Noerr,Hungary: Introduction to the new Company Act,"It will be replaced by the ‘place of birth of the natural person’ (the date of birth of the natural person is currently mandatory information to be published in the company register).

The new Company Act will no longer make a difference between premises (located in the same city as the registered office, in Hungarian: ‘ telephely ’) and branch offices (located in a different city but within the country’s borders, in Hungarian: ‘ fióktelep ’), which also aims at a much simpler procedure, more in line with EU practices.

The importance of the Company Gazette will also be reduced, as the new Company Act links the public authenticity of the register to the registration of the data rather than to its publication in the Company Gazette.

The regulatory environment for the new Company Act is far from complete.

Additional legislation is expected to be adopted before the entry into force in July (or as of the postponed entry date) (e.g. on the list of mandatory documents to be submitted in the registration procedure, standard documents, or the detailed rules on winding-up procedures).

We are closely monitoring changes and emerging legislation related to the new Company Act.

Whether as a client or an in-house counsel, if you have any questions regarding the practical implementation of the new Company Act, please do not hesitate to contact us."
Noerr,Hungarian implementation of the EU Whistleblowing Directive,"Just after Easter, on 11 April 2023, the Hungarian Parliament adopted its long-awaited act (“ Whistleblower Protection Act ”) to implement the EU Whistleblowing Directive ((EU) 2019/1937, the “ Directive ”).

The Directive aims to improve protection for whistleblowers across Europe, including by requiring companies to set up internal reporting channels.

For the most part, the Whistleblower Protection Act implements the provisions of the Directive , but in some points it deviates from or goes further than the Directive.

This summary focuses on the key requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act in corporate practice.

Number of employees or field of business is the decisive criterion The Whistleblower Protection Act contains an obligation for the following companies to set up internal reporting channels :

Employers having at least 50 employees .

Based on the Whistleblower Protection Act, natural persons who perform an activity for remuneration and under the direction of the company (e.g. apprentices, hired workers, contractors) are also to be regarded as employees.

Companies in special areas regardless of their number of employees.

This includes credit institutions, financial services companies, auditors, bookkeepers, tax advisors, law firms, companies carrying out an activity related to real estate transactions, companies in the oil and gas sector and operators of floating installations in the territory of Hungary.

Companies with 50-249 employees are permitted to share resources by means of a joint internal reporting channel (hotline).

Even companies with fewer than 50 employees should consider voluntarily establishing whistleblower structures to avoid reputation-damaging external leaks (which are also protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act).

Whistleblowers and whistleblowing subjects A whistleblowing report may be made by (i) prospective, current or former employees, (ii) prospective, current or former self-employed persons having a relationship with the company, (iii) prospective, current or former shareholders and persons belonging to the administrative, management or supervisory body of the company, (iv) prospective, current or former interns or volunteers and (v) contractors, subcontractors or suppliers having a contractual relationship with the company.

Companies have no obligation to allow, i.e. investigate, anonymous tips .

The internal reporting channels (hotlines) must be available for any unlawful or allegedly unlawful activities, omissions or other information related to an abuse.

The reporting person must not suffer any adverse measures (e.g., termination of employment, discrimination or any detrimental legal consequences) as a result of the reporting.

Organisational requirements The whistleblowing hotline must be operated by an independent and competent person or department .

The Whistleblower Protection Act does not prohibit the performance of other tasks i.e. operating the whistleblowing hotline can be one of several tasks of the dedicated person or department.

Outsourcing the internal whistleblowing channel to whistleblower protection attorneys or to third-party organisations is permissible.

However, operating the hotline and taking necessary follow-up steps may not be completely outsourced to third parties (no transfer of responsibility to third parties).

The original responsibility for maintaining confidentiality in handling the whistleblowing report and for remedying the infringement always remains with the obligated employer.

Close coordination is therefore required between the employer and the third party, for example with regard to internal investigations and measures to remedy the grievance.

Requirements regarding reporting channels The Whistleblower Protection Act contains several mandatory procedural requirements for operating internal reporting channels."
Noerr,Hungarian implementation of the EU Whistleblowing Directive,"Requirements regarding reporting channels The Whistleblower Protection Act contains several mandatory procedural requirements for operating internal reporting channels.

Among others, companies are obliged to offer the option of whistleblowing in writing or verbally, check the pertinence of the subject of the report and the validity of the allegations made, contact the whistleblower and, if necessary, request further information, maintain the confidentiality of the whistleblower and the person/people affected by the whistleblowing, comply with documentation obligations, including recording the content of the verbal reports in writing and acknowledging receipt of the whistleblowing report within seven days, take follow-up measures (e.g. internal investigation, discontinuation of investigation, forwarding the information to authorities), give feedback to whistleblowers on the outcome of the investigation, the follow-up steps planned and already taken as well as reasons for these within three months of receipt of the report , provide information on the operation of its own reporting channel , the related procedure and the main provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act in an easily accessible manner.

In practice, this means that a policy on the operation of the internal reporting channel is to be prepared and communicated by e-mail or on the company’s website.

Data protection requirements Operating the internal reporting channel (hotline) involves processing the personal data of both the reporting person and the person affected by the whistleblowing.

The company operating the internal reporting channel, as a data controller, must prepare a privacy notice on the data processing regarding the operation of the hotline system and communicate it to the data subjects (reporting persons, persons affected by the whistleblowing).This data processing activity must also be included in the company’s register of data processing activities .

The Whistleblower Protection Act strictly regulates permissible processing purposes, the recipients to whom the personal data can be transferred and the deletion obligations of the controller.

Special rules apply to the transfer of the personal data to non-EU countries.

Effect of the Whistleblower Protection Act The Whistleblower Protection Act enters into force 60 days after its publication (which has not yet occurred).

At the moment we envisage that the whistleblowing systems will have to be in operation as of the beginning of July 2023.

The Whistleblower Protection Act contains a grace period for companies with 50-249 employees that are obliged to operate the internal reporting channel based on the number of their employees and not on their special activities.

The obligation to establish a reporting channel will only apply to them from 17 December 2023 .

Legal consequences of the failure to comply with the Whistleblower Protection Act Failure to set up an internal whistleblowing hotline will not lead directly to an administrative fine.

Although the competent labor inspectorate is entitled to check whether the requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act are being met, in case of non-compliance it may only oblige the companies to comply with the relevant whistleblowing provisions."
Noerr,Putin allows Seizure of Russian assets of Foreign Companies,"By Decree No. 302 dated 25 April 2023 (“ Decree 302 ”) the Russian President allowed to introduce external management over specific assets located in Russia, which are owned or controlled by legal entities and individuals from so called “unfriendly” countries (“ Unfriendly Persons ”).

Such assets include shares in Russian companies, movable and immovable property as well as property rights (“ Seized Assets ”).

As per Decree 302 any Seized Asset will be managed by the Russian Federal Agency For State Property Management ( Rosimushestvo ) or, upon a decision of the Russian President, by a different authority (“ External Manager ”).

The External Manager is entitled to exercise all the powers/rights over the Seized Asset save for the right to dispose of it.

The external management ceases upon the decision of the Russian President.

The costs of the External Manager will be compensated at the expense of the income from the Seized Assets.

Decree 302 establishes as the only “pre-condition” for the seizure that assets of Russian owners have been seized or frozen, or anyhow restricted, or are threatened to be seized/frozen/restricted in the country of the Unfriendly Person, or that there is any threat to the Russian Federation.

This extensively (and vaguely) worded pre-condition is actually already fulfilled in a large number of countries, e.g. in every EU country, the US and the UK.

Therefore, effectively Decree 302 allows the Russian President to seize any Russian asset owned by western companies or their Russian subsidiaries in Russia .

The current list of the Seized Assets adopted by Decree 302 includes: the shares in JSC Unipro owned by Uniper SE; the shares in JSC Fortum owned by Fortum Russia B.V. and Fortum Holding B.V It can be extended any time by a decision of the Russian President.

In contrast to the draft Russian law “On External Management” which was prepared by the Russian authorities in March 2022 but not adopted and which provided for certain criteria to be fulfilled for the introduction of external management over Russia assets held by foreign owners, the external management under Decree 302 is introduced and conducted upon the sole and unlimited discretion of the Russian President."
Noerr,Will working time soon have to be recorded electronically?,"The eagerly awaited draft bill from the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (“ Labour Ministry ”), which was announced for the first quarter of 2023, is now finally available.

The draft points out the direction in which a law on the (already existing) obligation to record working time could go.

What is the background of the new law?

As we reported in our news article on the German Federal Labour Court’s (“ Federal Labour Court ”) “timekeeping decision” of 7 December 2022 ( link ), all employers are obliged, at the latest since the Federal Labour Court’s ruling of 13 September 2022 (case no. 1 ABR 22/21), to maintain a “reliable, objective and accessible” system for recording daily time worked.

According to the Federal Labour Court, to protect employees, it was essential to record not only how long but also at what times and on what days employees work.

However, it was not clear exactly how the working time was to be recorded in practice.

Is manual timekeeping on a piece of paper or in an Excel spreadsheet already a “system” that is “reliable, objective and accessible”?

The Federal Labour Court had clarified that working time does not necessarily have to be recorded electronically.

In contrast, the requirements found in the new draft bill are stricter.

It is considered likely that the legislator – as provided in the draft – will in principle stipulate electronic recording, which means that many employers will have to make changes.

What are the specific plans?

The Labour Ministry’s draft bill of 18 April 2023 states that the German Working Time Act ( Arbeitszeitgesetz – “ Working Time Act ” ) is to be amended in order to reflect requirements established by case law.

Up to now, the Working Time Act has only required that working time exceeding that of a normal working day be recorded.

In future, employers will be obliged under section 16(2) of the Working Time Act (new version) to electronically record the beginning , end and duration of employees’ daily working time on the day they perform the work.

New obligation to record working time electronically The draft bill goes beyond the form requirements established by case law and stipulates that employees’ working time must in principle be recorded electronically.

According to the draft bill, exemptions from this form requirement will only be available to employers who either employ ten or fewer employees, are subject to a collective agreement with a corresponding exemption or are subject to a works agreement based on such a collective agreement.

However, at least generous transitional periods, staggered according to number of employees, are provided for the changeover to electronic timekeeping: Employers with up to 10 employees No electronic timekeeping requirement is intended.

A handwritten record on paper is sufficient.

Employers with fewer than 50 employees Five-year transitional period to switch to an electronic timekeeping system.

Employers with fewer than 250 employees Two-year transitional period to switch to an electronic timekeeping system.

Employers with 250 or more employees One-year transitional period to switch to an electronic timekeeping system.

However, caution is advised here, as this relief only extends to the form of the record.

Once the law is in force, all employers will be obliged to comply with all other newly introduced obligations under the law, such as information, record storage and monitoring obligations.

Can timekeeping be delegated?

The draft provides the practical solution that the timekeeping can be done by employees themselves or by a third party.

This is essential, especially in the case of mobile work (field service or remote work).

Depending on a company’s circumstances, it is advisable that the timekeeping be done either by employees themselves or by a department head, shift supervisor, foreman or the client that uses the services of a temporary employee."
Noerr,Will working time soon have to be recorded electronically?,"Software solutions (e.g. apps on smartphones or laptops) are particularly suitable for employees who work in the field or remotely.

In each such individual case, it should be determined which option is best suited for practical and legally certain implementation.

It is important to note that the responsibility always remains with employers, and they are obliged to carry out random checks of working time records that have been delegated to the employee.

Information requirements Employers must inform employees of the recorded working time upon request.

This follows from the principle established by the European Court of Justice that a timekeeping system must be “accessible”.

Employees can also request copies of the records.

The explanatory memorandum of the draft bill states that compliance with this request can be sufficient in the form of transmission of an electronic copy or allowing employees to inspect the records themselves and make copies.

The draft does not state how often employees can make use of their rights to information and copies.

This constitutes the same risk of excessive use linked to the rights to information and copies found in Article 15 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Overtime pay and the likely avalanche of lawsuits The obligation to keep records will lead to an increase in the number of legal actions for overtime pay.

As a general rule, employers need only pay for overtime actually worked and initiated by them.

Employees bear the burden of proof of the number of overtime hours worked.

Up to now, many claims for remuneration of overtime have failed because the plaintiffs, i.e. the employees, could not prove in detail the overtime actually worked.

In the future, however, employees will be able to easily prove (in court) the number of overtime hours worked.

According to established case law, records actually made are presumed to be correct.

With this in mind, employers would be well advised in future to regularly check working time records and, if necessary, discuss with employees whether the overtime was actually necessary and could be avoided in future.

Only employers that have intervened in time and/or implemented legally sound rules will be able to defend themselves against claims for large amounts of overtime pay in future.

Employers should therefore implement a suitable system to prevent “self-initiated” overtime or enter into appropriate agreements on (effective) compensation for overtime.

What about executive employees?

In general, executive employees are not covered by the scope of application of the Working Time Act pursuant to its section 18(1)

no. 1.

The draft bill has no express provision that would oblige executive employees to record working time in future.

What about collective agreements?

Like many laws, the draft bill contains a collective bargaining clause, according to which it is possible to deviate from the timekeeping obligation by means of a labour-management agreement, in particular with regard to the form and the time of recording.

The parties to the collective agreement can also exempt certain groups of employees from the timekeeping obligation, but these groups can contain only certain employees with special characteristics that are prerequisites.

These prerequisites could be met, for example, by managers, special experts or scientists.

Does the works council have to be involved?

Introducing an electronic system for recording working time is subject to mandatory co-determination by the works council because section 87(1) no. 6 of the German Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz ) applies.

Employers should therefore familiarise themselves with the various possibilities and systems for recording working time and determine from the outset what is possible and what is necessary.

What are the legal consequences for violations?"
Noerr,Will working time soon have to be recorded electronically?,"What are the legal consequences for violations?

The draft provides for violations to be punishable as administrative offences with fines of up to €30,000.

Employers are subject to this fine if they intentionally or negligently fail to draw up records at all or correctly, completely, in the prescribed manner or in a timely manner.

The same applies to employers that do not keep all the records for at least two years or do not comply with an employee’s request for information or a copy.

Employers already face fines of up to €30,000 for failure to comply with requirements regarding maximum working time, break times and time off between working days according to section 22(1) nos.

1-3 of the Working Time Act or even imprisonment of up to one year under section 23 of the Working Time Act.

In future, however, employers will face the considerable risk that employees will be able to prove or supervisory authorities will be able to very easily determine these violations.

Will trust-based working time still be possible?

Mandatory recording of employees’ working time (by the employees themselves) does not prevent employees from continuing to decide themselves when this work will be done within the framework of trust-based working hours.

Compliance with the provisions of the Working Time Act regarding breaks, time off between workdays and maximum working time has always been mandatory for every form of trust-based working time.

Trust-based working time in which employees “work when they want” without adhering to these legal framework conditions has always been and will remain impermissible.

However, the draft bill is also considerably stricter on this point.

In the case of trust-based working time, employers will be explicitly obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure that they become aware of violations of the Working Time Act and take appropriate remedial action.

The explanatory memorandum of the draft bill proposes automated notifications to employers which would make them directly aware of such violations that become apparent when employees record their working time electronically.

However, on the one hand, there is a very fine line between the necessary monitoring of working time and illegal employee surveillance, so employers must be careful.

On the other hand, employers that become aware of violations of the Working Time Act may face penalties if they fail to act (imprisonment for up to one year or a fine, sections 22 and 23 of the Working Time Act).

Outlook

At this point, there is no need for panic but rather for an objective discussion of the issue.

The changes planned in the draft bill include far-reaching consequences for many employers in Germany.

It is considered certain that the proposed electronic form of recording working time will not be abandoned in the resulting law.

There will still be discussions regarding the details, as numerous comments from associations and trade unions are to be expected.

Nevertheless, the draft bill could be passed in the near future.

Particularly for larger companies, it will simply not be practicable over a longer period of time to (continue to) record working time in paper form.

Practically speaking, good software-based solutions such as apps will be necessary, but it is important to remember that works councils have a right of co-determination.

Generous transitional periods are provided for initiating an electronic system.

Employers should make sure they understand the amendments, which entail considerable risks for them.

For one thing, the records can serve as evidence for supervisory authorities, which can lead to fines or even imprisonment if, for example, maximum working time is exceeded."
Noerr,Will working time soon have to be recorded electronically?,"For one thing, the records can serve as evidence for supervisory authorities, which can lead to fines or even imprisonment if, for example, maximum working time is exceeded.

If employees work overtime not initiated or monitored by their employers, the employers will also be exposed to considerable claims for overtime pay, which employees can easily enforce in court, since overtime will in future be documented in a legally watertight manner and employers demonstrably could have been aware of it."
Noerr,Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Adopted,"The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter “the CBAM”), a key element of the European Green Deal legislative package, has been conclusively adopted by the European Union (“EU”) legislators (European Parliament and Council of the European Union).

Following the formal adoption of the CBAM by the European Parliament on 18 April 2023, the Council of the European Union adopted the new law on 25 April 2023.

It will be published in the EU Official Journal in the coming weeks and will enter into force twenty days later.

The CBAM addresses imports of products/goods into the EU from carbon-intensive industries.

It aims at equalising the carbon costs contained in domestic and imported products, by imposing a carbon price on certain (defined) imported products, which risk offsetting EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts, whilst simultaneously encouraging collaboration with non-EU businesses adhering to high climate standards.

The carbon price principally covers direct and indirect emissions from the production of electricity consumed during the production processes of CBAM goods, with the exception of goods for which the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter “the ETS”) allows Member States to compensate indirect costs, such as iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen, for which only direct emissions will be taken into account (see Annex II of the CBAM).

The European Commission’s CBAM Proposal was presented in July 2021 as part of the so-called “ Fit for 55” package .

An provisional agreement on the Proposal was reached in December 2022 (see our related News Alert here ).

Key Differences to the Initial Proposal

The CBAM covers a wider range of products compared to the initial Proposal, more precisely: cement, electricity, fertilisers, iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen and some precursors and downstream products made from cement, iron and steel, aluminium (see Annex I of the CBAM for the concerned CN codes), so-called CBAM goods.

The final text also stipulates a more centralised model of implementation through the European Commission (hereafter “Commission”), for which the Commission has requested more resources, and pushes back the beginning of the transitional period from January until October 2023.

Links with EU ETS Reform Together with the CBAM, the legislators also officially endorsed the Commission Proposal to review the ETS , another key aspect of the Fit for 55 package.

The EU ETS is a market-based mechanism which caps greenhouse gas (hereafter “GHG”) emissions by dividing them into allowances, each representing one tonne of CO2.

The emissions allowances are mostly auctioned but some are distributed to industries at risk of carbon leakage for free.

The EU ETS was launched in 2005 and reviewed for the last time in 2018, determining the total quantity of emissions allowances for the so-called phase 4 until 2030.

The Proposal to review the ETS concerns the ongoing phase 4, with the aim of reducing the phase 4 cap and introducing a more ambitious linear reduction factor for GHG emissions, in order to align with the 2030 target of reducing net emissions by 55%.

A provisional agreement was reached in December 2022, a few days after the agreement on the CBAM (see our related News Alert here ).

The successful conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the ETS was crucial to the final adoption of the CBAM, as the CBAM will replace the ETS in the sectors to which it applies.

This will be achieved by a phasing-out of the free ETS allowances from 2026 to 2034 and a corresponding phasing-in of the CBAM.

The reduction rate for free ETS allowances is as follows: 2026: 2.5%; 2027: 5%; 2028: 10%; 2029: 22.5%: 2030: 48.5%; 2031: 61%; 2032: 73.5%; 2033: 86%; 2034: 100%.Until the free ETS allowances are completely phased out, the financial obligations under the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions which do not receive free allowances under the ETS."
Noerr,Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Adopted,"Overview of CBAM Obligations The CBAM will become fully operational from January 2026, however, there will be a transitional phase starting as early as in October 2023.

During this phase, importers of CBAM goods must provide a quarterly report 30 days after the end of each quarter, specifying the total quantity of each type of CBAM good imported during the quarter, the actual total embedded emissions and total embedded indirect emissions in those goods and any carbon price due in the country of origin for the embedded emissions.

From 1 January 2025, importers must also designate and apply for the authorisation of a CBAM declarant in the EU Member State where the importer is established.

As from 1 January 2026, only authorised declarants will be able to import CBAM goods and will need to submit a yearly CBAM declaration, imposing further obligations such as purchasing and surrendering CBAM certificates.

Implications for Importers and EU Downstream Producers

The CBAM undoubtedly triggers organisational changes for importers of CBAM goods.

Additionally and importantly, the CBAM could also affect EU downstream producers using CBAM product categories as inputs in their supply chain.

Against this background, downstream producers could be encouraged to reconsider their suppliers, seeking out less carbon-intensive inputs to avoid paying the financial adjustment.

It is also important to note that before the end of the transitional phase on 31 December 2025, the Commission will submit a report to assess an extension of the scope of the CBAM to other products.

Similarly, the Commission aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the CBAM in addressing the risk of carbon leakage for goods exported from EU to countries that do not apply ETS or implement similar mechanisms.

If appropriate, the Commission will present a legislative proposal, further extending the application of the Fit for 55 package to companies.

In conclusion, the CBAM and the revision of the ETS intend to accelerate the decarbonisation and the adoption of low-carbon technologies in specific sectors.

Therefore, it is critical for companies to remain well-informed of the developments and carefully evaluate the overall impact on their business activity.

If you or your company are interested in further guidance with respect to the CBAM or the revision of the ETS, including on the application of the CBAM to business activity or compliance obligations, please do not hesitate to reach out to our international and EU trade and energy teams."
Noerr,Introducing a draft directive on the right to repair,"On 22 March 2023, the European Commission presented its long-awaited draft directive on consumers’ right to repair of their consumer products.

The new legal act leads to a significant expansion of manufacturers’ responsibility for products in Europe.

In future, consumers will be entitled, in addition to their warranty rights against the seller, to directly assert claims against the manufacturers of products.

As part of the EU Commission’s ambitious ”Green Deal” project, the draft is intended to lead to more sustainable use of resources and create an easy and inexpensive way for consumers to have products repaired.

What products are involved?

The directive is intended to cover a wide range of products that are used by almost every consumer.

These include household appliances such as dishwashers, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners, but also products such as smartphones or tablets.

Consumers will have the right to repair if a product has a defect for which the seller is not liable under statutory warranty provisions.

This can be the case if the defect was not yet present at the time the goods were handed over to the consumer or if the defect only becomes apparent after the warranty period has expired.

It will not matter whether the consumer has caused the defect himself/herself.

Repair obligation The draft establishes an obligation on the part of manufacturers to repair the products they market.

Manufacturers therefore remain responsible to a certain extent for the functionality of their products even after the expiry of the warranty period.

Although they do not always have to offer repairs free of charge, considerable costs will probably be entailed simply in providing the necessary infrastructure even if they use subcontractors to fulfil their repair obligations.

Besides offering repairs themselves, manufacturers will have to ensure that independent repairers have access to spare parts and to the information required for the repairs.

The aim is to allow consumers to freely decide who they wish to have carry out the repairs.

This means that manufacturers must establish their own infrastructure for repairs while also enabling other companies to offer comparable services that compete with their own repair services.

In order to protect consumers from overpriced repair offers, manufacturers and independent repairers will be obliged to provide an estimate of the repair costs at a consumer’s request.

In addition, the directive will oblige Member States to set up an online platform that allows consumers to locate product repairers and sellers of remanufactured products.

European legal acts to be adapted According to the draft directive, Directive (EU) 2019/771 on certain aspects of the sale of goods governed by contract law, Directive (EU) 2020/1828 on representative actions for the protection of consumers’ collective interests and Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for consumer protection laws are to be adapted.

What practical implications does the draft have?

The European Commission’s draft directive must first pass through the European legislative process and be implemented in national regulations.

However, it is already foreseeable that manufacturers will be faced with considerable additional financial and logistical expenditures.

Because consumers will have a right to claim repairs directly from them, manufacturers will have to establish their own repair facilities.

Due to their obligation to also enable competitors to carry out repairs, manufacturers will also have to develop ways to offer their own repair services in a competitive form without unduly hindering competitors.

Establishing the corresponding infrastructure will entail considerable costs for manufacturers, which they will have to pass on to consumers.

This means that manufacturers will have to establish their own repair infrastructure, including a long-term stock of spare parts."
Noerr,German Federal Court of Justice: providing security for costs of legal enforcement of domestic and foreign arbitral awards in Germany,"As of recently, it was not clear whether security for legal costs in proceedings to declare domestic or foreign arbitral awards enforceable in Germany must be provided by foreign applicants at the request of the respondent as is the case for foreign claimants in court actions.

The German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof – “Federal Court”) answered in the negative under previous procedural law and, until recently, left this issue open under currently applicable procedural law.

In a ruling dated 12 January 2023 (I ZB 33/22), the Federal Court declared sections 110 and onwards of the German Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung – “Civil Procedure Code”) regarding an obligation to provide security to be analogously applicable to legal costs for enforcement of arbitral awards.

Thus, entities and individuals that are confronted with enforcement of an arbitral award by foreign creditors in Germany have the option of requiring security for legal costs.

The obligation to provide security for legal costs applies to applicants who do not have their habitual place of residence in an EU Member State or a signatory state of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

Background of the Federal Court decision The applicant is a German entrepreneur who worked in the Russian Federation for many years.

The respondents are several independent companies belonging to a group of fruit juice companies that previously cooperated with the applicant.

In 2019, the applicant won against the respondents in ad hoc arbitration proceedings in Moscow, and the respondents were ordered to pay compensation for damage amounting to a figure in the mid-eight-figure range.

The respondents filed an action with the Koblenz Higher Regional Court for a negative declaratory judgment that did not recognise the foreign arbitral award.

By way of countersuit, the applicant sought declaratory judgments including that the arbitral award is enforceable.

The respondents then unilaterally declared that there was no longer a need to adjudicate their action for a negative declaratory judgment and requested that the court reject the application for enforceability of the arbitral award.

The Koblenz Higher Regional Court (Koblenz Higher Regional Court, decision dated 31 March 2022 – 2 Sch 3/20) rejected not only the respondents’ application for a declaratory judgment that there was no longer any need for adjudication but also the applicant’s application for a declaratory judgment of enforceability and decided that the foreign arbitral award was not to be recognised in Germany.

The applicant continued to pursue his applications in the form of an appeal on a point of law.

The respondents applied for rejection of the appeal on a point of law and opposed the rejection of their application for a declaratory judgment of no need for adjudication with an appeal on points of law of their own.

In November 2022, the applicant reported that he had changed his place of habitual residence from Moscow to Dubai (UAE).

The respondents then demanded that he provide security for legal costs.

In January 2023, the applicant reported that he had given up his address in Dubai and now had a residence and the geographical focus of his living situation in Italy.

Federal Court decision: analogue applicability of the provisions on providing security for legal costs in declaratory proceedings regarding enforceability The Federal Court held that the respondents’ application for provision of security for legal costs was admissible but rejected its merits.

The court based its decision on the following reasons: Proceedings to declare an arbitral award enforceable are initiated with an application (not an action), so strictly speaking the parties are not in the procedural positions of plaintiff and defendants but rather of applicant and respondents."
Noerr,German Federal Court of Justice: providing security for costs of legal enforcement of domestic and foreign arbitral awards in Germany,"However, the court found that, the applicant was in a position equivalent to a claimant within the meaning of section 110(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The court ruled that under the currently applicable procedural law, sections 110 et seq. of the Civil Procedure Code are analogously applicable to application proceedings for a declaration of enforceability of German and foreign arbitral awards.

It deemed the prerequisites for analogous applicability to be given.

There is an unintentional gap in legislation because section 1063 of the Civil Procedure Code only contains individual procedural provisions.

Thus, the general provisions regarding first-instance evidence-gathering proceedings are to be supplementally applied, which includes sections 110 et seq. of the Civil Procedure Code.

The meaning and purpose of providing security for legal costs was also an indication in favour of analogous application to proceedings for a declaration of enforceability of German and foreign arbitral awards.

Its intent is to protect the defendant from enforcement difficulties abroad when enforcing a claim to reimbursement of costs.

The nature of the respondents’ interests in proceedings for declaration of enforceability of an arbitral award is thus comparable with that of a defendant in a lawsuit.

No special procedural aspects speak against the analogous application of sections 110 et seq. of the Civil Procedure Code because neither the Civil Procedure Code nor the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards contain special rules to expedite proceedings for a declaration of enforceability.

There could likewise be no presumption of a comparable need for alacrity as in proceedings for temporary injunctions and seizure, in respect of which it was held that sections 110 et seq. of the Civil Procedure Code are not applicable.

In an arbitration, the winning party has already achieved (initial) security in the form of the arbitral award.

The winning party also has the option of securing the subsequent enforcement of the arbitral award via an application for precautionary attachment according to section 1063(3) first sentence of the Civil Procedure Code.

However, in the applicant’s favour, the exception for countersuits (section 110(2) no. 4), according to which there is no obligation to provide security for legal costs in the event of countersuits, applied.

The privileged position of the countersuing party was justified by the fact that filing a countersuit was caused by a previous attack by the claimant.

In addition, filing a complaint against a debtor who had his/her habitual place of residence outside the EU and the European Economic Area showed that the claimant had accepted the difficulties involved in enforcement.

A defendant in a countersuit was not entitled to the same type of protection as was a defendant in an original action.

The applicant’s role was not at all affected by the fact that he was also the appellant on a point of law.

The first-instance role was the factor that determines who was a claimant.

Likewise, the respondents’ unilateral declaration of no need to adjudicate did not affect the parties’ roles in the least.

The party that sought a declaration of enforceability of the arbitral awards was not automatically to be seen as the attacker.

The respondents had precipitated the applicant’s application for a declaration of enforceability when they filed their action for a negative declaratory judgment.

The issue of the applicant’s change of place of residence to Italy – and thus back to a Member State of the EU – was therefore no longer a decisive factor."
Noerr,German Federal Court of Justice: providing security for costs of legal enforcement of domestic and foreign arbitral awards in Germany,"The issue of the applicant’s change of place of residence to Italy – and thus back to a Member State of the EU – was therefore no longer a decisive factor.

Relevance of the Federal Court’s decision for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in Germany The Federal Court has strengthened the rights of debtors in cases involving enforcement in Germany of German or foreign arbitral awards by creditors that do not have their habitual place of residence in an EU Member State or a signatory state of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

It is important to note that security for legal costs is not automatically ordered by German courts, and it depends on the party’s formal role in the first instance.

Countersuits are exempt from the obligation to provide security for costs.

r Respondents must formally request security for costs in the  enforcement proceedings.

The respondent’s nationality is irrelevant.

Even if the respondent has the same nationality as the applicant, he remains entitled to security for costs.

In other words, not only Germans but also foreign individuals or entities can apply for security for costs.

Noerr,"Hungary: Significant Changes to the Labor Code From January 1, 2023","The most comprehensive amendment to the current Hungarian Labor Code (Act I of 2012 on the Labor Code) is expected to enter into force on January 1, 2023.

Most of the amendment is based on the implementation of European Union directives (2019/1152 and 2019/1158).

These aim to create more transparent and predictable working conditions and a better work-life balance, especially for parents and employees caring for their relatives.

The changes will require considerable preparation on the part of the employers, for example, by updating labor law documentation and examining more carefully the circumstances that give rise to unilateral measures, such as terminations, before taking action.

A substantial change is expected in the general rule on abuse of rights.

From January 1, if an employee claims that the employer committed an abuse, the burden of proof in any legal dispute will be on the employer with respect to the fact that there is no causal link between the circumstances referred to by the employee (for example, that he or she had a private dispute with his or her manager) and the harmful action caused (such as termination of employment).

This change in the burden of proof obviously puts employers in a more difficult position.

One practical consequence may be that employees are more likely to bring legal actions to challenge dismissals.

A significant change in the context of terminations is that, at the request of the employee, the employer will be obliged to give reasons for the termination even in cases where the Labor Code does not otherwise oblige the employer to do so (under a probationary period, termination of an executive employee’s employment, or an employee who is retired).

Such a request will only be possible in some instances, for example, if the employee claims the termination is due to their asking for flexible working conditions.

One of the most significant changes will be that employees with young children (up to the age of eight) and employees taking care of relatives will be able to ask their employer to change their place of work or working schedule or to request part-time or teleworking.

Employees may only make such a request if they have been employed for at least six months and must give written reasons.

The employer must provide a written answer, including proper reasoning, within 15 days.

If the employee believes the refusal is unlawful or the employer does not offer a response within the time limit, the employee can go to court.

The court can provide the necessary approval to change the working conditions instead of the employer.

The mandatory content of the information to be provided at the start of the employment relationship will be extended, requiring employers to update their templates.

Furthermore, the deadline for providing such information will be shorter (it will have to be presented within seven days of the start of the employment).

The duration of paternity leave will be increased from five to 10 working days.

For the first five working days, the employee will be entitled to his full absence pay; from the sixth day onwards, 40% of it must be granted.

A new legal instrument called parental leave will be introduced, under which an employee with a child under three will be entitled to 44 working days of leave (both the mother and the father can take parental leave).

For this leave, 10% of the absence pay is payable, but this must be reduced by the amount of the child’s social security benefit paid to the employee.

A working time benefit for caregivers is also introduced, under which an employee is exempted from the obligation to work for up to five working days a year to provide personal care to a relative who needs care for serious health reasons or to a person living in the same household as the employee."
Noerr,"Hungary: Significant Changes to the Labor Code From January 1, 2023","Although this is not a change in connection to the directives, it is worth mentioning that in the future, an employee who is unfit for work for health reasons will be exempted from their obligation to work and will not be entitled to salary during the period of exemption.

With this amendment, the legislator has sought to eliminate inconsistent case law by introducing a uniform rule in the Labor Code."
Noerr,Bamberg Higher Regional Court rules on insurance claim under vehicle recall insurance policy,"Court decisions relating to industrial liability insurance are rare and decisions on vehicle recall insurance are even rarer.

Surprisingly little attention has been paid to a judgment of such kind that was handed down by the Bamberg Higher Regional Court (Case ref.

1 U 79/20; BeckRS 2021, 60955) as far back as 16 December 2021 (cf. r+s 2023, 310, with criticisms from Schimikowski).

Cover provided by vehicle recall insurance Vehicle recall insurance provides cover in three different situations: first, as the name suggests, recalls issued for product safety reasons (risk prevention); second, pre-recall measures, where no recall is necessary because the vehicles affected have not yet been delivered and, finally, installation and dismantling costs outside of emergency response.

The last of the three relates to cases involving product warranties.

These three coverage sections are mutually exclusive.

Pre-recall measures can only be taken prior to delivery; thereafter, the vehicles may have to be recalled.

Insurance coverage for installation and dismantling costs outside of emergency response, regardless of whether the manufacturer still has the vehicles or has already delivered them, is only available (cf.

German Insurance Association’s Model Conditions for Professional and Business Liability Insurance (AVB BHV) A5-5.1, version May 2019) )

if no pre-recall measures have been taken or recall issued.

“Trigger madness” The insured event that activates coverage (in insurance jargon “trigger”) becomes particularly relevant when deciding whether insurance coverage is available at all and, if so, during which insurance period, from which insurance company and on what terms.

There is no uniform definition of this trigger for all three coverage sections of vehicle recall insurance.

The trigger in the case of safety-related recalls to avoid personal injury and property damage (cf.

AVB BHV A5-3.1) is the vehicle manufacturer’s observation of a statutory duty to issue a recall notice requesting the registered vehicle keeper to take the vehicle to a dealership.

In these cases, the vehicle manufacturer necessarily communicates to the outside world.

On the other hand, the coverage trigger for pre-recall measures (cf.

AVB BHV A5-4.2), provided vehicles “are still in the manufacturer’s yard”, and for insuring installation and dismantling costs outside of emergency response (cf.

AVB BHV A5-5.2), irrespective of the vehicle’s location, is in both cases the automobile manufacturer’s internal directive to examine the parts suspected of being defective.

It is not uncommon, especially for the terms and conditions of brokers to bypass vague references to internal directives by including other definitions of insured events; as in the case of product liability insurance, this is done, for example, by referring to an earlier point in time, i.e. when the defective parts were installed or, at the other end of the timeline, to the time of dismantling.

There have even occasionally been calls for the “claims-made” principle familiar from D&O insurance to be applied across the board.

Representatives of leading industrial insurance brokers have already spoken of “trigger madness” in view of the manifold approaches to trigger coverage (Grote, Zeitschrift für Versicherungswesen 2019, 212).

No final clarification from Bamberg Higher Regional Court Put very simply, the judgment of the Bamberg Higher Regional Court was based on the following facts: In 2014, dangerous defects in certain vehicle components became apparent.

It was not until the following year, namely 2015, that the vehicle manufacturer issued recall notices to vehicle keepers requesting them to take their vehicles to a dealership.

This occurred after the components supplier, which later faced substantial recourse claims for the costs of the recall campaign, had changed insurers at the end of 2014."
Noerr,Bamberg Higher Regional Court rules on insurance claim under vehicle recall insurance policy,"This occurred after the components supplier, which later faced substantial recourse claims for the costs of the recall campaign, had changed insurers at the end of 2014.

The component supplier’s claim for insurance coverage was directed solely against the insurance company that had been the insurer in 2014.

The claim was unsuccessful if for no other reason than that Bamberg Higher Regional Court was unable to conclude that an event triggering insurance cover had occurred in 2014.

The outcome would in any event appear to be clearly correct in relation to two of the three coverage sections: the recall campaign which, if it even did take place, did not occur until 2015 when recall notices were issued to the vehicle keepers and the pre-recall measures because all of the vehicles affected were obviously already in the hands of customers.

The parties, however, also disagreed as to whether coverage of installation and dismantling costs beyond risk prevention had in fact been triggered in 2014 through the issue of a corresponding internal directive of the automobile manufacturer.

The insured component supplier argued that even in 2014 the vehicle manufacturer had directed to conduct an internal review of the life expectancy of the vehicle components affected.

It alleged further that, at least in the case of the vehicles affected that were in Asia, the decision to replace the components affected had also been taken in 2014, albeit not implemented until 2015.

Bamberg Higher Regional Court did not accept these arguments.

According to the Court, in contrast to the mere issue of an internal directive, a recall in the form of recall notices issued to the vehicle keepers, which also served to prevent injury or damage, had occurred in 2015.

Based on the manufacturer’s review of the components’ life expectancy and the expert opinions submitted during the hearing, the defects in the components could have caused “significant engine damage” and, also personal injuries.

The Court concluded from this that there was no room for finding that coverage for installation and dismantling costs outside of emergency response was available.

This reasoning and the distinctions made are not convincing.

Insurance cover for installation and dismantling costs outside of emergency response exists regardless of whether the vehicles affected are still in the manufacturer’s yard or are already in the hands of customers.

This insurance cover cannot be excluded simply because the vehicles affected might first have to be called to the dealerships via a notice issued to the vehicle keepers.

Whether one calls this a “non-safety recall” (Nickel/Nickel-Fiedler, Rückrufkostenversicherung , KfzRückRM, no. 8, para.

1), a service campaign or something similar is irrelevant for insurance cover.

Apart from that, not every recall to avoid personal injury or property damage is automatically also a recall within the meaning of the insurance conditions.

In fact, most insurance conditions as also in the present case make the existence of a corresponding statutory recall duty a prerequisite for recall coverage (Model Conditions for Professional and Business Liability Insurance A5-3.1).

Ever since Germany’s Federal Court of Justice in its “nursing beds” judgment (NJW 2009, 1080) rejected, in the special circumstances of that case, the existence of a recall duty for nursing beds that were a fire hazard, it has become necessary to verify in each specific case whether the risk of personal injury and, even more so, every risk of property damage (including in the form of damages limited to the defective product itself) actually gives rise to a statutory recall duty.

Moreover, it will be necessary to examine this question in relation to every jurisdiction in which affected vehicles are located and the results may be different in each case (Schimikowski, r+s 2023, 315 et seq.)."
Noerr,Bamberg Higher Regional Court rules on insurance claim under vehicle recall insurance policy,"The Higher Regional Court of Bamberg did not look into this and thus avoided dealing with the issue of internal directives as triggers in more detail.

Risk of gaps in coverage It is conceivable that in one jurisdiction the earlier trigger of an internal directive in connection with installation and dismantling costs would be decisive, whereas in another a recall that occurred during a later insurance period with a different insurer would apply.

It might be possible to avoid having insurance cover fragmented or to avoid coverage gaps due to the unwillingness of subsequent insurers to accept known or emerging risks by incorporating a “serial loss” clause in the policy with the previous insurer which also covered claims for subsequent loss or by possibly adding a “notice of circumstance” provision to the policy.

Neither necessarily reflects current market standards.

A careful examination of the insurance conditions is recommended especially if a change of insurer is being considered."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: Updated guidelines on the right of access,"The updated Guidelines of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) on the right of access make it necessary for companies to review their internal processes and documentation on data protection in order to avoid fines and claims for damages for failing to provide sufficient access.

Background: Extensive obligation to provide access under the GDPR The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies to provide data subjects with information on personal data relating to them without delay upon request – usually within one month at the latest.

Firstly, this includes confirming whether the company processes personal data of the person requesting information at all.

If this is the case, information on these data must be provided in the form of a copy of the personal data.

In addition, certain information about the processing of the data and about the rights of the data subject must be provided.

Strict requirements for the provision of access In February 2022, the European Data Protection Board published new guidelines on the right of access under the GDPR for public consultation.

In these guidelines, the supervisory authorities imposed strict requirements for the provision of access under data protection law .

Following the conclusion of the consultation process, the EDPB recently published an updated version of its guidelines.

As expected, the new version does not contain any groundbreaking changes compared to the consultation version.

Apart from some editorial corrections, the adjustments focus essentially on clarifying selected points and provide a few additional case examples.

Thus, the supervisory authorities are adhering to their strict approach.

Unsurprisingly, in the updated version of its guidelines, the EDPB also addresses in particular the judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of 12 January 2023 .

The judgment confirms the strict view already taken by the supervisory authorities in the consultation version of their guidelines that data controllers must, in principle, name all specific data recipients when providing access.

Review of internal processes and documentation of data protection in companies According to the view of the EDPB expressed in its guidelines, companies must proactively prepare for access requests and, if necessary, create appropriate internal processes for this purpose so that they are able to properly provide access and do so without delay and, as a rule, within one month at most.

In light of the updated EDPB guidelines, companies should therefore carefully review and, if necessary, optimise their internal processes and documentation on data protection.

In particular, internal policies for handling requests under data privacy law (data subject access requests) and templates for responding to access requests should be revised in order to be prepared for such requests.

Private enforcement ‒ damages claims by data subjects Violations of the obligation to provide access can lead to the exercise of a range of powers by the supervisory authorities or the imposition of major fines.

For example, the Hessian Data Protection Authority has imposed fines in the mid ten-thousands for breaches of the obligation to provide access.

The strict requirements of the supervisory authorities, however, also further encourage private enforcement in data protection law .

Companies are increasingly confronted with claims for non-material damages due to breaches of access obligations.

It is worth noting in this context that there is an increasing tendency among German courts to render plaintiff-friendly rulings.

For example, the Oldenburg Labour Court recently awarded non-material damages in the amount of €10,000 for violations of the right of access.

The Düsseldorf Labour Court awarded non-material damages in the amount of €5,000 for a delay in providing access, while the Hamm Regional Labour Court awarded non-material damages in the amount of €1,000."

Noerr,Impact of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation on Private Equity firms and other institutional investors,"Notifications of M&A transactions that are signed on or after 12 July 2023 and have not been closed by 12 October 2023 will have to be filed with the European Commission (“ Commission ”) if they exceed the thresholds under the new EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“ FSR ”) (see our article here ).

In order to clarify the formal requirements for such notifications for the companies concerned, the Commission published a draft Implementing Regulation (“ IR ”) in February 2023 which sought to resolve procedural issues (see our article here ).

As part of a consultation process, stakeholders and other interested parties were given the opportunity to submit comments on this draft IR to the Commission by 6 March 2023.

The Commission received 74 responses to this consultation, in particular from businesses (32) and business organisations (29).

In the following, we address some of the criticisms and proposals for change made by private equity firms and other institutional investors such as sovereign pension funds.

Overall, their submissions make it clear that the FSR will have a significant administrative impact, especially for these investors.

I. Criticism and proposals for change from institutional investors 1.

Term “financial contribution” defined too broadly Institutional investors invariably criticised the fact that the term “financial contribution” under the FSR is unclear and defined too broadly.

All of the other participants in the consultation shared this criticism.

The broad definition of the term “financial contribution” is problematic because the term is pivotal for the obligation to report an M&A transaction.

Whereas under EU State aid law, only “aid” must be reported to the Commission, under the FSR “financial contributions” are sufficient to trigger the obligation.

The main difference lies in the fact that “aid” is only available if a financial contribution also confers a selective advantage on the undertakings concerned.

The FSR however takes this into account only during the substantive examination, i.e. after notification.

The broad definition of “financial contribution” is particularly evident in the following examples: on the one hand, any tax advantage granted by a third country can be understood as a “financial contribution”.

On the other, the mere purchase of goods and services from or their sale to a third country can also provide companies with a “financial contribution”, even if this occurs on regular market terms.

This means that companies will face the challenge of having to effectively monitor and record any economic interaction with a third country (and affiliated entities, see point 4. below).

In principle, this would also include investments and contributions to funds of limited partners, which (like pension funds) could be regarded as state actors.

This is because a company can only check whether it has an obligation to report an M&A transaction if it knows which “financial contribution” came from a third country.

For this reason, the solution uniformly proposed by institutional investors is to limit the definition of “financial contributions” under the FSR to those that also constitute a selective advantage for certain companies and to significantly increase the de minimis threshold for financial contributions.

The EU legislature intentionally defined the term “financial contributions” broadly so that it would be possible to carry out extensive reviews of any third countries’ influence  on the EU internal market.

Restricting the scope of the term would risk allowing the opportunity to review financial contributions to be circumvented.

The Commission therefore has to balance the legislative interest in investigating financial contributions with the practical needs of companies.

One possible option for the Commission would be to establish exemptions for “financial contributions” that would otherwise have to be taken into account."
Noerr,Impact of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation on Private Equity firms and other institutional investors,"One possible option for the Commission would be to establish exemptions for “financial contributions” that would otherwise have to be taken into account.

For example, it could exempt interactions with third countries resulting from competitive tender procedures from the definition.

This means that arm’s length transactions with third countries could be disregarded.

2. Understanding of the term “notifying party” too broad Institutional investors also criticised the Commission’s broad understanding of who should be regarded as a notifying party.

This is related to the question of who the recipient of a financial contribution is and therefore what information the parties have to disclose when making their notification.

At present, the entire group of companies (“economic unit”) is considered the notifying party and, simultaneously, the recipient of the contributions.

Put simply, all companies that are jointly controlled count as one enterprise (one economic unit).

This understanding has particularly far-reaching consequences for institutional investors because different funds and the portfolio companies held by them are often controlled by a single investment firm (general partner).

This makes it necessary for each fund and each portfolio company to treat financial contributions from other funds and portfolio companies controlled by the same  investment firm as its own.

As a result, all the “financial contributions” of all of the funds and portfolio companies would always have to be regarded for the threshold calculation and listed with each application.

In order to limit their administrative burden, institutional investors are proposing that the term “notifying party” be restricted to the acting portfolio company itself or at least the relevant fund(s) making the investment.

This would lead to a different understanding of the term “notifying party” in the case of investments from institutional investors than in other cases.

Commission representatives themselves have already shown a willingness to allow exceptions for institutional investors such as private equity firms and accept that the FSR’s administrative burden could otherwise prove a barrier to investment.

It is thus to be expected that the Commission will take this criticism from institutional investors into account in the final version of the IR.

3.

Dispensing with disclosure requirements in respect of M&A auctions Another point of criticism raised by institutional investors is the obligation to disclose information about the auction process that led to the transaction to be notified.

The Commission’s draft notification form for M&A transactions requires the acquirer to disclose details such as the number of participants in the auction process, the number of potential acquirers contacted by the seller and to give a detailed description of the other participants in the auction process.

The main problem for institutional investors is that the auction participants themselves usually do not have such information.

This has led to suggestions that the information should have to be disclosed (if at all) by the seller.

However, the disclosure of such information could influence the results of (future) auctions.

Sellers could be incentivised to exclude potential bidders who fall within the scope of the FSR from auctions in order to avoid the problem.

This could lead to disadvantages for institutional investors.

Furthermore, the disclosure of such information could also raise antitrust issues.

It is likely that these criticisms will prompt the Commission to review its notification form as it would not wish the FSR to hinder M&A auction procedures or create antitrust problems for itself.

4. Ambiguities in attribution to third countries Finally, institutional investors complained of the effort involved in attributing a financial contribution to a third country due to the difficulty of identifying the payee behind an investor."
Noerr,Impact of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation on Private Equity firms and other institutional investors,"For this reason, some institutional investors have proposed including exceptions in the IR, for example, for contributions from (state) pension funds to the relevant third country and for interactions with investors based in jurisdictions with which the EU has concluded a free trade agreement (such as Canada).

The problem of exceptions for investments which can only be indirectly attributed to third countries poses a particular challenge for the Commission since it could lead to third countries structuring their affairs in a way that is designed to deliberately circumvent the FSR.

On the other hand, it can be very time-consuming for institutional investors to have to identify  the state a contributionoriginates from.

It remains to be seen whether the Commission will be able to solve this problem in the IR or whether a solution will only emerge through practice.

II.

Outlook

The amendments proposed by institutional investors are aimed essentially at avoiding administrative burdens and thus potential delays in M&A transactions, and, of course, the risk of heavy fines for breaches.

Unsurprisingly, these organisations are calling for clear and easy-to-manage requirements.

The Commission, however, must reconcile meeting the FSR’s objectives with ensuring that the EU internal market offers good investment conditions.

As a result, it will not be able to accede to every request from institutional investors.

Nevertheless, the Commission has itself acknowledged that FSR notification requirements will create a considerable amount of extra work.

The likelihood of this pushing the Commission’s personnel capacities to its limits cannot be ruled out.

It would be desirable if the Commission were to deal with the bulk of the criticisms in the final version of the IR, whose adoption is planned for Q2 2023.

Due to the FSR’s far-reaching impact on the investment climate in the EU internal market, it would also be highly beneficial if it were to quickly clarify the approach it will take in practice.

This would help realise the goal of a “level playing field” for all companies operating in the EU internal market."
Noerr,Romania: Latest changes to VAT exemptions,"Law 88/2023, which was published in Official Gazette no. 310 from 12/04/2023, contains important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Code.

From 11 June 2023, the following supplies will be VAT-exempt: construction, rehabilitation and modernisation services for hospital units within the public network, as well as construction, rehabilitation and modernisation services for hospital units which are supplied to non-profit entities registered in the Public Register organised by the tax authorities if the services are intended for hospital units owned and operated by the non-profit entity or those from the public network, as the case may be; medical equipment, devices, articles, accessories and protective equipment, materials and consumables for sanitary use, normally intended for use in the field of healthcare or for use by disabled persons, essential goods for compensating for and overcoming disabilities, other than those mentioned below, as well as the adaptation, repair, rental and leasing of such goods, carried out for hospital units in the public network, as well as those carried out for non-profit entities registered in the Public Register organised by the tax authorities if they are intended for hospital units owned and operated by the non-profit entity or those from the public network, as the case may be; prostheses and accessories, with the exception of dental prostheses legally exempt from VAT; orthopaedic products.

The VAT exemption for the supply of the goods/services mentioned above applies: directly, by the suppliers of goods/services issuing invoices without VAT if the beneficiary of the goods/services is a hospital unit within the public network or, if applicable, the central or local public institution/authority which ensures its financing, according to the law; by way of VAT refunds on the purchase of goods/services by non-profit entities according to a procedure established by order of the Minister of Public Finance.

The VAT refunded from the state budget must be used by non-profit entities exclusively to finance the acquisition of the aforementioned goods/services.

The order of the Minister of Finance and the methodology for applying the VAT exemption will be issued within 60 days of publication of this law in the Official Gazette."
Noerr,Reform of EU State aid law: Major subsidies pave the way for climate neutrality,"The European Commission presented its Green Deal Industrial Plan on 1 February 2023.

The plan defines the goal of net-zero industry in Europe and a rapid transition to climate neutrality.

EU State aid law was pinpointed as a key implementation tool, leading to the adoption of the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) on 9 March 2023 (see our News article ).

Simplified investment in response to competition from outside Europe The European Union faces international competition in its transition to climate neutrality.

It is crucial to use EU State aid law to prevent companies migrating to third countries.

This applies especially to companies operating in strategically important sectors (batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, electrolysers and equipment for carbon capture, use and storage).

Up to 15% of the costs of manufacturing equipment or key components in those sectors, including the required raw materials, and a total amount of up to EUR 150 million, are eligible for State aid (see paragraph 85 TCTF).

Depending on the assisted region, State aid of up to 35% of eligible costs and a total sum of up to EUR 350 million can be granted.

If State aid is awarded in the form of tax advantages, loans or guarantees, the amount may be increased by 5 percentage points, even up to 20 percentage points with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs').

The State aid can be granted on a temporary basis until 31 December 2025 under the TCTF and must not lead to any changes of location within the single market.

The companies concerned must also commit to keeping the investment in that region for at least five years (three years for SMEs) after the completion of the investment.

To remain competitive compared with third non-EU countries, two mechanisms in particular were included in Chapter 2.8 TCTF (paragraph 86) to allow for higher State aid in individual cases.

These two mechanisms apply only to individual aid and additional requirements must be met (see below).

Matching aid It may be more lucrative for companies to relocate their production to third countries outside the EEA, for example if those countries offer higher and simpler State aid options.

The matching aid mechanism is intended to allow a company to receive State aid in the single market equal to what it would have verifiably received in a third country outside the EEA for a comparable investment.

Hereby, the instrument is reminiscent of the “most-favoured-nation” principle used by the WTO.

Funding gap The aim of this scheme is to plug any funding gaps compared to third countries to give companies an incentive to operate within the EEA.

Having said this, the instrument is already familiar within EU state aid law, but with a different reference point.

Typically, EU state aid law focuses on the amount necessary to induce the company to invest.

In contrast, the funding gap is determined by the third country scenario, i. e. the difference between the net present value of the expected cash flows of the aided investment and the net present value of the expected cash flows of the hypothetical investment in a third country outside the EEA.

Careful assessment required There are additional requirements to be met to qualify for these additional subsidies based on matching aid or funding gaps.

Depending on whether the amount is lower for matching aid or under the funding gap scheme, only the lower amount of State aid can be granted.

The company must provide substantiated evidence of subsidies that it would be likely to receive in a third country outside the EEA.

In addition, the company must use state-of-the-art production technologies from an environmental emissions perspective.

As not all Member States have the same opportunities to adapt their subsidies to those of third countries, the mechanisms may pose a risk to the competitiveness and integrity of the single market."
Noerr,Reform of EU State aid law: Major subsidies pave the way for climate neutrality,"As not all Member States have the same opportunities to adapt their subsidies to those of third countries, the mechanisms may pose a risk to the competitiveness and integrity of the single market.

Therefore, the TCTF stipulates that higher investments may be subsidised if they (a) are within a previously designated assisted area for regional aid (b) are carried out in at least three Member States.

In the case of cross-border investments (option b)), a significant part of the total investment must be realised in at least two assisted areas, one of which must be designated as a structurally weak and thus category “A” assisted area.

“A” assisted areas are outermost regions or regions whose GDP does not exceed 75% of the EU average.

In this way, aid granted to one rich region is meant to boost other regions too.

Noerr,UPC Divisions And Locations: Where Can I File Which Action?,"As of June 1, 2023, patent infringement and nullity actions will be possible before the Unified Patent Court (UPC).

The UPC will be able to decide on all disputes relating to Unitary Patents and European Patents, at least where no opt-out is declared and if the subject matter of the action is not already pending before a member state court (cf.

our posts from March 21 , 2023 and March 27 , 2023 ).

This leads to the question to which UPC division one should bring their patent action.

Which divisions and location does the UPC offer to the plaintiffs and what determines which division of the UPC is competent for a case?

The following post addresses these questions.

I. From Paris And Munich To Helsinki: Divisions Of The UPC In First Instance The UPC consists of Local and Regional Divisions and a Central Division.

The Central Division has its seat in Paris and a section in Munich.

The fate of the second section remains to be decided: originally intended for London, it will Brexit-related possibly open in Milan instead.

Local and Regional Divisions can be found in almost all UPC member states.

As a rule, there is one Local or Regional Division per member state.

Germany alone has received the maximum number of four Local Divisions, seated in Dusseldorf, Munich, Mannheim and Hamburg respectively.

Other Local Divisions are located in Brussels, The Hague, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Ljubljana, Milan, Paris and Vienna; in addition, there are Regional Divisions such as the Nordic Baltic Division in Stockholm which will conduct its hearings also in Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius.

In accordance with the structure and tasks of the Court, the UPC’s Divisions consist of judges from various jurisdictions and technical fields.

The Local and Regional Divisions, which are responsible for the majority of patent infringement cases, can decide without the participation of a technically qualified judge.

In contrast, the Central Division is always also staffed with technically qualified judges.

These judges provide the technical expertise required to assess the various patent validity disputes that the Central Division is responsible for.

All in all, this mix of legally and technically qualified judges allows the UPC’s Divisions to have a composition and expertise similar to e.g. the German Federal Patent Court’s.

II.

Which Divisions Are Competent For Infringement Actions?

Under the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA), plaintiffs can regularly choose from a number of competent Divisions: 33 (1) (a) UPCA states that the Local or Regional Division for the UPC member state in which the patent infringement took place is competent for a patent infringement case.

33 (1) (b) UPCA further gives competence to the Division that has jurisdiction over the member state in which the defendant has its seat .

33 (1) subparagraph (2) UPCA further gives competence for infringement cases to the Central Division if an infringement took place in a UPC member state and if the defendant has no seat in a UPC member state.

33 (1) subparagraph 3

UPCA provides that if the patent infringement took place in a UPC member state without Local or Regional Division (such as e.g. in Bulgaria or Malta) and the defendant has no seat in a member state with a UPC Division, the Central Division is always competent.

III.

Which Divisions Are Competent For Nullity Actions?

With respect to questions of validity of patents, a distinction must be made between isolated nullity actions and nullity counterclaims: According to Art.

33 (4) clause 1 UPCA, the Central Division has a primary competence for isolated nullity actions .

According to Art.

33 (3) (a) UPCA, a nullity counterclaim may be decided by the Local or Regional Division which decides on the pending infringement action."
Noerr,UPC Divisions And Locations: Where Can I File Which Action?,"According to Art.

33 (3) (a) UPCA, a nullity counterclaim may be decided by the Local or Regional Division which decides on the pending infringement action.

Alternatively Art. 33 (3) (b), (c) UPCA allows for the Local and Regional Divisions to refer the nullity counterclaim or (with the consent of the parties) the entire proceedings to the Central Division .

By providing these options, the UPC offers considerable flexibility to both plaintiffs and case managing judges.

The UPC pairs this flexibility with a promise of mostly uniform decision on questions of validity and infringement and fast proceedings.

According to its Rules of Procedure, the UPC should be able to make a first-instance decision within one year after the action has been filed.

To ensure that the Local and Regional Divisions, which will decide the majority of cases, can meet these requirements also in technically complex cases, Local and Regional Divisions can ask to have a technically qualified judge assigned for the case.

This gives the UPC a further advantage over the patent litigation chambers of many member states, which are often exclusively staffed with legally qualified judges."
Noerr,Romania: The double-edged sword of ChatGPT in the workplace,"The business world is evolving at lightning speed, and technology is at the forefront of this change.

One of the most significant technological advancements is the use of chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Even though using ChatGPT might sound like a good idea and simplify workflows, its widespread use in the workplace can be a double-edged sword, raising concerns about the potential risks and legal issues that employers must take into account to safeguard their business.

Using ChatGPT without a proper framework can be a legal minefield, endangering both employers and employees.

As a result, it's essential to be aware of the potential hazards associated with utilizing ChatGPT in the workplace.

In this article, we explore some of the most significant risks that employers must navigate to reap the benefits of workplace innovation while avoiding legal pitfalls.

What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a cutting-edge natural language model developed by Open AI, introduced to the market in November 2022.

Unlike conventional chatbots, which are usually designed for specific functions, ChatGPT's adaptability enables it to be used for various tasks.

This makes ChatGPT a highly valuable resource, as it was trained using vast amounts of unlabelled data, making it highly advanced and versatile.

As companies continue to explore the option of using ChatGPT to optimize their business processes, it is increasingly becoming a preferred tool for employees across various industries when carrying out their day-to-day tasks, from drafting emails to generating job offers and even programming.

Potential risks for employers While ChatGPT could seem like an attractive option for companies and individuals seeking to streamline their workflows, it's important to consider whether it is the best tool for the job.

Is it true that ChatGPT's adaptability enables it to be used for a wide range of tasks; however, it may not always be the optimal choice for every situation since it may trigger some potential risks for companies.

1. Security, data privacy and confidentiality breaches ChatGPT can expose employers to risks if employees feed it proprietary or confidential information/personal data.

Such disclosure could lead to penalties or legal actions against the company such as: claims for damages and/or penalties for breaching personal data regulations if the employees disclose information that includes certain personal data of other employees/clients/customers, etc; and/or claims for damages in case of disclosure of commercial and/or sensitive data; this may also cause damage to the company’s reputation.

2. Providing inaccurate or outdated information While ChatGPT is an AI-powered language model trained on a vast amount of data, it's important to note that it may not always provide accurate or up-to-date information since the tool is not updated in real time.

This may lead to errors or inaccurate results when performing tasks.

Moreover, ChatGPT may not always be able to distinguish between reliable and inaccurate information, which could lead employees to make decisions based on misleading or incorrect information.

For instance, if ChatGPT provides inaccurate information in response to a customer query, it could lead to customer dissatisfaction and harm the company's reputation.

Inaccurate/outdated information from ChatGPT could have far-reaching consequences for businesses, making it crucial to ensure that employees understand the limitations of this tool and use it judiciously.

While ChatGPT can be an effective tool that streamlines workflows, it's important to validate its results and cross-check them with human expertise to ensure accuracy and reliability.

3.

Copyright infringement Using ChatGPT to generate responses to user queries might also be dangerous in regard to copyrights.

The language model’s development relies heavily on internet data, and some of this data may be subject to copyright laws."
Noerr,Romania: The double-edged sword of ChatGPT in the workplace,"The language model’s development relies heavily on internet data, and some of this data may be subject to copyright laws.

Imagine a scenario where ChatGPT uses copyrighted content to generate responses to user queries.

This could lead to copyright infringement, which could result in a costly lawsuit or infringement claim.

It’s important to understand that it's not just the employee who's at risk here; the employer can also be held liable for any copyright infringement committed by its employees.

For instance, an employee’s use of copyrighted images, text, or any other protected content could breach the owner's exclusive rights and lead to a legal nightmare.

If the breach is discovered, the copyright owner could file a lawsuit against both the employee and the employer responsible for the infringement.

Thus, employers should ensure that they comply with copyright laws, or they might find themselves and their employees navigating a minefield that nobody wants to face.

4. Inherent bias There is also a growing concern about potential biases that may be ingrained in ChatGPT.

After all, the tool learns from the data it is trained on, leaving room for potential unintentional biases to creep into its algorithms.

These biases could affect how ChatGPT responds to user queries and  trigger legal consequences.

Moreover, if employees rely on ChatGPT for decision-making processes such as hiring or promotion tasks, the system's biases could result in discrimination claims.

For example, ChatGPT’s bias was put to a test by requesting it to generate basic performance feedback for various professions.

The result showed that gender stereotypes influenced ChatGPT’s choice of pronouns for jobs such as receptionist or construction worker.

Additionally, the feedback provided for female employees was longer than that for male employees, highlighting the potential for gender bias in the system.

This example underscores once again the need for employers to be aware of and eliminate any inherent biases in ChatGPT.

What can employers do Employers must take appropriate steps to address the risks and potential legal implications associated with using ChatGPT in the workplace.

The decision to allow employees to use ChatGPT in their daily tasks is crucial and can have a significant impact on the company's reputation and compliance obligations.

To mitigate these risks, employers can choose to permanently restrict the use of ChatGPT in the workplace.

In such case, the employers should: - clearly include this restriction in the internal regulations/policies; and - restrict their employees’ access to the ChatGPT website/ application.

Alternatively, if employers decide to allow the use of ChatGPT, the following actions could be considered: drafting and implementing clear rules and procedures regarding the use of ChatGPT.

These rules should provide a clear framework on how and to what extent this tool can be used by the employees in their daily tasks, such as: - prohibiting employees from referring to or entering confidential, personal data or information into ChatGPT; - expressly stipulating which tasks can or cannot be performed using ChatGPT; - imposing the obligation to include human oversight and review ChatGPT’s responses.

conduct training sessions with employees to raise their awareness of the potential risks associated with using ChatGPT, thus empowering employees to identify situations where it may not be appropriate or could pose a risk to the company.

Having clear rules and procedures in place for the use of ChatGPT in the workplace is crucial for employers, regardless of whether they allow its use or not.

These rules provide a framework for employees to follow and also allow employers to hold employees disciplinarily liable in case of failure to observe them.

Conclusions Is ChatGPT a game-changer in the workplace, or a legal headache waiting to happen?

The answer is both."
Noerr,Romania: The double-edged sword of ChatGPT in the workplace,"Conclusions Is ChatGPT a game-changer in the workplace, or a legal headache waiting to happen?

The answer is both.

While ChatGPT can boost efficiency and productivity, employers must also navigate potential risks and compliance issues.

It is also important for companies to realise that, as ChatGPT becomes more prevalent in the workplace, the competitive edge of offering innovative solutions or responses may diminish.

Thus, employers should thoughtfully consider whether and if so, how, their employees should use ChatGPT.

In either case, they should establish clear policies and procedures to reduce potential risks.

By being proactive in addressing these risks, employers can maximize the advantages of ChatGPT while minimizing potential legal and compliance issues."
Noerr,Ministerial bill promoting immigration by skilled workers,"Plans to make immigration of skilled workers from countries outside the EU easier It is common knowledge that the demand for skilled personnel on the German labour market cannot be met by using skilled workers from the European Union.

There are now plans to simplify and broaden the options for recruiting third-country nationals in the newly published draft bill on immigration by skilled workers.

Germany’s Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community and Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs have started consultations in the various committees by submitting this draft bill for an Act to promote immigration by skilled workers ( Gesetz zur Weiterentwicklung der Fachkräfteeinwanderung ).

Objectives and need for the provisions The draft bill is designed to further develop the legal framework for promoting the targeted and controlled migration of skilled workers from non-EU states so as to strengthen Germany’s labour market and its standing as a business location.

The intention is to contribute towards sustained social prosperity and safeguard the social security systems.

At the same time, the draft intends to implement the requirements in Directive (EU) 2021/1883 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2021 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of highly qualified employment.

Skilled-worker pillar as a supporting element

The draft bill is based on three pillars – the skilled-worker pillar, experience pillar and potential pillar.

The skilled-worker pillar continues to be the central element for migration.

As was previously the case, it also encompasses the EU Blue Card for foreign graduates of higher education institutions and the national residence permit for foreign skilled workers with German vocational training or vocational training recognised in Germany, or alternatively an equivalent higher education qualification.

The draft now extends the range of employment options for skilled workers.

In contrast to the present current situation, a skilled worker with eligible vocational training will be able to carry out any eligible employment.

The contents of the vocational qualification will then no longer have to match the planned employment.

This is intended to also apply to skilled workers with an academic degree.

Being classified as a skilled worker enables them to then take part in any type of employment.

Foreign skilled workers with a German degree can obtain a residence permit even without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency.

The requirement that the employment has to match the qualification will only continue to apply when issuing the EU Blue Card.

Summary of the most important points The draft bill provides for a range of changes to the EU Blue Card: The minimum annual salary required for issuing the regular (“big”) EU Blue Card is to be reduced from around €58,400.00 gross (2/3 of the earnings ceiling used for assessment of contributions in Germany’s statutory pension scheme for 2023) to approximately €49,581.60 gross (56.6% of the contribution assessment ceiling).

If the employee’s minimum salary reaches this threshold, it is not necessary to obtain the Federal Employment Agency’s approval for the EU Blue Card to be issued, which considerably speeds up the application procedure.

The minimum annual salary for issuing a “small” EU Blue Card (which is subject to approval ) is also to be reduced from some €45,552.00 gross (52% of the contribution assessment ceiling) to €39,682.80 gross (45.3% of the contribution assessment ceiling) for STEM professions, where there are shortages and bottlenecks.

If the skilled worker concerned holds a qualification from a German higher education institution, it will additionally also be possible for the small EU Blue Card to be issued without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency."
Noerr,Ministerial bill promoting immigration by skilled workers,"A completely new arrangement is the small EU Blue Card for those taking up their first job : in future, a skilled worker will be able to obtain the small EU Blue Card regardless of what professional group they belong to when they reach the lower income threshold for contribution assessments (45.3%) if they obtained their higher education qualifications no more than three years before making the application.

Besides this, there is a new possibility for skilled workers who have completed a tertiary education programme (university of applied sciences/technical college, vocational college, etc.) that is equivalent to a qualification from a higher education institution, requires a training period of at least three years and is classified in at least level 6 of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) or level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework in Germany to obtain the EU Blue Card.

Consequently, applicants no longer have to be trained at a university in order to be issued with an EU Blue Card.

To tackle the severe shortage of skilled personnel especially in the German IT sector, the draft bill also contains an exception from the skilled-worker requirement for IT specialists who have at least three years’ relevant professional experience.

The plan is that such people should also be able to get an EU Blue Card without higher education qualifications provided that they have abilities, knowledge and skills at a level comparable to higher education qualifications.

The government also intends to make it easier for holders of EU Blue Cards to change jobs and to create arrangements enabling long- and short-term mobility within the EU in order to keep skilled employees in Germany in the long term.

In addition, the draft provides that the employment in Germany for which the EU Blue Card is to be issued only has to have minimum term of six months.

Up to now, a minimum term of employment of one year was an (unwritten) requirement.

Apart from the changes for the EU Blue Card, the draft also contains further simplifications: Taking on students is to be made easier by introducing a workday account and topping up the maximum duration of employment to 140 workdays a year.

This will make the opportunities for deploying foreign work students more flexible.

Besides this, foreign trainees and students will be able to obtain a residence permit to engage in eligible employment even before they have completed their training or studies if they already satisfy the requirements.

Now that the prohibitions on changing the purpose will cease to apply, the barrier between stays for educational purposes and work that has existed to date will become easier to cross.

A new residence permit is also to be introduced for third-country nationals who are already qualified and hold a vocational qualification requiring a training period of at least two years that is state-recognised in their home country or higher education qualifications.

Unlike the current situation, they will be able to start the German process for recognition of the vocational qualification obtained abroad and will already be able to engage in eligible employment in Germany during the recognition process.

The condition for this is that they have a specific job offer and that the employer undertakes to allow the employee to take part in any necessary additional qualification measures within the employment relationship.

The government also plans to open up the German labour market even further for skilled foreign workers by allowing people with foreign vocational training lasting at least two years or higher education qualifications by launching a “ Chancenkarte” (opportunity card) enabling them to look for a job on the basis of a points system.

Points will be awarded for language skills, work experience, age and connections to Germany."
Noerr,Ministerial bill promoting immigration by skilled workers,"Points will be awarded for language skills, work experience, age and connections to Germany.

The Chancenkarte will entitle them to work on a trial basis for up to two weeks, but also to take on secondary employment for up to twenty hours a week.

These arrangements are also to be accompanied by procedural changes aiming to speed up issuing of visas.

Outlook These legislative changes aim to increase immigration by skilled workers and to make Germany a more attractive country for migrants.

The new provisions are intended to help overcome the “weaknesses” in the German Skilled Workers’ Immigration Act ( Fachkräfteeinwanderungsgesetz ) from 2020, one of these being the long application and visa processes.

It is to be hoped that these welcome simplifications will be implemented and actually put into practice in such a way that they allow companies to plan their HR affairs even at short notice.

Dismantling procedural obstacles would lead to a real reduction in workloads at the application authorities (which are generally understaffed) and ultimately lead to the entire process being speeded up.

This would be a great help to all those involved."
Noerr,Romania: Tax exemptions for digital nomads,"Following the legislative changes introduced at the beginning of 2022 concerning the long-term visa for digital nomads, the Romanian tax authorities have published Law no.

69/2023 in the Official Gazette no. 265 of 30 March 2023.

By Law no.

69/2023, the tax authorities have expressly stipulated that digital nomads, i.e. foreigners who come to Romania to work remotely for foreign companies by using information and communications technology, are expressly exempted from the requirement to pay income tax and social insurance contributions on the salary income gained from abroad.

The tax exemptions are valid only if the digital nomad stays in Romania for no more than 183 days (either a single period or several cumulative periods) during any consecutive 12-month period ending in a specific calendar year."
Noerr,Employee data protection: ECJ calls German provisions into question,"The European Court of Justice (ECJ) recently called into question the German provisions on employee data protection in its eagerly awaited judgment of 30 March 2023 in the request for a preliminary ruling on the live streaming of classes by videoconference in Hessen .

In its ruling, the Court focused mainly on the relevant provisions of employee data protection in section 23 of the Hessen Data Protection Act.

However, the Court’s critical considerations are certainly transferrable to the virtually identical rules on employee data protection in section 26 of the German Federal Data Protection Act.

The ECJ left it to the referring German court to decide on the compatibility of the relevant German national provisions with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

However, the ECJ clearly indicated it did not consider the German provisions on employee data protection compatible with the relevant provisions of Article 88 of the GDPR.

The ruling is a major blow to the German legislature, which has so far failed to produce legally watertight and appropriate regulations on employee data protection despite ongoing criticism.

If the German legislature does not remedy the situation soon by comprehensively revising the regulations on employee data protection in the German Federal Data Protection Act in conformity with EU law, or even by introducing a separate Employee Data Protection Act which the German data protection authorities have long been calling for, in future only the general GDPR provisions will apply to the processing of employee data.

In principle, these provisions also apply in the context of employment.

In this regard, the ECJ expressly stated in its ruling that the legal bases laid down in Article 6 of the GDPR were in themselves exhaustive and conclusive.

However, it remains to be seen whether the German lawmakers will actually take the ECJ ruling as an opportunity to quickly revise German data protection law.

Companies should therefore check as soon as possible which alternative legal bases they could use for processing employee data instead of section 26 of the German Federal Data Protection Act."
Noerr,Update: New type of class action in Germany – Federal government agrees on draft bill,"On 27 January 2023, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Germany and 23 other Member States because the Representative Actions Directive (RAD) was not transposed into national law by the due date of 25 December 2022.

Germany now plans to transpose the RAD at the very latest by the application deadline of 25 June 2023.

After much back and forth, the federal cabinet passed the government draft for the implementation of the RAD on 29 March 2023, thus paving the way for its timely introduction.

Procedure for the new representative action The core of the government draft is the introduction of a collective action for redress in addition to the model declaratory action (cf.

Schläfke/Lühmann/Stegemann, PHi 2022, 138 ).

According to the government draft, a qualified entity may bring an action for redress if at least 50 persons register similar claims in the register of representative actions.

The established requirements of section 606(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure for the legal standing of qualified entities (350 members and a minimum registration period of four years) will be replaced by less stringent requirements.

It will be sufficient for a qualified entity to have 75 members and a minimum registration period of one year.

This means that qualified entities can be established and used as claimants whenever there is an occasion to do so while limitation periods are still running.

Affected persons have to register in order to participate in the collective action.

Thus, as before, Germany will be using an opt-in model.

Registrations will be possible until two months after the first oral hearing.

Judgments and court settlements before the end of this registration period are not possible (pre-judgment and pre-settlement opt-in).

Small businesses (i.e. those employing fewer than 50 people and with an annual turnover or an annual balance sheet of less than EUR 10 million) can also register their claims.

Since the government draft does not contain a limitation on original claims, according to the wording of the draft there is considerable potential for circumvention and abuse because, for example, litigation-funded claim vehicles may register multiple claims previously assigned to them.

The material scope of the representative action goes beyond the RAD as it covers any civil claim and not only claims based on an infringement of provisions of Union law referred to in Annex I of the RAD.

Representative actions could therefore become relevant in a variety of areas, such as claims for breaches of the law on data privacy, product liability cases, cartel damages, capital investment cases or the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act.

The procedure following an action for redress will be divided into the following stages: Estimation of damages and determination of a collective total amount The qualified entity bringing a collective action for redress has to provide sufficient facts in order to establish the amount of damages claimed to the court’s satisfaction.

Based on those facts, the court is authorised to estimate damages pursuant to section 287 of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

In the final redress judgment, the court will determine a collective total amount.

When doing so, the court may in certain circumstances assume that all claims are justified.

Whether the registered parties are entitled to demand compensation on the basis of the final redress judgment will only be examined in the implementation proceedings.

Any excess sums awarded will be refunded.

Litigation funding possible Litigation funding will generally be possible.

There are certain admissibility requirements to avoid conflicts of interest between consumers and litigation funders.

Since qualified entities often have limited financial resources, litigation funding can give them significantly more room for manoeuvre."
Noerr,Update: New type of class action in Germany – Federal government agrees on draft bill,"Since qualified entities often have limited financial resources, litigation funding can give them significantly more room for manoeuvre.

However, the question is what motivation litigation funders would have to fund a representative action for redress, since generally the entire amount claimed must be paid to consumers and because a profit-sharing agreement with the individual (often unknown) consumers cannot usually be entered into.

Litigation funding of actions for skimming off profits possible It is planned to allow litigation funding in case of actions for skimming off profits under section 10 of the Act against Unfair Competition (UWG).

One condition is that the competent public authority approves the funding (in particular the success fee) in advance.

Until now, such litigation funding was not possible.

In addition, actions for skimming off profits will no longer require an intentional infringement, but only gross negligence.

These amendments are likely to increase the number of such actions in the future.

Noerr,European Patents: Which Cases Can be Brought Before the Unified Patent Court (UPC)?,"The UPC Agreement will enter into force soon.

We are in the midst of the Sunrise Period.

Opt-outs are already possible to prevent European Patents (EPs) from falling under the jurisdiction of the UPC (cf.

our article dated 21 March 2023 ).

Yet, what happens if an EP owner does not opt out of the UPC's jurisdiction?

The following article considers several legal scenarios in this situation.

I.

In Principle: Exclusive Jurisdiction of the UPC The UPC does not only have exclusive jurisdiction over complaints relating to European Patents with unitary effect (Unitary Patents) which will be granted as of 1 June 2023.

The UPC also has exclusive jurisdiction for actions relating to EPs , provided that the individual EP is granted for a UPC member state, no opt-out has been declared and the respective complaint is filed as of 01 June 2023.

II.

Cases Pending Before Member States’ Courts Are Not Affected The UPC Agreement does not affect the jurisdiction of the national courts for infringement and validity cases which are already pending before 1 June 2023 .

The national courts will decide these cases for the respective UPC member state.

III.

Is a Case Pending in a Member State Court Preempted From Being Brought Before the UPC?

To avoid contradicting decisions, the same subject matter should only be decided either by the UPC or by a member state court.

Thus, an infringement complaint based on an EP that is pending e.g. before a district court in Germany will likely preclude the UPC from ruling on the same question of infringement.

The UPC could carve out issues pending before national courts in order to prevent e.g. diverging infringement decisions on the same infringing act with respect to the same national part of an EP vice versa the same defendant.

In doing so, the UPC would limit its decision on an EP to matters not already pending in a UPC member state.

This would not limit the UPC from deciding on infringement of the EP in the context of a different subject matter.

In particular, the UPC could decide on infringement of the same EP to the extent that a different act of infringement, infringement in other UPC member states or infringement against another defendant is alleged.

If a case is pending before a member state court and the plaintiff wants to obtain a comprehensive UPC decision on its subject matter, the respective national laws generally allow for the plaintiff to withdraw the pending case (cf. e.g. Section 269 German Civil Procedure Code ).

Upon withdrawal from the national court, the UPC can decide the subject matter of the complaint with effect for all UPC member states.

IV. Which Principles Apply in Nullity Cases?

As long as there is no opt-out on an EP, nullity complaints with effect for all member states can be brought against this EP before the UPC as of 1 June 2023.

A risk of conflicting decisions arises if a plaintiff brings a nullity complaint against an EP before the UPC in addition to a nullity complaint against the same EP that is already pending before a member state court.

In such cases, the UPC will likely avoid the risk of conflicting decisions by performing a carve-out .

Under the carve-out, the UPC would decide the nullity complaint only with respect to those parts of the EP that are not already subject of a nullity action that is pending before a member state court.

Other plaintiffs’ nullity complaints against this EP are a different subject matter.

The UPC would therefore likely still decide them in full, meaning with effect to all UPC member states.

In this case, nullity complaints from other plaintiffs’ that are pending before national courts against the same EP should not preempt a comprehensive UPC decision."
Noerr,Disclosure Regulation – Ongoing updates of the regulatory technical standards,"I.Introduction Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, known as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“ SFDR ” or “ Disclosure Regulation ”) lays down sustainability-related disclosure obligations towards end investors for companies in the financial services sector.

On 14 August 2022, the regulatory technical standards (“ RTS ”) accompanying the SFDR entered into force.

The RTS define the requirements of the SFDR in greater detail.

Applicable since 1 January 2023, the RTS are continually being updated, and their implementation poses daunting challenges, including to insurers and brokers.

The most recent amendments, found in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/363, are directly applicable with no transition period for implementation.

However, it is important that the requirements regarding comprehensive transparency do not impair the clarity of the disclosure.

Otherwise, suspicions of “greenwashing” can arise.

II.

Regulatory technical standards The SFDR has been in effect since 10 March 2021 and has been amended once again by I Taxonomy Regulation, i.e. (EU) Regulation 2020/852.

In particular, the European Supervisory Authorities (“ ESAs ”) were mandated to develop RTS.

The Commission issued RTS in the form of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288.

1. Drafting and updating The RTS are wide-ranging and complex, which becomes obvious if only due to the amount of time needed to draw them up.

The original plan was that the ESAs submit the draft RTS to the Commission by 30 December 2020.

The RTS entered into force in August 2022 and have now been applicable since 1 January 2023.

The Disclosure Regulation stipulates that the ESAs update the RTS on an ongoing basis to reflect legal and technical developments.

Accordingly, the RTS are constantly being reviewed and updated.

The last update was brought about by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/363, which entered into force on 20 February 2023 and governs changes regarding the annexes to the RTS.

2. Objectives The main objective of the SFDR is to control investors’ investment behaviour.

More transparency regarding environmental characteristics is intended to enable end investors to make informed investment decisions.

For this purpose, the disclosure obligations towards end investors on the integration of sustainability risks, on the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts and sustainable investment objectives and on the promotion of environmental or social characteristics in investment decision-making and in advisory processes are to be harmonised, thus improving the comparability of financial products.

Disclosure obligations to be complied with in pre-contractual documents and periodic reports are intended to reduce asymmetries in information regarding the abovementioned factors.

The recitals of the RTS reveal that another express objective is to address concerns regarding “greenwashing”, which is generally understood as an attempt by organisations to present a “green” or “sustainable” image, particularly via communications and marketing, without actually systematically taking the corresponding sustainability-oriented action in their business operations ( https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/greenwashing-sustainable-finance#greenwashing-im-kontext-von-sustainable-finance).

Greenwashing can, for example, also be seen in the “green” purpose of a financing instrument.

The comprehensive specification of disclosure obligations in the RTS is intended to combat this.

3. SFDR categories

The SFDR provides for various transparency levels for financial products that establish the degree of disclosure required in pre-contractual information.

First, Article 6 of the SFDR deals with transparency for financial products that integrate sustainability risks or at least present the reasons why the financial market participants deem the sustainability risks not to be relevant."
Noerr,Disclosure Regulation – Ongoing updates of the regulatory technical standards,"More extensive disclosure obligations apply to financial products that promote environmental or social characteristics (Article 8 SFDR) and financial products that have sustainable investment as their objective and for which an index has been designated as a reference benchmark (Article 9 SFDR).

4.Obligors

Pursuant to Article 42 of Directive (EU) 2011/61, the disclosure obligations apply to all financial market participants and financial advisors in the EU as well as asset managers and advisors outside the EU that sell their products to customers in the EU.

This includes insurers that provide insurance investment products and/or advice regarding them.

Insurance brokers that provide advice on insurance investment products are likewise subject to the disclosure obligations unless they have fewer than three employees.

5.

Essential content The RTS specify the content, methodology and presentation of pre-contractual information, information on the website and information in periodic reports that promotes environmental or social characteristics of sustainable investments.

The information is to be provided free of charge and in a manner that is easily accessible, non-discriminatory, prominent, simple, concise, comprehensible, fair, clear and not misleading.

The RTS provide indicators of the principal adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors.

The indicators must be easily understood.

To further strengthen the comparability of the information to be disclosed, the information on principal adverse impacts should relate to reference periods that run from 1 January until 31 December of the preceding year.

The annexes to the RTS include standard templates for the principal adverse sustainability impacts statement, pre-contractual disclosure for financial products and periodic disclosure for financial products.

The requirements placed on the content of the standard templates are explained in the RTS.

Despite the scope of the RTS, many questions remain unanswered.

On its website, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht – “BaFin”) has stated that it intends to bring the financial companies’ questions regarding the RTS to the Joint Committee of the ESAs.

The ESAs’ interpretation aids will be published in Q&A form.

The ESAs published an extensive Q&A regarding the RTS on 17 November 2022 (https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Fachartikel/2022/fa_bj_2212_Offenlegungsverordnung.html).

6.

Challenges in practice The Disclosure Regulation, including the RTS, poses special challenges for financial market participants and financial advisors.

In practice, the complexity of the disclosure obligations often leads especially smaller insurance brokers to avoid further disclosure obligations by declaring that they do not take adverse sustainability impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors into account in their investment or insurance advice.

Difficulties in implementation also result from insufficient access to data (https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Fachartikel/2022/fa_bj_2212_Offenlegungsverordnung.html).

Financial market participants and financial advisors depend on companies in the real economy to receive such data.

Up to now, only large capital market-oriented companies with more than 500 employees have been legally obliged to provide extensive transparency on sustainability issues and to collect the relevant data.

Smaller companies often do not even have such data regarding their own operations because they are not legally required to collect it.

BaFin emphasises that, from the perspective of financial market participants and financial advisors, the most important factor will be to master the art of walking the tightrope between comprehensive transparency and a clear and simple presentation of the relevant information."
Noerr,Disclosure Regulation – Ongoing updates of the regulatory technical standards,"If the disclosure is not sufficiently clear or is too concise, suspicions of “greenwashing” can arise.

Finally, the changes to the RTS made by the new Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/363 do not provide for a transition period for implementation.

In its Q&A, BaFin has stated that it expects financial market participants to make all reasonable efforts to fulfil the new requirements immediately.

BaFin will take into account the new Regulation in its administrative practice as of 1 September 2023.

This means primarily examining compliance with the requirements placed on pre-contractual information in Articles 8 and 9 SFDR."
Noerr,Germany tightens provisions on fines for infringements of EU type approval law,"On 15 March 2023, the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport adopted the Regulation on prosecution of infringements of EU type approval law ( Verordnung über die Ahndung von Zuwiderhandlungen gegen EU-Typgenehmigungsvorschriften ) (the “Regulation”).

The Regulation now makes it possible to impose significantly higher penalties for infringements of EU type approval law by motor vehicle manufacturers, dealers, etc.

The previous legal situation was comparably milder.

Although practically all EU regulations and directives make it obligatory for Member States to lay down effective and dissuasive rules on penalties (see for example Article 84 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 and Article 72 of Regulation (EU) 167/2013), Germany complied only to a limited extent.

Up to now, only a few infringements have even resulted in fines, and the fines did not exceed €2,000 or €5,000 (section 37 of the German regulation on the EC motor vehicle type acceptance regulation ( EG-Fahrzeuggenehmigungsverordnung ) in conjunction with sections 23(2) and 24 of the previous version of the German Road Traffic Act).

In 2021, the legislator then laid the legal foundation for more severe penalties with a new version of section 24 of the Road Traffic Act, but the implementation was delegated to the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, which initially remained inactive.

Now, the Ministry has activated the new, significantly expanded rules on fines.

The new Regulation provides for wide-ranging penalty options and makes fines of up to €5,000,000 possible in conjunction with section 24(3) and (4) of the Road Traffic Act in conjunction with section 30(2), third sentence of the German Act on Administrative Offences, with the range of applicable fines varying according to the infringement.

For example, the Regulation now provides for the highest range of fines (see in particular section 5(4) of the Regulation) for the use of illegal defeat devices, which has been particularly important in the last several years.

It goes without saying that the new rules do not apply to infringements committed before the new Regulation entered into force due to the principle of legality (Article 103(2) of the German constitution (Basic Law) and Article 49(1) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights).

In the light of this new regulation on fines, it is all the more important, especially for motor vehicle manufacturers, to be even more careful to comply with the requirements of EU type approval law."
Noerr,New transitional periods for legacy devices under the EU Medical Devices Regulation,"Now that the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) has been in effect for almost two years, major problems have transpired in the recent past for manufacturers and other economic operators who have not adapted their medical devices portfolio to the provisions yet.

The previously applicable transitional period for “legacy devices” which can still be placed on the market and put into service in accordance with the requirements under the rules previously in place (Directive 90/385/EEC relating to active implantable medical devices and Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices) were intended to expire in May 2024.

However, the notified bodies are struggling to process the applications for re-certification in time, meaning that there is a risk of acute shortages of supplies.

As a remedial measure, Regulation (EU) 2023/607 , which amends the MDR with regard to the transitional periods applicable to legacy devices and other aspects, took effect on 20 March 2023.

This article provides an overview of the new regime, which is far from simple.

I. Background and lawmakers’ intention The consolidated MDR version which has applied since 24 April 2020 provided for a transitional period for legacy devices until 26 May 2024.

Until that date, it was to be possible to lawfully place on the market and put into service certain medical devices that still comply with the former Directives.

This applied, for one, to medical devices that were classified as class 1 products under the former Directives but are in a higher risk class under the MDR, and thus require the involvement of a notified body in the conformity assessment procedure.

It also applied to medical devices of classes IIa and higher for which notified bodies issued certificates during certain periods prior to 26 May 2021.

This transitional period was intended to absorb capacity shortages at notified bodies since the switch to the MDR involves a compulsory re-assessment of all medical devices for the medical device to remain marketable.

In addition, notified bodies had to be newly designated and notified under the MDR to be able to perform their responsibilities.

Despite the increase in the number of notified bodies over time, it became evident that the total capacity would be insufficient to complete re-certification of the large number of medical devices before 26 May 2024.

To avoid acute supply shortages that could result from this, EU lawmakers have presented Regulation (EU) 2023/607, which has now entered into force and amends the MDR.

The Regulation is intended to provide relief in this tense situation.

II.

New transitional periods: the most important changes It should be noted, to begin with, that not all legacy devices can benefit from extended transitional periods as a result of the MDR amendment.

Instead, the following now applies: 1.

Medical devices in classes I (sterile condition), I (measuring function) and IIa or higher with expiring certificates Certificates issued by notified bodies after 25 May 2017 (original effective date of the MDR) in accordance with the previous rules that were still valid on 26 May 2021 (date of application of the MDR) and that have not been withdrawn afterwards will remain valid after the end of the period indicated on the certificate until 31 December 2027 for all class III devices, and for class IIb implantable devices except sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips and connectors; or 31 December 2028 for class IIb devices other than those mentioned above, for class IIa devices, and for class I devices placed on the market in sterile condition or having a measuring function."
Noerr,New transitional periods for legacy devices under the EU Medical Devices Regulation,"If the above certificates expired prior to 20 March 2023, the certificates can now remain valid until the dates stated above (31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028) if the following conditions are met: before the date of expiry of the certificate, the manufacturer and a notified body have signed a written agreement in accordance with Section 4.3, second subparagraph, of Annex VI to the MDR for the conformity assessment in respect of the device covered by the expired certificate, or in respect of a device intended to substitute that device; or a competent authority of a Member State has granted a derogation from the applicable conformity assessment procedure in accordance with Article 59(1) of the MDR or has required the manufacturer, in accordance with Article 97(1) of the MDR, to carry out the applicable conformity assessment procedure.

2. Higher class medical devices under the MDR originally falling under class I Medical devices which according to the old provisions fell in class I and are in a higher class under the MDR may now be placed on the market and put into service on 31 December 2028.

3. Joint requirements regarding extended transitional periods For both product categories described above, the following additional conditions have to be met: The devices continue to comply with the old provisions (Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC, as applicable); there are no significant changes in the design and intended purpose; the devices do not present an unacceptable risk to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons, or to other aspects of the protection of public health; the manufacturer has put in place a quality management system in accordance with Article 10(9)

no later than 26 May 2024; and the manufacturer or the authorised representative has lodged a formal application with a notified body in accordance with Section 4.3, first subparagraph of Annex VII for conformity assessment in respect of the device or in respect of a device intended to substitute that device no later than 26 May 2024, and the notified body and the manufacturer have signed a written agreement in accordance with Section 4.3, second subparagraph, of Annex VII to the MDR no later than 26 September 2024.

In addition, MDR requirements relating to post-market surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and of devices continue to apply for legacy devices in place of the corresponding requirements under the old provisions.

4.

Class III custom-made implantable devices Class III custom-made implantable devices may be placed on the market or put into service until 26 May 2026 without a certificate issued by a notified body in accordance with the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 52(8), second subparagraph, provided that the manufacturer or the authorised representative has lodged a formal application with a notified body in accordance with Section 4.3, first subparagraph, of Annex VII to the MDR for conformity assessment no later than 26 May 2024, and the notified body and the manufacturer have signed a written agreement in accordance with Section 4.3, second subparagraph, of Annex VII to the MDR no later than 26 September 2024.

5. Periods for selling current stocks no longer apply Another important change is that the periods for selling current stocks will no longer apply.

The new MDR will not include the previously applicable periods expiring on 26 May 2025 for legacy devices already placed on the market anymore.

Legacy devices already placed on the market can therefore be sold for an indefinite period now, provided they are still safe and satisfy the applicable requirements.

III.

Conclusion The amendment certainly provides short-term relief in the process of adapting to the MDR, which has become an acute situation for many companies by now."
Noerr,New transitional periods for legacy devices under the EU Medical Devices Regulation,"III.

Conclusion The amendment certainly provides short-term relief in the process of adapting to the MDR, which has become an acute situation for many companies by now.

However, on a closer look it just means a short breathing space for both the economic operators concerned and the notified bodies since it does not provide a remedy for the bottleneck caused by limited capacities at the notified bodies.

EU lawmakers are therefore already planning additional measures such as special solutions for certain product categories, as various sources indicate.

As a result, some flexibility is urgently required to avoid supply shortages in the EU, or to prevent them from getting even worse, and to ensure that the EU remains attractive for manufacturers of medical devices.

By the way: The MDR also falls within the scope of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 on representative actions.

It provides for representative actions against infringements by traders against EU law and provisions transposing it into national law that harm or may harm the collective interests of consumers.

Noerr,European data protection authorities launch coordinated review of the position and tasks of data protection officers,"The European data protection authorities recently launched a coordinated review of the position and tasks of data protection officers, which is being coordinated by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) .

The German data protection authorities are also taking part in the joint Europe-wide review.

The data protection authorities are particularly interested in using the review to gauge whether data protection officers have the position required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the resources needed to carry out their tasks.

Data protection officers will first be sent questionnaires for this purpose.

The answers will be used to identify whether additional formal investigations by the authorities are warranted.

The European data protection authorities intend to jointly decide on possible further national supervision and enforcement actions .

Violations of the legal requirements set out in the GDPR may lead to significant regulatory fines .

We recommend that companies carefully review the position and tasks of their data protection officer, especially in light of the announced review by the authorities, and that any organisational improvements necessary be initiated quickly.

The role that the GDPR provides for data protection officers is one of the central pillars of robust data protection governance in a company.

A data protection officer not only has the task of advising on data protection issues, but above all also has an independent control function .

In practice, the challenge lies in designing structures and organisational processes for data protection in a company to, on the one hand, ensure that data protection officers are involved in an effective and at the same time efficient manner, but, on the other hand, to also avoiding potential conflicts of interest on the part of data protection officers.

It is therefore obvious that, in their review, the supervisory authorities will also pay particular attention to any interference experienced by data protection officers in performing their tasks independently and effectively."
Noerr,The Unified Patent Court Goes Live,"The Unified Patent Court (UPC) will take up its work on June 1, 2023.

It represents an absolute novelty: For the first time, one court will uniformly decide for all contracting member states on infringement and validity of European patents (""EP"").

This means that as early as June 1, 2023, lawsuits to the UPC to enforce or, alternatively, destroy an EP in almost the entire European Union will be possible.

I. One Patent Court to Rule Them All In addition to Germany, the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court will also enter into force in 16 other contracting member states: France, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Sweden and Slovenia.

Other states such as Hungary, Spain or Poland could follow.

Decisions of the UPC on an EP have equal effect in all contracting member states.

An injunction obtained before a German chamber of the UPC is thus also valid in France, the Netherlands, Italy, etc.

Conversely, the UPC can also nullify an EP uniformly in all contracting member states.

II.

""Sunrise Period"" is Already Underway: “Opt-Out” now possible The UPC starts with a three-month ""Sunrise Period"" (March 1, 2023 to May 31, 2023).

For owners of EPs the beginning of the Sunrise Period brings important decisions.

They now have the possibility to exclude the exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC for lawsuits in connection with EPs via a so-called "" opt-out "".

If an opt-out is requested for an EP, infringement and validity of the EP will have to be assessed in each member state separately.

For this, the respective national courts have jurisdiction.

In Germany, these are the patent litigation chambers of the district courts (for infringement) and the Federal Patent Court (for validity).

Without an opt-out , the UPC has exclusive jurisdiction for lawsuits regarding infringement and validity of an EP from June 1, 2023 onwards.

III.

EP Owners Need to Act Quickly Owners of EPs must now ask themselves whether they want to opt out of the UPC's jurisdiction.

In principle, an opt-out will remain possible at least until April 30, 2030.

However, if an EP is made subject to a lawsuit before the UPC, the opt-out-option will be lost irreversibly for this EP."
Noerr,Overview of German banking regulation 2023,"The financial sector in Germany and in the EU has undergone significant changes in recent months and years and the regulatory environment continues to evolve.

Increased digitalisation in the financial sector has found its reflection in several recent and upcoming regulations concerning matters such as cryptoassets, securities dematerialisation, anti-money laundering and cyber resilience.

At the same time, ESG and sustainable finance are key trends in the current regulatory and supervisory framework.

Dr Jens H. Kunz and Klaudyna Lichnowska from our practice group Financial Services Regulation worked together with Global Legal Insights (GLI) and contributed the German law chapter to the multijurisdictional compendium “Banking Regulation 2023”.

The contribution outlines the financial regulatory architecture in Germany, including banking governance, internal controls and bank capital requirements.

It also addresses key regulatory developments in the financial sector, including on digitalisation, crypto assets, blockchain, artificial intelligence, cyber resilience and ESG/sustainable finance.

Noerr,Commission launches consultation on “fair share” initiative,"Should online service providers have to pay for the traffic generated by their users?

To answer this question, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on 23 February 2023, which addresses key issues for the telecommunications sector and the digital economy.

Known as “fair share”, the consultation is held to decide whether the European Commission should force large online providers to compensate internet service providers for the use of their network.

The “fair share” initiative explained The proposal follows a long-standing demand from network operators that companies benefitting from the use of digital infrastructure should help pay for it.

According to a study commissioned by the European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association (“ETNO”), the services of the six major online providers (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Netflix) together account for more than half of the world’s total data traffic.

Telecom operators are therefore calling for content providers that generate large volumes of traffic to be obliged to contribute to investments in network infrastructure.

In their view, this is the only way to afford the investment needed to develop modern networks, the costs of which the European Commission estimates at around € 174 billion by 2030.

The “fair share” initiative is part of a comprehensive package of measures aimed at developing telecommunications infrastructure that has been put forward by EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton.

Along with the initiative, he also presented the Gigabit Infrastructure Act, a piece of legislation intended to cut red tape and speed up network expansion.

In addition, the European Commission recently revised the guidelines on State aid for broadband networks.

The “fair share” initiative now focuses on private sector contributions to the financing of the network infrastructure.

“Fair share” as a key source of contention The initiative is politically divisive and is also controversial within the European institutions and Member States.

Network operators point to the huge shortfall in investments and the increase in data traffic generated by the use of online services.

According to press reports, however, several member states have warned against hasty decisions in a non-paper dated 19 July 2022.

Besides Germany, the document was signed by the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland and Sweden.

They argue that any changes might affect the relationship between telecom operators, digital platforms, and users.

Open questions and possible answers The consultation aims to provide answers to outstanding questions – in particular, which online service providers should pay the compensation and how such compensation could be collected.

One option would be to make all online service providers pay, or only service providers from specific sectors, or – as the European Commission has suggested –require only large traffic generators to pay.

Large traffic generators could be determined by a threshold value that is based on the percentage of data traffic generated during peak hours.

The Commission may also rely on familiar concepts from Union law, such as “gatekeeper” under the Digital Markets Act or “very large online platforms” under the Digital Services Act .

For the collection and distribution of contributions, the European Commission is considering two options: On the one hand, payment could take the form of a digital levy that is paid into a national or European fund to co-finance certain investments.

On the other hand, online service providers could be required to make direct payments to network operators, with the payments being negotiated and managed between the parties.

In the latter case, according to the European Commission, it would be necessary to ensure that small network operators are not discriminated against and that the payments are explicitly used for investment."
Noerr,Commission launches consultation on “fair share” initiative,"For example, they could be linked to certain economic or environmental requirements.

The consultation will remain open to comments from stakeholders until 19 May 2023.

The results will be decisive for the further action to be taken by the European Commission.

EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton plans to finalise the initiative by the end of his term in office in July 2024."
Noerr,The EU foreign subsidies regulation from the trade perspective,"Introduction The EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (hereafter “ FSR ”) entered into force on 12 th January 2023 and its provisions will generally apply from 12 th July 2023 (please see our News Alerts concerning the completion of the legislative procedure and the draft Implementing Regulation here and here and for the public procurement aspects here ).

Trade Instruments do not Adequately Address Foreign Subsidies

The focus of this News Alert is the interaction between existing trade instruments and the FSR.

Prior to adoption of the FSR, the EU had at its disposal the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (hereafter “ SCM Agreement ”), trade defence instruments (i.e., anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations) and specific provisions in Free Trade Agreements (“ FTAs ”) to tackle distortions caused by third countries’ trade actions.

The Commission does not, however, consider that the available trade instruments adequately address foreign subsidies.

For example: The EU trade defence instruments, notably the EU’s anti-subsidy rules, only apply to the import of subsidised goods into the Union but not when foreign subsidies take the form of services, investments or other financial flows in relation to the establishment and operation of undertakings in the EU.

The scope of the SCM Agreement is also limited to trade in goods.

As regards FTAs, there are significant differences on the provisions on subsidies; the majority of the agreements in place simply provide for consultations in case of distortive subsidies, and only some of them foresee specific provisions prohibiting subsidies that are particularly detrimental.

Although the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to modernising WTO rules on industrial subsidies to enhance the proper functioning of the SCM Agreement, and although the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (hereafter “ GATS ”) contains a mandate to establish rules for subsidies relating to trade in services, this process has not yet been initiated by WTO Members.

The Commission therefore also justifies the need for the FSR with the “regulatory” gap left by available trade instruments.

The FSR will thus act as a complementary tool to the established EU trade rules to improve the multilateral legal framework addressing distortive subsidies.

Closer Look at Trade Aspects of the FSR The FSR, to a certain extent, details the envisaged relationship between trade instruments and the FSR.

The FSR, for example, provides for the compliance of the implementation of the FSR with Union law, the WTO Agreement and other commitments made under other EU and Member State trade and investment agreements .

This idea is underlined in Art. 44 para. 

9 FSR, which determines that the FSR does not prevent the Union from exercising its rights or fulfilling its obligations under international (trade) agreements.

In particular, no action can be taken under the FSR which would amount to a specific action against a subsidy as defined in the SCM Agreement and granted by a third country which is a member of the WTO.

The FSR thus provides for precedence of the provisions of the SCM Agreement.

Nonetheless, the word “specific” must be highlighted, as the SCM Agreement is only applicable to specific subsidies , i.e., subsidies specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries.

The manner in which the Commission aims to resolve uncertainty in cases of conflict between the FSR and the SCM Agreement, particularly if the presence of a specific subsidy is uncertain, remains to be seen.

The draft Implementing Regulation on practical and procedural aspects of the FSR published by the Commission on 6 February 2023 and under consultation until 6 March (please see our News Alert on the Implementing Regulation for more information) fails to further examine the relationship between the application of the FSR and available trade instruments."
Noerr,The EU foreign subsidies regulation from the trade perspective,"In particular, there is no mention of possible derogations as regards comprehensive FTAs with substantive provisions on distortive subsidies.

Lastly, not explicitly mentioned in the FSR but inherent to the interconnection between the FSR and trade rules, is the fact that the Commission, as the competent authority to enforce the FSR, will look to make use of the experience gained in EU trade remedy investigations, for example when investigating sources available to examine the subsidy.

What Companies Need to Do Next Companies should now focus on internally identifying the financial contributions they have received from non-EU countries and setting up internal reporting processes.

The Commission’s power to start a review on its own initiative ( ex officio ) should be taken into consideration by those companies operating in higher-risk / specific sectors or that have received financial contributions from certain non-EU countries.

Companies that fail to comply with notification obligations will be liable for a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover."
Noerr,Expiry of the statutory transitional regime for discrepancy reports to the transparency register,"All obligated parties under the Money Laundering Act [ Geldwäschegesetz – GwG ], namely financial and credit institutions, financial services companies, insurance companies, payment institutions, real estate agents, but also non-privileged dealers in goods, art brokers and art warehouse keepers are obliged to verify the information provided by their respective business partners on beneficial owners and to obtain an extract from the transparency register for this purpose (Section 12 (3) GwG).

If there are discrepancies between the information on beneficial owners entered in the transparency register and the information available at the obligated parties, obligated parties must immediately report this to the transparency register pursuant to Section 23a (1) sentence 1 GwG.

In the course of the conversion of the transparency register from a supplementary register to a full register, the legal duty to submit a discrepancy report pursuant to Section 59 (10) GwG was suspended until 1 April 2023 if a report to the transparency register was dispensable under the legal situation applicable until 31 July 2021.

According to the so-called reporting fiction in Section 20 (2) GwG, the obligation to report to the transparency register was deemed to be fulfilled if the information on the beneficial owner could already be obtained from the electronically retrievable commercial, partnership, cooperative, association or company register.

Insofar as the reporting fiction did not apply, discrepancy reports had to be submitted up to now.

Such statutory transitional period ends on 01.04.2023.

Starting on 02.04.2023, discrepancy reports must now be submitted in all cases.

According to the FAQs of the Federal Office of Administration [ Bundesverwaltungsamt] (in German language only), a discrepancy is deemed to exist if, among other things, discrepancies are found in the first or last name, date of birth, place of residence, but also in the type of beneficial ownership (e.g. participation in the company or exercise of a function on a governing body).

A discrepancy is also said to exist if the company, contrary to its legal transparency obligation, has not declared the beneficial owner to the transparency register.

Depending on the legal form, transitional periods – which expired on 31 December 2022 at the latest – applied for this.

No discrepancy report is required if not all nationalities of the beneficial owner are entered in the transparency register or there are discrepancies in titles and nobility predicates (Federal Office of Administration FAQs E6 and E7).

The discrepancy report must be submitted immediately, i.e. without undue delay, after the discrepancies have been identified, via the reporting portal on the homepage of the transparency register.

A violation of this obligation may constitute an administrative offence pursuant to Section 56 (1) No. 65 GwG and is subject to a fine.

Obligated parties under the Money Laundering Act must therefore now ensure that they promptly report any new discrepancies that become known to the transparency register, starting on 2 April 2023."
Noerr,EU adopts tenth sanctions package against Russia,"On 25 February 2023, the European Union published the tenth package of sanctions against Russia for its attack on Ukraine in the Official Journal of the European Union .

The new sanctions package represents a considerable expansion and supplementation of the existing measures in the two main sanctions regulations: Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 (amending act available here ) as a general sanctions regulation with in particular sectoral trade measures (A.) and Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 (amending acts available here and here ) on list-based, personal financial sanctions (B.).

In addition to the expansions, both regulations focus on measures to enforce the sanctions.

In particular, information obligations for private individuals were introduced and a considerable number of sanctions were imposed on third-country nationals.

The latter concerns Iranian individuals and entities that supply the Russian military with unmanned aerial vehicles (so called Shahed drones) (C.).

Finally, measures have been taken to protect European critical infrastructure, especially in the gas sector (D.).

A. Trade measures in Regulation (EU) No 833/2014

The tenth sanctions package expands the list of goods subject to an export ban because they could contribute to the military and technological enhancement or development of Russia’s defence and security sector.

This essentially includes some rare earths, electronic integrated circuits and thermal imaging cameras (Article 2a in conjunction with Annex VII, as amended, of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014).

The export ban on goods from the aerospace industry has been extended to include turbo-jet engines and related components (Article 3c and Annex XI, as amended, of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014).

The addition to the export ban on goods that enhance Russia’s industrial capacity, Article 3k and Annex XXIII, as amended, of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 is particularly comprehensive.

Annex XXIII has been given a new Part C, which covers a very broad range of goods from the mechanical and chemical industries.

These include, among others: various flat-rolled products in iron or steel variants; structures, structural parts and containers made of iron, steel or aluminium ; certain producer gas and water gas generators; steam turbines and their parts ; diesel or semi-diesel compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines and their components ; components for water turbines; various liquid pumps; vacuum pumps; miscellaneous laboratory equipment; certain centrifuges and their components; engine-driven winches; certain cranes and forklift trucks; industrial robots; various excavators and construction vehicles; foundry tools and machinery; metal and mineral working tools; ball bearings ; shafts, cranks and couplings; semiconductor manufacturing machinery and equipment ; electric internal combustion engine starters and various electrical components; certain trucks; fibre optic cables; binoculars and telescopes ; compasses and certain other navigational tools ; material processing machinery; instruments for chemical and physical processes.

Article 3i and Annex XXI, as amended, of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 also introduce import bans for goods that generate considerable income for Russia.

These are mainly bituminous substances and related petroleum products from Chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature (“CN”) as well as carbons (heading 2803 CN) and synthetic rubbers (heading 4002 CN).

Finally, the list of military end-users for which exceptional dual-use exports may not be authorised was extended by 96 organisations (Article 2(7) and Annex IV, as amended, of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014).

B. List-based financial sanctions in Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014

The tenth sanctions package added 87 individuals and 34 entities to the list of persons, entities and bodies subject to an asset freeze and prohibition to provide funds or economic resources in Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014."
Noerr,EU adopts tenth sanctions package against Russia,"No 269/2014.

Essentially, these are leaders and senior officials in the occupied territories of Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia and high-ranking members of the Russian government.

Also listed are disinformation agents and those responsible for the abduction of Ukrainian children, as well as high-tech companies whose activities contribute to the war.

From the financial sector, three more banks were listed: Alfa-Bank, Rosbank and Tinkoff Bank.

As in the previous sanctions packages, the expansion of restrictive measures is also accompanied by the possibility of derogations for a transitional period (subject to approval).

In addition, some exceptions have also been added for certain transactions to be possible, such as with the Jewish Claims Conference or the National Settlement Depository (NSD), amendments in Article 6b of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014.

Additional financial sanctions were imposed on nine natural persons and seven legal entities associated with activities of the Wagner Group in Mali, Libya and the Central African Republic.

The relevant listings can be found in the Regulation on restrictive measures in view of the situation in Mali ( Regulation (EU) 2017/1770 ) and the Regulation on restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses ( Regulation (EU) 2020/1998 ).

C. Enforcement measures Measures that can be grouped under the heading of sanction enforcement have been added to both main sanction regulations.

According to the new Article 3d(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, non-scheduled flights between the EU and Russia must now be declared.

The export ban on dual-use goods from Article 2 and on firearms from Article 2aa of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 was supplemented by a ban on the transit of these goods through Russia, Art. 2 (1a), 2aa (1a) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended.

A special reporting obligation was also newly introduced: natural and legal persons, entities and bodies, including, in particular, companies in the financial and insurance sectors must disclose to the competent national authorities information on the (indirect) assets of the Central Bank of Russia which they hold or control no later than two weeks after 26 February 2023, Article 5a(4a) to (4e) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, as amended.

The financial sanctions of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 are also supplemented by a significant expansion of the obligations of private individuals to inform public authorities where the private individuals become aware of sanction breaches, Article 8(1a) to (1c) of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014, as amended.

The obligation to disclose includes information on the frozen funds and economic resources, such as the type and amount, but also such information to identify those who own, hold or control those funds and resources.

This particular provision will apply from 26 April 2023 on.

In addition, both regulations penalise Iranian natural and legal persons for their involvement in the supply of so called Shahed drones to Russia.

Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 established a presumption of onward transfer to the Russian military for deliveries to listed Iranian entities pursuant to Article 2(7) and Annex IV Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, as amended.

Four Iranian individuals working for Paravar Pars Company and Qods Aviation Industry, which are involved in the drone programme, are now listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 and thus subject to the financial sanctions of that regulation.

This extends the listing of Iranian entities, which first began on 30 January 2023 with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/192.

The listing of a shipping company in Dubai for its role in the transport of Russian oil under Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 has a similar aim of preventing circumventions.

D. Other measures In addition, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, in particular, include measures beyond the traditional instruments of sanctions law."
Noerr,EU adopts tenth sanctions package against Russia,"D. Other measures In addition, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, in particular, include measures beyond the traditional instruments of sanctions law.

The list of partner countries whose representations and companies in Russia are exempt from sanctions and with which information is shared has been expanded to include Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Norway; see Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, as amended.

The broadcasting bans and the suspension of broadcasting licences according to Article 2f and Annex VI of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 now also affect RT Arabic and Sputnik Arabic .

The new Article 5o of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, as amended, prohibits Russian nationals or Russian residents from holding positions on the governing bodies of critical infrastructure undertakings within the EU; this does not apply to nationals of a Member State of the EU or the EEA or Switzerland.

Another new Article 5p of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, as amended, means that gas storage capacity may not be provided to Russian nationals, natural or legal persons residing in Russia, or entities and bodies established in Russia – except for the part of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities used for storage .

Member states may authorise derogations to ensure critical energy supplies.

E. Evaluation

The new sanctions package again significantly expands the number of companies and economic sectors subject to sanctions.

For European companies, careful consideration of the goods-related embargo measures is very important in order to avoid sanctions breaches.

With regard to sanctions enforcement measures, the extensions of the private sector’s obligations to inform are of high relevance.

Here, too, European companies must be vigilant in order to avoid compliance breaches.

The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action also wants to focus more on private-sector players and has announced that it will advocate for mandatory disclosure of sanction breaches, which will be subject to penalties.

The EU expands the global reach of its sanctions measures with the new listing of Iranian natural and legal persons.

The sanctioning of third-country nationals has echoes of the so-called secondary sanctions in US sanctions law.

The EU is thus taking another step in this direction after including the option of listing persons who facilitate infringements of the ban on circumventing sanctions (eighth sanctions package, as Noerr reported ).

Whether such arrangements will be extended remains to be seen."
Noerr,Romania: Tax amnesty law regarding the reclassification of gift vouchers as salary,"Law 43/2023 on the introduction of a tax amnesty for tax liabilities, including interest and penalties for late payment, calculated by the tax authorities following the reclassification of income from gift vouchers obtained by individuals from persons other than employers, from the category of income from other sources to the category of salary income, was published in the Official Gazette no. 163 on 24 February 2023.

The tax amnesty applies to all tax liabilities relating to the period 26 May 2006 to 31 December 2020 calculated by the tax authorities following the reclassification.

The tax amnesty targets both assessed and unpaid tax liabilities as well as tax debts already paid by companies.

In the latter case, companies will be able to apply for a refund based on a procedure which will be approved by a subsequent Order to be published by the tax authorities within 30 days.

Also, for the aforementioned period, the tax authorities are not allowed to perform any reclassification in this matter in their future tax audits."
Noerr,Final steps in the adoption of the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism,"On 9 February 2023, the responsible Committee of the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, voted in favour of two proposals of the Fit for 55 package : the proposal to review the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter “ETS”) and the proposal on the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter “CBAM”).

The Fit for 55 package aims to address climate change by reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality in 2050.

Please see our previous News Alerts on the provisional agreement on the CBAM and its implications for companies here and on the agreement on the revision of the EU ETS here .

Key Features of the CBAM The CBAM aims to create incentives for non-EU producers to reduce emissions, by targeting imports of products in carbon-intensive industries listed in Annex I.

It acts as a preventive measure to ensure that the EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts are not offset by relocating carbon-intensive production to other non-EU countries where efforts are not as stringent.

The CBAM is designed to complement the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter “EU ETS”) and is intended to serve as an alternative means of reducing the risk of carbon leakage by allocating free ETS allowances to energy-intensive industries.

Free allocation of allowances under the ETS will be gradually phased out as the CBAM is phased in.

The phase in process will begin in 2026 and end in 2034.

Until the ETS phase out is completed, the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions that are not covered by free allowances under the ETS.

This will be achieved by obliging relevant parties to purchase CBAM certificates to pay the difference between the carbon price paid in the production country and the price of carbon allowances in the EU ETS.

As regards the scope, the CBAM will apply to imports from sectors at greater risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity generation, hydrogen, certain precursors as well as some downstream products such as screws and bolts and similar articles of iron or steel; with the exceptions of imports from third countries participating in the ETS or a similar mechanism.

Indirect emissions will only be covered under certain conditions.

An extension of the scope will be considered after the transition period until 31 st December 2025.

The CBAM will be introduced from 1 st October 2023.

In order to enable an adjustment to the new mechanism, the obligations imposed during the transition period until 31 st December 2025 shall be limited to reporting.

In particular, importing companies will have to file quarterly CBAM reports, no later than one month after the end of each quarter.

These reports shall include the total quantity of each type of goods, the actual total embedded emissions, the total indirect emissions and the carbon price due in a country of origin for the embedded emissions in the imported goods.

The CBAM will become fully operational from 2026 onwards, subjecting companies to the financial impact of the carbon levy.

It is important to note that goods can only be imported into the customs territory of the EU by an authorised CBAM declarant; therefore, any importer established in a Member State shall apply for the status of authorised CBAM declarant.

By 31 st May of each year, the authorised CBAM declarant shall submit through the so-called CBAM registry, a number of CBAM certificates that corresponds to the embedded emissions declared.

It is Member States’ responsibility to sell CBAM certificates to authorised CBAM declarants established in their respective country at the price calculated in accordance with the CBAM.

Failure to submit the CBAM certificates by the authorised CBAM declarant implies the payment of a penalty.

The Commission is responsible for monitoring the functioning of the CBAM."
Noerr,Final steps in the adoption of the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism,"Failure to submit the CBAM certificates by the authorised CBAM declarant implies the payment of a penalty.

The Commission is responsible for monitoring the functioning of the CBAM.

Before 1 January 2028, as well as every two years thereafter, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on its application.

Additionally, the Commission shall assess the effectiveness of the CBAM in addressing the carbon leakage risk for goods produced in the Union for export to third countries.

Next Steps The proposals are expected to be placed on the agenda of the April plenary session (17-20) of the European Parliament for the final vote.

Should the European Parliament adopt the proposals as set out in the compromise texts agreed in December 2022, the Council would then approve them in the same wording.

The CBAM will come into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal, which is expected for May 2023.

The CBAM will impose a new regulatory framework upon companies active in the relevant sectors.

Now is the time for companies to prepare for the transition phase of reporting obligations from 1 st October 2023."

Noerr,Frankfurt Higher Regional Court rules on admissibility of setting margins and bonuses unilaterally,"In a judgment on 14 February 2023, Frankfurt Higher Regional Court (case 11 U 9/22) confirmed in full that the manufacturer has the right to set margins and bonuses “outside” of the dealer contract.

In the case at hand, the defendant had expressly clarified in its authorised dealer contract that discounts and margin components were not part of the contract.

Instead, the defendant unilaterally set the margins (i.e. discounts on the recommended retail price) and any bonuses in a circular in the last quarter of a calendar year for each subsequent year.

The dealership association had taken legal action against this.

The court of first instance, Frankfurt Regional Court, ruled that the right of the manufacturer to unilaterally set margins and bonuses in a circular valid for one year constituted an unreasonable impediment to the authorised dealer within the meaning of section 19(2)(1) and section 20(1) of the German Competition Act.

In the Regional Court’s opinion, the manufacturer should be required to agree fixed margins in the dealer contract, otherwise the authorised dealers would lack the necessary certainty for planning purposes.

The defendant was not allowed to unilaterally determine bonuses, since the dealers could assume, based on the specific structure of the dealer contract and the accompanying correspondence when entering into the dealer contracts, that bonuses were a contractually agreed component of the fee and that the conditions were not in place under the law on T&C for a unilateral reservation of the right to change or a unilateral right to determine performance.

The use of clauses that are invalid under the law on T&C would constitute an unfair impediment within the meaning of antitrust law.

The decision of the Regional Court met with incomprehension from many observers, as it disregarded the relevant case law of the higher courts in many aspects and called into question the previous practice of numerous manufacturers and importers.

The court of appeal, Frankfurt Higher Regional Court, has now overturned the judgment handed down by Frankfurt Regional Court of 16 December 2021, completely reversing it.

In doing so, the Higher Regional Court made some important clarifications and specifications and did not permit a further appeal against its decision.

I. Unilateral setting of margins The Higher Regional Court confirmed that in principle, margins can also be set unilaterally by the manufacturer.

The basic margins therefore do not have to be agreed per se in the dealer contract.

The Higher Regional Court justified this by stating, among other things, that according to relevant higher court case law, the agreement of an ex works price system was permissible under antitrust law (see Frankfurt Higher Regional Court, ZVertriebsR 2017, 244 para.

42 et seq; Munich HRC, OLGR 2004, 197; Cologne HRC, BeckRS 2010, 143557).

If such an ex works price system, i.e. a system in which a manufacturer sells its products to the dealer on the basis of the current price lists it has unilaterally determined, is permissible, a provision in the dealer contract stating that the basic margins are determined once a year by the manufacturer cannot be contrary to antitrust law, the court said.

The authorised dealers were also protected insofar as the manufacturer was subject to increased contractual duties of consideration and loyalty when exercising its right to unilaterally set the margins each year, the court said.

In addition, the manufacturer usually had no interest either in making it more difficult for its authorised dealers to sell to end customers because of excessive purchase prices, since it itself at least indirectly participated in the sales risk of the authorised dealers.

In this respect, the interests of the manufacturer and the authorised dealer were the same, concluded the court."
Noerr,Frankfurt Higher Regional Court rules on admissibility of setting margins and bonuses unilaterally,"In this respect, the interests of the manufacturer and the authorised dealer were the same, concluded the court.

Although the use of a clause that is not permissible under the law on T&C may also constitute an impediment in breach of antitrust law, the specific provision in the case at hand is not objectionable under T&C law.

In the present case, the parties had not agreed on any right to determine performance subject to the strict requirements of the law on T&C in the first place:

In terms of sales prices (meaning dealer purchase prices), there was no right to determine performance because the sales price was determined at the time the individual purchase contract was entered into and was not determined subsequently by the manufacturer.

The court also said there was no right to determine performance with regard to the remuneration for the activities owed under the dealer agreement, because the basic margin was only a calculation factor in the assessment of the dealer purchase price and no specific fee was fixed nor was one intended to be fixed.

Moreover, the actual fees, i.e. the dealer’s profit, depends on many factors that the manufacturer cannot influence.

II.

Unilateral setting of bonuses With regard to the right to set bonuses unilaterally, the court followed the Daihatsu decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (NJW 1994, 1060).

First of all it clarified that, contrary to the conclusions reached by the Regional Court, the bonuses offered were voluntary additional benefits from the manufacturer and not remuneration for a service owed under the dealer contract.

None of the services earning the bonuses in dispute were owed under the dealer contract.

In addition, there was nothing in the dealer contract to indicate that the defendant had agreed to pay bonuses.

Since it was a voluntary benefit from the manufacturer, the manufacturer could have refrained from promising bonuses altogether.

In any event, in line with the Daihatsu decision, the manufacturer was permitted to unilaterally determine the content and scope of the promise.

Accordingly, setting bonuses in circulars valid for one year at a time was not an unreasonable hindrance, the court concluded.

III.

What are the practical implications of the ruling?

As a result, everything remains the same and yet the ruling will bring some calm back into the agitated debate on setting margins and especially bonuses.

This debate had gained momentum with the Büchl ruling by the Austrian Supreme Court as the antitrust higher court (decision of 22 March 2021, GZ 16 Ok 4/20d) and was also fuelled in Germany by the first-instance ruling of Frankfurt Regional Court.

As a result, numerous dealers and dealer associations tried to use antitrust law as a lever to challenge the remuneration and bonus systems by their principals.

The Higher Regional Court has now put a damper on this by consistently applying the existing case law of the higher courts and supreme courts."
Noerr,New type of class action in Germany – Update,"Federal Ministry of Justice publishes ministerial draft and starts public consultation procedure On 27 January 2023, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Germany and 23 other Member States because the Representative Actions Directive (RAD) was not transposed into national law by the due date of 25 December 2022.

Germany now plans to transpose the RAD until the application deadline on 25 June 2023 the latest.

On 16 February 2023, the Federal Ministry of Justice (BMJ) published its ministerial draft of the RAD which has already been in the interdepartmental consultation procedure since mid-September 2022.

Some key points of the ministerial draft continue to be fiercely discussed within and outside the Federal Government.

In order to accelerate the implementation process, a public consultation procedure is conducted in parallel to the interdepartmental consultation.

The deadline for submitting comments in the public consultation procedure is 3 March 2023.

Procedure for the new representative action The core of the ministerial draft is the introduction of a collective action for redress next to the model declaratory action (cf. already our news article of 18 September 2022 and Schläfke/Lühmann/Stegemann , PHi 2022, 138).

According to the ministerial draft, a qualified association may bring an action for redress if at least 50 persons register similar claims in the register of representative actions.

Registration is possible until the day before the first oral hearing.

Germany will thus keep the opt-in model already used for the existing model declaratory action.

What is new is that smaller companies (those employing fewer than 50 people and with annual turnover or an annual balance sheet below €10 million) can also register their claims.

Since the ministerial draft does not contain a limitation to original claims, there is a considerable potential for circumvention and abuse inter alia because litigation-funded claim vehicles may register multiple claims previously assigned to them.

The material scope of the representative action goes beyond the RAD as it covers any civil claim and not only claims based on an infringement of provisions of Union law referred to in Annex I of the RAD.

Representative actions could therefore become relevant in a variety of areas, such as claims for breaches under the law on data privacy, product liability cases, cartel damages, capital investment cases or the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act.

The procedure following an action for redress will be divided into the following stages: Estimation of damages and determination of a collective total amount The qualified entity bringing a collective action for redress has to provide sufficient facts in order to establish to the satisfaction of the court the amount of damages claimed.

Based on those facts, the court is authorised to estimate damages pursuant to Section 287 of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

In the final redress judgment, the court will determine a collective total amount.

When doing so the court can under certain circumstances assume that all claims are justified.

Whether the registered consumers are entitled to demand compensation on the basis of the final redress judgment will only be examined in the implementation proceedings.

Any excess awarded has to be refunded.

Litigation funding possible Litigation funding will generally be possible.

There are certain admissibility requirements to avoid conflicts of interest between consumers and the litigation funder.

Since qualified entities often have limited financial resources, litigation funding can give them significantly more room for manoeuvre.

However, the question is what motivation litigation funders would have to fund a representative action, since generally the entire amount claimed must be paid to consumers and practically a profit-sharing-agreement with the individual (often unknown) consumers cannot be concluded."
Noerr,New type of class action in Germany – Update,"Litigation funding of disgorgement proceedings possible It is planned to allow litigation funding in case of actions for skimming off profits under section 10 of the Law against Unfair Competition (UWG).

One condition is that the competent public authority approves the financing (in particular the success fee) in advance.

Until now, such litigation funding was not possible.

In addition, actions for skimming off profits will not require an intentional infringement any longer but only gross negligence.

These amendments are likely to increase the number of actions for skimming off profits in the future.

Open issues While the general model of the collective action for redress is agreed upon, , there are several important aspects which are still under discussion within the Federal Government.

The aspects include in particular: Timing of the opt-in : Contrary to the ministerial draft, the Green-led Federal Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection (BMUV) as well as consumer associations are in favour of consumers being able to register until after a judgment has been issued (post judgment opt-in).

However, it is questionable whether such a late opt-in is possible for reasons of the rule of law.

Suspension of limitation period in the case of a collective action for redress : The ministerial draft correctly provides that the limitation period is suspended only for claims by registered consumers.

The BMUV and consumer associations, however, favour a suspension independent of a prior opt-in.

In this case, collective actions for redress would suspend the limitation period of claims of all affected consumers for the duration of the proceedings.

Such an effect is already necessary for actions for injunctive measure where consumers do not have to participate.

It is not clear why this should also apply to actions for redress if consumers have the possibility to suspend the limitation of their claims by registering for the action.

Requirements for legal standing of qualified entities : While the ministerial draft retains the requirements of section 606 (1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure for legal standing, the BMUV and consumer associations advocate for less strict requirements.

According to press reports, the BMJ is now prepared to meet these demands.

For example, the threshold of 350 members relevant for legal standing is to be lowered to only 75 members and the minimum registration period for qualified entities is to be reduced from four to one year.

Burden of proof : It is also being discussed whether there is the need to amend provisions regarding the burden of proof in such a way that it is easier for the qualified entity to provide evidence when a fact to be proved by the is known only to the defendant company.

Additional introduction of a group action : Finally, although not required by the RAD, the BMUV and consumer associations advocate for the introduction of a group action procedure.

In such a collective procedure, the affected consumers can initiate the procedure themselves; legal standing for collective actions would then no longer be limited to qualified entities.

A corresponding bill by the Green party failed in 2017.

Noerr,Competition Outlook 2023,"In this Competition Outlook, Noerr’s Antitrust & Competition practice group provides you with a summary of the most important developments in European and German competition and antitrust law in 2022, focusing on the most prominent issues, and gives an overview of the developments we can expect in these areas in 2023.

Topics relating to digitalisation once again played a special role in antitrust and competition issues in Germany and Europe throughout 2022.

In Germany, the Federal Cartel Office is continuing to apply section 19a of the German Act against Restraints of Competition (“Competition Act”), introduced as part of the 10th amendment to the Competition Act, and this will also have a crucial impact in 2023.

At a European level, last year saw the adoption of the new Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), which gives the European Commission extensive powers to monitor corporations classified as “gatekeepers”.

The new year will reveal which areas the DMA will be applied to first and how it interacts with section 19a of the Competition Act.

In addition, competition and antitrust law in 2022 was influenced to a great extent by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and its repercussions.

The Federal Cartel Office issued decisions on crisis-induced co-operations necessitated by possible gas shortages.

Rising electricity, gas and fuel prices were also one of the motivations for the German legislator to prepare further changes to national competition law.

The latest draft of the 11th amendment to the Competition Act sets out far-reaching powers of the Federal Cartel Office to intervene in oligopolistic markets that extend beyond the known merger and abuse of dominance controls.

It will certainly be interesting to see how these intended powers take shape during the legislative process in 2023.

Last year, European State aid law was also forced to react to fallout from the war in Ukraine and the resulting negative effects on the economies of the Member States.

The Temporary Crisis Framework, a regulatory instrument created for this purpose, is initially scheduled to apply until 31 December 2023.

Alongside this, the new EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation will come into effect starting in July 2023, establishing yet another regulatory hurdle that companies will have to overcome during transactions on top of the standard merger and foreign direct investment controls.

By contrast, the tidal wave of effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which has also left its mark on antitrust and competition law over the last few years, seems to be ebbing away.

One key consequence in 2022 was that the competition authorities resumed carrying out dawn raids at companies to investigate antitrust infringements.

We can expect this trend to continue in the new year.

These are just a few of the many topics dealt with in our Competition Outlook, which also include the latest developments in the areas of antitrust law governing sales and distribution matters, cartel damages and foreign direct investment controls.

Noerr,EU Commission publishes draft of the Implementing Regulation of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"As we reported on 9 February 2023, the European Commission (“ EC ”) has published its draft Implementing Regulation (“ Draft IR ”) on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“ FSR ”).

The Draft IR seeks to clarify practical and procedural aspects of the application of the FSR and contains essential guidelines for the notification of public procurement procedures.

In particular, undertakings need to notify during public procurement procedures foreign subsidies above certain thresholds (see our previous news alert ).

In the event of non-compliance, companies will be subject to fines and periodic penalty payments.

In addition, companies are now subject to a reporting obligation under which they must provide the EC with all facts relevant to the decision on the public procurement procedure.

Main provisions regarding procurement procedures Notification Article 5 of the Draft IR stipulates that foreign financial contributions in public procurement procedures must be submitted to the contracting authority or contracting entity in charge of the relevant public procurement procedure in a certain manner on a single form, whose form is prescribed in the Annex 2 to the Draft IR.

Moreover, there is provision for a possible exemption for companies from the obligation to provide certain information and documents for the notification.

The requirement for this is, in addition to a written request to the EC, the agreement of the contracting authority or contracting entity in charge of the procurement procedure as well as the EC’s finding that compliance with these obligations or requirements is not necessary for the examination of the case.

Effective date of notifications and declarations As stated in Article 7 of the Draft IR, in open public procurement procedures, notifications and declarations will become effective on the date on which they are received by the EC, after having been completed.

In addition, the notifying person or company has an updating obligation.

After submitting a notification or declaration, the person or company must notify the EC without delay of any relevant new information, which they would have had to notify if they had known or ought to have known that information at the time of the submission.

Information from the contracting authorities and contracting entities

Furthermore, Article 11 of the Draft IR clarifies Article 13(5) of the FSR by specifying that the obligation of Member States referred to in the Article to provide the EC, upon its request, with all information necessary to conduct inspections under Regulation 2022/2560 extends in particular to contracting authorities and contracting entities responsible for the procurement procedures concerned, their staff and any external experts who have information relevant to the investigation.

What happens next?

The Draft IR is subject to consultation and open for feedback until 6 March 2023.

The adoption of the regulation is planned for the second quarter of 2023.

Based on stakeholders’ input, the EC will then adopt a final version of the IR in the second quarter of 2023.

We encourage all companies active in public contracts to engage in the consultation and to contribute their views on the Draft IR."
Noerr,No end to the stalemate: Whistleblower Protection Act fails to pass in the Bundesrat,"The Bundesrat (Upper House of the German legislature) today refused to give its consent to the draft bill of a German protection law submitted by the coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats (known as the “traffic-light coalition”).

It seems that the struggle for a German Whistleblower Protection Act will now shift to parliament’s cross-party mediation committee!

It is now official: we will not have a German Whistleblower Protection Act by mid-2023 either.

The transposition into German law of the European Whistleblower Directive (2019/1937/EU, the “Directive” ) failed ‒ not all that surprisingly ‒ today in the Bundesrat.

This leaves companies and whistleblowers for the time being in an unclear legal position.

Once again it is not a good day for Germany as a member state of the EU ‒ quite rightly, the EU Commission is now conducting infringement proceedings against Germany for its failure to implement the Directive.

Following the Federal Government’s renewed attempt to enact a law protecting whistleblowers in its ministerial draft bill in April 2022 ( cf.

our article “The Whistleblower Protection Act reloaded” ), it published its governmental draft in July 2022.

On 16 December 2022, with the votes of members of the traffic-light coalition, the German Bundestag finally voted in favour of the Whistleblower Protection Bill (records of the Bundestag 20/3442 and records of the Bundestag 20/4909, the “Whistleblower Protection Bill”) , which was debated in today’s session of the Bundesrat.

The adoption of the implementing law is relevant for companies because, in addition to a high level of protection for whistleblowers, it will also provide for the mandatory establishment of internal reporting channels in accordance with the provisions of the Directive (cf. also our series of articles on the Directive ).

The traffic-light coalition’s Whistleblower Protection Bill sets forth, among others, the following provisions, which in part go even beyond the minimum requirements of the Directive: Companies with 50 or more employees are as a rule required to establish and operate internal reporting channels , section 12 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill.

Internal reporting channels must be available for reporting the following matters:

Infringements punishable by law , section 2(1), no. 1 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill Infringements punishable by a fine if the breached provision serves to protect life, limb or health or to protect the rights of employees or their representative bodies, section 2(1), no. 2 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill Infringements of national or European legal acts in specifically listed areas of law (e.g. in public procurement or environmental law, section 2(1), nos.

3-9 and (2) of the Whistleblower Protection Bill Statements by civil servants that constitute a violation of the duty to be loyal to the constitution, section 2(1), no. 10 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill Internal reporting channels must be available in particular to employees and temporary workers ; companies may decide whether the reporting channels should also be available to third parties who are in contact with the company, section 16(1) of the Whistleblower Protection Bill Outsourcing the internal reporting channel to third parties is permissible (e.g. to affiliated group companies such as the parent company) because “according to the separate legal personality principle that applies to companies […], an independent and confidential unit can also be [established] as a “third party” at another group company (e.g. parent company, affiliated company or subsidiary]” (see p. 79 of the explanatory notes to the Whistleblower Protection Bill)

As from 1 January 2025, companies will have a duty to establish anonymous reporting , section 16(1), sentences 4-6 and section 42(2) of the Whistleblower Protection Bill Protection for whistleblowers against retaliation (such as dismissal)"
Noerr,No end to the stalemate: Whistleblower Protection Act fails to pass in the Bundesrat,"Whistleblowers are protected even where they make a false report due to “simple” negligence, section 33(1) of the Whistleblower Protection Bill The motive of the whistleblower is irrelevant (p. 92 of the explanatory notes to the Whistleblower Protection Bill)

Whistleblowers may choose whether to make a report internally or externally, section 7(1) and section 33(1), no. 1 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill

The draft bill reverses the burden of proof in favour of the employee so that it is for the employer to prove that the whistleblowing report did not cause the discrimination alleged by the employee, section 36(2) of the Whistleblower Protection Bill.

Penalties Section 40(2), no. 2 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill imposes penalties of up to € 20,000 for failure to set up internal reporting channels For retaliation against a whistelblower, companies may be fined up to €1 million , section 40(2), no. 3 and section 20(6) of the Whistleblower Protection Bill in conjunction with section 30(2), sentence 3 of the Administrative Offences Act The federal states that are governed by the Union parties CDU/CSU rejected the Whistleblower Protection Bill during today’s session of the Bundesrat.

Their main points of criticism were, in addition to the additional bureaucratic burden for companies that the establishment of internal reporting channels would cause, the extension of the Whistleblower Protection Bill’s material scope of application beyond that which is required by European law as well as the obligation to establish anonymous reporting procedures, which the Bundestag had included in the draft bill at the last minute.

During the previous legislative period, there had already been heated debate about the extension of the German Whistleblower Protection Bill’s material scope of application.

Ultimately, this is actually why the legislative process failed.

In the meantime, the CDU/CSU is the only one of the German political parties to reject implementation of the Directive in a manner exceeding its requirements.

However, due to the party-political balance of power in the Bundesrat, agreement on this is essential.

As was to be expected, this question therefore remains the “dealbreaker” as far as the adoption of a German law to protect whistleblowers is concerned.

The main victims of this political stalemate over the implementation of the Directive in Germany are ultimately the companies and the whistleblowers, who will have to deal with an unclear legal situation in the coming months.

Irrespective of this, all companies that the Whistleblower Protection Bill subjects to an obligation to establish a whistleblower system should consider doing so now at the latest.

Sooner or later, such an obligation will be introduced!"
Noerr,European Commission publishes draft Implementing Regulation on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"On 6 February 2023, the European Commission ( EC ) published its draft Implementing Regulation (“ Draft IR” ) on the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“ FSR” ).

The FSR is the legal basis for the EC to control the grant of subsidies by countries outside the EU (see here ).

The Draft IR seeks to clarify practical and procedural aspects of the application of the FSR and provides important guidance on the notifications of M&A transactions .

What does the Draft IR cover?

To recap, the FSR requires companies to notify transactions if certain thresholds regarding turnover and third-country financial contributions are met (see here ).

The Draft IR further explains procedural elements such as (i) form and timing of notifications, (ii) investigative powers of the EC, (iii) submission of commitments by the parties, (iv) right of parties to participate in investigations, (v) treatment of confidential information, (vi) access to file and (vii) time limits.

The Draft IR has two Annexes (Annex 1 for notifications concerning M&A transactions and Annex 2 for public procurement procedures) with standard forms for information that companies need to provide.

What are the key takeaways for M&A transactions?

Waiver requests can reduce information required Like in merger control notifications, companies are encouraged to contact the EC prior to formal notification ( pre-notification contact ) when questions on the scope of the required information can be discussed.

Importantly, companies can request the EC to dispense with the obligation to provide certain information ( waiver request ) where the information in question is not available or not relevant for the EC’s assessment.

In practice, parties will have to explain why the information is not available or not necessary for the EC to find that a given financial contribution is not a subsidy or that a presumed subsidy would not be able to improve the competitive position of a company and negatively affect competition in the EU.

No identification of “de minimis“ financial contributions The Draft IR sets out a welcome de minimis threshold below which financial contributions will not have to be disclosed in a notification.

Annex 1 contains a standard table listing in detail which information must be provided to the EC for each financial contribution.

The obvious challenge for companies will be to provide the information on all financial contributions received from non-EU countries.

The Draft IR offers some assistance in this regard: A financial contribution only has to be identified if the individual amount of the specific financial contribution equals or exceeds €200,000 and if the total amount of all contributions per third country per year equals or exceeds €4 million .

Overall burdensome information and document production requirements Nevertheless, the Draft IR provides extensive document production duties in relation to strategic, legal, economic or tax-related due diligence documents.

The information on structured bidding processes , for which extensive information is requested, will often not be easily available to companies.

Further, companies will need to explain the “ different business lines” of activities of the parties – a concept so far unknown in formal EU merger control proceedings.

In addition, companies will still need to keep a record of de minimis contributions .

These are not only relevant for reaching the notification thresholds, but in the case of staggered transactions, the €4 million cap might not apply to each subsequent transaction.

Finally, the Draft IR still requires companies to elaborate in detail on financial contributions above the de minimis threshold in a standard table.

For certain categories of financial contributions, information on classification as a subsidy is required in addition, thereby further increasing the burden on internal bookkeeping.

Noerr,Romania: DAC7 reporting for marketplace operators,"Government Ordinance no.

16/2023, published in Official Gazette

no.

86/31.01.2023, introduces important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Procedure Code by transposing the provisions of EU Directive 2021/514, also known as the DAC7 Directive.

One of the most important changes brought by this new piece of legislation is that, since 3 February 2023 , a new reporting obligation applies to companies operating online market-places (“ Operators ”) used by private and corporate merchants (“ Merchants ”) to sell goods or to provide personal services, property rental services or rental services for means of transport.

The required reporting includes extensive information about the Merchants’ identity, activity and related financial dealings and will be submitted annually to the Romanian tax authorities.

As part of a tax due diligence process required under DAC7, Operators will be required to collect extensive information from the (private or corporate) Merchants they work with and to validate said information to the extent possible using means that include all public sources.

The deadline for finalizing the aforementioned tax due diligence report is 31 December of the relevant reporting year.

The first annual DAC7 report is due by 31 January 2024 for activities carried out in 2023.

Operators will need to apply for special registration with the Romanian tax authorities in order to be able to comply with the new reporting obligation.

Operators that fail to comply with the new requirements in Romania may face a fine of up to €20,000, the cancellation of the above-mentioned registration and a prohibition to con-duct business in Romania or anywhere in the European Union."
Noerr,European Commission sheds light on how to deal with new merger referral policy,"The European Commission (“ EC ”) has recently published a Q&A document providing practical information on the implementation of its Guidance Communication (2021) regarding the application of the referral mechanism set out in Article 22 of the European Merger Regulation (“ EUMR ”).

This Q&A provides more clarity on the assessment of candidate cases for referral, interaction with the Commission and its cooperation with National Competition Authorities (“ NCAs ”).

I. Background Under Article 22 of the EUMR, a Member State may refer a transaction to the EC that meets two requirements: it must (i) affect trade between Member States and (ii) threaten to significantly affect competition within the territory of the referring Member State(s).

Originally, the referral mechanism of Article 22 of the EUMR was intended to allow Member States that had no national merger control regime to bring transactions perceived as problematic to the attention of the EC.

Over time, Article 22 EUMR lost its relevance, as all Member States except Luxembourg adopted a merger control regime.

Then the EC discouraged requests for referral of transactions that had not triggered the referring Member States’ competence to review transactions under their own merger control regimes.

In March 2021, however, the EC reversed this policy and laid out its new approach in its Guidance Communication (2021).

The EC now actively encourages NCAs to refer certain transactions that have not exceeded the Member States’ jurisdictional thresholds.

The background of this policy change lies in the (perceived) enforcement gap when it comes to certain mergers, particularly in the digital and pharmaceutical areas.

Where takeovers of highly innovative companies do not trigger national filing thresholds (because the companies are too small), the elimination of their competitive potential is not scrutinized at all.

In addition, the new law governing large digital platforms (DMA – Digital Markets Act) requires gatekeepers to inform the EC about relevant transactions.

Such information can then be used by the EC to encourage Member States to refer the transactions to the EC for merger control assessment.

While the German Federal Cartel Office and some other NCAs have expressed concerns about the new mechanism and refrained from referring cases where jurisdictional thresholds of national merger control regulations are not met, the General Court has not objected to the EC’s new policy (but the Illumina/GRAIL case is currently pending at the European Court of Justice).

In the meantime, the EC has accepted Article 22 referral requests in at least four cases ( Illumina/GRAIL , Meta/Kustomer , Viasat/Inmarsat and Cochlear/Oticon Medical ).

II.

The new Q&A document The 2021 policy has led to some uncertainty regarding deal planning, as it deviates from the established reliance on more clear-cut jurisdictional thresholds, which facilitated an accurate assessment as to whether or not a deal is notifiable.

In its new Q&A document, the EC now sheds more light on the practical implementation of its new policy.

1.

How to assess the risk of an Article 22 referral Generally, Article 22 referrals are not limited to any specific economic sector.

However, the EC is focusing on the digital and health (pharma, biotech and medical devices) sectors.

All examples from the Q&A document have in common that the target’s turnover does not adequately reflect its actual or future competitive potential, as may be indicated by a comparatively high transaction value for a target with low or no turnover.

The EC is also interested in reviewing and preventing “killer acquisitions”.

These are transactions among competitors in which the target is either growing quickly or on the verge of a breakthrough, potentially threatening the incumbent’s business model."
Noerr,European Commission sheds light on how to deal with new merger referral policy,"These are transactions among competitors in which the target is either growing quickly or on the verge of a breakthrough, potentially threatening the incumbent’s business model.

Vertical mergers where the target has the potential for very valuable input into the incumbent’s business model have also caught the EC’s attention.

The EC will consider refusing a referral request where the transaction has already been notified in Member States that did not request or join another referral request.

2. How to seek guidance from the EC as a merging party The merging parties may contact NCAs directly, but the EC has voiced a preference for the parties’ contacting the EC by submitting a “case team allocation request” (a standard document form which seeks general information on the parties, the products, the degree of competition between the merging parties, etc.).

This is because the EC considers itself a better-placed authority to give guidance.

The EC would then require substantiated information about the deal in an informal briefing paper.

The information includes a concise description of the parties and the transaction, but also a more detailed assessment of the relevant markets and the competitive situation (an indicative list is provided on p. 6 of the Q&A ).

“Early indications” given by the EC that an intended transaction does not constitute a good candidate for a referral are non-binding, and there is no legal timeframe for the assessment.

However, the EC will endeavour to carry out a first review within five working days from receipt.

It is worth noting that Member States must request a referral within, at most, 15 working days from the date on which the concentration was “made known” (i.e. the active transmission of sufficient information to enable a preliminary assessment) to them.

Until a referral request is made, the merging parties are not obliged to refrain from the implementation of their transaction.

However, this does not mean intervention at a later stage would be off the table.

3. How to report a suitable case to the EC as a third party Third parties may inform the EC of suitable candidates for referral by informally contacting the Head of Unit of the merger unit in charge of the relevant industry.

The EC is not obliged to act, but it will acknowledge receipt and, if it considers the criteria for a referral to be met, invite the relevant Member States to request a referral within a reasonable period of time.

4.

How cooperation between the EC and the NCAs takes place Member States have the right – and not the obligation – to request a referral.

The EC can only invite them to make such a request.

We consider it very likely that Member States that have not expressed concerns regarding the referral policy will follow such request.

The Q&A confirms that all information submitted to the EC will be kept confidential.

However, the EC encourages applicants to indicate when submitting a case allocation request whether the transaction in itself is highly market sensitive and expects them to provide a waiver regarding the exchange of information with the NCAs.

III.

Take-aways

The new referral mechanism gives the EC expansive leeway in assessing candidate cases.

This leeway is not fully mitigated by the option of seeking guidance.

The good news, however, is that the case numbers indicate that the EC will apply a cautious approach to Article 22.

The most difficult cases are those where the transactions do not meet any of the EU Member States’ merger thresholds and are thus ready to close.

We understand that until mid-December 2022, the EC had considered for referral 30 such cases in which no national merger thresholds were met, Illumina/GRAIL being the only one that has actually been referred.

Apart from this, there have been only a few referrals (such as the three other cases mentioned above), but in these, at least the national thresholds were met."
Noerr,European Commission sheds light on how to deal with new merger referral policy,"Apart from this, there have been only a few referrals (such as the three other cases mentioned above), but in these, at least the national thresholds were met.

Overall, merger control planning requires a further risk assessment as to where it is appropriate to seek guidance from the EC or at least an NCA to increase legal certainty.

This needs to be considered at an early phase of the transaction planning, as it can have a significant impact on the transaction timetable."
Noerr,Hungary: The concept of Golden Shares and its historical roots in Hungarian law,"Part 1

The entire concept of golden shares can be explained in one sentence: golden shares make the adoption of certain corporate measures as well as decisions on amending certain provisions of the articles of association of a company dependent on the “yes” vote of the holder(s) of the golden shares.

As a result, golden shares give the holder(s) a de facto right of veto over certain corporate decisions.

When analysing the role of golden shares, it is important to understand their historical roots.

In Hungary, golden shares became relevant during privatisation (when state-owned assets were sold to private investors as part of the economic regime change); therefore we will analyse the concept of golden shares from that perspective.

Within the framework of privatisation in Hungary, the applicable law (Act XXXIX of 1995 on the Sale of State-Owned Entrepreneurial Assets; the “Privatisation Act 1995”) imposed certain obligations on companies which were especially significant for the operational capacity of the national economy.

Accordingly, the Privatisation Act 1995 specified the introduction of golden shares in several companies of a strategic nature which had also been approved by the Hungarian parliament.

The rationale for this was that the Hungarian state intended to keep some control over certain privatised companies; in other words, private investors acquired a majority stake, but the Hungarian state still had influence on the decision-making process, as it held a golden share that granted a right of veto.

This was especially important to protect privatised companies of a strategic nature (with regard to the safety of public supplies) from hostile takeovers, since golden shares made the target less attractive.

This was further reinforced by the fact that after the amendment of the Privatisation Act 1995 in 1998 it was no longer possible to eliminate golden shares from the articles of associations of certain strategically important companies.

In addition, the Privatisation Act 1995 stipulated that only the Hungarian state or its affiliated entities were allowed to hold golden shares.

Part 2 On 1 May 2004, Hungary joined the European Union.

As a result of the accession (and the entry into force of the EC law in Hungary), the “European Commission has decided to ask Hungary formally to modify its privatisation framework law (Act XXXIX of 1995 on the Sale of State-Owned Entrepreneurial Assets), which it considers to be incompatible with EC law.

The Commission considers that the law contains unjustified restrictions on the free movement of capital and right of establishment by conferring special rights for the state in 31 privatised companies in the form of voting priority (“golden”) shares.

The Commission's request is in the form of a reasoned opinion, the second stage of the infringement procedures laid down in Article 226 of the EC Treaty.

In the absence of a satisfactory reply from Hungary within two months of receiving the reasoned opinion, the Commission may decide to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice.”

In the absence of a timely reply, the European Commission decided to initiate an infringement procedure against Hungary.

As a response to the infringement procedure, the Hungarian government adopted Act XXVI of 2007 on the Abolition of Golden Shares (the “Golden Share Act”), which came into force on 21 April 2007.

The Golden Share Act states that golden shares will cease to exist and will be deemed ordinary shares following the expiry of the 90-day period after the Golden Share Act comes into force, unless during this period the relevant companies have convened a general meeting and have essentially transformed the golden shares into regular voting preference shares issued under the then effective Hungarian Companies Act (i.e. Act IV of 2006 on the Companies Act).

The aim of the Golden Share Act was to comply with the provisions of EC law and eliminate the proposed state measure."
Noerr,Hungary: The concept of Golden Shares and its historical roots in Hungarian law,"The aim of the Golden Share Act was to comply with the provisions of EC law and eliminate the proposed state measure.

Final part Considering the above arguments and the related historical background, one question remains: whether the continued existence of the golden share can be justified at all.

Every piece of national legislation should be examined on a case-by-case basis.

Nevertheless, I am of the firm opinion that the existence of golden shares can be justified under EU law if the following conditions are met: (i) the golden share is aimed at protecting a specific public interest; (ii) the golden share only affects certain specified decisions of the management (i.e. it is proportionate); and (iii) the role of the golden share cannot be reduced to merely protecting the company from hostile takeovers.

This viewpoint was confirmed by the ECJ in Commission v Belgium [C-503/99 Commission v Belgium [2002]] where the ECJ held that “the free movement of capital, as a fundamental principle of the Treaty, may be restricted only by national rules which are justified by reasons referred to in Article 73d(1) of the Treaty or by overriding requirements of the general interest and which are applicable to all persons and undertakings pursuing an activity in the territory of the host Member State.

Furthermore, in order to be so justified, the national legislation must be suitable for securing the objective which it pursues and must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it, so as to accord with the principle of proportionality”."
Noerr,Public procurement rules in the new EU regulation on foreign subsidies,"On 12 January 2023, the Regulation on Foreign Subsidies Distorting the Internal Market , EU Regulation 2022/2560 (the “FSR”) entered into force.

We discussed the Regulation as well as the preparations undertakings should now be making in our first article on the FSR What’s it all about .

In line with its objective of ensuring a strong, open and competitive internal market in which European and foreign undertakings can compete (fairly) on the merits, the FSR also addresses public procurement procedures in its Chapter 4.

The EU even sees a particular need for action in the area of public procurement: the need to counteract market-distorting foreign subsidies is “especially salient” here because public contracts are financed by taxpayer funds (Recital No. 40).

This is the first time that far-reaching instruments of subsidy control have been introduced into public procurement law.

The EU legal framework has until now only provided for control of whether aid has been received unlawfully from a Member State when examining tenders that appear to be abnormally low (Article 69(4) of the Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU).

From an institutional point of view, the FSR is breaking new ground by adopting the instruments of public procurement law: for the first time, the European Commission has been given direct powers to intervene and take decisions in public procurement procedures conducted in Member States.

Details of the requirements under public procurement law Chapter 4 of the FSR sets out the rules for public procurement procedures.

The rules cover procedures for the award of works, supply and service contracts as well as works and service concessions with the exception of defence and security-related contracts (cf.

Article 28(1) and (3) of the FSR).

According to Article 27 of the FSR, a foreign subsidy that causes or risks causing a distortion in public procurement procedure can generally be assumed to exist where a foreign subsidy enables an economic operator to submit a tender that is unduly advantageous in relation to the works, supplies or services concerned (Article 27 of the FSR).

In order to assess whether there may be a risk of distortion of the internal market due to unduly advantageous offers, the FSR provides for certain thresholds.

If these thresholds are reached, undertakings must, when submitting a tender or a request to participate, notify the contracting authority of all foreign subsidies received during the previous three years.

Even if they are not exceeded, the obligation to declare foreign financial contributions and confirm that they do not meet the thresholds still applies (Article 29(1) of the FSR).

The notification threshold is reached if the estimated value of the procurement procedure concerned is above €250 million, and at the same time, the foreign contribution exceeds €4 million per third country.

Where contracts are divided into different lots, an additional threshold of €125 million applies to the aggregate value of all lots for which the undertaking is applying (Article 28(2) of the FSR).

This obligation also applies to the main subcontractors and suppliers if the economic share of their contribution exceeds 20% of the estimated contract value (Article 28(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 29(5) of the FSR).

If the above thresholds are exceeded, the undertaking must inform the contracting authority by means of a notification or a declaration.

The contracting authority is in turn required to transfer this notification or declaration to the Commission for review without delay (Article 29(2) of the FSR).

Upon receipt of such a notification, the Commission will first check it for completeness and will then carry out a preliminary review for which it essentially has a period of 20 working days after receipt of a complete notification (Article 30(2) of the FSR)."
Noerr,Public procurement rules in the new EU regulation on foreign subsidies,"During the preliminary review, the procurement procedure may continue, but the contract may not be awarded yet (Article 32(1) of the FSR).

Finally, if the Commission considers it necessary to carry out an in-depth investigation, it must normally complete same within 110 working days after it has received the notification (Article 30(5) of the FSR).

While the Commission is conducting its investigation, the contract may not be awarded to an undertaking that has received foreign subsidies (Article 32(2) of the FSR).

In addition, contracting authorities may report to the Commission information on foreign subsidies that distort competition or communicate it to the Commission if they suspect that an undertaking has made a false declaration (Article 29(7) of the FSR).

The Commission may also start an ex officio procedure and initiate an investigation (Article 29(8) of the FSR).

If the Commission finds that an undertaking benefits from a foreign subsidy which distorts the internal market, it has two options (Article 30 of the FSR): Where the undertaking offers sufficient commitments for redressive measures, the Commission may adopt a decision making them binding.

In the absence of sufficient commitments, the Commission may prohibit the award of the contract to the undertaking concerned.

The substantive standards against which the Commission will assess a distortion of the internal market are the same as those used for foreign subsidy control as a whole (Articles 4 to 6 of the FSR).

If an undertaking fails to comply with procurement provisions, the Commission may impose fines and periodic penalty payments on it (Article 33(1) in conjunction with Article 17 of the FSR).

Where an undertaking provides incomplete, incorrect or misleading information in its notification of financial contributions, the Commission may impose a fine on it not exceeding 1% of its aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year.

Any failure to notify a subsidy or any circumvention or attempted circumvention of the notification requirements will also result in a fine not exceeding 10% of aggregate turnover (Article 33(2) and (3) of the FSR).

Preparation of procurement procedures in view of the FSR The FSR applies to procurement procedures initiated on or after 12 July 2023 (Article 53(4) of the FSR).

Since the Regulation will cover subsidies and financial contributions already granted and is planned to take effect from the middle of this year, contracting authorities and undertakings should begin now to deal with the implications for procurement law of the FSR on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market: Contracting authorities should ensure that their procurement procedures are designed correctly and, in particular, that any foreign financial contributions are properly notified to the Commission.

Undertakings that benefit from foreign financial contributions should review their financing and keep in mind the proper notification of contributions in procurement procedures ‒ especially in view of the considerable financial risks associated with incorrect notifications and missing information.

Even undertakings that do not receive any financial contributions from third countries should keep the FSR in mind so that they can report infringements by competitors.

The Commission has announced that it intends to strictly enforce the FSR.

We would be happy to assist you with the necessary checks and preparations for procedures or notifications.

Noerr,Plans to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction,"The majority of international commercial disputes are decided by arbitral tribunals.

There are many reasons for this.

In some cases, however, it may be advisable or, in the absence of an arbitration agreement, mandatory to have the dispute heard by state courts.

In order for German state courts to be able to meet the requirements of international disputes even better, a number of measures are required which are addressed in the key issues paper of the Federal Ministry of Justice from January 2023 (BMJ | Pressemitteilungen | Eckpunkte des Bundesministeriums der Justiz zur Stärkung der Gerichte in Wirtschaftsstreitigkeiten und zur Einführung von Commercial Courts ).

I. Background In recent years, there have already been some efforts to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction by introducing so called Commercial Courts.

These were selective measures taken by the individual federal states (see ⁣Litigating in Germany - Noerr ).

The Commercial Courts set up by the federal states have so far been accepted to varying degrees.

Some have already recorded a three-digit number of proceedings, while others have so far handled no proceedings at all or only a single-digit number.

A major point of criticism to date has been that although oral hearings can be held in English pursuant to Section 185 (2) of the Courts Constitutions Act (“ GVG ”), according to Section 184 GVG, German remains the language of the court.

Therefore submissions and judgments must be written in German.

Three draft bills introduced by the Bundesrat to allow English as an additional language of proceedings in special procedural constellations have so far failed.

This is where the key issues paper of the Federal Ministry of Justice comes in.

II.

Content of the key issues paper The key issues paper proposes five measures to make proceedings before German Commercial Courts more attractive for international commercial disputes: English language The central point of the proposal is the introduction of the possibility to conduct proceedings entirely in English.

That is, if the parties agree and there is a factual reason for doing so, then pleadings and annexes will be filed in English, the hearing will be conducted in English, and the decisions to be rendered by the court will be written in English.

This shall apply to all instances.

In order to support the further development of the law also through the English-language decisions and to enable enforcement (in German-speaking countries), the English-language decisions are to be translated into German.

Possibility of establishing Commercial Courts at the Higher Regional Courts

The system of instances shall remain unchanged in principle (first instance: Regional Court, second instance/appeal: Higher Regional Court, third instance/appeal: Federal Court of Justice).

However, the federal states are to be allowed to set up specialized senates at the Higher Regional Courts (""Commercial Courts""), which would then already have first-instance jurisdiction for certain commercial disputes, in order to enable concentration and specialization.

This would mean that the level of the Regional Courts would be skipped in certain cases.

The jurisdiction of these first-instance Commercial Courts at the Higher Regional Courts is to depend on the amount in dispute.

The key issues paper cites the example of EUR 1 million as the threshold value.

Furthermore, there should be the possibility - as is customary in international arbitration proceedings - for a verbatim record of the hearing.

The Commercial Courts shall be staffed with specialized judges who have very good language skills and access to modern technical equipment (see also point 5. - Online hearings).

Appeal to the Federal Court of Justice Appeals against the decisions of the Commercial Courts of first instance at the Higher Regional Courts are to be possible to the Federal Court of Justice."
Noerr,Plans to strengthen Germany as place of jurisdiction,"Appeal to the Federal Court of Justice Appeals against the decisions of the Commercial Courts of first instance at the Higher Regional Courts are to be possible to the Federal Court of Justice.

This will reduce the number of instances to two in the interests of procedural efficiency.

In contrast to arbitration proceedings, in which there is generally only one instance, it is still possible to have the decision reviewed by appeal to the Federal Court of Justice.

Trade secrets

In contrast to arbitration proceedings, proceedings before state courts are generally public.

For companies, this often has the disadvantage that trade secrets cannot be adequately protected.

The key issues paper also addresses this dilemma.

In future, the protection of trade secrets is to be brought forward to the time at which the action is filed.

Information classified as confidential should not be used or disclosed outside of legal proceedings.

Online hearing It is already possible under Section 128a of the German Code of Civil Procedure (“ ZPO” ) to hold oral proceedings by means of video and audio transmission (i.e. by video conference).

In practice, however, this option is used with varying frequency.

Higher Regional Courts in particular have been rather reluctant to make use of this option.

This is partly due to the inadequate technical equipment of the courts.

The key issues paper provides for the use of video conferencing technology in proceedings before the Commercial Courts to be strengthened.

In doing so, it refers to the draft bill of the Federal Ministry of Justice to promote the use of video conferencing technology (see (Wieder) mehr Video-Verhandlungen an deutschen Gerichten?

- Noerr ).

III.

Outlook

In order not to lose touch with other jurisdictions for international dispute resolution (e.g. Amsterdam/London/Paris/Singapore) or rather to catch up, measures are necessary to increase the attractiveness of Germany as a place of jurisdiction.

The key issues paper lists a number of important points here (English as the language of proceedings, protection of trade secrets).

Not mentioned in the key issues paper, but very desirable, would be the introduction of a mandatory case management conference in proceedings before the Commercial Courts, as is also customary in arbitration proceedings.

Here, for example, the deadlines and dates would be set after consultation with the parties, which would lead to greater procedural efficiency.

Admittedly, such an approach is not ruled out at present either.

However, if it is formally provided for, implementation is assured.

It remains the case that internationally active companies in particular must weigh up which jurisdiction should be sensibly agreed for the settlement of a legal dispute.

Noerr is one of the leading law firms in the field of litigation and arbitration.

The more than 130 lawyers throughout Europe advise and represent clients in all forms of dispute resolution - before state courts, cross-border in several jurisdictions, in arbitration proceedings as well as in alternative dispute resolution proceedings."
Noerr,What does the Foreign Subsidy Regulation mean for M&A transactions?,"Practitioners and EU officials alike seem to be in agreement that the Foreign Subsidy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2022/2560; “ FSR ”), which entered into force on 12 January 2023 (see our News Alert here ), will have a significant effect on M&A deals.

The new notification tool for transactions introduced in Articles 19 to 26 of the FSR has the potential to impose major bureaucratic burdens on deal parties by requiring them, if certain thresholds are exceeded, to notify certain transactions and to submit large amounts of information and data on financial contributions from non-EU countries to the European Commission (the “ Commission ”).

As is the case in merger control proceedings, a merger may not be closed until the Commission has given its approval under the FSR (“standstill obligation”, which also applies to  the granting of EU State aid).

The notification and standstill obligations apply to concentrations in relation to which signing takes place on or after 12 July 2023 .

In which cases does the new notification tool apply?

According to Article 20(3) of the FSR, the notification tool applies to transactions where the following two thresholds are met by the parties to a concentration:

Turnover threshold Financial contribution threshold “at least one of the merging undertakings, the acquired undertaking or the joint venture is established in the Union and generates an aggregate turnover in the Union of at least EUR 500 million ” “the […] undertakings were granted combined aggregate financial contributions of more than EUR 50 million from third countries in the three years preceding the conclusion of the agreement, the announcement of the public bid, or the acquisition of a controlling interest”

The turnover threshold is meant to ensure that the FSR will only apply to large M&A deals.

However, recent discussions and data suggest that the Commission’s initial expectation of 26 to 38 notifiable transactions per year will likely be exceeded (significantly) in practice (an expectation based on historical data in merger control cases; see the Commission’s Impact Assessment of 5 May 2021, pp. 51 et seq.).

In addition, the Commission will be able to request ad-hoc notifications for smaller concentrations if it suspects the existence of distortive foreign subsidies.

We note that the threshold for financial contributions is set at a relatively low level.

First, it applies to financial contributions within three years prior to the signing of the transaction .

Second, the term “financial contribution” (to be differentiated from the term “foreign subsidies” for which additional conditions apply) is defined very broadly in the FSR.

It encompasses not only the transfer of funds and liabilities but also the foregoing of revenue otherwise due and even the provision as well as purchase of goods and services .

Hence, even minor transactions, such as an electricity bill or sale of office supplies to a public entity can technically fall under the definition of a financial contribution.

Therefore, in particular those companies that regularly enter into contracts with non-EU countries (including private entities whose actions can be attributed to such a third country) for the provision or purchase of goods and services may very quickly exceed the threshold of EUR 50 million over three years.

The Commission has the power to prohibit the completion of a subsidised concentration.

If there is a breach of the notification or the standstill obligation , the Commission may impose fines of up to 10% of a company’s annual aggregated turnover .

What does a notification entail?

If the thresholds are met, the concentration as well as the financial contributions received in the three years prior to the transaction will have to be notified by the undertakings concerned (in the case of a merger or the acquisition of joint control, jointly by the parties; in all other cases, by the person or undertaking acquiring control)."
Noerr,What does the Foreign Subsidy Regulation mean for M&A transactions?,"As is the case with the merger control notification (Form CO), the notification will very likely require a significant amount of information and data.

While the precise content of a notification will only be known soon after the Commission’s publication of the Implementing Regulation in the coming weeks, it is clear that, depending on the size of the undertakings concerned and the nature of their business, thousands of data points will have to be reported to the Commission.

It follows that the thorough and careful preparation of such notification will take time.

This should be duly taken into account in the overall transaction process .

How does the notification and clearance regime affect deal timing?

As regards the waiting period following a complete notification, the Commission will have 25 working days to assess whether the notified financial contributions constitute foreign subsidies and whether they risk distorting the internal market ( Phase I ).

If in Phase I the Commission is unable to find that the criteria for foreign subsidies are not met or a distortion can be excluded, it will carry out an in-depth review of potential distortions of the internal market in Phase II that can take a further 90 working days (extendable by 15 working days).

What does the Commission assess?

The Commission will assess whether there is a distortion in the internal market caused directly or indirectly by foreign subsidies.

In this context, the Commission may apply a “ balancing test ”, through which the positive and negative effects of financial contributions from non-EU countries (which also qualify as foreign subsidies) will be weighed.

How can companies prepare for the new notification requirement?

The new notification tool will apply from 12 October 2023, but concerns all transactions signed as of 12 July 2023 .

Companies that are involved in larger M&A deals, and therefore potentially affected by the notification requirement, should prepare themselves accordingly.

Companies should set up and maintain an internal database that enables them to identify and report (on a rolling basis from July 2020 onwards) all financial contributions received from non-EU countries as of July 2018.

Once the notification tool applies, any delay in gathering this data will lead to a delay in the overall transaction.

External counsel will be able to assist in determining which of these financial contributions will eventually be seen as foreign subsidies by referring to, in particular, relevant State aid law precedents and experience.

The potential positive effects of financial contributions to be considered in the balancing test should be assessed prior to notification .

Companies may want to monitor and report to the Commission transactions by their competitors that may have been influenced by foreign subsidies and were not notified to the Commission in advance.

The Commission has recently signalled that it is open to receiving suggestions on possible simplifications concerning the content of notifications in non-problematic cases.

Companies may therefore want to consider areas where simplifications may be both necessary and possible from their perspective.

Lastly, the Implementing Regulation will be particularly helpful for understanding the scope and dimension of notifications and the process overall.

In that regard, the Commission will soon publish a draft Implementing Regulation, which all stakeholders – such as the undertakings likely to be affected by the FSR – can comment on within four weeks.

The final rules are expected to be finalised and adopted by mid-2023."
Noerr,Changes in the owner control regime in Germany,"More clarity on intra-group acquisitions, additional reliefs and adjustments, but more granular requirements for private equity, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and non-EU/EEA vehicles Proposed acquirers of German credit institutions, financial institutions and insurance companies are subject to a revised owner control regime.

New provisions clarify that also intra-group restructurings may be subject to the notification obligation.

Key changes include reliefs for indirect intra-group acquisitions in terms of required deliverables, but introduce new granular requirements for private equity, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and non-EU/EEA vehicles.

The novelization implements Joint Guidelines on the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increases of qualifying holdings in the banking, insurance and securities sectors (JC/GL/2016/01) by the European Supervisory Authorities and it applies since 28 December 2022.

New provisions and reliefs relevant for intra-group acquisitions The revised Owner Control Regulation sheds more clarity on the topic of intra-group acquisitions.

The new provisions clarify that proposed acquirers are obliged to notify BaFin and Bundesbank of the intention to acquire a qualifying holding, i.e. direct or indirect holding of 10% or more of capital, voting rights or another possibility to exercise a significant influence over the management of the regulated target entity ( Qualifying Holding ), even if the acquisition is a result of an intra-group restructuring among entities already holding a Qualifying Holding.

However, intra-group transactions can benefit from significant reliefs, in particular if the documents and information submitted to the German regulators, BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank ( Bundesbank ) are still up-to-date.

The new/revised reliefs include: General relief which exempts all proposed acquirers (i.e. not only intra-group) from filing anew documents and information to BaFin and Bundesbank that were already submitted in past owner control proceedings.

The novelisation extended the default time availability of this relief from one to two years from the past filing, whereby both before and after the novelisation this default time period may be extended by BaFin on a case by case basis (see Sec. 16 (1) sent. 1 of the Owner Control Regulation), New relief exempting proposed acquirers whose holdings change from an indirect Qualifying Holding into a direct Qualifying Holding in the same target entity form submitting again information and documents that have already been submitted to BaFin and Bundesbank in the previous owner control proceedings and have not changed – without any time limit (see new Sec. 16 (1) sent. 3 of the Owner Control Regulation), Relief applicable to all intra-group transactions and thus also to constellations other than in the bullet above (e.g. change of a direct Qualifying Holding into an indirect Qualifying Holding or intra-group restructurings of intermediate holding companies) specifying that only documents and information that concern persons, entities and the group structure which have not been submitted in the past owner control proceedings as well as documents and information that are no longer up-to-date have to be submitted in the new owner control proceedings – without any time limit (see revised Sec. 16 (10) sent. 

3 (previously Sec. 

10 (3)) of the Owner Control Regulation),"
Noerr,Changes in the owner control regime in Germany,"3 (previously Sec. 

10 (3)) of the Owner Control Regulation),

Relief allowing BaFin and Bundesbank to waive, in part or in full, the submission of documents and information if the proposed acquirer shall acquire an indirect Qualifying Holding and is not the ultimate parent undertaking at the top of the group structure (see revised Sec. 16 (10) sent. 1 of the Owner Control Regulation), New relief stating that proposed acquirers of indirect Qualifying Holdings which are not the ultimate parent undertaking of the group do not have to submit a full business plan for the target entity, but only a so-called document on strategy, irrespective of the percentage of the indirect Qualifying Holding to be acquired, i.e. even if control over the target shall be acquired (see Sec. 16 (10) sent. 2 of the Owner Control Regulation), Previous reliefs for acquisitions of Qualifying Holdings in factoring or finance leasing targets (which do not conduct other regulated business subject to a BaFin license) have been revised so that that proposed acquirers which are not ultimate parent companies at the top of the group and shall acquire an indirect Qualifying Holding in the target are exempt from the obligation to submit documents and information if the acquisition is intra-group (see Sec. 16 (12) (previously Sec. 10 (5))of the Owner Control Regulation).

More granular requirements for private equity, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and non-EU/EEA vehicles The revised Owner Control Regulation introduces new requirements for private equity, hedge funds, sovereign funds and non-EU/EEA vehicles (see Sec. 8a of the Owner Control Regulation).

The new requirements for private equity funds and hedge funds include filing of the following additional information: detailed description of the performance of previously acquired Qualifying Holdings in credit institutions, financial institutions, insurance companies and pension funds, details on the investment policy, investment restrictions along with details on the monitoring of investments, factors for the decision to invest in the target regulated entity as well as factors that would lead to a change of the proposed acquirer’s success strategy, decision-making structures, including the names and functions of the persons responsible for the investment decisions, and detailed description of proposed acquirer’s anti-money laundering procedures, including the applicable legal framework.

The new requirements for sovereign wealth funds include filing of the following additional information: detailed information on the name of the ministry or government department responsible for setting the fund's investment policy, details of the investment policy and any investment restrictions, names and functions of the persons responsible for the investment decisions of the fund, and details on the influence of the relevant ministry or government department on the day-to-day operations of the fund and of the target regulated entity

The new requirements for non-EU/EEA entities include filing of the following additional information: a certificate of good standing issued by an official authority of the relevant third country or, if that third country does not provide for certificates of good standing, an equivalent certificate issued by the financial supervisory authority of the third country in respect of the proposed acquirer, if available, a statement issued by the financial supervisory authority of the third country that there are no obstacles or limitations to the provision of information necessary for the supervision of the target regulated entity, and a summary of supervisory provisions of the third country applicable to the proposed acquirer Other key changes The revised Owner Control Regulation includes a number of further changes as well as new template forms for notification purposes and for the fit and proper assessment."
Noerr,Changes in the owner control regime in Germany,"The key changes include the following: The Revised Owner Control Regulation specifies that capital holding of 10% or more in the target held by a shareholder who is, directly or indirectly, controlled by another entity shall be attributed in full to such entity (see 5 (1) new sent.

2 of the Owner Control Regulation).

This provision is relevant for determining the circle of proposed acquirers and can be of particular relevance for private equity structures involving General Partners functions.

It reflects the approach expressed so far by the European Supervisory Authorities and the European Central Bank to combine the multiplication criterion (generally used for calculation of indirect Qualifying Holdings of capital) with the control criterion , More granular disclosures are now required for persons who shall be appointed to the management board of the target; new forms are to be used for the purpose of fit and proper assessment concerning beside the reputation also information on further mandates and time availability.

In case of targets that are CRR credit institutions questionnaires on professional suitability, personal reputation, conflicts of interests and sufficient time availability are to be submitted.

The revised disclosures direct thereby towards the requirements applicable to appointments in the normal course of business, that is outside the owner control change scenario, Disclosures relating to the proposed acquirers and their management board members now include some formal easements, e.g. an explicit provision allowing for compiled disclosures for managed and controlled entities and a possibility to submit a list of such entities and the relevant information rather than separate forms; further, there is now an explicit specification that disclosures on controlled and managed entities concern entities that have been controlled and/or managed by the proposed acquirer in the past ten years , Explicit provision allowing case-by-case arrangements with BaFin in the event of legal obstacles to providing certain information or documents, Proposed acquirers that are not natural persons are obliged to submit an analysis of the scope of consolidated supervision , including information about which group entities would be included in the scope of consolidated supervision requirements after the proposed acquisition and at which levels within the group those requirements would apply on a full or sub-consolidated basis.

Proposed acquirers shall also provide an analysis of the impact of the proposed acquisition on the ability of the target to continue to provide timely and accurate information to BaFin and Bundesbank."
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control issues guidance on appropriateness and further information on effectiveness,"The German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für

Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle – the “ Federal Office ”) has published guidance (only available in German) and further information on the principles of appropriateness and effectiveness (only available in German) according to the requirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – “ Supply Chain Act ” ).

The principle of appropriateness refers to all due diligence obligations and is a basic principle of the Supply Chain Act.

In its guidance, the Federal Office explains its understanding of this term and provides practical tips on putting this principle into action while fulfilling due diligence obligations.

Points made in the guidance that are particularly important in practice are summarised below: Definition of the principle of appropriateness For its definition of appropriateness, the Federal Office refers to the criteria for appropriateness found in section 3(2) Supply Chain Act and interprets them: Type and scope of business activities : Factors to consider here are how complex the characteristics or kind of products or services are; how wide-ranging the variety of services and business relationships are; what the company’s target territory is (regional, national or international); whether there are risks specific to countries, sectors or groups of goods; whether the company is vulnerable to risks (i.e. frequency of risks) and how large the company is (number of employees, turnover, investment and operating capital and production capacity).

The company’s ability to influence the party causing a violation : This is determined based on the company’s proximity to the risk.

If the direct supplier is the party causing the violation, the company’s ability to influence the risk and the supplier depends on factors including the company’s degree of market dominance (e.g. compared to competitors) and its order value in comparison to the direct supplier’s total turnover.

The company is to create transparency step by step regarding the direct supplier’s total turnover.

One stated indication of a company’s ability to influence the direct supplier is the direct supplier’s willingness to cooperate on improvements.

The typically expected severity of the violation, irreversibility of the violation and probability that a human-rights or environmental obligation will be violated: The severity is to be determined based on the degree of the adverse effects, i.e. the intensity or depth of a violation.

Whether a violation is irreversible is also to be taken into account.

Determining factors for the probability of occurrence of a violation include, whether there have been any violations in the past, but also the causing party’s previous conduct and the existence of possible preventive measures.

How the company contributes to causation of the risk or violation: Risks in a company’s own sphere of business are usually caused by the company itself.

Ways in which companies contribute to causing risks and violations include by permitting, enabling or inciting a particular course of action.

Under the principle of appropriateness, companies are entitled to discretionary leeway on measures to implement their due diligence obligations (i.e. the “ how” ).

The company’s business and risk situations are to help determine the intensity and sequence of measures the company takes to counteract risks.

The Federal Office emphasises that there is no hierarchy regarding the importance of each of the criteria for appropriateness; rather, they are all to be taken into account at the same priority.

In general, the company can initially prioritise some that are related to risks assessed as high.

However, in doing so, companies must not limit their measures to those players that are able to exert strong influence; instead, they must ultimately deal with all players and risks."
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control issues guidance on appropriateness and further information on effectiveness,"However, in doing so, companies must not limit their measures to those players that are able to exert strong influence; instead, they must ultimately deal with all players and risks.

Definition of the principle of effectiveness Measures are considered effective when they enable to identify and mitigate human-rights and environment-related risks and to prevent, end or minimise the magnitude of violations, see section 4(2)

Supply Chain Act.

Interaction of effectiveness and appropriateness The Federal Office emphasises the close connection between appropriateness and effectiveness.

Companies can only choose appropriately from among effective measures.

This is intended to ensure that an appropriate measure always effectively mitigates or ends risks or violations.

Companies are expected to examine effectiveness and appropriateness to choose measures, thus deploying resources in a manner that achieves their goals.

First impression and shortcomings The publication touches on fundamental topics that will need to be treated at more depth.

Restricting the discretionary leeway for action provided by the Supply Chain Act : A glance at the examples suggests that the Federal Office is restricting and, in some cases, completely closing the discretionary leeway for action provided by the legislator.

For example, if a company wishes to make an acquisition in a country and discovers during its risk assessment that children younger than 15 or 13 years of age are employed in the enterprise to be acquired, it must take appropriate preventive and remedial measures.

According to the Federal Office, the company will only be deemed to have fulfilled its duty when higher wages are paid, child labour is prohibited and adequate local childcare facilities (i.e. schools) are provided.

The company will therefore be obliged to open a local school because the Federal Office considers this an effective and appropriate measure, and it will not be permitted to decide whether paying higher wages, prohibiting child labour, training employees locally and supporting existing schools and/or participating in local initiatives is effective.

This gives rise to the impression that the Federal Office is allowing itself to be influenced too much by development aid policies and is shifting governmental responsibilities entirely onto businesses.

Ability to influence: The Federal Office describes in great detail the ability to influence direct suppliers as the one who causes a risk or violation, but it completely fails to address the ability to influence indirect suppliers.

This is not understandable for us, because it is precisely here that the question arises in practice as to whether and how businesses can influence indirect suppliers (with which they have no contractual relationship) at all.

Thus, the impression can arise that the Federal Office is restricting discretionary leeway for action.

However, such a tendency would contradict all of the legislator’s statements.

In its explanatory memorandum, the legislator emphasises in many places that companies are entitled to broad discretionary leeway to act in regard to all decisions.

It remains to be seen what will be left of the leeway granted by the legislator in the actual practice of applying the Supply Chain Act."
Noerr,Schlecker judgment by Germany's Federal Court of Justice,"On 4 January 2023, the Federal Court of Justice (hereinafter also “the Court”) published the eagerly awaited judgment in the Schlecker case, which was issued on 29 November 2022 (judgment of 29 November 2022, file no.

KZR 42/20, full text in German here ).

Although the press release following the pronouncement of the judgment was interpreted by some as a claimant-friendly U-turn by the Court in the case of information-sharing cartels, the ruling (which is to be published in the official collection) is in fact in line with the previous case law of the Court’s cartel division on cartel damages, which requires comprehensive examination of the parties’ submissions by the trial judge.

Background The now-insolvent drugstore chain Schlecker e.K.i.

L. ( Schlecker ) filed a claim for damages of approx.

€212 million against several manufacturers of drugstore products with Frankfurt Regional Court ( Landgericht ) and Frankfurt Higher Regional Court ( Oberlandesgericht ).

Between 2004 and 2006, the manufacturers had shared information on current and future wholesale price increases, including discount campaigns, in breach of antitrust law (the case became known as the drugstore cartel).

Following a leniency application, the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) imposed fines on the cartel participants between 2008 and 2013.

Schlecker had purchased various products from these manufacturers during the cartel period, with prices for such products being agreed in annual meetings.

Schlecker then claimed damage of its own due to increased product prices.

The action was unsuccessful in both lower courts, particularly because the courts could not establish that Schlecker had suffered any cartel-related damage.

Decision by the Federal Court of Justice The Federal Court of Justice quashed the appeal judgment and referred the case back to Frankfurt Higher Regional Court for a new ruling.

While the Court affirmed the defendant’s cartel infringement within the meaning of Article 81 of the EC Treaty (now Article 101 TFEU) as well as section 1 of the German Act against Restrictions of Competition based on the FCO’s penalty notice and the fact that Schlecker was affected by the cartel as a customer buying the cartelised drugstore products, the issue of establishing the cartel-related damage is the focus.

No presumption of damage and no binding establishment of damage based on the penalty notice The Federal Court of Justice first rejected the argument raised in the appeal on points of law that due to the binding effect of the FCO’s penalty notice under section 33(4) of the German Act against Restrictions of Competition (2005), it had to be presumed that Schlecker suffered cartel damages.

The Court said that especially when establishing that an intended restriction of competition was achieved, it did not have to make any assessments whatsoever of the specific effects on competition.

The determination of a disadvantage for the customers in question was not decisive in this respect and therefore was not part of the binding effect of section 33(4) of the German Act against Restrictions of Competition (2005).

Rather, issues of the causality and the amount of the damages were, in principle, solely determined by the competent court’s free assessment of the evidence presented.

The findings required for this had to be determined by the trial judge, who was also entitled to resort to an estimate of the damage, according to section 287(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

The Court added that the trial court’s resulting assessment of the facts could only be reviewed to a limited extent by the Court on appeal, since after all the Court only reviews whether the legal principles of assessing damages have been misjudged, whether essential assessment factors have been disregarded or whether incorrect standards have been used for the estimate (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 28 January 2020 – BGHZ 224, 281 marginal no. 35 et seq. – Rail cartel 2 )."
Noerr,Schlecker judgment by Germany's Federal Court of Justice,"The trial judge has a free hand, especially when handling requests for evidence, according to the Court.

In the case of circumstantial evidence, before taking evidence the trial judge is allowed to, and has to, examine whether the evidence presented convinces him or her of the truth of the main fact to be proven.

Empirical principle of a cartel-related price increase is a relevant indication, even in cases where information is merely shared The Federal Court of Justice considered these principles to have been breached in the present case by the court of first appeal (Frankfurt Higher Regional Court), which did not establish sufficient indicative circumstances based on its assessment of the information-sharing cartel identified.

In line with its previous case law (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 28 January 2020, BGHZ 224, 281 – Schienenkartell II, link to our news ), the Court first held that even outside the temporary scope of section 33a(1) of the German Act against Restrictions of Competition, in the case of territorial and price agreements in breach of cartel law, a factual presumption in favour of the customers based on a high degree of probability in the sense of an empirical principle suggested that there was a cartel-related price increase.

The Court now applied this empirical principle to the present case’s mere sharing of secret information on current and future pricing policy.

Here, too, the empirical principle suggests that the competitors involved jointly achieved a higher price level than they would have without sharing information.

The reason for this was the presumption that the companies involved in the sharing would take the information into account when determining their own market conduct – this is part of economic experience and corresponds to reasonable economic judgement, the Court said.

No reversal of the burden of proof, even under European law The Court’s cartel division again clarified that this empirical principle did not result in prima facie evidence or a reversal of the burden of proof.

Rather, this empirical principle could only establish circumstantial evidence of the alleged fact.

The necessity of a reversal of the burden of proof – prior to the entry into force of the Cartel Damages Directive, which introduced a legal presumption of damage – did not follow from the principle of effectiveness under EU law, either.

That principle only states that evidence of cartel-related damage may also be provided by circumstantial evidence.

Moreover, that principle was sufficiently taken into account by the option of estimating damage within the meaning of section 287(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

Importance of empirical principle to be determined by overall assessment However, even in the case of sharing information, the empirical principle should not be regarded as having only a slight indicative effect (at least from an abstract perspective).

However, the Federal Court of Justice only rejects a schematic view.

Within the framework of its overall assessment, the trial court had to examine whether there were indications in the concrete case (such as the frequency and duration of the sharing of information) which confirmed or invalidated the empirical principle in the individual case.

The Court then went into detail on the circumstantial evidence that was included in the overall assessment in the individual case.

The Court’s ruling states that the trial judge is required to clearly examine, with regard to the individual economic argument and the respective deviation, whether it is circumstantial evidence that supports or refutes the occurrence of damage and the application of the empirical principle and then to differentiate with regard to the question of the burden of presentation and proof."
Noerr,Schlecker judgment by Germany's Federal Court of Justice,"In doing so, the cartel division examines the parties’ allegations in the context of the effects of the infringement assumed by it, which it determines rather generally based on the assessment of the unity of the offence under administrative offence law.

Rejection of regression analysis not sufficient According to previous case law, a regression analysis submitted by a party stating there is a difference (or none) between the prices on the cartelised market and a cartel-free comparative market already constitutes evidence to be taken into account to show that cartel damages occurred or to refute such damages.

The Federal Court of Justice now states that the trial judge may not, in principle, refuse to obtain a court-appointed expert’s report to determine damages on the grounds that the regression analysis contains methodological errors.

This is because the claimant’s assertion that cartel-related damage had occurred was not, in view of the established empirical principle, chosen at random without tangible indications and therefore not a misuse of law in the civil procedural sense.

Consequences in practice The Federal Court of Justice’s ruling comes as no real surprise in view of its recent case law on cartel damages.

Once again, the cartel division clarifies the process of obtaining results and finds legal errors in individual cases here.

What is new is that the Federal Court of Justice now extends the empirical principle for the occurrence of a cartel-related price increase, which has already been developed for price and territorial agreements in breach of cartel law, to the sharing of information in breach of cartel law and assumes that, based on general experience, such information is in fact used by companies.

In this respect, the hurdles for cartel victims are lowered.

Furthermore, even if the regression analyses submitted are faulty, as often happens in practice, the trial judge must consider obtaining a court-appointed expert’s opinion if the factual presentation otherwise provides sufficient indications of damage.

On the other hand, this should not mean that from now on trial judges must always affirm that cartel-related damages did in fact occur in claims for damages following the sharing of information in breach of antitrust law.

This is because the Federal Court of Justice strongly emphasises that neither prima facie evidence nor a reversal of the burden of proof supports the existence of damage.

As a result, the trial judge must take into account all circumstantial evidence presented by both sides in estimating damages pursuant to section 287 of the German Code of Civil Procedure and always consider who has the burden of proof and presentation for each fact alleged.

Thus, even according to the Federal Court of Justice’s present judgment, it is the claimant alone who bears the burden of proving that the sharing of information led to an increase in prices.

The cartel participants, on the other hand, must show and, in case of doubt, probably also prove, that the information obtained was not relevant in determining their market conduct.

This is not new, as the explanation of why prices were set competitively despite the breach is already an essential element of an effective defence.

It remains essential for both the claimant and the defendant side to highlight and validate market and price-setting mechanisms that offer clear evidence for or against the occurrence of damage.

Econometric studies can validate these arguments and are an important, but not the only, element of the parties’ submissions.

Ultimately, the Federal Court of Justice shows once again that the trial courts must, as part of their judicial decision-making, assess all of the parties’ submissions as well as the way the individual cartel operates, if necessary with the assistance of a court-appointed expert.

Noerr,Caps on energy prices,"On 24 December 2022, the Act on the Introduction of an Electricity Price Cap (the “ Electricity Price Cap Act ” ) and the Act on the Introduction of a Cap on the Price of Pipeline-Based Natural Gas and Thermal Heating (the “ Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act ”) came into force.

The purpose of these two important statutory instruments is to reduce the financial burden on consumers resulting from the recent sharp rise in energy costs.

Both pieces of legislation also provide extensive financial relief for companies.

If a company wishes to take advantage of the envisaged relief, it should pay particular attention to the relief ceilings under EU State aid law, the deadlines for satisfying notification obligations, the duty under both Acts to save jobs and the applicable ban on bonuses and dividends.

The requirements and obligations that apply to companies will depend largely on the amount of relief they receive and on the sector in which they operate.

Relief under the Electricity Price Cap Act As part of the electricity price cap, electricity customers who consume less than 30,000 kWh of electricity per year will receive 80% of their previous electricity consumption at a guaranteed gross price of 40 ct/kWh, while those who consume more than 30,000 kWh of electricity per year will receive 70% of their previous electricity consumption at a guaranteed net kilowatt hourly price of 13 ct/kWh.

In addition, grid charges, taxes, levies and surcharges will apply.

Energy suppliers will charge for consumption above these quotas at the price contractually agreed with the customer.

The calculation of the quota for which the electricity price is capped will depend on the type of delivery point.

If a standard load profile is used for calculating the price, the grid operator’s current estimate for the customer’s annual consumption will be used as a basis for calculating the customer’s quota.

In such case, the quota for which the price is capped will be 80% or 70% of estimated annual consumption.

Otherwise, for example, in the case of real-time metered customers, the quota for which the price is capped will be 80% or 70% of consumption in 2021.

For companies that procure their own electricity (“self-suppliers”) through imports or purchases on the stock exchange rather than from energy suppliers, the relief granted will be calculated separately.

Relief will be automatically granted through instalments or advance payments agreed with different energy suppliers or invoices issued by them.

In the case of self-suppliers, relief will be granted by the transmission system operator responsible for their control area.

The companies affected will not need to apply for a subsidy.

Relief under the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act Under the cap on the price of gas and thermal heating, consumers of natural gas and thermal heating whose annual consumption is up to 1.5 million kWh per delivery point ‒ in the case of natural gas, this will include consumers who are charged on the basis of a standard load profile and smaller companies ‒ will receive a quota of 80% of their estimated annual consumption in September 2022 at a guaranteed gross energy price of 12 ct/kWh (natural gas) or 9.5 ct/kWh (thermal heat).

Consumption above these quotas will continue to be charged at the contractually agreed price.

Large industrial consumers who consume more than 1.5 million kWh of gas per year (e.g. real-time metered customers) will receive a quota amounting to 70% of their gas consumption at a guaranteed net kilowatt hourly price of 7 ct/kWh based on their annual consumption in 2021.

For purchases of thermal heating, large industrial consumers will receive a quota amounting to 70% of their annual consumption in 2021 at a guaranteed net kilowatt hourly price of 7.5 ct/kWh.

The group of consumers described above will be granted relief from March 2023."
Noerr,Caps on energy prices,"The group of consumers described above will be granted relief from March 2023.

They will not be required to apply for relief because it will be granted automatically through the instalments and advance payments agreed with energy suppliers.

In March 2023, the consumers concerned will receive a credit for three times the relief amount so as to retrospectively cover the months of January and February 2023 as well.

On the other hand, relief for large industrial consumers of gas and thermal heating begins in January 2023 as companies affected did not receive emergency aid under the German Natural Gas and Thermal Heating Emergency Aid Act in December 2022.

The relief granted to companies that procure their own natural gas (“self-suppliers”) will be calculated separately.

As a rule, companies entitled to relief will not need to apply for a subsidy.

It is only those companies that procure natural gas on the gas wholesale market for their own consumption that must apply for relief using the application portal established for this purpose ( https://gaswaermepreisbremse.pwc.de ) (cf. sections 35(1) and 7(2) of the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act.)

EU State aid ceilings for relief under the Electricity Price Cap Act and the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act Section 9 et seq. of the Electricity Price Cap Act and section 18 et seqq.

of the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act implement the ceilings on the relief that companies, including their affiliates, are permitted to receive as State aid under EU law.

The ceilings apply not only to relief under the Electricity Price Cap Act and the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act, but also to the total relief and subsidies that a company or group of companies is entitled to claim before 1 January 2024 as a result of the energy crisis.

This includes, among other things, relief received under the Natural Gas and Thermal Heating Emergency Aid Act and subsidies under the Energy Cost Reduction Programme.

The applicable relief ceiling for a company or group of companies must be determined on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the impact of the high energy prices on the company or group of companies and the sector to which the company or group of companies belongs.

Where relief of over €4 million is sought, the ceilings to be applied in each case will be bindingly determined by an audit authority to be specified (section 11 of the Electricity Price Cap Act and section 19 of the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act).

In future companies affected will have to apply to the audit authority for such a determination.

Notification obligations of companies If the relief received by companies in 2023 exceeds €100,000.00, they should comply with the notification obligations and deadlines in relation to energy suppliers, audit authorities and transmission system operators, which are laid down in section 30 of the Electricity Price Cap Act or section 22 of the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act.

For companies active in the primary production of agricultural products or in the fisheries and aquaculture sector, notification obligations apply as from receipt of relief amounting to €10,000.00.

Job retention obligation If a company wishes to claim relief of over €2 million, it must pursuant to section 37 of the Electricity Price Cap Act or section 29 of the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act prove to the audit authority by 15 July 2023 that it has included a provision in a collective agreement or works agreement guaranteeing its employees their jobs until at least 30 April 2025 (“job guarantee agreement”).

Alternatively, companies affected may submit a declaration in which they undertake to maintain, at least until 30 April 2025, a workforce that is the equivalent of at least 90 per cent of the full-time equivalent jobs in their company on 1 January 2023."
Noerr,Caps on energy prices,"If they do not provide proof on a timely basis that they have satisfied their job retention obligation, the relief granted will be capped at a maximum of €2 million.

Ban on bonuses and dividends Section 37a of the Electricity Price Cap Act and section 29 of the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act provide for a ban according to a scale on the payment of bonuses and dividends by companies that receive total relief exceeding €25 million or €50 million.

If a company receives relief in the range of €25 million to €50 million, the ban will only apply to bonus agreements or bonus resolutions after 1 December 2022.

On the other hand, where the relief a company receives exceeds €50 million, the ban will extend to all bonus agreements and the distribution of dividends.

The bans apply to bonuses and dividends for the year 2023, regardless of when they are actually paid out.

Companies affected may submit a declaration to the competent audit authority by 31 March 2023 confirming that they will not claim relief exceeding €25 million under the Electricity Price Cap Act or the Gas and Thermal Heating Price Cap Act.

This “opt-out” provision allows companies to avoid the application of the ban on bonuses and dividends ."
Noerr,European Court of Justice sharpens access right under data protection law,"In its judgment of 12 January 2023 , the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has sharpened  the right of access to personal data under Article 15 GDPR, going beyond the provision’s actual wording.

The ECJ’s strict requirements will make it necessary for companies to review their internal processes and their templates for responding to access requests so as to avoid fines and damages actions for failure to provide access.

Sharpening of the right to access under data protection law: no choice for controllers when providing information about recipients Article 15 GDPR grants an individual the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.

Where this is the case, the data subject has the right of access to the personal data and to certain information about the processing of the data and about the data subject’s rights in this respect.

This also includes information about the recipients or categories of recipients to whom such personal data have been or will be disclosed (Article 15(1)(c) GDPR).

At first glance, the wording of Article 15(1)(c) GDPR (“or”) obviously speaks in favour of the controller having a right to choose whether to name specific recipients or only categories of recipients when providing access.

However, applying a contextual interpretation, the ECJ arrives at the conclusion that the controller must in principle communicate the specific identity of the recipient and not just the categories of recipients.

In the Court’s view, the controller is only permitted in exceptional cases to simply communicate the category of recipients, i.e. in those cases where it cannot identify the specific recipient or it can show that a request for information is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

Private enforcement ‒ damages claims by data subjects Violations of the right of access can lead to administrative measures and significant fines.

For example, the Hessian Data Protection Authority has imposed fines in the mid ten-thousands for violations of the right of access.

The ECJ’s strict requirements are also likely to further encourage the developments currently visible in private enforcement in data protection law .

We can expect that, due to violations of the right of access, companies will in future be confronted with more and more damages claims, including mass proceedings .

It is worth noting in this context that there is an increasing tendency among courts in Germany to hand down plaintiff-friendly rulings on claims for non-material damages .

For example, Hamm Regional Labour Court has awarded non-material damages in the amount of €1,000 as compensation for violations of the right of access, while Düsseldorf Labour Court and Berlin Labour Court even awarded non-material damages of €5,000 for providing access late.

This development is likely to encourage more and more people to claim damages for violations of the right of access.

Review of internal processes and templates for responding to access requests In light of the new ECJ case law, we recommend that companies carefully review and, if necessary, adapt their internal processes and templates for access requests.

In particular, guidelines for handling requests under data protection law and templates for responding to access requests should be revised in order to be prepared for such requests.

Data privacy litigation As a result of current developments, it is becoming increasingly important for companies to deal strategically with the challenges, opportunities and risks presented by data protection litigation on a timely basis.

Data protection law is the substantive basis for such litigation and at the same time the linchpin in relation to other areas, in particular the relevant codes of procedure."

Noerr,Bundestag passes Whistleblower Protection Act,"On 16 December 2022, the Bundestag passed the Act for Better Protection of Whistleblowers (“Whistleblower Protection Act”), thus implementing the EU Whistleblower Directive and taking into account the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights on protecting whistleblowers.

Compared to the bill in September 2022 (we reported on the March 2022 bill here , and also on the requirements for whistleblower systems here , in German only)), the enacted version of the law contains some minor changes which do not change the structure of the bill.

The Whistleblower Protection Act also contains far-reaching obligations for administrative bodies and the public sector.

Key content of the Whistleblower Protection Act The purpose of the Whistleblower Protection Act is to enable whistleblowers to straightforwardly report breaches of the law and rules in companies and public authorities and to alleviate their fears of suffering personal disadvantages.

To achieve this purpose fully, the scope of application is broad and extensive organisational guidelines are laid down.

Scope Whistleblowers within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act are all natural persons who have obtained information about breaches in connection with their work or prior to their work and who report or disclose these to the reporting units listed in the Act.

In terms of the subject matter, the scope of application covers the contents of reports and disclosures listed exhaustively in section 2 of the Act.

The German legislator has defined the scope of application more broadly than specified in the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive.

The protected contents include, in particular, breaches that are punishable by penalty, breaches that are punishable by a fine, insofar as the provision breached serves to protect life, limb and health or to protect the rights of employees or their representative bodies, as well as breaches of national or European legal provisions in more closely defined subject areas.

Compared to the government draft, the scope of application contains two important additions.

Tipoffs about anti-constitutional statements by civil servants and breaches of the provisions of the European Digital Markets Act are now covered as well.

Measures to protect whistleblowers The core of the Whistleblower Protection Act is the obligation to set up an organisation-specific internal reporting unit and an additional external reporting unit for whistleblowers to contact as they wish.

In principle, every private-sector and public-sector employer must set up and run an internal reporting unit.

Only employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt.

The central external reporting unit is (with specific exceptions) a unit set up for this purpose at the Federal Justice Office (BfJ) and organisationally separate from the rest of the BfJ’s area of responsibility, as well as, optionally, reporting units set up in the federal states which concern the state and municipal administrative bodies.

In addition, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) have set up external reporting units for certain offences within the remit of these authorities.

Both internal and external reporting units have to provide appropriate reporting channels, check the validity of the report and take appropriate follow-up measures.

Follow-up measures may include, in particular, internal investigations at the employer’s premises, but may also include dismissal of the case due to lack of evidence.

As a major deviation in practice from the original bill, it is now obligatory for reporting units to also deal with anonymous tipoffs and to provide suitable reporting channels that allow for anonymous communication between whistleblowers and reporting units.

In the bill, this was only envisaged for standard cases (“ought to” rather than “must”)."
Noerr,Bundestag passes Whistleblower Protection Act,"In the bill, this was only envisaged for standard cases (“ought to” rather than “must”).

However, the procedure for receiving such anonymous tipoffs will not be mandatory until 1 January 2025.

To avoid whistleblowers suffering disadvantages as a consequence of their (justified) tipoff, reprisals against whistleblowers are prohibited.

To facilitate enforcement of this, it is presumed, as a reversal of the burden of proof, that any professional disadvantage that occurs after a report is a reprisal.

A breach of the prohibition constitutes an administrative offence subject to a fine of up to €100,000.

As a further legal consequence of a breach, a whistleblower can demand financial compensation for material and also – in derogation from the bill – for intangible damages.

Obligations for administrative bodies and the public sector The Whistleblower Protection Act is not only a challenge for private-sector companies, but also requires particular action both in government bodies and public-sector enterprises.

To start with, public-sector employers are also required to set up an internal reporting unit.

The following applies: If the employer is the federal government or a state government, the supreme federal or state authorities must establish organisational units consisting of individual or several authorities, administrative units, companies or courts, each of which must set up an internal reporting unit.

This obligation also applies to municipalities and associations of municipalities in accordance with the relevant state law, as well as companies owned or controlled by them (the adopted version of the Act explicitly clarifies this compared to the bill).

This also puts municipal companies (such as public utilities and local transport companies) under pressure to act.

Adjustments by the legal committee, based on proposals by the Association of Municipal Enterprises, clarified that municipal enterprises can set up joint reporting units.

Otherwise they would have been in a worse position than private-sector companies, which also have this option.

In order for the internal reporting units to perform their tasks, they must be given the necessary powers to do so.

In addition, the people entrusted with these tasks must be able to carry out their activities independently.

When specifically structuring the internal reporting units, public authorities in particular will have to consider how to ensure independent fulfilment of tasks despite the fact that state officials are fundamentally bound by instructions and despite the hierarchical administrative structure.

In addition, the special provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act on the protection of state secrecy interests must be observed.

The requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act for public-sector employers are not only to be seen as an obligation.

They can also be understood as a means of ensuring the administrative apparatus complies with the law and the constitution.

This type of protection is clearly reflected in the example of anti-constitutional statements by civil servants, which are now included in the scope of protection as a suitable subject for reporting or disclosure.

According to the explanatory memorandum of the Bundestag’s legal committee, the specific reason for this amendment is the current discussion on how to deal with far-right “ Reichsbürger ” in the civil service.

For example, if a civil servant denies the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and rejects the free democratic basic order, that will be considered a statement in breach of the constitution."
Noerr,Russian Government Commission regarding transactions and dividend payments,"Russian Government Commission establishes principles for consent to transactions and dividend payments I. Background For several months after the Russian President (a) significantly tightened restrictions on direct or indirect transfers of shares in Russian limited liability companies (LLCs) by individuals or legal entities from “unfriendly” countries (“ Unfriendly Persons ”) with Decree No. 618 dated 8 September 2022 (“ Decree 618 ”) and then (b) also made the transfer of shares in Russian stock corporations by Unfriendly Persons completely subject to the consent of the Government Commission for Control of Foreign Investment in the Russian Federation (“ Government Commission ”) with Decree No. 737 dated 15 October 2022 (“ Decree 737 ”), which constituted a marked tightening of a decree with a similar intention, Decree No. 81 dated 1 March 2022, the principles and criteria upon which such consent was to be based were not drawn up, or at least were not published.

This also applied to permission to distribute dividends to Unfriendly Persons.

Such distributions were restricted by Decree No. 95 dated 5 March 2022 and Decree No. 254 dated 4 May 2022 and then likewise made subject to the consent of the Government Commission by Decree 618. II.

Principles of the Government Commission An initial draft by the Government Commission on the principles for consent to transfers of shares/interests by Unfriendly Persons was publicly circulating mid-December, although the official publishing of the extract from the minutes of the meeting of the Government Commission did not take place until 30 December 2022.

The Government Commission presented a list of specific criteria and conditions in the document which, in connection with the consent to the transfer of securities of Russian companies (which include shares, stocks and deposits (“ Assets ”)), are deemed to be particularly important.

These include: an independent valuation of the market value of the Assets; the disposal of the Assets at a discount of at least 50% on their market value as determined in an independent valuation; the determination of performance indicators for new shareholders (owners); the granting of a payment deferral of 1-2 years and (or) commitment to a voluntary payment of funds into the (Russian) budget in the amount of at least 10 % of the transaction value.

The Government Commission further specified the principles/criteria that must essentially be observed if approval for profit distributions (dividend payments) by Russian companies (“ Companies ”) to Unfriendly Persons is to be granted.

These are as follows: the amount of profit to be distributed (dividend payments) may not exceed 50% of the Company’s total net profit from the previous year; a retrospective analysis of profit distributions (dividend payments) for past periods shall be taken into account; the Company’s foreign shareholders must be willing to continue commercial activities in the Russian Federation; the views of the federal executive authorities and the Central Bank of Russia must be taken into account in assessing the significance of the Company’s activity and the impact of its activity on the Russian Federation’s sovereignty in terms of its technology and production and on the Russian Federation’s social and economic development; the establishment of quarterly performance indicators for the Company by the federal executive authorities; the possibility for the Company to make quarterly profit distributions (dividend payments) provided that the Company has satisfied the performance indicators.

III.

Assessment and Outlook 1.

Transfer of Shares As soon as Decree 618 was issued, it could be assumed that the Russian government would seek to make it more difficult for foreign companies to decide to leave the Russian market by creating legal uncertainty through an intentionally vague procedure that in any case delayed exit transactions and increased their costs."
Noerr,Russian Government Commission regarding transactions and dividend payments,"Moreover, Russia sought to reserve the right to decide who would be allowed to leave the Russian market and under what conditions.

In the list of criteria and conditions now presented, the Government Commission makes it clear that foreign companies should not benefit from exiting Russia and should only do so on terms that favour purchasers (preferably Russian ones).

According to media reports, the Russian finance minister already announced last summer that companies exiting Russia should certainly be made to experience some losses.

This approach is reflected in the extensive nature of the requirements that have now been established.

The majority of foreign companies that have decided to exit Russia have already suffered losses due to the de facto cessation of their business in Russia.

Even though these companies may not have expected to achieve the highest price when selling their Russian Assets, a discount of at least 50% of the value of the Russia Assets is nevertheless a painful measure; this is especially so where the valuation of the Assets has already taken into account the reduced scale/practical discontinuation of business operations or the fact that it is no longer possible for previous business operations to be continued.

Sellers will be no less concerned by the ambiguously drafted requirement that purchasers be allowed to defer payment by up to two years since this would mean ‒ especially given the unpredictability of Russia’s political and economic development ‒ that they would be transferring their shares without adequate certainty of receiving the (full) payment price.

Most foreign companies will regard this uncertainty as unacceptable.

The additional obligation respectively variant (the wording on this is probably intentionally left ambiguous) - payment into the budget of at least 10% of the value of the transaction - will pose (possibly severe) challenges too.

If this is to be understood as a seller’s obligation (here, once again, the Government Commission’s wording is not clear), it might be economically possible to absorb the 10% as a burdensome but unavoidable step in an exit strategy.

However, the fact that foreign companies (sellers) would be helping to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine, at least indirectly, by making payments to the Russian government results in exactly the significant compliance problems and reputational risks that the companies hoped to avoid by exiting.

As yet it is impossible to predict whether the Government Commission will strictly adhere to the principles it has established or apply other/further less transparent factors that may not be economically motivated.

There has already been one highly visible case of refused consent, regarding which it is generally assumed that the Government Commission felt that the purchase price was too high because it exceeded an amount three times EBITDA.

Because the regulatory framework for transfers of shares has been tightening since the war began, apparently with the goal of giving the Russian government stronger means of controlling planned transactions, it cannot be ruled out that further restrictions will follow.

2.

Dividends For reasons including preventing capital flight and to strengthen the ruble, Vladimir Putin restricted the payment of dividends at the very beginning of the war (including by setting a maximum amount of RUB 10 million per month (“ Base Amount” )).

Further restrictions were attached to dividend payments that exceed the Base Amount in the course of the year.

The now published list of approval criteria is intended to more closely link allowed distributions to the economic key figures and the continued operation of Russian subsidiaries of the foreign shareholders.

In addition, distribution exceeding the Base Amount is no longer to be possible on a monthly basis but only per quarter and this only under the prerequisite that certain performance indicators are fulfilled."
Noerr,Russian Government Commission regarding transactions and dividend payments,"The aim here is to put the owners under pressure to (successfully) continue their business operations in Russia because otherwise, distribution of dividends, including those from profit carried forward from previous years, will be restricted or prevented.

With the above-mentioned principles established by the Government Commission, the situation for companies that wish to leave Russia but are not willing to give up all of their profits and the prospect of sufficient consideration for the value they have created has taken a considerable turn for the worse.

The result will probably be more insolvent Russian companies and subsidiaries and thus - from the viewpoint of the non-Russian shareholders - more uncontrolled exits from Russia."
Noerr,NIS 2 – The second Network and Information Security Directive,"In December 2022, the Council and the European Parliament adopted the NIS 2 Directive , thoroughly revising and extending the legal requirements for IT security in the European Union.

This is the legislative response to the heightened threat situation and the related need for tougher cybersecurity.

The Member States now have to implement the new regulations nationally.

In Germany, the legislature will have to significantly adapt the BSIG (Act on the Federal Office for IT Security).

This article sets out the key points of the reform.

Goal: (More) standardised IT security across Europe The EU sees cybersecurity as a core requirement for the smooth operation of the single market (see recital 2).

The sometimes highly divergent implementation of the first NIS Directive, which led to companies in the Member States being affected differently, was a major thorn in the side of the legislator.

The NIS 2.0 Directive therefore aims to eliminate the major differences between the Member States by specifying a standardised criterion for its application (see recital 5).

The Directive will apply to all public or private-sector entities operating in certain sectors which are at least medium-sized enterprises according to EU Commission’s definition of SMEs (Article 2(1)).

An “essential entity” does not necessarily have to be a large entity.

This approach is the response to the growing mutual dependencies of central infrastructure, which can trigger a far-reaching downward spiral of effect, even if “only” one or more medium-sized players are at the start of the chain.

The thresholds for critical infrastructure under the German national Regulation on the Designation of Critical Infrastructure are likely to be consigned to history soon.

Expanded scope The EU has greatly expanded the scope of cybersecurity guidelines.

The Directive mentions “ essential entities ” and “ important entities ”.

The counterpart to the “ essential entities ” in the previous Directive was “ operators of essential services ”, designated “critical infrastructure” in the German transposition of the legislation (see section 2(10) BSIG).

The “ important entities ” are now an additional category.

These are primarily entities operating in the Other Critical Sectors listed in Annex II (see Article 3(2)).

The EU sees the responsibility for cybersecurity as lying mainly with operators in these two categories (see recital 77).

By enacting the German IT Security Act 2.0 in April 2021, the German legislature already significantly expanded the target group of the national cybersecurity guidelines itself.

This now governs not only “ critical infrastructure ” and “ digital services ”, but also “ companies of special public interest .”

Following the implementation of the NIS 2 Directive, a fourth category is now likely to be added – or the German legislator will align the companies of special public interest with the important entities.

Operators in the following sectors in particular are considered “ essential entities” and thus “ critical infrastructure” : Energy Transport Banking and finance Healthcare Drinking water and waste water Digital infrastructure Public administration Space “ Important sectors ” include: Post and courier services Waste management Food production, processing and distribution Manufacturing/production of goods Chemicals production, manufacturing and trade Education and research Specific requirements A core requirement of the NIS 2 Directive for essential and important entities is that they take “ appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures ” taking into account the “ state of the art ” (Article 21(1)).

The starting point should be a “ systemic analysis ” taking into account the “ human factor ” as well as the “ degree of dependence […] on network and information systems ” (see recital 78).

The required measures should not impose a disproportionate financial and administrative burden on the entities."
Noerr,NIS 2 – The second Network and Information Security Directive,"The required measures should not impose a disproportionate financial and administrative burden on the entities.

However, the legislator makes it clear that proportionality is measured according to the potential “ societal and economic impact ” that a cybersecurity incident may cause (recital 82).

“ Essential entitie s” in particular are therefore unlikely to succeed in invoking the effort and cost of the required measures to support their claims of proportionality.

The Directive also requires an “ all-hazards approach ” that takes into account physical disruptions such as theft, fire, floods and telecommunication or power cuts.

The NIS 2 Directive is complemented by the simultaneously announced Directive on the resilience of critical entities , which focuses on physical security, such as with regard to acts of terrorism or natural disasters.

In addition, the entities concerned are required to report “ significant incidents ” without delay (Article 23(1)).

Cybersecurity as a compliance issue The IT security of the essential and important entities is a matter for senior management.

The Directive states that the management bodies must approve the risk-management measures, oversee the implementation and can be held liable for infringements (Article 20(1)).

The Directive expressly allows the Member States also to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of the national rules transposing the Directive (see recital 131).

Strict oversight by authorities To enforce the requirements for essential and important entities, the NIS 2 Directive provides for comprehensive oversight by Member States’ authorities.

The Directive explicitly mentions on-site inspections, ad hoc audits, security audits and security scans (Article 32).

The entities most affected are the essential ones that are subject to a comprehensive ex ante and ex post supervisory regime (see recital 122).

These operators are required to systematically document the implementation of their risk-management system.

Infringements can result in administrative fines of €10 million or 2% of the worldwide annual turnover (Article 34(4)).

Action to take Though the Member States now have two years to transpose the European requirements into national law, the entities concerned need to take action today.

The Directive encourages essential and important entities to incorporate cybersecurity risk-management measures into contractual arrangements with their direct suppliers and service providers (recital 85).

The entities concerned should therefore check whether they are subject to regulation and, when entering into future contracts, ensure they implement the required measures with their service providers.

Any subsequent change in the contractual basis will require the cooperation of the service provider (sometimes at a high price).

However, the most important lesson to be learned from past trends is that cybersecurity is not an onerous legal obligation, but is in the best interests of the enterprises and entities.

The impact of a cybersecurity incident on these entities, as well as on society and the economy as a whole, may be far more drastic than any official measure to enforce legal requirements."
Noerr,Update: Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act enters into force,"Following its publication in the Federal Law Gazette, the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act’s (zweites Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz - SDG II) most significant provisions entered into force on 28 December 2022.

Information on the most important changes was contained in the draft bill prepared jointly by the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK).

We discussed this in our previous news article .

The Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act, which has now entered into force, builds on the First German Sanctions Enforcement Act ( erstes Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz – SDG I ) of 28 May 2022.

It aims to improve the enforcement of sanctions, especially given the sanctions imposed on Russia and the desire to combat money laundering.

On the one hand, the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act, which is an omnibus act, creates new federal law through the introduction of the Sanctions Enforcement Act ( Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz – SanktDG ).

On the other hand, it amends various existing German acts, including the Foreign Trade and Payments Act ( Außenwirtschaftsgesetz – AWG ), the Anti-Money Laundering Act ( Geldwäschegesetz – GwG ), the Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz – KWG ) and the Securities Trading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz – WpHG ).

I. Important changes introduced by the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act It creates a central authority responsible for enforcing sanctions at the federal level to enforce sanctions law in Germany.

It establishes an administrative procedure for investigating the assets of sanctioned persons and partnerships and provides for a register for this purpose.

It sets up a whistleblowing agency.

It provides for the possibility of appointing a special representative to monitor compliance with sanctions in companies.

It provides for the linking of real estate data to the transparency register.

It creates a duty for organisations registered abroad that hold real estate in Germany to report their holdings to the transparency register.

It introduces a ban on cash payments in real estate transactions.

It increases the transparency of the concept of the deemed beneficial owner pursuant to section 3(2), fifth sentence of the German Anti-Money Laundering Act.

It paves the way for authorities to be able to access information on ownership and control structures.

It makes the UN’s sanctions list directly applicable in Germany.

It amends the rules on trustworthiness in the legislation on financial supervision.

II.

Changes compared to the draft bill 1.

Sanctions Enforcement Act (SanktDG) Sections 10(3) and (4) of the final version of the Sanctions Enforcement Act (new version) impose a duty on the Central Authority for Sanctions Enforcement and the other authorities involved in enforcement (such as the German federal bank - Deutsche Bundesbank) to report to one another following receipt of a relevant notification.

In the draft bill, the reporting duty was only imposed on the central authority.

In relation to the sanctioned assets register, the final version of the Act also increases the requirements placed on one of the three categories of the data to be collected.

Previously, information on assets could be recorded if, after investigations into ownership had been completed, there was still a reasonable doubt as to the legal or beneficial ownership of the assets.

Pursuant to section 14(1), point 3 of the Sanctions Enforcement Act (new version), it is now necessary for there to be, in addition, clear indications that the assets really are sanctioned assets and, in a volte-face from the approach taken in the draft bill, a reasonable doubt as to the legal or beneficial ownership of other persons is required.

However, the newly drafted point 3 only applies to significant assets, i.e. those whose value exceeds €100,000, which is also a change."
Noerr,Update: Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act enters into force,"However, the newly drafted point 3 only applies to significant assets, i.e. those whose value exceeds €100,000, which is also a change.

The new version of section 14(2) sets out detailed guidelines on the specific information that will be stored in relation to the relevant assets.

Section 17(3) of the Sanctions Enforcement Act (new version), which was added to the final version of the Act, provides that the Central Authority for Sanctions Enforcement will now be responsible for proceedings involving administrative offences.

2.

Additional laws As compared with the draft bill, the final version that has now been published makes changes in relation to the provisions amending existing acts.

In this context, special mention should be made of the notification requirement for notaries in the draft bill that was previously set forth in section 19c of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.

The final version of the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act no longer contains this requirement.

III.

Conclusion and outlook The Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act is likely to lead to an improvement in the enforcement of sanctions and, as a result, increase the impact of EU sanctions on Russia.

For the first time, it makes it possible even outside the parameters of the Banking Act to appoint special commissioners to ensure that companies comply with sanctions legislation.

In addition, the introduction of the asset register in particular should make dealing with and attribution of asset ownership significantly easier.

In view of the authorities’ existing powers, it remains to be seen whether the creation of a central authority will really add value.

The final version of the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act makes few fundamental changes in relation to the draft bill; the adaptations relate more to technical drafting improvements.

In terms of content, the only significant changes are the newly introduced materiality threshold of €100,000 in section 14(1), second sentence of the Sanctions Enforcement Act (new version.)

in the case of assets whose ownership is unclear and the omission of section 19c of the Anti-Money Laundering Act that was previously in the draft bill.

It is likely that there will also be changes to the legislative basis for sanctions enforcement after the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act.

For example, the linking of the assets register with other registers is planned as is the establishment of a register for recording real estate transactions."
Noerr,Agreement on the Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System,"On 18 December 2022, the trilogue negotiators of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission (hereafter “Commission”, together “the EU institutions”) agreed on a provisional text on the proposal to review the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter “ETS”).

This milestone deal was reached only a few days after a similar provisional agreement on the EU’s carbon border tax on certain imported products , also known as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter “CBAM”) (see our related News Alert here ).

The successful conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the ETS is an important milestone on the path to the expected adoption of the EU landmark legislation CBAM early in the new year.

The EU ETS and the CBAM Both the proposal for a directive amending Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (hereafter ETS Directive) and the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism are part of the so-called Fit for 55 package , presented by the Commission in July 2021, which aims to reduce net greenhouse gas (hereafter “GHG”) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality in 2050.

The ETS is a carbon market based on a cap-and-trade mechanism of emission allowances for energy-intensive industries and the power generation sector.

The reform of the system aims to align the ETS Directive with the target set out in the European Climate Law to reduce net GHG emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

Negotiators of the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to increase the overall ambition of emissions reductions in the sectors covered by the ETS to 62% by 2030 and in order to reach this target they propose a steeper annual reduction.

The scheme will also be extended to cover more sectors of the economy, such as maritime transport.

A separate ETS for fuel emissions from the road transport and building sectors (“ETS II”) will be established by 2027, with the possibility for it to be postponed until 2028 if energy prices are exceptionally high.

The ETS allocates free allowances to sectors at risk of carbon leakage identified in a list for energy intensive industries.

With the introduction of the CBAM, the EU institutions intend to equalise the carbon price between domestic products and imports, allocate free allowances in a more targeted way and to incentivise the uptake of low-carbon technologies and the reduction of GHG emissions by third countries.

The CBAM is designed to complement the ETS, serving as an alternative means of reducing the risk of carbon leakage by allocating free ETS allowances to energy-intensive industries.

The current free allocation of allowances under the ETS will be gradually phased out as the CBAM is phased in.

Specifically, the Council and the European Parliament have now agreed to end free ETS allowances for the sectors covered by the CBAM over a nine-year-period between 2026 and 2034.

Until free allocations end, the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions that do not receive free allowances under the ETS.

A transitional period will start already on 1 October 2023, during which importers will be subject to reporting obligations of their embedded GHG emissions without having to pay financial adjustments.

Once the CBAM becomes fully operational, importers will need to obtain authorisation from a centralised CBAM authority and purchase carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that they would have had to pay to produce the goods at issue in the EU."
Noerr,Agreement on the Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System,"The CBAM will apply to imports from all third countries except those participating in the ETS or a linked mechanism from a limited number of emissions-intensive sectors that are at greater risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity generation, hydrogen, certain precursors as well as some downstream products such as screws and bolts and similar articles of iron or steel.

Indirect emissions will also be covered under certain circumstances.

Before the end of the transition period, the Commission shall assess whether to cover also other goods at risk of carbon leakage, including organic chemicals and polymers, and it will also evaluate the risk of carbon leakage for goods produced in the EU but exported to third countries.

If deemed necessary, the Commission will present a separate legislative proposal on that.

Next steps The successful conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the ETS having been declared a prerequisite for reaching a final agreement on the CBAM, the provisional agreement on the ETS takes us a decisive step closer to seeing the CBAM legislation being finalized in the very near future.

In order to be final and adopted, both the provisional agreement on the CBAM and the provisional agreement on the review of the ETS now need to be formally approved by the two EU co-legislators, the Council and the European Parliament.

The new legislation will come into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal, which is expected for March/April 2023."
Noerr,Regulatory & Governmental Affairs - Europanews 2022,"Highlight: Emissions Trading System Negotiators of the European Parliament and the Council finally reached an agreement on the proposal to reform the EU Emissions Trading System, paving the way for the formal adoption of the new rules.

Noerr,Romania: Tech layoffs - Isolated incident or new HR trend,"Lately, the tech industry seems to have taken a major hit, with more and more companies deciding to lay off hundreds or even thousands of employees and/or implementing a hiring freeze until next year.

When we see FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet) announcing such massive layoffs, there is no point asking whether this will affect the entire tech industry.

However, the question remains whether this will trigger a domino effect in the market, or even if it is the start of a new HR layoff trend and how companies should approach this situation.

Why is it happening?

Over the years, as everything in our life has become more digitalised, tech companies have thrived as a reliable source of well-paid jobs.

Then the pandemic hit and people started working remotely, shopping from home or streaming movies – in short, the online life became more of a need than a want.

This triggered an even bigger need for tech services.

Tech companies definitely felt the pressure to ensure both quality and quantity in a short amount of time by providing cloud based infrastructure and web hosting services.

So as tech companies’ revenues increased significantly, so did their need for a larger workforce.

Tech companies started a hiring spree, estimating that online business would continue to grow at least at the same rate.

The tech market became even more competitive, creating a war for talent.

Tech companies had to offer excellent remuneration packages to attract new hires.

Microsoft employees, for example, left to join Facebook on twice their former salary.

In 2022, however, the internet boom has faded and offline life is starting to pick up again.

More and more employees are going back to the office and people are spending more money on services than on goods, so the tech companies are seeing a drop in their revenue and their employees’ salaries have suddenly become too expensive.

Cost-cutting pressure and rising inflation coupled with a looming bear market and rising interest rates have forced tech companies to lay off huge numbers of employees or freeze recruitment in 2022.

The impact on non-tech companies Since tech companies are the pacemakers for the future, these workforce cuts may also set an alarming precedent and have a ripple effect throughout many industries.

Tech layoffs could hurt industries that are dependent on tech and their employees – and let’s be honest, everything around us is tech: from retail to construction, all industries have a tech component they rely on.

And in the current situation, it is safe to say that the whole range of services and subscriptions tech companies provide are feeling the pinch.

This situation could cause a domino effect in the market.

If companies can no longer provide services at the same level and using the same IT infrastructure, investors will be more cautious about investing in companies.

In addition, the entire business might be affected, which might lead to more layoffs or a hiring freeze.

However, there is a potential silver lining to the layoffs.

The hiring freeze might create an opportunity for companies to revamp the hiring process and to draft and implement more appropriate and appealing HR policies.

This is even more of an issue in the tech industry where the hiring process has not taken into account gender criteria, for example.

What can the companies do?

In our opinion there are a few things companies must remember in this wave of tech layoffs: Companies that rely on tech might take this opportunity to consider insourcing their tech services.

If so, companies should pay attention to the package they intend to offer the candidates."
Noerr,Romania: Tech layoffs - Isolated incident or new HR trend,"If so, companies should pay attention to the package they intend to offer the candidates.

On one hand, the candidates are likely have to take less attractive financial offers than they found in the heart of the tech sector until now; however, such individuals are less likely to have full confidence in an employer’s ability to keep them on the payroll through hard times – so the companies will have to convince them they are a good fit for the future.

And this could mean taking more interest in HR and focusing on: - Investing in the HR department.

For example, better training for HR employees could ensure better hiring practices, and so HR employees will be able to seek and hire the best candidates for the company’s needs.

Also, given that HR departments have an important role in determining the attrition rate, it is important to train HR employees to observe what is causing a high or low attrition rate and propose solutions.

- Drafting or amending HR policies.

From diversity, equality and inclusion to benefits policies, candidates are starting to be more interested in whether a company has implemented such HR policies and how they are applied in practice within the company.

Thus better HR policies mean better opportunities for a company to recruit more suitable candidates.

If the company is on the other side of the story and therefore might be considering layoffs, it is important to remember that Romanian law is very strict regarding the dismissal of employees.

Thus, a very careful approach should be taken, firstly to determine whether the company should carry out individual or collective redundancies, and secondly, to comply with the relevant legal procedure.

Noerr,The EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation is here: What’s it all about?,"Today, the EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (“FSR”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU.

This means the FSR will come into force on 12 January 2023 (20 days after publication) as Regulation (EU) 2022/2560.

The provisions of the FSR will apply from 12 July 2023, six months after its entry into force.

The notification requirements for concentrations and public procurement procedures will apply from 12 October 2023, cf.

Article 54(4) FSR.

The FSR is the EU’s response to subsidies granted by non-EU countries to companies that could distort the EU’s internal market (“Foreign Subsidies”).

Companies supported by non-EU countries may be able to benefit from advantages that EU Member States cannot give to “their” companies because of stricter requirements under EU State aid law.

At the same time, the European Commission (“Commission”) came to the conclusion that Foreign Subsidies cannot be adequately regulated by the existing tools of EU State aid, merger control, public procurement, and foreign trade law.

Indeed, in the Commission’s view, there has been no comparable, effective regulation of Foreign Subsidies so far.

The EU is now closing this regulatory gap with the FSR.

The aim is to create a level playing field for all companies operating in the EU’s internal market.

The legislative initiative goes back to the Commission’s White Paper on levelling the playing field as regards foreign subsidies , published back in June 2020 (see our alert here ).

In May 2021, after a public consultation process based on the White Paper, the Commission presented its proposal for the FSR (see our alert here ).

The legislative process was eventually concluded on 28 November 2022 with the adoption of the FSR by the Council of the European Union.

What preparations do companies have to undertake now?

From 12 July 2023 onwards, all companies doing business in the EU will have to consider the issue of Foreign Subsidies, especially when planning M&A activities and participating in public tenders which trigger the relevant thresholds.

This may lead to a further notification obligation to the Commission, including a standstill obligation.

This in turn will affect deal timelines, and the coordination of regulatory approvals will become even more complex.

In more detail: First, companies will have to clarify internally whether they have received a financial contribution from non-EU countries.

, In this context, the FSR defines the concept of “financial contribution” very broadly.

A rough reference point for the existence of a foreign subsidy is expected to be the “advantage” conferred within the meaning of EU State aid law, which is not the necessarily equivalent to the economic benefit enjoyed by aid recipients.

Companies that determine that they have received a financial contribution from a non-EU country are obliged (if the thresholds are exceeded) to notify transactions (“M&A instrument” – cf.

Article 21 FSR) and participations in procurement procedures (“Procurement instrument” – cf.

Article 29 FSR) to the Commission.

In addition, there is a general instrument for market investigation – the Commission can act ex officio even if there is no obligation to notify and can thus examine information from any source regarding alleged distortive financial contributions (cf.

Article 9 FSR).

The Commission will in these cases evaluate whether the identified financial contributions constitute a foreign subsidy and have any distorting effect on competition.

Finally, the Commission may evaluate whether any positive effects may outweigh the negative effects (“balancing test” – cf.

Article 6 FSR).

The Commission is currently working on an implementing regulation that will contain procedural specifications.

It will include notification forms and clarifications on the procedures relevant for notification and access to file."
Noerr,The EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation is here: What’s it all about?,"It will include notification forms and clarifications on the procedures relevant for notification and access to file.

Highly relevant in this regard is the notification form which will identify the level of detail and information that companies need to submit both for concentrations and public procurement notifications.

In the coming weeks, the Commission will launch a public consultation; the adoption of the implementing regulation is expected for the second quarter (at the latest third quarter) of 2023.

Therefore, it can be expected that further clarifications also on the responsible Directorate General within the Commission will be provided.

So far, only assumptions have been made regarding three possible scenarios: the Directorate-General for Competition (DG Comp), given its experience in State aid and merger control, as unique enforcer; two Directorates-General in charge of the new rules, more precisely DG Comp (for the scrutiny of concentrations) and the Directorate-General for Internal Market, DG Grow (for public procurement procedures); the creation of a specific joint task force with officials coming from different Directorates-General.

Noerr,News from the ECJ on VAT groups,"The European Court of Justice (the “ECJ” or the “Court”) has been dealing with the issue of VAT groups for quite a while.

Most recently, the ECJ (ECJ judgments of 1 December 2022, Case C-141/20

Norddeutsche Gesellschaft für Diakonie and Case C‑269/20 Finanzamt T ) had to address several questions referred by the German Federal Court of Finance ( Bundesfinanzhof ) with regard to the compatibility of the German provisions on VAT groups with EU law.

In conclusion, the Court upheld the provision under German VAT law which considers the controlling company of a VAT group to be the sole taxable person in the VAT group ( Organkreis ) (see section B below), expanded financial integration beyond the level applied up to now by the tax authorities (see section C below) and questioned the status of internal transactions being or not being subject to taxation (see section D below).

A. Background In two requests for a preliminary ruling (dated 11 December 2019 – XI R 16/18 and 7 May 2020 – V R 40/19) both XI. and V. Senate of the German Federal Court of Finance sought information on the interpretation of Article 4(1) and (4) and Article 21(1)(a) and (3) of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 (now replaced by the VAT System Directive).

Specifically, the Court had to decide on whether (i) instead of the VAT group (the group treated as a single entity for tax purposes), a Member State can designate a member of that group (under German tax law the controlling company of a VAT group) as the taxable person, (ii) in addition to a majority shareholding financial integration also requires a majority of the voting rights and (iii) becoming a member of a tax group involves by categorisation a loss of the controlled company’s independence.

B. Controlling company’s sole tax liability is compliant with EU law With respect to the relevant taxable person, the ECJ referred to its previous case law according to which the VAT group as such is generally to be considered the taxable person (ECJ judgments of 22 May 2008 – C-162/07 Ampliscientifica and Amplifin and of 17 September 2014 – C-7/13 Skandia America [USA], filial Sverige ).

However, the Court qualified this by saying that, as the Advocate General stated in her Opinion, where several legally independent members of a VAT group together constitute a single taxable person, there must be a single interlocutor.

It continued that for this reason German tax law, which designates the controlling company of a VAT group to be the sole taxable person and representative of the group, who assumes the group’s VAT obligations vis-à-vis the tax authorities, does not conflict with EU law.

It believes that this, however, requires that the controlling company of a VAT group is in a position to impose its will on the controlled companies and that the role of a controlling company of a VAT group as the sole taxable person does not entail a risk of tax losses.

The Court stated that German tax law contains a sufficient liability provision in section 73 of the German Tax Code ( Abgabenordnun g) which provides that, if applicable, the controlled companies are liable for the taxes of the controlling company for which their tax group is relevant for tax purposes.

C. No majority of voting rights required for financial integration However, according to the Court, the requirements under German law for financial integration of controlled companies are incompatible with EU law.

The German understanding to date is that such integration requires a majority of the voting rights in addition to a majority shareholding.

The Court considers this requirement to be incompatible with a narrow interpretation of EU law.

It holds the view that a majority shareholding already means financial integration – regardless of the actual voting rights.

Holding a majority of the voting rights does not, a priori, constitute a measure that is necessary and appropriate to combat tax evasion."
Noerr,News from the ECJ on VAT groups,"Holding a majority of the voting rights does not, a priori, constitute a measure that is necessary and appropriate to combat tax evasion.

D. Internal transactions still not subject to taxation?

The ECJ also found the categorisation of controlled companies as non-independent entities under section 2(2) no. 2 of the German VAT Act ( Umsatzsteuergesetz ) inadmissible.

It stated that contrary to German law, integration into a VAT group does not per se result in a loss of the controlled company’s independence.

The Court instead holds that it is necessary to determine in the individual case whether or not the relevant controlled company carries out an independent economic activity, i.e. whether it performs its activities in its own name, on its own behalf and under its own responsibility, and bears the resulting economic risk itself.

E. Consequences in practice It is good news that the controlling company of a VAT group may continue to be considered the sole taxable person in accordance with previous practice, i.e. the ECJ’s judgments have provided more legal certainty in this respect.

In addition, there will be no billion euro claims for tax refunds by controlling companies of VAT groups which tax authorities had feared would arise and which were still assumed after the Opinion of Advocate General Laila Medina.

The narrow interpretation of financial integration means an expansion of the VAT group concept to cover those companies which had been excluded from such integration to date due to the lack of a majority in voting rights.

Although we will have to await the final judgment of the German Federal Court of Finance, it is to be expected that the national interpretation with respect to financial integration will be adjusted to reflect this change.

As the existence of a tax group for VAT purposes is not optional, existing structures where shareholdings deviate from voting rights should be examined for the existence or non-existence of a VAT group.

Where the tax authorities’ current understanding of VAT groups is more favourable, companies can invoke protection of legitimate expectations even if case law changes following the ECJ proceedings.

It will be necessary to closely observe how the courts handle transactions within the tax group which have so far been treated as non-taxable (“internal transactions”) in the follow-up case law.

The ECJ opinion suggests that members of VAT groups in principle continue to be independently entities and that they can thus carry out taxable transactions within the VAT group.

In this case, the VAT group would be degraded to a mere formal vehicle where the controlling company of a VAT group only performs certain obligations for the entire group.

This would have far-reaching consequences in practice, especially with regard to billing within the group, but also on a potential deduction of input VAT.

Existing VAT groups are well-advised to review already at this point in time whether there is a need for action.

This applies especially in view of the future treatment of internal transactions.

We will monitor the further developments and are happy to help you react appropriately."
Noerr,"EU expands sanctions against Russia, introduces oil price cap","The European Union is doubling down on its sanctions against Russia.

The 27-strong bloc has introduced a price cap above which the seaborne transport of Russian crude to third countries is prohibited as of 5 December 2022 (A.), and has introduced a ninth package of sanctions, considerably expanding the purview of EU sectoral and personal sanctions (B.).

Looking ahead, the price cap will apply to additional products beginning in February 2023, curtailing EU companies’ ability to ship these to third countries.

A. Price Cap for Seaborne Crude: Tightening the Screws on Shipping to Third Countries As part of their coordinated approach towards sanctioning Russia, the G7 and Australia – the so-called Price Cap Coalition – have reached agreement on a price cap of USD 60 per barrel on Russian seaborne crude oil, prohibiting the shipping to third countries of Russian crude trading above the cap.

The legal basis for the price cap had already been laid on 6 October 2022 with the EU’s eighth sanctions package against Russia (see our News alert here ).

The agreement on the price cap came just in time before the EU’s blanket ban on the seaborne transport to third countries of Russian crude came into effect on 5 December.

European Commission President von der Leyen welcomed the agreement, noting the price cap would help stabilize global energy prices while cutting Russian revenue.

I. Key Provisions The EU has implemented the agreement by amending its regulation governing sectoral sanctions against Russia (Council Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014) effective 3 December 2022 (see here and here ).

As of 5 December, a price cap of USD 60 per barrel applies to crude oil and petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (CN code 2709 00) originating in or exported from Russia.

Only oil purchased at or below this cap is exempt from the EU’s ban on shipping to third countries.

An initial 45-day transition period exempts vessels carrying Russian origin crude oil that was purchased and loaded before 5 December 2022, and is unloaded at the final port of destination before 19 January 2023.

An emergency clause further allows the transport of oil above the price cap and the provision of related services (technical assistance, brokering services and financial assistance) whenever necessary to prevent or mitigate events likely to have a serious and significant impact on human health and safety or the environment, or to respond to natural disasters.

The price cap will be reviewed every two months to reflect market developments.

It will be set at least 5 % below the average market price for Russian oil and petroleum products.

II.

Amendments to Regulation (EU) 833/2014

The provisions outlined above were implemented by amending the EU regulation governing sectoral sanctions against Russia.

Besides setting the initial oil price cap in Annex XXVIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 at USD 60 per barrel, the Council substantially amended Art.

3n, which governs the transport of crude oil and petroleum products to third countries: Beyond transport-related activities, the prohibition in Art.

3n para.

1 henceforth also applies to activities related to trading and brokering.

Similarly, the ban in Art.

3n para.

4 was expanded to include trading and brokering.

3n para.

5 governs the entry into force of the prohibition in Art.

3n para.

4 and provides for a 90-day grace period after the entry into force of subsequent changes to the price cap for treaties concluded before the entry into force of the amended cap and respecting the price cap in force at the time.

3n para.

6 (d) introduces a 45-day transition period exempting from the prohibitions in paras 1 and 2 any seaborne crude originating in or exported from Russia that was purchased above the price cap, but is loaded prior to December 5, 2022, and unloaded at the final port of destination before 19 January 2023.

3n para."
Noerr,"EU expands sanctions against Russia, introduces oil price cap","3n para.

7 as amended limits to 90 days the ban on the provision of the services listed in para.

1 to vessels that have transported Russian crude oil or petroleum products per para.

4 purchased above the price cap, provided the operator had knowledge thereof or reasonable cause to suspect it.

The newly introduced 3n para.

9 codifies further exemptions e.g. for the mitigation of natural disasters.

B. Ninth Sanctions Package On 16 December2022, the Council of the EU has consented to the ninth sanctions package against Russia, following a proposal by the European Commission.

The ninth sanctions package amends Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilizing the situation in Ukraine (sectoral sanctions) and Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine ( here and here ).

While 1241 individuals and 118 entities are currently subject to EU Russia sanctions, the new sanctions target about 200 additional individuals and entities.

In general, the new sanctions package merely extends and intensifies the existing restrictions, including the following additions: Further items which might contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement or the development of its defence and security sector are listed in Annex VII, including drone engines, further chemical and biological equipment, riot control, agents and electronic components, Article 2a and Annex VII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as amended; the export ban covering goods and technology suited for use in aviation and the space industry has been extended by including aircraft engines and their parts, Article 3c and Annex XI of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014; further goods which could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities have been sanctioned by including such items as generators, toy drones, laptops, hard drives, IT components, night-vision and radio-navigation equipment, cameras and lenses, Article 3k and Annex XXIII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as amended; a prohibition to hold posts in governing bodies of legal persons or entities directly or indirectly controlled or with 50% public ownership; and the existing ban on the provision of certain services has also been extended by prohibiting the provision of advertising, market research and public opinion polling services, as well as product testing and technical inspection services are prohibited, Article 5n para.

of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014.

The Russian energy sector is subject to new restrictions as the prohibition of investments in the Russian mining sector has been added to the existing investment ban (Article 3a of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended).

Further, the Russian Development Bank is now also subject to a general transaction prohibition, Article 5aa and Annex XIX of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

Additionally, the ninth sanctions packages sharpens, prolongs and adds derogation regulations.

Among these, the derogation from the general transaction prohibition of transactions strictly necessary for divestment and withdrawal from Russia has been extended until 30 June 2023, Article 5aa para.

3a of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as amended.

Insofar, it seems inconsistent that the accompanying derogation from the prohibition to make funds available to entities which are listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 and are subject to the transaction ban, have not been extended accordingly.

The new regulations further add the possibility for the competent authorities of the Member States to authorize the sale, supply or transfer of goods and technologies listed in several annexes – again, if such action is strictly necessary for the divestment from or the wind-down of business in Russia, Article 12b of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

We will in more detail comment on this provision."
Noerr,"EU expands sanctions against Russia, introduces oil price cap","We will in more detail comment on this provision.

C. Outlook

As pointed out above, with the extended sanctions, the EU intends to hit Russia’s economic, military and political power even harder, notably by expanding the list of sanctioned individuals and entities to reflect new insights as well as increasing the overall remit of sanctions.

Under the current sanctions regime, the oil price cap has to be reviewed and potentially adjusted every two months.

The Commission may well use those intervals to review sanctions and make any necessary changes and adjustments at the same time.

As of now, petroleum exports to third countries will also fall under the purview of the price cap provision beginning on 5 February 2023, further increasing the number of operators and industries affected by EU sanctions.

Lastly, the EU’s asset freezes and travel restrictions are up for their rolling renewal by 15 March 2023."
Noerr,Romania: New regulations regarding social dialogue,"Law 367/ 2022 on social dialogue was published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, no. 1238 of 22 December 2022 ("" Law 367/ 2022 "").

Noerr,Romania: Important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Code - Update,"Government Ordinance no. 16/2022, published in Official Gazette no.

716/15.07.2022 on 15 July 2022, which brought important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Code, was approved by Law 370/2022, which was published in Official Gazette no. 1228/20.12.2022.

The new law amends the provisions of Ordinance 16 as shown below.

Starting on 18 July 2022, the new law: establishes consistent rules on the corporate form and tax status of companies for the purpose of applying the dividend tax exemption on the distribution of dividends (i) between Romanian companies; and (ii) from Romanian companies to other EU companies.

introduces an additional condition for the applicability of income tax and social security relief for the construction sector – i.e. 80% of the qualifying employers’ total turnover must be from activity carried out in Romania.

The total turnover must be obtained exclusively from Romania provides that the turnover on which tax relief for the construction sector is based must be calculated in real time, taking into consideration only year-to-date information from the current year and not using historical data (as has been the case until now).

Noerr,New ECJ referral on representative actions in data protection law,"By its order of 10 November 2022, the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) suspended the proceedings in the Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband v Meta Platform Ireland Limited case again.

After the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) had cleared the path for representative actions in data protection law by its judgment of 28 April 2022, the German Federal Court has now referred another question regarding the scope of Article 80(2) GDPR for a preliminary ruling, this time on the interpretation of an infringement “as a result of the processing”.

Background In the dispute, the German Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen , the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, complained that the information given below the “Play Now“ button in the defendant’s app centre was in breach of the statutory requirements to obtain valid consent from the user for data protection law purposes.

The plaintiff also complained that a concluding reference constituted a general business condition that was in its view unreasonably disadvantageous to the user.

As already reported in our news alert of 13 June 2022, by its order of 28 May 2020 the German Federal Court of Justice requested the ECJ to provide a preliminary ruling on the question of whether the provisions in Article 80(1) and (2) and Article 84(1)

GDPR conflict with national legislation allowing competitors and likewise associations, entities and chambers entitled under national law to bring proceedings for GDPR breaches against an infringer before the civil courts independently of the infringement of specific rights of individual data subjects and without being instructed to do so by a data subject.

On 28 April 2022, the ECJ decided against the Federal Court’s view that the standing to bring proceedings may result from Article 80(2) GDPR.

It held that in order to protect consumer interests, a consumer protection association may bring legal proceedings against the person allegedly responsible for infringing the protection of personal data, irrespective of the specific infringement, on the grounds that the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, consumer protection legislation or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions has been violated.

However, according to the ECJ, this requires that such data processing is able to affect the rights of identified or identifiable natural persons.

New suspension of the proceedings and referral to the ECJ Following the oral hearing on 29 September 2022, the German Federal Court of Justice suspended the proceedings again.

The Court’s order for reference of 10 November 2022 is mainly based on the assumption that the provision in Article 80(2) GDPR, which allows Member States to provide for procedural mechanisms for representative actions against the alleged infringer of the protection of personal data, only exists where the suing association claims the infringement of a data subject’s rights “ as a result of the processing ” .

The German Federal Court pointed out that the standing to bring proceedings conferred on the plaintiff by Section 8(3) No. 3 of the German Act against Unfair Competition ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb ) and Section 3(1) sentence 1 No. 1 of the German Act on Injunctions against Infringements of Consumer Law and other Infringements ( Unterlassungsklagengesetz ) must fall within both the personal and material scope of Article 80 (2) GDPR.

The Court held that, being a consumer protection association, the plaintiff is covered by the personal scope of Article 80 (2) GDPR.

Whether, however, the requirements for the material scope are also fulfilled cannot be answered beyond any doubt according to the German Court.

In this respect, the German Federal Court in particular focuses on the requirement under Article 80(2) GDPR stating that the rights of the data subjects must have been infringed “as a result of the processing”."
Noerr,New ECJ referral on representative actions in data protection law,"According to the Court, it is unclear whether such “processing” also includes the breach of the obligation at issue, i.e. the obligation to provide information on the purpose and scope of the consent.

Ultimately, this is about whether “processing” as defined in Article 4(2)

GDPR also means the obligation under Article 12(1) sentence 1 and Article 13(1)(c) and (e) GDPR to provide information to the data subject on the purpose of the processing and the recipients of personal data in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

Even if those obligations to provide information were to fall under “processing”, the German Federal Court further asks whether in the case at hand the infringement occurred “as a result” of the processing within the meaning of Article 80(2) GDPR.

According to the German Federal Court, the wording “as a result” may suggest that the standing to bring proceedings by way of representative action relates to infringements which are the result of a processing operation as defined in Article 4(2)GDPR.

Conclusion and outlook It remains to be seen how the ECJ will decide on the question referred to it.

The German Federal Court of Justice already noted that eventually it may not be possible in the case at hand to successfully invoke Article 80(2)

GDPR in support of the claimed standing to bring proceedings."
Noerr,Romania: New Whistleblowing Law enters into force on 22 December 2022,"Law no. 316/2022 on the protection of public interest whistleblowers (the “ Whistleblowing Law ”) was published in the Official Gazette of Romania on 19 December 2022 and will enter into force on 22 December 2022, when appropriate internal reporting channels and whistleblowing guidelines will become mandatory for private companies employing 250 or more employees.

Given the Whistleblowing Law’s importance for and impact on the private sector, we have summarized some of the main challenges and obligations companies will face in the coming months: All private companies with at least 250 employees (as well as public institutions) will have to identify or implement internal reporting channels and appropriate whistleblowing guidelines by 22 December 2022;

For companies employing between 50 and 249 employees, the obligation to implement proper reporting channels is postponed until 17 December 2023.

However, whistleblowing guidelines remain mandatory as of 22 December 2022; It remains mandatory to appoint an internal party responsible for whistleblowing unless registration and management of whistleblowing reports is delegated to specialised service providers; Anonymous whistleblowers will have the same legal protection and anonymous whistleblowing reports are to be registered and managed in the same way as reports from named whistleblowers; The Whistleblowing Law impacts employee relations by introducing the right of a whistleblower to be represented in disciplinary investigations following a whistleblowing report by a lawyer who has been appointed free of charge by the Romanian Bar Association.

Moreover, upon the whistleblower’s request, participation by union and/or media representatives in such disciplinary investigations becomes mandatory; The Whistleblowing Law reinforces the prohibition of retaliation against whistleblowers, and a court can require that its rulings on illegal retaliation be published on the company website and in the press; Whistleblowing registers are to be kept for a period of five years, and statistics on incoming whistleblowing reports will become mandatory for companies subject to the obligation to implement internal reporting channels.

Noerr,The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: What to prepare for,"On 12 December 2022, during the fourth inter-institutional meeting on the EU’s proposed carbon border tax on certain imported products, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (hereafter “CBAM”), negotiators from the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission (hereafter “Commission”) reached a provisional agreement .

Because the transitional period for the new mechanism is scheduled to begin on 1 October 2023, now is the time for companies to prepare for the new mechanism.

Background As a driver of the global environmental agenda, the EU aims to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

The European Green Deal , presented by the Commission in December 2019, is a roadmap of policy initiatives designed to make the EU’s economy sustainable, an ambitious target.

The milestone goal is to reduce EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

The first set of legislative proposals designed to facilitate the emissions reduction and to align the EU’s climate, energy, transport, taxation and land use policies with this target was the “ Fit for 55” package of July 2021.

As part of this package, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism aims to contribute to the EU’s climate neutrality objective while encouraging other countries to decarbonise their production processes by levelling the playing field in carbon pricing between EU producers and foreign producers.

The CBAM in a nutshell The principal objective of the proposal for a CBAM is to equalise the carbon price between domestic products and imports, thereby addressing the risk of carbon leakage caused by asymmetrical environmental policies of third countries and to potentially incentivise them to put greener policies in place.

The CBAM is designed to complement the EU Emissions Trading System (hereafter “EU ETS”) and is intended to serve as an alternative means of reducing the risk of carbon leakage by allocating free ETS allowances to energy-intensive industries.

Free allocation of allowances under the ETS will be gradually phased out as the CBAM is phased in.

Until free allocations end, the CBAM will only apply to the proportion of emissions that do not receive free allowances under the EU ETS.

Thus, according to the provisional deal reached by the co-legislators, the CBAM will initially apply to imports from all third countries except those participating in the EU ETS or a linked mechanism from certain emissions-intensive sectors that are at greater risk of carbon leakage.

Specifically: iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, and electricity generation (as originally proposed by the Commission), hydrogen and certain precursors as well as some downstream products such as screws and bolts and similar articles of iron or steel.

Indirect emissions will also be covered under certain conditions that are still under negotiation.

The scope of the CBAM could be extended in the future; before the end of the planned transition period, the Commission will assess whether to also cover other goods at risk of carbon leakage, including organic chemicals and polymers; the goal, as reiterated by the Parliament, is to include all goods covered by the EU ETS by 2030.

The proposal foresees a transitional phase during which importers in these sectors will have to report their embedded GHG emissions but not pay the financial adjustments.

Once the CBAM becomes fully operational, importers into the EU will need to obtain authorisation from a CBAM authority and purchase carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid to produce the goods in the EU.

Under the provisional agreement, the CBAM’s initial phase will begin in October 2023.

The full CBAM will be phased in gradually while phasing out the free allowances under the revised EU ETS for the sectors concerned."
Noerr,The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: What to prepare for,"The full CBAM will be phased in gradually while phasing out the free allowances under the revised EU ETS for the sectors concerned.

When the transition phase will end has yet to be decided.

In its original proposal, the Commission foresaw a transition period until 2025, as did the Council; the Parliament was in favour of prolonging it until 2026.

Last but not least, the provisional agreement establishes more centralised governance of the CBAM.

Thus, rather than each Member State implementing the mechanism, the Commission is now expected to be authorised to administer most tasks as a central supervising authority.

What companies need to prepare for The CBAM will bring about various changes for those involved in the sectors concerned.

EU manufacturers, traders and importers, foreign exporters and all other parties that are potentially impacted by the mechanism should already start preparing to adapt to them.

In particular, businesses will have to prepare for a global supply chain review, assess the implications of the new mechanism on their business model and quantify their potential exposure.

Another expected direct impact for EU companies will be higher import prices for covered goods, along with a general increase in the prices of any derivative products.

At the same time, the measure provides an opportunity for businesses to review their ESG responsibility preparedness.

All EU importers in the covered sectors must be ready for the reporting obligations to which they will be subject during the transitional period, which will start on 1 October 2023, as established by the provisional agreement reached by the co-legislators.

During this period, EU importers subject to the reporting obligation must: calculate the direct and indirect emissions that have arisen in the production process of the goods imported into the EU submit quarterly CBAM reports containing: the total quantity of each type of CBAM goods, specified per plant producing the goods in the country of origin; the total embedded emissions for each type of goods calculated in accordance with the method set out in Annex III of the proposed regulation; the total embedded indirect emissions in accordance with the calculation method to be established by the Commission in an implementing act.

Importers who fail to submit CBAM reports will be subject to proportionate and dissuasive penalties.

Once the transitional period has elapsed and the implementation phase has started, companies will be subject to the financial impact of the carbon levy that will have to be paid under the CBAM, as well as the following additional compliance obligations: EU importers will have to register with national authorities to become “authorised declarants”; EU importers will have to calculate the embedded direct and indirect emissions of the goods they import into the EU; EU importers will have to purchase CBAM certificates covering the emissions embedded in the imported products; each authorised declarant will have to submit a CBAM declaration to the competent authority by 31 May each year, specifying: the total quantity and each type of goods imported during the previous calendar year; the total embedded emissions for the imported goods; the total number of CBAM certificates corresponding to the total embedded emissions in those goods imported into the EU in the preceding year.

Non-compliance with these provisions can result in high fines and even a complete withdrawal of the license to import into the EU.

Next steps The provisional agreement is affected by the on-going negotiations regarding reform of the EU ETS.

The Presidency of the Council has clearly stated that the CBAM regulation cannot be formally adopted until certain aspects relevant to the CBAM are agreed in the context of other related dossiers.

Further negotiations on the EU ETS are planned for the next few days, and a final agreement is expected by the end of the week."
Noerr,The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: What to prepare for,"Further negotiations on the EU ETS are planned for the next few days, and a final agreement is expected by the end of the week.

Additional details on the duration of the CBAM transition period, the phasing out of the free allowances and the treatment of exports from the EU to third countries will not be available until then.

Once a full deal is reached, the agreement needs to be formally approved by the two co-legislators, the Council and the Parliament, before it is final.

The regulation will come into force 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal."
Noerr,Land in sight? – European Commission publishes draft adequacy decision for new EU-US Data Privacy Framework,"On 13 December 2022, the European Commission published a draft adequacy decision on the transfer of personal data to the US on the basis of the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework .

In its adequacy decision, the European Commission comes to the finding that under the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data exists in the US.

This means that once the adequacy decision has been adopted, transferring personal data to the US will be permitted under the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework without any further measures for transfers to third countries or official authorisations being required.

Background: Schrems II judgment of the CJEU, new Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework and US Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities In a striking decision issued in the Schrems II case on 16 July 2020, the European Court of Justice (CJEU) declared the European Commission’s implementing decision on the EU-US Privacy Shield invalid, without even providing a transition period , thus dealing a bitter blow to transatlantic transfers of data .

On 25 March 2022, the European Commission and the US published a joint statement on a new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework”.

In this statement they announced that the successor to the EU-US Privacy Shield, which had been found invalid by the CJEU, should also address the concerns raised by the CJEU in Schrems II.

On 7 October 2022, US President Biden signed an Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities , which is intended to implement the agreements with the European Commission on the new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework in US law.

On the same day, the European Commission subsequently announced that it would be taking steps to prepare an adequacy decision for the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework and launching the procedure for its adoption on this basis.

Further steps to adopt the adequacy decision and outlook The European Commission has already submitted the now published draft adequacy decision on the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) for its opinion.

The European Commission then still has to obtain the green light from a committee consisting of representatives of the EU Member States.

In addition to this, the European Parliament also has a right of scrutiny over adequacy decisions.

Once these procedures have been completed, the European Commission will be able to adopt the adequacy decision.

At the moment, it is not possible to predict when the adequacy decision announced by the European Commission will actually enter into force.

The Commission itself has not yet officially announced a specific date.

It is likely that the decision will be adopted in the first quarter of 2023.

While it is not surprising that the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework has already attracted some harsh criticism, the European Commission is convinced its new adequacy decision will withstand a new review by the CJEU.

We can expect the new adequacy decision to also come before the CJEU sooner or later.

At least for the time being, however, companies will be able to base data transfers to the US on the European Commission’s new adequacy decision.

So land is now in sight for the transatlantic transfers of data that have been affected by Schrems II, at least in the medium term.

Nevertheless, it is essential to continue reviewing all the risks of international data transfers in companies as set out in the comprehensive transfer impact assessments (TIA) recommended by the EDPB – not least considering the accountability under data protection law – and to take steps to deal with any risks where appropriate."
Noerr,Land in sight? – European Commission publishes draft adequacy decision for new EU-US Data Privacy Framework,"Otherwise, until the adequacy decision has been finally adopted it is still necessary to carry on taking appropriate safeguards (at least as an interim solution) for data transfers to the US, for instance to applying the new standard contractual clauses introduced by the European Commission in 2021.

As the transition period for the European Commission’s old standard contractual clauses from 2001 and 2010 ends on 27 December 2022 , despite all the euphoria about the adequacy decision on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework that is just around the corner, companies may have no choice but to amend existing contracts containing old standard contractual clauses at short notice."
Noerr,EU Listing Act Proposal - Part 1,"European Commission publishes proposal to amend Market Abuse Regulation On 7 December 2022, the European Commission submitted a proposal for an “EU Listing Act”, an EU initiative to make European capital markets more attractive for EU enterprises and simplify access to capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The EU Listing Act includes amendments to Regulation (EU) no 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation – “ MAR ”) for the purposes of removing legal uncertainty during an existing listing, reducing the time and money expended by issuers to fulfil obligations arising from listing and making provisions on sanctions more reasonable, especially for SMEs.

The European Commission’s most important suggestions can be summarised as follows: I. Ad hoc publication 1.

Delayed publication obligation for protracted processes For protracted processes such as an M&A or capital market transaction, the proposal provides for extensive and practical amendments regarding ad hoc publication.

Article 17(1) MAR requires issuers to promptly publish inside information that directly affects them.

When processes are protracted, this disclosure obligation applies not only in regard to the final event (such as entering into a company acquisition agreement in the event of an M&A transaction), but also in regard to the intermediate steps (such as conducting due diligence before entering into the company acquisition agreement).

According to the current legal situation, even such intermediate steps can constitute inside information and trigger a publication obligation for the issuer, regardless of whether there is a likely prospect that the final event will occur.

For protracted processes, the proposal provides that the obligation to promptly publish inside information would no longer apply to intermediate steps.

Instead, issuers would merely be obliged to publish the final event of the protracted process.

Despite what was under consideration when the public consultation regarding the EU Listing Act was announced, the definition of inside information in Article 7(1)a) MAR will not be changed.

The result is that the prohibition of insider dealing as found in Article 14 MAR will still be triggered by “intermediate step inside information” during protracted processes; thus, in such a case, only the publication obligation according to Article 17(1) MAR will no longer exist.

Consequently, it will be necessary to differentiate between inside information that “only” triggers the prohibition of insider dealing and inside information that also triggers a prompt publication obligation according to Article 17(1) MAR.

2.

Guidance in the form of a list of potential inside information The proposal also includes empowering the Commission to draw up a non-exhaustive list of potential inside information and state for each type of information the point in time at which the issuer can be expected to disclose it in compliance with the ad hoc publication requirement.

3.

Specifying prerequisites for delaying publication of inside information The legal provisions regarding delayed publication of inside information are to be made more concrete.

At present, it is only permissible according to Article 17(4)b)

MAR to delay publication of inside information if the delay is not likely to mislead the public.

This condition is to be made more concrete by adding directly to Article 17(4)

MAR the examples of “misleading the public” currently found in the ESMA Guidelines (Guidelines on delay in the disclosure of inside information and interactions with prudential supervision (ESMA70-159-4966 EN)).

4. Sending explanations for delays to competent authority earlier The Commission is also proposing a change to the point in time when the competent authority is to be informed of a delay."
Noerr,EU Listing Act Proposal - Part 1,"4. Sending explanations for delays to competent authority earlier The Commission is also proposing a change to the point in time when the competent authority is to be informed of a delay.

According to Article 17(4) third paragraph MAR, such notification is only required directly after delayed publication of the inside information.

According to the proposal, it will now be required immediately after the issuer’s decision to delay publication.

Although the national supervisory authorities are to be informed sooner, they will still not be required to approve the delay.

I. Market soundings 1.

Safe harbour The Commission’s proposal also includes changes related to market soundings according to Article 11 MAR.

A market sounding is an interaction between a seller of financial instruments and one or more potential investors for the purpose of gauging the interest of potential investors in a possible transaction.

The changes are intended to clarify that the provision on market soundings and the corresponding requirements are only an option for disclosing market participants (“ DMP ”) to benefit from protection against the accusation of unlawful disclosure of inside information (“safe harbour”).

Market participants that completely comply with the notification and recording obligations found in Article 11 MAR have full protection from an accusation of unlawful disclosure of inside information.

Conversely, market participants that do not (completely) comply with the requirements cannot claim this “safe harbour”; however, this does not constitute a presumption that they have unlawfully disclosed inside information.

On the contrary, as is the case with the “safe harbour” provisions for share buy-back programmes and stabilisation measures according to Article 5 MAR, the lawfulness of the disclosure of inside information is then to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

The Commission’s proposal also provides that, when disclosing information, all DMPs, regardless of whether they intend to take advantage of the “safe harbour”, must ascertain whether such information constitutes inside information before conducting market soundings and throughout the entire process.

The result of this ascertainment and the determinative reasons must be documented in writing and made available to the competent supervisory authority at its request.

2. Expansion of the definition of the term “market sounding” The proposal also states that the definition of the term “market sounding” will be expanded to include all cases in which a transaction is ultimately not announced.

III.

Introducing a permanent (instead of situation-based) insider list The Commission’s proposal also provides for changes in regard to drawing up insider lists according to Article 18(1) MAR.

Currently, issuers and any person acting on their behalf must draw up a list of all persons who have access to inside information and who are working for them under a contract of employment, or otherwise performing tasks through which they have access to inside information (“ insider list ”).

This list is to be updated with a new section when new inside information is ascertained.

Consequently, a new, situation-based insider list is to be drawn up for each case of inside information.

According to the current legal situation, it is possible to voluntarily add a section to this situation-based list that contains information on persons who usually have access to inside information (“ permanent insiders ”).

In future, it will generally be sufficient if all issuers – and not only companies listed on SME growth markets as currently required – merely draw up and maintain a list of permanent insiders (permanent insider list).

This permanent insider list must include all persons who, due to their internal role or position at the issuer, usually have access to inside information, e.g. members of the administrative, management or supervisory boards."
Noerr,EU Listing Act Proposal - Part 1,"The obligation to maintain situation-based insider lists will thus be eliminated according to the Commission’s proposal.

However, for issuers whose securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market at least in the last five years, the proposal stipulates that the Member States can require these companies to draw up and maintain a complete insider list with all persons who have (situation-based) access to inside information if this is justified to ensure market integrity.

Nevertheless, for persons who act on an issuer’s behalf or on their account (e.g. advisors, accountants or credit rating agencies), it will continue to be stipulated that they must draw up, update and, as appropriate, submit to the competent supervisory authority their own list of all persons who have access to inside information that directly relates to this issuer.

IV.

Transactions for a manager’s own account (directors’ dealings) 1.

Raising reporting thresholds Additional changes are foreseen in regard to managers’ transactions for their own account (“directors’ dealings”) according to Article 19 MAR.

One such change concerns the threshold value above which such transactions must be reported.

Article 19(8) MAR currently provides for a reporting obligation starting at a total amount of €5,000 in a calendar year, which can be increased to €20,000 by the competent supervisory authorities according to Article 19(9) MAR.

This option has been exercised by supervisory authorities in countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

Now, the regular threshold is to be increased to €20,000 with an option to be increased to €50,000 by national supervisory authorities.

2.

Broader exceptions to trading ban The exceptions to the trading ban for managers are also to be expanded.

According to Article 19(11) MAR, it is generally prohibited for any person discharging managerial responsibilities to conduct any transactions relating to financial instruments of the issuer during a closed period of 30 calendar days before the announcement of an interim financial report or a year-end report which the issuer is obliged to make public.

Exceptions from this trading ban are only possible under the prerequisites found in Article 19(12) MAR.

These exception conditions are now to be expanded and, in particular, to be extended to include employee savings plans that are linked to financial instruments other than shares.

Transactions including those in which the manager does not make any investment decisions are also to be included.

V. Share buy-back programmes Finally, simplifications for share buy-back programmes are to be included.

According to Article 5 MAR, the prohibitions of insider dealing and unlawful disclosure of inside information (Article 14 MAR) as well as the prohibition of market manipulation (Article 15 MAR) do not apply if, in the context of a share buy-back programme, there is full compliance with the prerequisites found in Article 5 MAR for conducting these measures (“safe harbour”).

The obligations in the context of share buy-back programmes currently include extensive transparency and disclosure obligations towards the competent supervisory authorities and the capital market, including a current reporting and publication obligation for issuers according to Article 5(3)

MAR in regard to every single transaction connected to a share buy-back programme.

If an issuer’s shares are traded in more than one Member State, there is also currently an obligation to report these transactions to all competent authorities, regardless of whether the share buy-back has been conducted on the stock exchange for which that authority is competent and regardless of whether the issuer has actively initiated or merely consented to admission to trading on a stock exchange in another Member State.

In future, this reporting and publication procedure is to be simplified and reduced."
Noerr,EU Listing Act Proposal - Part 1,"In future, this reporting and publication procedure is to be simplified and reduced.

In the future, issuers will only be required to report the information to the national supervisory authority of the market on which the issuer’s shares are most liquid.

Providing the public with aggregate information instead of publicly announcing each individual transaction will be sufficient to benefit from the “safe harbour” rules.

VI.

Conclusion The proposed changes in regard to publication obligations in the event of managers’ transactions for their own account and in the context of share buy-back programmes are welcome without reservation because the value of this information for the capital market was questionable in the first place, and the obligations required significant expenditures of time and money from issuers.

However, whether the changes in the publication obligation under Article 17(1) MAR will actually result in relief for issuers remains to be seen.

If the final event as such constitutes inside information, it will still always have to be promptly published.

The new provision will then only be applicable for situations in which the final event is not deemed to be inside information, but the intermediate step becomes so important that it is to be deemed inside information in itself.

However, it can be assumed that this will not occur often.

Because the insider dealing prohibition found in Article 14 MAR will also be applicable to intermediate step inside information, issuers will also have to continue to ascertain if intermediate steps have insider relevance.

Thus, it is not at all certain whether the change in Article 17 MAR will have practical significance.

The Commission’s initiative to require that the reasons for delaying publication of inside information be sent to the supervisory authority directly after making a decision/resolution on such a delay is remarkable.

In such a case, it would be necessary to prepare a resolution and document it in writing as extensively as possible even before the issuer’s relevant governing instances take it into consideration in order to be able to send the resolution to the supervisory authority promptly after it is passed.

Another result of the proposed amendment would be that the supervisory authorities would become aware of potential insider-relevant situations that ultimately do not result in the publication of an ad hoc announcement, e.g. if a transaction falls through.

Although there is currently no legal obligation to inform the supervisory authorities of a resolution to delay publication that is documented in the course of the process, in the future, the supervisory authority would be able even in such a case to examine the delay resolution as to whether the prerequisites for a delay were given and whether the resolution was passed in good time.

This is likely to significantly increase the risk of a fine and the expenditure of time and money required of issuers."
Noerr,New EU Legislation: Violations of Sanctions as EU Crimes,"Context On 2 December 2022, the Commission approved a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the definition of criminal offences and penalties for the violation of Union restrictive measures (“Proposal”).

Preceding the Proposal, the Council adopted a Decision to identify the violation of Union restrictive measures as an EU crime.

The Proposal ensued amongst the backdrop of the anticipated strengthening of EU rules on confiscation and asset recovery, aiming to facilitate confiscation of frozen assets to be used in the reconstruction of Ukraine.

Legal Basis Under Art.

83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”), the Parliament and Council may establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in areas of particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension.

Art.

83 TFEU lists categories covered thus far, such as terrorism, arms trafficking, and corruption.

The Proposal reiterates the fact that sanctions violations constitute serious crimes, as they can, amongst others, perpetuate threats to international peace and security and undermine democracy.

The implementation and enforcement of EU sanctions fall under the responsibility of Member States.

The Commission underlines the importance of the Directive due to the resulting fragmentation of definitions of sanctions violations and applicable penalties.

This led to different degrees of criminalisation amongst Member States (in two Member States only administrative measures are foreseen).

Key Aspects of the Proposal The Proposal aims to uniformly criminalise defined sanctions violations (Art. 3 para. 

1 od the Proposal).

Some Member States have broad definitions of sanctions violations in place, such as “breach of EU regulations”, whereas others list the prohibited conduct in detail.

To counter these different approaches, Art. 3 para. 

2 of the Proposal firstly foresees a uniform definition of sanctions violation.

Included are categories such as trading goods or services whose import or export is prohibited, failing to freeze or making funds or economic resources available to a designated entity, providing prohibited or restricted services etc.

The foreseen offences require intent (Art. 3 para. 1 of the Proposal) or at least gross negligence (Art. 

3 para. 

3 of the Proposal).

Wilful blindness ( i.e., ignoring existence of restrictive measures), which was originally included in the initial Communication from the Commission has been omitted.

The Proposal, moreover, does not define these terms.

A more precise definition of intent would be desirable, as the thresholds for intent vary amongst Member States, depending on the conduct in question.

The Proposal does, on the flip side, address calls for a clearer definition of the circumvention prohibition (Art. 3 para. 

2 (h) of the Proposal), for example, by determining the margin between illicit activity and legal advice.

Circumvention of restrictive measures through certain activities shall also constitute a criminal offence, for example concealing funds or economic resources, concealing ultimate ownership, failing to comply with notification requirements or even failing to cooperate with administrative authorities.

Although the Proposal stipulates that legal professionals are subject to the Directive, as there is a risk of their services being misused for the purpose of violating sanctions, there should be exemptions (Recital 7).

Art. 3 para. 

5 of the Proposal clarifies that professional legal secrecy shall prevail and that members of the legal profession do not have reporting obligations, except when the legal professional participates in the violation.

Similarly, a carve-out from criminalisation for humanitarian aid has been incorporated (Recital 9 and Art. 3 para. 

6 of the Proposal)."
Noerr,New EU Legislation: Violations of Sanctions as EU Crimes,"Similarly, a carve-out from criminalisation for humanitarian aid has been incorporated (Recital 9 and Art. 3 para. 

6 of the Proposal).

The Directive congruently aims to harmonise the interpretation and application of derogations, for which Member States are typically entitled to discretion.

Practical Considerations

Although stakeholders widely appear to welcome the Proposal, the Directive seems to only be the first step in the full harmonisation of sanctions enforcement.

Under German law, Sec. 18(1) of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act [Außenwirtschaftsgesetz] provides for criminal punishment for almost all kinds of sanction violations.

Sec.

16 of the newly passed bill of the Sanctions Enforcement Act [Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz] qualifies failure of a designated entity to report funds or economic resources as a criminal offence.

Negligent violations are regarded as administrative offences.

Nevertheless, further adoption of German criminal law will become necessary.

Gross negligent violations can no longer be qualified as administrative offences but must be punished as a criminal offence.

The most important change will affect legal persons and partnerships: The maximum punishment for intentional or gross negligent violations will be increased by up to 1 % or even 5% of the worldwide turnover, depending of the severity of the violation.

This will make it more essential than ever to have an appropriate sanction compliance program in place.

Next steps The draft Directive will, in a next step, be discussed in working groups in the European Parliament and Council as part of the ordinary co-legislative procedure.

The Proposal has already been submitted to the Council on 5 December 2022.

As the presidency of the Council will rotate from the Czech to Swedish presidency on 1 January 2023, we expect the Council working group to commence its discussions after this date.

First indications of Parliament and Council positions, which determine the further course of the Proposal, will typically be available within two months."
Noerr,Updated guidance document for telemedia from the German data protection authorities,"The German Data Protection Conference ( Datenschutzkonferenz ; the “Data Protection Conference”), which is the joint committee of the data protection authorities in Germany, recently published an updated version of its guidance for telemedia from the supervisory authorities (only available in german).

This was published together with an informative evaluation report on the public consultation procedure (only available in german), which had been conducted prior to the update.

In order to minimise exposure to supervisory measures and fines, companies would be well-advised to use the German data protection authorities’ updated guidance as an opportunity to review the design of their websites, apps and other telemedia to see whether or not these take into account the supervisory authorities’ common positions.

This also relates in particular to consent mechanisms for cookies and similar technologies.

Background: No special provisions for telemedia in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), selective special provisions in the German Act to Regulate Data Protection and Privacy in Telecommunications and Telemedia and already-established guidance from the Data Protection Conference.

The GDPR does not contain any special provisions on the design of telemedia.

The German Act to Regulate Data Protection and Privacy in Telecommunications and Telemedia (“ Telekommunikation-Telemedien-Datenschutzgesetz ”, hereinafter the “Act”), which has been in force since 1 December 2021, only provides for special requirements for certain aspects of the design of telemedia.

These relate mainly to the use of cookies and similar technologies.

The Act was enacted to implement the EU ePrivacy Directive, which was last amended in 2009.

The ePivacy Regulation (only available in german), which is to replace the ePrivacy Directive, is still locked in the legislative process.

The Data Protection Conference published detailed guidance for telemedia providers in 2019, which included advice chiefly on issues surrounding the use of cookies and similar technologies.

This was supplemented in 2020 when the Data Protection Conference published guidelines on the use of Google Analytics .

On 20 December 2021, the Data Protection Conference adopted a new version of its guidance in order to take into account for the first time the Act, which had taken effect on 1 December 2021.

Prior to revising its guidance, the Data Protection Conference initiated a consultation procedure (only available in german), allowing for the submission of comments until 15 March 2022.

An evaluation of the comments received can be found in the media working group’s evaluation report on the consultation procedure concerning guidance for telemedia providers (only available in german).

Specific adjustments and additional details in the updated guidance In the updated version of the telemedia supervisory authorities’ guidance (only available in german) (as of December 2022), the authorities have now made specific adjustments and added more detailed information.

For example, on a topic of great importance to many website operators, namely of “reach measurement” (often also referred to as “web analysis”), the Committee states that such technologies may – even taking into consideration the strict requirements for the use of cookies in the Act ‒ be used at least for the “error-free delivery of the website” (in individual cases this may be done even without consent).

Generally, use without consent will not, however, extend, for example, to measuring the “profitability of advertisements”.

In its guidance, the Committee has also provided details on the design of consent banners."
Noerr,Updated guidance document for telemedia from the German data protection authorities,"In its guidance, the Committee has also provided details on the design of consent banners.

Necessity for companies to consider revising their practices Even if the updated version of the guidance does not conclusively and unambiguously answer all of the questions that are relevant in practice for ensuring that the design of telemedia conforms with data protection rules, nevertheless both the updated guidance and the evaluation report on the consultation procedure offer legal practitioners valuable insights into the German supervisory authorities’ legal views.

It can be assumed that the supervisory authorities will base their administrative practice on the jointly formulated positions and, if any data protection requirements, as interpreted in their guidance, are violated, will take remedial action and, where necessary, impose fines.

Consequently, companies should keep the updated guidance and the evaluation report on the consultation process in mind when designing websites, apps and other telemedia.

This applies especially to consent mechanisms for cookies and similar technologies (e.g. local storage, session storage, possibly browser fingerprinting, etc.).

In order to minimise exposure to supervisory measures and fines, we recommend that companies use the German data protection authorities’ updated guidance as an opportunity to review the design of their websites, apps and other telemedia to see whether or not these take into account the supervisory authorities’ common positions."
Noerr,Autonomous vehicles on Slovak roads from 2023!,"The Slovak Republic has now adopted legislation that focuses on the technological development for autonomous driving and intelligent mobility.

On 8 November 2022, the President of the Slovak Republic signed the Act amending certain laws in relation to the development of automated vehicles .

The approved law, effective from 2 January 2023 , represents a subtle but significant step towards the development of operation of autonomous vehicles in Slovakia.

The law enshrines definitions such as “automated delivery vehicle”.

Additionally, it regulates the conditions for automated delivery vehicle permit holders which must be satisfied during its operation.

In order to exclude liability against the artificial intelligence or the autonomous vehicles themselves, the existing definition of “driver” is extended to include a person supervising a vehicle that uses an automated driving system.

Under certain conditions, automated delivery vehicles will also be able to drive on pavements and other places where pedestrians can walk, as well as on cycle paths.

In the near future, we will have to get used to possibility that we may encounter autonomously driving vehicles as road users in Slovakia.

However, fully autonomous vehicles driving safely and without driver´s intervention or supervision are still a thing of the future."
Noerr,New basic rules for the internet: The Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act,"In November 2022, two of the European Union’s key regulatory projects for the Digital Single Market enter into force.

With the enactment of the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the EU has redefined the rules of the game for digital services.

The DSA and the DMA are the two main pillars of the future European regulation of the digital space.

They are particularly ambitious projects that affect all users and providers of online services.

The regulatory package creates numerous new compliance and transparency requirements that companies will have to implement in the coming months.

What was originally planned as a single piece of digital legislation was divided into two parts during the legislative process: The DSA regulates the liability of digital intermediary services for illegal content uploaded by users and introduces due diligence obligations for providers in order to curb the negative effects of online services.

The DMA establishes specific competitive conduct rules for large platforms that act as gatekeepers in order to limit the market power of the large digital companies.

I. Digital Services Act (DSA)

The DSA sets forth uniform responsibilities and obligations throughout the EU for providers of digital intermediary services, such as internet access services (e.g. Telekom and Vodafone), social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), online marketplaces (e.g. eBay and Amazon) and search engines (e.g. Google and Bing).

To this end, the DSA relies on two regulatory approaches: As the successor to the eCommerce Directive, the DSA answers the question of who is liable if a user distributes illegal content via an intermediary service.

The DSA draws on the established liability privilege accorded to intermediaries and adds specific procedural requirements for deletion orders and information requests by authorities.

The DSA supplements the liability provisions for third-party content with far-reaching due diligence obligations, which are differentiated according to the type and size of the service and are intended to take into account the specific risks of online services.

The most important requirements include obligations to offer points of contact for users and authorities and to set up a notice and action procedure for illegal content as well as to follow extensive rules for online advertising and the design of websites.

Particularly strict requirements apply to very large online platforms and search engines with at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU.

These very large services must examine the societal risks of their services, for example with regard to the viral spread of harmful content and their impact on elections, human rights or the mental health of users, and take measures to mitigate identified risks.

In this respect, the DSA is the EU’s response to the increasing importance of online platforms in political discourse, disinformation campaigns and fake news in the run-up to elections, and the societal impact of hate speech.

While it is clear that regulation is focussed on the tech giants from the Silicon Valley, thousands of smaller European services will also be affected by the new obligations.

Companies affected by the Act should begin in good time to adapt their organisational and technical processes to ensure that they are in compliance with their obligations as from 17 February 2024.

Otherwise companies are exposed to the risk of high fines.

This is especially true for providers of very large online platforms and search engines.

They will be subject to the more extensive obligations four months after the European Commission has notified them that they have been designated as a very large service.

II.

Digital Markets Act (DMA) As the second pillar of digital regulation, the DMA aims to ensure the contestability and fairness of markets in the digital sector, to promote innovation and to better protect consumers.

It is aimed at the large online platforms that are known as “gatekeepers” and for which certain rules of conduct (obligations and prohibitions) apply.

Gatekeepers are companies providing core platform services that allow business users essential access to end users.

The DMA defines a total of ten such core platform services, such as online search engines (e.g. Google), operating systems (e.g. Microsoft), web browsers (e.g. Chrome), virtual assistants (e.g. Alexa) and social networks (e.g. Facebook).

A number of rules of conduct will be imposed on gatekeepers to ensure that they do not unfairly undermine the contestability of core platform services.

These rules of conduct are bolstered by the compliance, monitoring and reporting duties to which gatekeepers are subject.

The DMA defines thresholds above which there is a presumption of gatekeeper status.

These thresholds are comparable to the criteria for very large services under the DSA.

In addition, the European Commission may initiate a market investigation under the DMA if it wishes to (i) designate a company as a gatekeeper outside its regular procedure for doing so, (ii) investigate systematic non-compliance with the obligations or (iii) include new core platform services in the scope of the DMA.

In addition to providing the European Commission with far-reaching powers of investigation, inspection and decision-making, the DMA grants it power to impose penalties.

For example, the European Commission may impose fines of up to 20% of the gatekeeper’s annual worldwide turnover or impose behavioural or even structural remedies.

The European Commission has the sole responsibility for deciding whether to designate a company as a gatekeeper and for enforcing the DMA.

The DMA grants third parties a number of rights of participation and indirect means of redress that can be asserted before the European Commission, national competition authorities and national courts.

However, national courts that apply the DMA are not permitted to take decisions that diverge from those reached by the European Commission under the DMA.

You can find further information on the Digital Markets Act here .

III.

Significance for IP law The new set of digital rules is closely intertwined with traditional IP law.

On the one hand, the DMA provides for rights to data portability and interoperability that may conflict with providers’ intellectual property rights.

On the other hand, the DSA defines and supplements the principles governing the liability of platform providers, something which has always been highly controversial in IP law.

The starting point for this remains the long established liability privilege accorded to intermediaries: Platforms that provide intermediary services will retain their exemption from liability for illegal third-party content and will not have a general duty to monitor the content posted by their users.

However, the DSA sets out, for the first time, uniform rules across Europe requiring hosting providers to have a mechanism in place, which will allow third parties to report suspected illegal content.

In future, this mechanism will be the starting point for the liability of providers which do not act quickly to block or remove content after a notice has been made.

Another innovation is the “Good Samaritan” rule, which ensures that online intermediaries do not lose their liability privilege simply because they voluntarily review user content.

This provision is intended to give legal certainty to providers when they use filters or have their employees check uploaded content in order to proactively detect infringements."
Noerr,New basic rules for the internet: The Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act,"This provision is intended to give legal certainty to providers when they use filters or have their employees check uploaded content in order to proactively detect infringements.

Although the DSA does to this extent only provide a new basis for many familiar principles, the significance of its specific details for the protection of intellectual property within the EU cannot be underestimated."
Noerr,Control or no control – UBOs and the transparency register,"I. Introduction Since 30 June 2022, legal entities have been required to actively report their ultimate beneficial owners to the transparency register ( see our article from 17.06.2021 ).

The previous option of relying on information already published from other public sources, in particular the commercial register, is no longer possible since that date.

This means that compliance with and fulfilment of this reporting obligation is becoming increasingly relevant in every company acquisition and every due diligence.

If the company subject to the reporting obligation does not submit a required report to the transparency register, or does not submit it on time or in full, this is not considered a minor oversight but an administrative offence, which can be punished with a fine of up to €150,000 if committed intentionally.

In addition, the Federal Office of Administration, as the register-keeping authority under section 57(1) German Anti-Money Laundering Act, publishes non-appealable decisions imposing fines on its website, stating the nature and character of the offence and naming the legal entities responsible for the offence.

Notices remain public for five years.

II.

Identifying the ultimate beneficial owner Pursuant to section 3(2) sentence 1 German Anti-Money Laundering Act, any natural person who directly or indirectly (i) holds more than 25% of the capital shares, (ii) controls more than 25% of the voting rights or (iii) exercises control in a comparable manner is deemed to be the ultimate beneficial owner of a legal entity.

1.

Direct participation The first stage of the review begins with identifying the shareholders.

This involves looking at the direct shareholding structure in the specific company subject to the reporting obligation.

It may well be the case that several shareholders meet the requirements as ultimate beneficial owners.

Case study 1 : If A-GmbH is held by two natural persons, A and B (70% and 30% respectively), both shareholders are ultimate beneficial owners of A-GmbH, as both exceed the threshold of 25%.

Variation : If, on the other hand, A-GmbH is held by three natural persons, A, B and C (60%, 30% and 10% respectively), then C alone does not fulfil the requirement in section 3(2) German Anti-Money Laundering Act, which is why only A and B must be reported as ultimate beneficial owners.

2.

Indirect participation According to the legal definition, the ultimate beneficial owner can only be a natural person.

Therefore, if one of the shareholders is a legal entity, more detailed examination is required, namely to identify who controls that legal entity.

In that case, the chain of shareholdings in the legal entity is analysed and a review is done at each level as to whether a natural person exercises indirect control pursuant to section 3(2) sentence 2 German Anti-Money Laundering Act.

Regarding “controlling influence” on the legal entity, section 3(2) sentence 4 German Anti-Money Laundering Act refers to the provisions of section 290(2-4) German Commercial Code.

Controlling influence exists, among other things, if the natural person controls the majority of the voting rights in a legal entity.

Case study 2 : If two natural persons (A and B) each have a 30% share in A-GmbH and B-GmbH also has a 40% share, A and B are first identified as ultimate beneficial owners because they both exceed the threshold.

In the second step, we examine who controls B-GmbH (within the meaning of section 290(2-4) German Commercial Code).

For this purpose, the shareholders of B-GmbH must be identified.

If B-GmbH has C (60%) and D (40%) as shareholders, C exercises a controlling influence over B-GmbH according to section 290(2)

no.

1 German Commercial Code, since C holds the majority of the voting rights in B-GmbH.

Thus, C indirectly controls A-GmbH, which is why B-GmbH’s 40% shareholding is attributed to it."
Noerr,Control or no control – UBOs and the transparency register,"no.

1 German Commercial Code, since C holds the majority of the voting rights in B-GmbH.

Thus, C indirectly controls A-GmbH, which is why B-GmbH’s 40% shareholding is attributed to it.

In this situation, A and B must therefore be reported as the (direct) ultimate beneficial owners and C as the (indirect) ultimate beneficial owner of A-GmbH. Variation : If C and D each hold B-GmbH on a parity basis, neither exercises a controlling influence over B-GmbH, and thus neither C nor D is to be regarded as an (indirect) ultimate beneficial owner of A-GmbH. Accordingly, only A and B are to be reported as ultimate beneficial owners of A‑GmbH. III.

Nature and extent of the beneficial interest If the ultimate beneficial owner has now been identified at the various levels, certain information must be communicated pursuant to section 19(1)

German Anti-Money Laundering Act, in particular the type and scope of the beneficial interest.

1. Specific percentage According to the wording of the law, any natural person with more than 25% of the capital shares/voting rights is the ultimate beneficial owner.

For each ultimate beneficial owner, the nature and extent of the beneficial interest must be disclosed.

However, it is not clear from the wording of the law whether the specific percentage has to be stated or whether it is sufficient to simply state that the threshold of 25% is exceeded.

If the latter were the case, the legal reporting requirements would be satisfied if the extent of the beneficial interest were merely stated as “> 25%”.

On the other hand, the requirement to indicate a specific percentage currently results from the fact that it is not possible to submit a report to the transparency register without indicating a specific percentage.

More information can be found in our article from 03.06.2022 .

The interpretation becomes relevant whenever the shareholding of an ultimate beneficial owner changes without the ultimate beneficial owner’s position itself changing.

If, in case study 1, A transfers 20% of its shareholding to B, so that both have a 50% shareholding in A-GmbH, according to the wording of the law no new report would have to be made to the transparency register, because nothing has changed in the position of A and B as ultimate beneficial owners (= more than 25%).

From the point of view of the transparency register, however, a notification of change must be made because the (reported) shareholding amounts have changed.

2. Percentage for indirect control In addition, indicating the beneficial interest in the case of indirect control causes difficulties, especially where the controlling shareholder does not hold 100% of the capital shares/voting shares.

It should be noted that the existing percentage shareholdings are not multiplied, but that the amount of the shareholding in the controlled GmbH is directly attributed.

This is because the controlling shareholder can control the full amount of the existing (sub-)participation.

If, as in case study 2, C holds 60% of B-GmbH, which in turn holds 40% of A-GmbH, C’s beneficial interest is not 24% (60% of 40%), but 40%.

C is therefore the ultimate beneficial owner of 40% of A-GmbH."
Noerr,The new digital sick note,"Until now, every employee in Germany knew what the procedure was: they had to give their employer a printed sick note by the fourth day they were unfit for work.

That requirement to provide a physical document is now to be abolished as of 1 January 2023 (at least in some cases) and replaced by a digital sick note.

In this article we’ll look at the context and at how the change in the law will be implemented in practice.

Legal situation to date Under the 1st sentence of section 5(1) of the German Continued Remuneration Act (the “Act”), an employee has to tell their employer without undue delay that they are unfit for work and for how long (duty to notify).

Besides simply telling their employer, employees also have the following duties under section 5(1) of the Act: If the employee is unfit for work for more than three calendar days, they must hand in a sick note saying roughly how long they will be off work, on the fourth day at the very latest (2nd sentence of section 5(1)).

However, the employer may insist the employee hands in the sick note earlier (3rd sentence).

Many employment contracts and collective or company agreements explicitly specify this.

If the employee is off work longer than the sick note says, the employee has to provide a new sick note (4th sentence), and is still obliged to do so even if the employee will not receive any further pay in the event of illness.

New legal situation from 1 January 2023 The employee’s duties under section 5(1) of the Act will essentially still apply after the change in law from 1 January 2023.

But a new subsection (1a) has been added to section 5, and this new subsection specifies exceptions to the principles of section 5(1) as follows: The 2nd to 5th sentences of subsection 1 do not apply to employees with public health insurance.

Those employees must have a doctor determine their unfitness for work on the dates given in the 2nd to 4th sentences of subsection 1 and how long they are likely to be off work for and issue a sick note in accordance with the 2nd to 4th sentences of subsection 1.

The 1st and 2nd sentences do not apply to: 1.

Part-time workers in private households (section 8a of the German Social Code, Volume 4) 2.

Sick notes provided by doctors who do not work within the public health insurance system.

This addition to section 5 of the Act is accompanied by various social insurance rules: Under the existing section 295(1) 1st sentence, no. 1 of the German Social Code, Volume 5, doctors who work within the public health insurance system have to record the details of unfitness for work and send them to the public health insurers.

Under the new version of section 109 of the German Social Code, Volume 4, also coming into force on 1 January 2023, after receiving those details from the doctor, the public health insurers will then produce a notification for the employer to call up.

This will include in particular the employee’s name, start and end dates of unfitness for work, the date of the sick note, whether it is the first or a follow-on notification, and whether there are any indications the unfitness for work is due to an accident at work or another accident or to the consequences of an accident at work or another accident (new section 109(1) German Social Code, Volume 4).

If the public health insurer discovers, based on the diagnosis information in the sick note and other data it has, that an employer’s continued pay for sickness will run out since the employee has deductible previous periods of sickness, it notifies the employer concerned, giving details of relevant previous periods of sickness (new section 109(2) German Social Code, Volume 4)."
Noerr,The new digital sick note,"This means the new rules on electronic transmission of data on unfitness for work from the doctor to the public health insurer to the employer only apply if an employee has public health insurance, their unfitness for work is certified by a doctor working within the public health insurance system and the employee does not want to claim continued pay as a part-time worker in a private household.

However, in all other cases the old law remains in place, in other words the duty to hand in a printed sick note in accordance with the 2nd to 5th sentences of section 5(1) of the Act.

This covers, in particular, employees with private health insurance, part-time workers in private households or those with a sick note from a private-sector doctor (one who does not work in the public health insurance system).

Despite the change in law, employees still have to notify their employer in accordance with the 1st sentence of section 5(1) of the Act.

That means in future an employee still has to proactively tell their employer on the first day of sickness that they are unfit for work and how long they expect to be off work for.

Aim of the new law The aim of the digital sick note is to reduce the administrative burden on employers and employees.

According to the rules in section 109 German Social Code, Volume 4, the public health insurer, after receiving a sick note for a publicly insured employee, is to provide the employer with the details previously recorded in the printed sick note for retrieval by the employer.

The intention is that as a result of this digital procedure, publicly insured employees will no longer have to hand in a printed sick note.

In future, rather than handing in a printed sick note, according to the 2nd sentence of section 5(1a) of the Act, if relevant, employees will only have to consult a doctor on the dates mentioned in the 2nd to 4th sentences of section 5(1), have the doctor declare that the employee is unfit for work and for approximately how long, and get a properly issued, i.e. especially printed, sick note according to the 2nd to 4th sentences of section 5(1).

Thus the employee can keep the printed note as legally intended evidence of high probative value, as the case law concedes, so that if there are any glitches (such as the electronic transmission failing) the employee can prove their unfitness for work, in order to qualify for continued payment under section 3 of the Act.

The lawmakers specifically want to keep this printed sick note so employees can prove their unfitness for work to their employers until a suitable digital equivalent with the same high probative value is available.

At the same time, it should be reviewed at regular intervals whether the conditions are in place for eliminating public doctors’ duty to provide a printed note.

Putting the new rule in practice The new law has the following implications in daily practice: Employer retrieves data on unfitness for work Once a publicly insured employee has consulted a (public) doctor who has issued a sick note, an employer which has been told by the employee they are unfit for work can retrieve the related data from the relevant public health insurer within the scope of section 5(1a) of the Act.

In light of this, HR/payroll departments in particular should familiarise themselves with the technical requirements for retrieving details of unfitness for work.

When adapting existing IT systems to retrieve that data, there may be certain data privacy and co-determination rules to be complied with.

However, if the employer cannot retrieve the details of unfitness for work because of a glitch (such as technical issues at the doctor, health insurer or employer), the employee can prove they are unfit for work and for roughly how long using the printed note provided by the doctor."
Noerr,The new digital sick note,"Employer’s right to refuse performance As the law stands, the employer may refuse to continue to pay wages until the employee has presented the sick note required by section 5(1) of the Act (section 7(1)

no. 1 variant 1 of the Act).

Despite introducing the new section 5(1a) of the Act, the lawmakers have not extended this right to refuse performance to entitle the employer to refuse continue to pay wages until the employee has fulfilled the duties of section 5(1a) of the Act, in other words until a doctor has certified unfitness for work.

In doing so, the government has weakened the significance of section 7 of the Act to the detriment of employers.

It is doubtful whether a corresponding right to refuse performance can be agreed in an employment contract or collective/company agreement without a statutory basis.

Section 12 of the Act also forbids any deviation from the provisions of the Act and thus also from section 7(1) to the detriment of employees.

Ultimately, the employer initially bears the risk of the employee failing to fulfil their duties, even if the employer still has other options for response.

In particular, the employer can give the employee a warning if they fail to fulfil their duties under section 5(1a) of the Act.

If the employer also (justifiably) doubts whether the employee is actually unfit for work, it will initially refuse to continue to pay wages, stating that the conditions for entitlement in section 3(1) of the Act are not met.

But all this depends on the individual case.

Current rules in employment contracts or collective/company agreements Under section 5(1a) of the Act, an employee no longer has to hand in a printed sick note to their employer.

This appears to apply even if an employment contract or applicable collective/company agreement still refers to the previous legal situation and requires a printed sick note to be presented: Under section 5(1a) of the Act, placing an agreed, unrequested duty on the employee to present a sick note appears to clash with the legislative aim.

Only in the event of glitches, and only at the employer’s request, does the employee have to present a sick note.

Thus a corresponding provision in an employment contract or collective/company agreement will be in conflict with the law from 1 January 2023.

Corresponding provisions in employment contracts or collective/company agreements will thus probably have to be reinterpreted from 1 January 2023 due to this conflict.

In our view, there are good reasons for interpreting corresponding provisions to the effect that under section 5(1a) of the Act, the employee is required to consult a doctor and have their unfitness for work determined no later than on the day they are required to submit a sick note to the employer according to the arrangement in the employment contract or collective/company agreement referring to the previous legal situation.

This interpretation does not put employees at a disadvantage because they now have to do less than before: previously they had to first consult a doctor, have the doctor assess and certify their unfitness for work, and then, secondly, present the sick note to their employer, while now they only have to take the first step: have a doctor assess and certify their unfitness for work.

The same applies if an employment contract or a collective/company agreement stipulates that an employee must submit a sick note from the first, second or third day of being unfit to work due to sickness.

Section 5(1a) of the Act does not alter the employer’s right to demand proof of unfitness for work even before the fourth day off work.

Whether such contractual clauses make sense, however, always depends on the individual case in practice."
Noerr,The new digital sick note,"Whether such contractual clauses make sense, however, always depends on the individual case in practice.

In this context, employers should always bear in mind that employees who are obliged to present proof of unfitness for work from the first day are often absent for longer than employees who are allowed to be absent from work for one, two or three days due to sickness even without medical proof of being unfit for work.

Revising provisions, especially in employment contracts Even if in our view there is no immediate need to revise employment contracts or collective/company agreements entered into before 1 January 2023, although this has not yet been confirmed by case law, model employment contracts should be revised to reflect the new legal situation in the future.

Corresponding provisions, in particular in collective/company agreements, can be revised at the next opportunity to create clarity for all parties involved.

When revising the relevant clause, it should be made clear that the new provision in particular does not apply to employees with private health insurance.

Regardless of the contractual situation, however, employers should inform their employees in good time about the new legal situation regarding the continued payment of wages.

This also creates clarity and avoids misunderstandings.

Employers should focus on the HR/payroll department employees.

They need to be familiar with the legal framework and the technical communication with public health insurers from day one."
Noerr,Digital Services Act enters into force: new obligations for digital intermediary services,"The European Union will see fundamental changes to online regulation.

On 16 November 2022, the Digital Services Act (“ DSA ”) comes into force as Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.

It contains numerous new provisions and obligations for digital intermediary services.

These include liability rules for illegal content, a far-reaching system of tightened and new due diligence obligations as well as an effective enforcement regime.

Fines of up to 6% of worldwide annual turnover can be imposed by authorities in case of violations.

Providers of intermediary services must implement measures to comply with the obligations of the DSA by 17 February 2024 at the latest.

Given the scope of the requirements, this is not much time.

Companies are well advised to review whether and to what extent they are affected by the new obligations and reorganise compliance structures in good time , make the necessary changes to the services and adapt their terms and conditions.

Scope

The DSA applies to digital intermediary services.

These include internet access services (e.g. Telekom and Vodafone), social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), online marketplaces (e.g. eBay and Amazon) and search engines (e.g. Google and Bing) as well as all other access, caching and hosting providers.

Both large tech companies and also small and very small providers down to the individual commercial provider of a Wi-Fi hotspot are covered by the DSA.

Like the GDPR, the DSA only requires that the service is offered in the EU , regardless of where the provider is based.

Liability for illegal content On a practical level, it is very important to note that the DSA retains the liability privileges for online services introduced by the e-Commerce Directive (and the German Telemedia Act – TMG) in the event that users disseminate illegal content .

In principle, online services continue to not be liable if users distribute illegal content via their services.

Only once they become aware of illegal content, providers have to take action.

There is no general monitoring obligation .

The DSA supplements the liability rules with uniform procedural requirements for orders by authorities to act against illegal content or to provide user information.

Due diligence The key feature of the DSA is a number of due diligence obligations that digital intermediary services will have to follow.

These obligations impose duties to act on the providers, regardless of the question of liability for illegal third-party content.

In order to cover the specific risks of online services, the DSA relies on a system of obligations graduated according to the nature and size of the services : The most important requirements include obligations to offer points of contact for users and authorities and to set up a notice and action procedure for illegal content .

For online platforms, there are also specific procedural requirements for moderating content and compulsory complaint and dispute resolution mechanisms comparable to those required under the German Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG).

Last but not least, the DSA lays down wide-ranging requirements for the design of services such as rules on labelling online advertising, a prohibition of manipulative design elements (dark patterns) and measures to protect minors.

For trading platforms, additional monitoring obligations apply in order to curb online trade in illegal goods and services.

Particularly strict requirements apply to very large online platforms and search engines with at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU.

These very large services must examine the systemic risks of their services , for example with regard to the spread of harmful content and impact on elections, human rights or the mental health of users, and take measures to mitigate identified risks.

The risk assessment must be reviewed annually in an independent audit."
Noerr,Digital Services Act enters into force: new obligations for digital intermediary services,"The risk assessment must be reviewed annually in an independent audit.

Therefore, very large services will need a comprehensive ongoing risk and compliance management.

Enforcement and sanctions The DSA will not be a paper tiger .

The European legislator has given very strong importance to effective and uniform enforcement of the DSA .

Some of the numerous provisions on enforcement read like a direct answer to enforcement deficits of the GDPR.

Two of the most significant innovation are that the supervision of very large services is mostly centralized at the European Commission while authorities of the Member State are given extensive rights and obligations to cooperate with each other.

The authorities are given a range of effective enforcement powers – including the blocking of services.

Companies in breach of the DSA obligations also face fines of up to 6% of their annual global turnover .

Furthermore, the DSA clarifies that not only authorities but also private-sector individuals and entities are entitled to legal recourse.

This continues the trend towards supplementary “ private enforcement ” of European legal acts, which significantly increases companies’ sanction and liability risks .

Private individuals or entities can also be represented by specialized associations and organizations even before legal action is taken.

Outlook It will be a few years before we will know for sure how authorities and courts apply the provisions of the DSA in practice.

However, it is already certain that digital intermediary services will be required to increase compliance efforts .

This is especially true for very large services.

Additionally, the very large services are not only required to fulfil far-reaching due diligence obligations, but also to do so as soon as four months after the European Commission designates them as a very large services by Commission decision – even if this date is before 17 February 2024.

Companies should determine now how they will have to change their internal structures , terms and conditions as well as the way their services are offered and initiate the corresponding processes .

Companies should also keep an eye on the other laws and legislative proposals by which the EU attempts to regulate the digital world and which are part of the Commission’s digital strategy .

These include the Data Governance Act and legislative proposals such as the Data Act and the AI Act .

In close relation to the DSA is its “sister regulation”, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) , which establishes specific competition rules for important platforms that act as gatekeepers in order to limit the market power of the large digital companies.

Detailed information on the DSA can be found in the book “ Das neue Recht der digitalen Dienste ” ( The New Law of Digital Services ), published by Torsten Kraul and edited by Marvin Bartels and Niklas Maamar, among others."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board (EDPB): New guidelines on lead supervisory authority make it necessary for companies to revise their documents,"The European Data Protection Board has recently published new guidelines on identifying the lead supervisory authority for public consultation .

In its new guidelines, the EDPB has made a significant about-turn in relation to the concept of a lead supervisory authority for joint controllers.

Although the changes only concern certain points, they will nonetheless be significant in practice.

Companies that process personal data as joint controllers with other companies should carefully review their joint controller agreements, internal privacy policies and data protection information to determine whether they comply with the new regulatory requirements: Background: Concept of lead supervisory authority under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the established Article 29 Working Party guidelines The GDPR provides that the supervisory authority of the main establishment or the single establishment of the company is the “lead supervisory authority” for a company’s cross-border processing activities .

According to what is known as the “one-stop shop” principle , the lead supervisory authority is the sole contact point of the company concerned for cross-border processing of personal data.

The designation of the lead supervisory authority is first of all relevant for the cooperation between supervisory authorities, for example, in dealing with complaints from data subjects as well as in public investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions against companies.

In practice, however, the designation of the lead supervisory authority also has considerable significance for companies, for example when formally or informally consulting the supervisory authority on cross-border data processing or when reporting cross-border personal data breaches .

Thus, normally, information on the lead supervisory authority can also be found in internal guidelines for dealing with data protection incidents .

The identification of the lead supervisory authority can also be relevant for the drafting of data protection information , in which companies often specify the supervisory authority responsible for them.

Even before the GDPR came into force, the Article 29 Working Party at the time had, on 13 September 2016, adopted guidelines for designating the lead supervisory authority of a controller or processor .

As the successor to the Article 29 Working Party, the EDPB formally endorsed these guidelines on 25 May 2018 .

Specific changes to the application of the lead supervisory authority concept in the case of joint controllers Apart from some editorial changes, the EDPB has largely adopted unaltered the content of the existing Article 29 Working Party guidelines in its new guidelines for identifying the lead supervisory authority.

The EDPB does, however, reverse one point, which will be significant in practice: In their old guidelines , the supervisory authorities took the view that, in the case of cross-border processing activities, joint controllers should designate a common main establishment and thus a lead supervisory authority in order to benefit from the “one-stop shop” principle.

The EDPB has now revised this recommendation in its new guidelines by clarifying the notion of the main establishment: the concept of the main establishment and thus also of the lead supervisory authority now only applies to single controllers and cannot be extended to joint controllers .

According to the new guidelines, any main establishment and thus the lead supervisory authority can only be designated individually for each joint controller .

The main establishment of one joint controller cannot be considered the main establishment of all joint controllers.

As a result, any agreements to designate a lead supervisory authority in joint controller agreements will be ineffective."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board (EDPB): New guidelines on lead supervisory authority make it necessary for companies to revise their documents,"As a result, any agreements to designate a lead supervisory authority in joint controller agreements will be ineffective.

Public consultation and necessity for companies to revise documents The EDPB will continue to welcome feedback regarding its new guidelines until 2 December 2022 in the public consultation process , explicitly pointing out that the consultations do not cover all of the guidelines, but only the section on designating a lead supervisory authority in the case of joint controllership, the content of which has been updated.

Although, the possibility of the EDPB still making changes to its guidelines based on the feedback received during the consultation process cannot be excluded, such changes are usually of an editorial nature.

No major changes in content are to be expected.

Companies that process personal data as joint controllers with other companies should therefore begin now to take the EDPB’s amendments into account, especially as the published version of the guidelines reflects the common approach of the European supervisory authorities.

We particularly recommend using the EDPB’s publication of its guidelines as an opportunity to carefully review joint controller agreements , internal privacy policies on data protection and data protection information to determine whether they comply with the new regulatory requirements on designating the lead supervisory authority where there are joint controllers."
Noerr,ECJ expands standing to bring an action to EU vehicle type approvals,"In its judgment of 8 November 2022, Case C-873/19, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) considerably expanded the rights of environmental associations to bring actions as compared to current German practice and – in this case – extended them to include actions against EU vehicle type approvals.

The ECJ also emphasised the primacy of application of EU law, with the result that any restrictive provisions of German law (in this case section 42(2) German Code of Administrative Court Procedure – Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung as well as the German Environmental Legal Remedies Act – Umwelt-Rechtsbehelfsgesetz ) do not preclude the right to bring an action.

In this specific case, the Environmental Action Germany (Deutsche Umwelthilfe – DUH) brought an action against the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt – KBA) for its approval of a particular type of software used in diesel vehicles, which DUH considers to be an illegal defeat device within the meaning of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC)

No 715/2007.

The importance of such a lawsuit can hardly be overestimated.

If successful, it will overturn a type approval for specific vehicles, making it illegal to market or register them (Art.

50 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858) and possibly also to drive such vehicles even if they have already been registered (section 5 German Vehicle Registration Regulation – Fahrzeug-Zulassungsverordnung ).

Such an extensive right of action for the DUH was rejected by the Schleswig Administrative Court in a comparable case (ruling dated 13 December 2017, 3 A 26/17).

The German legislator also tried to prevent environmental organisations from bringing actions against EU type approvals when amending the Environmental Legal Remedies Act.

However, in view of recent case law of the ECJ (Case C-664/15 (Protect)), the Schleswig Administrative Court now considered itself obliged to make a referral to the ECJ.

Following this referral, the ECJ ruled in the judgment discussed here that it must be possible for an environmental association, which is in principle entitled to bring an action under national law, to challenge an EU type-approval.

The ECJ stated that this follows from Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention in conjunction with Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR).

The KBA’s granting of type approval was an act within the meaning of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, which may have constituted a violation of Article 5(2) of Regulation No 715/2007.

This provision was an environmental provision within the meaning of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention.

The court concluded by stating that Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, which is therefore applicable, in conjunction with Article 47 CFR, obliges to ""ensure effective judicial protection of the rights conferred by EU law, in particular the provisions of environmental law"" (para.

66 of the judgment).

Against this background, it is for the referring court to examine whether German law allows for an interpretation in conformity with Union law.

However, the ECJ goes one step further, probably also with a view to the intention of the German legislature.

It ultimately reads the provisions of the Aarhus Convention into the fundamental right under Article 47(1) CFR – with serious consequences: While the Aarhus Convention has no direct effect according to the ECJ’s case law, the fundamental right under Article 47(1) CFR most certainly does.

Within its scope of application, it manifestly enjoys primacy over conflicting national law.

If an interpretation in conformity with EU law is not possible, the primacy of application of Article 47(1) CFR applies, so that any conflicting provisions of German Law, esp.

within the German Code of Administrative Court Procedure or Environmental Legal Remedies Act, are to be disapplied."
Noerr,ECJ expands standing to bring an action to EU vehicle type approvals,"within the German Code of Administrative Court Procedure or Environmental Legal Remedies Act, are to be disapplied.

The result in this specific case is clear: environmental associations such as the DUH have standing to bring an action against EU type approvals.

Now the Schleswig Administrative Court will only have to clarify the dogmatic question of how it will implement the ECJ’s requirements, i.e. whether it will interpret German law in conformity with EU law or assume the primacy of application of EU law.

It will also have to hand down a substantive ruling on the legality of the defeat device challenged by the DUH; in this respect as well, the ECJ has remained committed to its narrow interpretation of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) 715/2007 in the judgment discussed.

This judgment is of particular interest from two points of view.

First, of course, because it extends the standing of environmental associations to bring actions against EU type approvals for vehicles if and to the extent that they violate environmental regulations.

In view of the extensive new environmental legislation that has been enacted in recent years, this new right of action is very broad.

Thus, it is not surprising that this ruling made the DUH euphoric.

Ultimately, however, the ECJ’s decision also brings the Aarhus Convention and the German Environmental Legal Remedies Act to the fore once again and draws attention to the fundamental rights of action of environmental associations, which go far beyond EU type approvals.

This sweeping right of action, in conjunction with the current goals of the increasing number of climate lawsuits, the trend of “climate litigation”, makes the second essential significance of this decision obvious.

Companies are therefore well advised to scrupulously comply with all environmental law requirements to prevent vulnerability to such actions."
Noerr,“Pay-and-forget” model finds its way into company pension schemes practice,"With the enactment in 2018 of the German Act to Strengthen Company Pensions ( Betriebsrentenstärkungsgesetz – BRSG), the legislature introduced the option of a pay-and-forget model (defined contribution plan consisting of “only” an obligation to pay contributions) in connection with company pension schemes (see section 1(2), no. 3 of the German Company Pensions Act ( Betriebsrentengesetz – BetrAVG)).

However, these options have remained largely unused.

After the company Uniper concluded an association-level collective bargaining agreement that introduced the so called “social partner model” for its employees, the first social partner model in company retirement benefits was introduced industry-wide a few days later.

This was agreed between the Mining, Chemical and Energy Workers‘ Union ( Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie und Energie – IGBCE) and the German Federation of Chemical Employers’ Associations ( Bundesarbeitgeberverband Chemie ‒ BAVC) ( Grünes Licht für Deutschlands erstes Branchen-Sozialpartnermodell (bavc.de) ).

It remains to be seen how employers and employees will respond to this social partner model.

At least from the employer's perspective, it offers a few attractive benefits.

Statutory provisions on the social partner model The main difference between the social partner model and previous forms of company pension schemes is that the liability of employers and their responsibility for employees' receiving the promised benefits have been strictly curtailed.

In the case of the social partner model, the employer’s commitment is limited solely to the payment of the agreed contributions to the respective pension insurer.

Neither the employer nor the pension insurer guarantees or is even permitted to guarantee that the subsequent benefit will be in a specific amount (section 22(1), sentence 2 of the Company Pensions Act).

This means that, after they have paid the respective contributions into the company pension scheme, employers no longer need to worry about the subsequent benefits (hence “pay and forget”).

In other words, the investment risk is borne by the employee alone.

Even though at first glance the social partner model appears attractive from the employer’s point of view, it took more than four years before the first employers in the chemical industry were actually given the opportunity to offer a social partner model.

This is because a contributions’ commitment under the social partner model can only be made through a collective bargaining agreement or through a works agreement based on a collective bargaining agreement.

Moreover, a social partner model can only be implemented through a pension fund, an occupational pension insurance or a direct life insurance; it can also be financed through deferred compensation.

For its introduction, a social partner model presupposes an agreement between the social partners, i.e. an employer or employers’ association on the one hand and a trade union on the other, which is why mere contribution company pension schemes are also referred to as the “social partner model”.

Accordingly, the social partners are allocated a central role in the case of the such company pension schemes.

The Company Pensions Act also requires the social partners to go beyond simply agreeing to provide company pension schemes in the form of a social partner model.

Instead it requires them to participate in implementing and managing the company pension scheme (section 21(1) of the Company Pensions Act).

In addition, the social partners are required, among other things, to agree upon payment of an additional amount to secure the mere contribution company pension schemes, which will be borne by the employer (section 23(1) of the Company Pensions Act)."
Noerr,“Pay-and-forget” model finds its way into company pension schemes practice,"Even if the obligation in section 23(1) of the Company Pensions Act is not mandatory, the trade unions in particular will, in practice, normally insist on an agreement of such kind so as to minimise the investment risk that employees have to bear.

Finally, the social partner model can also extend to employers and employees who are not bound by collective bargaining agreements.

If the pension provider handling the pension scheme agrees, employers and employees may include in individual employment contracts a clause with a dynamic reference to the “relevant provision of a collective bargaining agreement” (section 24 of the Company Pensions Act).

The mention of the “relevant” collective bargaining agreement means that reference can only be made to a collective bargaining agreement that is relevant in terms of its geographic scope, period of validity and the industry and employees covered, i.e. one that would anyway apply between the parties to the employment contract if they were bound by a collective bargaining agreement.

Significance for the chemical industry and options for taking action Just how successful the social partner model will be in practice will first become evident in the next few months.

For the more than 400,000 employees in the chemical industry, however, the social partner model ‒ which provides simply for an old-age pension and (under certain conditions) a survivor’s pension – can offer attractive retirement benefits because of the opportunities for higher returns.

By dispensing with the necessity for guarantees, the capital saved can be invested more broadly, thereby improving the chances of an increase in value.

In the chemical industry, the new social partner model is to be applied to all new hires as well as to all employees who claim collectively agreed retirement benefits for the first time.

This is, however, conditional on both sides being bound by the collective bargaining agreement or the relevant collective bargaining agreement provision having been effectively referenced.

It will also be possible to use the social partner model for salaried employees and executive staff.

Collectively agreed pension schemes that are already in existence will, in principle, continue unaltered on their existing terms.

Whether it will be possible, by way of exception, for current employees to change to the new model will need to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

In general, however, the protection of legitimate expectations principle and the proportionality principle will apply to enable current employees to join an existing collectively agreed pension scheme in order to participate in the social partner model through future contributions.

If an employee changes employers, section 4 of the Company Pensions Act also allows for the transfer of vested pension rights to the new employer and thus also the opportunity to change the type of the company pension scheme.

In this respect, section 4(3) of the Company Pensions Act provides that an employee may, within one year from the termination of their employment contract, require their former employer to transfer the transfer value (i.e. the value of the vested company pension entitlement acquired by the employee) to their new employer or to a pension insurer pursuant to section 22 of the Company Pensions Act of their new employer if the company pension scheme has been implemented through a pension fund, an occupational pension insurance or a direct life insurance policy and the transfer value does not exceed the contribution ceiling for the state pension scheme.

The reference to section 22 of the Company Pensions Act covers precisely the social partner model.

Thus an employee may transfer the capital accumulated in the previous company pension schemes of an old employer to a social partner plan.

The new employer may also draw the employee’s attention to this."
Noerr,“Pay-and-forget” model finds its way into company pension schemes practice,"The new employer may also draw the employee’s attention to this.

For those already employed in the chemical industry prior to 1 January 2022, there is thus the possibility, at least for those who change jobs, of also benefitting from the advantages of the social partner model.

Employers in the chemical industry who are bound by collective bargaining agreements as well as those who can bind themselves to the collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry by including in individual employment contracts a clause with a reference to the “relevant” collective bargaining agreements should therefore familiarise themselves with the social partner model in good time.

At the end of the day, any assessment of the social partner model will have to take into account the opportunities that it offers in terms of both its attractiveness for employers as well as for existing company pension schemes.

Would a social partner model also be suitable for other sectors?

The social partner model could also be an alternative to existing company pension schemes for employers outside the chemical industry since it would, on the one hand, lower their risks (liability) and, on the other, offer employees an attractive, opportunity-oriented company pension scheme.

As the new social partner models show, the negotiations that would have to be conducted with trade unions are unlikely to be insurmountable obstacles since the model offers advantages for employers as well as for employees.

At companies where there have not until now been any collective bargaining agreements in place, employers may, in view of the option of incorporating relevant collective bargaining agreements by reference, find negotiating with trade unions or company employee representatives worthwhile.

After all, social partner models can offer advantages for both employers and employees."
Noerr,Key issues paper on a modern immigration act,"German employers to be able to recruit staff from non-EU countries more easily in future Germany is experiencing a growing demand for skilled workers.

In order to tackle this shortage, there are plans to make labour migration for non-EU citizens easier and to attract qualified skilled workers to the German labour market.

The German government has now submitted a paper outlining the key points for a modern immigration act to the cabinet for approval.

Once the details have been drawn up, the act is expected to be adopted in spring 2023.

How does the paper intend to make recruiting non-EU citizens easier for German companies?

The new strategy is to be based on three pillars – the skilled-labour pillar, experience pillar and potential pillar.

Skilled-labour pillar (1st pillar)

The EU Blue Card, which is already granted to graduates of higher education institutions from abroad if they present an employment contract with an employer (based in Germany) promising gross annual earnings of currently €56,400 is to continue to exist.

The Federal Employment Agency does not have to be involved in the process, which speeds up the application procedure.

The privileged treatment when employing non-EU citizens in STEM professions, for which a lower salary is sufficient, is also to remain in place.

In addition, the intention is that skilled workers with a German vocational qualification or a foreign vocational qualification recognised in Germany will in future be able to obtain a residence permit allowing them to take up “suitable” employment.

What is new is that these skilled workers will no longer need higher education or professional qualifications that are “suitable” for a particular job in Germany.

Instead, they will be able to work in any occupation, regardless of what field they are qualified in.

The contents of their qualifications no longer have to match their intended employment.

A trained teacher will then also be able to work as a financial analyst or a chemist as an HR manager.

Experience pillar (2nd pillar)

The plan is that non-EU foreigners with at least two years’ professional experience and professional qualifications recognised in their home country should be able to obtain a residence permit more easily in future.

For IT workers, who already do not need recognised professional qualifications, the threshold for gross salary will be lowered in future (at the moment IT workers must have a gross yearly salary of at least €50,760).

They will also no longer have to prove their German language skills.

Potential pillar (3rd pillar) In future, it will also be possible for any foreigners who are interested in doing so to migrate to Germany with a “Chancenkarte” (opportunity card) in order to be able to look for a job here.

The criteria for acquiring an opportunity card will include a foreign (higher education) qualification, professional experience, language skills or a previous stay in Germany.

The specific requirements will only be finalised once the cabinet has approved the key issues paper in the subsequent legislative process.

Outlook

It is to be hoped that the specific features of these measures designed to simplify the immigration process will also lead to faster decisions being made by the authorities in practice during the application process.

A welcome development would be shorter procedures, especially bearing in mind that personnel planning often happens at short notice.

In view of the current staff shortages (also at the authorities handling the applications), a simplified process would certainly mean that things would be speeded up and administrative staff’s workloads would be reduced."
Noerr,German Federal Court of Justice: New ruling on a clause regarding remote deactivation of an e-car battery,"In a decision dated 26 October 2022 (Ref.

XII ZR 89/21), the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the validity of a clause regarding remotely deactivating car batteries that was included in the general terms and conditions of a lease and declared it invalid, at least in relation to consumers.

Facts In this case, a consumer protection association had sought injunctive relief against a French bank as the lessor of an e-car battery with regard to the use of a clause in its general terms and conditions.

Under the clause at issue, if the lease were terminated without notice for cause, the bank, as the lessor of an e-car battery, was allowed to remotely deactivate the charging function of the car battery.

The cars in question were not provided by the lessor but were purchased separately by the lessees.

Decision The Federal Court of Justice confirmed the legal opinion held by the lower courts, i.e. that the clause was invalid due to a breach of section 307(1) and (2) of the German Civil Code on the grounds stated below.

The clause constituted an unreasonable disadvantage to the lessee.

According to the Federal Court of Justice, the burden of securing further use of the leased property in the event of a valid lease was inadmissibly shifted to the lessee.

Moreover, a lessee who asserted a right to reduce or withhold lease payments would always be exposed to the risk that the lessor could terminate the lease and exercise its deactivation right.

The clause also deviated in an inadmissible way from the legal distribution of risk.

In principle, it was, in the Court’s opinion, the lessor’s risk that the leased property would continue to be used without permission after the expiry of the lease term and would thus also be subject to wear and tear.

According to section 546a of the German Civil Code, in such a case, the lessor could demand compensation from the lessee or require a deposit at the beginning of the contractual relationship.

The Federal Court of Justice argued further that the bank’s ability to unilaterally access and deactivate the battery constituted an unjustified disadvantage for the lessee, in particular if the e-car was acquired independently of the battery rental, as was the case here.

If the battery was prevented from being charged, the e-vehicle, i.e. a much more valuable asset for the customer, would generally also become unusable.

The background was that the battery was manufacturer-specific and linked to the e-vehicle, which generally gave the lessee no reasonable option to replace the deactivated battery with another make in order to be able to continue operating the e-car.

Conclusion/Outlook The Federal Court of Justice rejected the lessor’s understandable desire to protect itself from unauthorised use of an e-car battery after a lease ends.

Even lessors that are technically able to prevent unauthorised use will continue to have only the “established” options of asserting a compensation claim or including a clause requiring a deposit in the lease."
Noerr,Antitrust Leniency Notice: Guidelines from the European Commission,"The European Commission recently published guidelines in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document regarding its Leniency Notice (see here ).

Companies involved in a secret cartel that disclose their activities to the European Commission and hand over evidence can benefit from either total immunity from or a reduction of fines under the Leniency Notice.

The guidelines offer companies further options to engage with the European Commission while remaining anonymous and to discuss whether the conduct they are considering disclosing would entitle them to the benefits of the Leniency Notice.

Key provisions of the Leniency Notice remain unchanged The key provisions of the Leniency Notice remain unchanged: Immunity from fines:

The first company to notify the European Commission of its participation in a cartel and to provide evidence that enables the European Commission to conduct an inspection or identify a cartel may apply for full immunity from fines.

Reduction of fines: Each following company is eligible to have their fines reduced by up to 50% if they disclose their involvement in the cartel and provide evidence that has significant added value compared to the evidence already held by the European Commission.

Further Conditions: The conditions for immunity from or reduction of fines also include that the company cooperates with the Commission promptly, continuously and to the fullest extent.

In addition, any participation in the cartel must cease, and evidence of the cartel must not be destroyed, falsified or suppressed.

Guidelines provide more clarity on important issues The guidelines aim at making the outcome of a leniency application more predictable for companies by introducing the following features: Informal Advice: The guidelines refer to specific Leniency Officers at the European Commission to whom undertakings and, in particular, their lawyers may turn for informal guidance on the Leniency Notice or on a leniency application.

Anonymous Communication: The European Commission indicates its willingness to engage in an anonymous exchange of information on possible leniency applications without requiring disclosure of the cartel participants, their scope of activities or other details that could make it possible to identify the cartel.

This guidance and communication may help to eliminate uncertainties as to whether particular novel types of conduct even constitute a cartel covered by the Leniency Notice and to what extent a company may benefit from a leniency application in such a case.

The guidelines also aim at facilitating procedural aspects of leniency applications.

To this end, the European Commission has updated its eLeniency platform that companies can use for leniency applications: Faster Access: The new version of eLeniency enables the European Commission to provide participating companies rapid access to documents that would otherwise only be accessible at the Commission’s premises.

Faster Notification: The new version also affords the European Commission the possibility to notify the companies involved of decisions and similar ordinances and documents in the course of the leniency proceedings without delay.

This may concern, for example, letters granting a marker, requests for information or “no-action” letters.

Finally, the guidelines contain a large number of clarifications in respect to definitions and further advice on the applicability of the Leniency Notice, the possible benefits for companies and the corresponding legal protection.

Consequences in Practice The European Commission’s guidelines illustrate the importance of internal compliance measures, as did the German Federal Cartel Office’s guidelines on its Leniency Notice from last year (see our news article here ).

The guidelines help to further increase the predictability of the outcome of a leniency application and further facilitate filing a leniency application."
Noerr,Antitrust Leniency Notice: Guidelines from the European Commission,"The guidelines help to further increase the predictability of the outcome of a leniency application and further facilitate filing a leniency application.

Overall, the guidelines may incentivize more companies to seek guidance from the Commission on past conduct and file for leniency sooner.

Accordingly, companies are well advised to establish adequate internal measures to detect potential cartel infringements."
Noerr,The Digital Markets Act is here: What is it all about?,"On 1 November 2022, the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) enters into force.

Together with the Digital Services Act, the DMA is one of the key elements of the EU’s digital strategy.

The DMA aims to ensure the contestability and fairness of markets in the digital sector, to promote innovation and to better protect consumers.

The DMA establishes a set of criteria allowing it to identify certain large online platforms as so called “gatekeepers”, and assigns them rules of conduct (do’s and don’ts).

Gatekeepers are companies providing core platform services that allow business users essential access to end users.

The DMA defines in total ten core platform services, such as online search engines (e.g. Google), operating systems (e.g. Microsoft), web browsers (e.g. Chrome), virtual assistants (e.g. Alexa) and online social network services (e.g. Facebook).

The Gatekeeper must also have a certain impact on the internal market which is measured by its turnover.

Further, the core platform services the gatekeeper offers must be an important gateway for users which is generally measured on the basis of monthly active users.

At the heart of the DMA are a list of obligations aimed at ensuring that gatekeepers do not unfairly undermine the contestability of core platform services.

The DMA lays down directly applicable obligations and prohibitions as well as obligations that can be defined in more detail in the future.

These rules of conduct or do’s and don’ts are bolstered by the compliance, monitoring and reporting duties to which gatekeepers are subject.

The DMA empowers the European Commission to supplement the list of gatekeepers' obligations so as to keep obligations up to date.

In addition, the European Commission may initiate a market investigation if it wishes to (i) designate a company as a gatekeeper outside its regular procedure for doing so, (ii) investigate systematic non-compliance with the obligations or (iii) include new core platform services in the scope of the DMA.

In addition to conferring far-reaching investigative, inspection and decision-making powers on the European Commission, the DMA provides for the imposition of penalties (e.g. fines of up to 20% of worldwide turnover as well as behavioural and even structural remedies) in order to ensure its effectiveness.

The European Commission has the sole competence to decide whether to designate a company as a gatekeeper, and to enforce the DMA.

The national competition authorities are required to coordinate with the European Commission and may initiate investigations into a gatekeeper or potential breaches of the DMA obligations in the relevant Member State.

Nevertheless, only the European Commission has the competence to take decisions.

National courts applying the DMA, must not render a decision which runs counter to a decision adopted by the European Commission under the DMA.

The DMA gives third parties a number of rights of participation and indirect means of redress that can be asserted before the European Commission, national competition authorities and national courts.

The rules of the DMA will begin to apply six months after its entry into force, i.e. as from May 2023.

The DMA is highly ambitious project that will put the existing business models of the large tech companies to the test.

However, the crucial question is whether the European Commission will have the capacity and resources to effectively enforce the DMA - existing resources of the Directorate-General for Competition and the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology are being allocated, in addition, new staff will be recruited and a new Chief Technology Officer will oversee enforcement."
Noerr,Romania: Latest changes to Romanian R&D over-deduction rules – follow up,"As per our newsletter published in early October 2022, the norms on deductions for research and development expenses when calculating taxable income for profit tax purposes were amended by Order no. 3265/21453/2022.

According to Order no. 3265/21453/2022, a National Register of Experts must be established to certify research and development activities.

Now, the Ministers of Finance and of Research, Innovation and Digitization have issued and published in Official Gazette no. 1051/31.10.2022, Order no.

21578/2022 to approve the founding of the National Register of Experts for certification of research and development activity (REXCD), the selection methodology for the Body of Experts and the Methodological Norms regarding expertise for the certification of research and development activities (the “ Order ”).

Thus, the fiscal incentive has become fully applicable for companies.

We would like to remind you that companies have the option of requesting certification of their activities by an expert registered in the National Register of Experts.

Large taxpayers are obliged to request certification of their research and development activity.

The main stages of certification of research and development activities are: 1.

Stage I – The company requests an expertise to certify its research and development activities by submitting a written request to the competent authority; 2. Stage II – An expert from REXCD is appointed to carry out the expertise – the expert is appointed by the competent body by 15 days after submission of the request under stage I; 3. Stage III – The expert and the company sign the expertise contract for certification – models of relevant documentation are provided in the Order.

The Order provides for indicative fees and working hours to set the price of the expertise; 4. Stage IV – The expertise for certification is conducted and the expertise report and certification are drafted.

When the review process has been completed, the competent authority for research and development can initiate verification of it, with prior notification of the company and the expert, exclusively to detect possible procedural defects.

Noerr,Romania: HR processes in the era of artificial intelligence,"It is well known that technology is continually transforming the way we work.

More and more companies are using programs that involve artificial intelligence (AI) software in order to simplify and accelerate their decision-making processes and overall business activities.

One of the last areas to begin using AI is HR processes.

There is no debate over the positive impact of AI software in HR processes or how AI reshapes the manner in which companies manage such processes.

From recruitment, to measuring productivity and providing adequate training to employees, to overall employee participation within the company, AI is known for helping companies to streamline processes, cut time and costs and reduce (even unconscious) human biases.

The new legal framework on the horizon The use of AI software in HR processes may easily seem to be the “go-to” solution for employers.

However, any company that uses AI software knows that there is a thin line between being fully compliant and breaking the law, which means that there is a strong risk that a desire for innovation could trigger a compliance catastrophe.

Until now, employers have been required to primary observe GDPR requirements when using AI software in HR processes, but the situation will soon become more complicated.

A draft EU AI Regulation proposed by the European Commission in 2021 is currently the subject of political negotiations and is expected to be put to a plenary vote in late 2022 or early 2023.

The draft AI Regulation establishes a risk-based approach (unacceptable, high, limited and minimal) – the higher the risk, the stricter the rule.

HR technology systems and tools, i.e.: AI systems used for recruitment or selection of natural individuals - job ads, screening or filtering applications, assessment of candidates during interviews; AI systems used for taking decisions on promotion and termination of employment agreements, tasks allocation, performance and behaviour assessments, are considered high-risk AI systems.

This means that the use of AI systems in HR processes is permitted subject to (i) compliance with strict requirements regarding data quality, documentation and transparency, human supervision, robustness against cyberattacks, and (ii) a conformity assessment of the application.

The draft AI Regulation also provides for detrimental consequences for companies that fail to comply with the requirements – up to €30,000,000 or 6% of total worldwide annual turnover for the most serious infringements.

Given the above, it seems useful to compile a list of the main aspects that employers must take into account when implementing or using AI software in HR processes.

A. Preventing algorithmic biases and ensuring transparency Although AI software eliminates human bias, companies must be aware that such software can have an algorithmic bias.

AI software is based on algorithms, i.e. a set of instructions that are fed into computers to be used by the computers as a basis for decisions.

Thus, a biased algorithm (e.g. due to a faulty database or incorrect programming) may lead to indirect discrimination against candidates/employees.  

For example, in the case of recruitment, if the company usually hires men, the AI software is likely to filter out female applicants.

Employers making decisions based on AI software that has an algorithmic bias are exposed to penalties if candidates/employees file discrimination claims with the National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) or with a court of law, i.e. fines of up to RON 100,000 (€20,000).

In order to mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias, companies should take steps to be adequately informed about the AI software, meaning (i) discussing with the developers the data set and how the computer is to be trained to use the algorithms and (ii) testing the product to ensure that all the protected characteristics (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) are included in the training datasets."
Noerr,Romania: HR processes in the era of artificial intelligence,"Moreover, employers must be able to ensure traceability of the system’s operations so as to be able to explain, if necessary, to employees/candidates or even labour authorities how the AI software produced the result on which the HR decision was based.

B. Assess data protection risks AI software in HR processes involves a variety of big-data analyses that may trigger significant implications from a GDPR perspective.

Thus, employers that use AI software for HR processes must consider a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) in accordance with GDPR regulations, based on which it could consider taking measures such as: pseudonymization of personal data, if possible; ensuring transparency, i.e. ensuring that the individuals know how their data is being processed; informing candidates/employees regarding the manner in which their data is being processed.

C. Inform employees’ representatives or trade union

Employers have a general obligation to inform their employees on the elements of the employment relationship, as well as to consult with the employees’ representatives/trade union with respect to decisions which may substantially affect their rights and interests.

Moreover, companies have an information obligation regarding the processing of personal data under the GDPR.

Although there is no specific labour information obligation related to the use of AI software, using AI software in HR processes with respect to its own employees involves the aggregation of data which may affect the employees’ rights and interests.

Thus, in addition to a GPDR obligation, it could prove useful for companies to consult the employees’ representatives or trade union when implementing or using AI software in HR processes.

D. Train and ensure a human element Both the GDPR and the draft AI Regulation prohibit to use AI software for exclusively automated decisions.

Thus, it is of the utmost importance for companies to ensure that AI software is “supervised” by a human operator, most likely from the HR department.

In such a case, the employer should make sure that the human operator has the competence, training and authority to perform this task.

Thus, it is advisable for the employee to receive appropriate training so as to be able to carefully oversee the functioning of the AI software, correctly interpret the output and/or decide whether such output should be used, overridden or reversed.

Irrespective of whether the draft AI Regulation comes into force, employers intending to or using AI software in HR processes should see the proposal as an opportunity to carefully assess the opportunities and risks of such software and adapt their practices accordingly."
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: government guidance on complaint procedure,"The German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für

Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle – the “ BAFA ”) has published Guidance and additional Information on complaint procedures on the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – the “ Supply Chain Act ”).

An appropriate and effective complaint procedure is a core element of the due diligence obligations under the Supply Chain Act.

Although companies subject to these obligations have broad discretionary powers and scope for action as to how they organise their complaint procedure, the BAFA has now explained when a complaint procedure fulfils the legal requirements in its opinion.

Please find a summary of selected topics below: Overview The guidance on complaint procedures uses the same structure already familiar from the guidance on risk analysis , regarding which we reported on 19 August 2022 .

In particular, the guidance contains a general section, requirements for the complaint procedure and help for practical implementation.

The guidance also explains how companies can review the effectiveness of their complaint procedure.

Target groups

The BAFA considers an appropriate complaint procedure to be a key element of the due diligence obligations.

Thus, in principle, according to the Supply Chain Act, any individual should in general be able to submit a relevant complaint to a company.

According to the guidance, companies can choose a risk-based approach and concentrate on the most important target groups of the complaint procedure.

The most important target groups will be individuals in a company’s own business area or its supply chain who are potentially affected by human rights or environmental violations.

These could include the company’s own employees, employees of direct or indirect suppliers or residents living around local sites.

A company must identify members of this target group by means of the risk assessment required under the Supply Chain Act.

This reveals once again the Supply Chain Act ’s new risk perspective, on which we have already reported.

Accessibility The complaint procedure must be accessible to the enterprise’s most important target groups.

Companies are well advised not to underestimate this criterion.

This applies in particular if the company is considering supplementing its existing complaint procedure or using procedures offered by external providers.

Vulnerable groups : First, there could be various groups for whom access could be hindered by various barriers.

Besides groups that immediately come to mind such as people with physical or mental disabilities, children and illiterate people, the guidance also mentions other groups as examples, particularly indigenous groups, migrant workers, religious minorities and people with different sexual orientations.

Complaint channels : In the opinion of the BAFA, various barriers to access can make it necessary to set up several complaint channels, for example a telephone hotline, online forms and local contact persons.

Discussion among legal scholars as to whether a company is obliged to have more than one complaint channel available has not reached a consensus.

In any case, the Supply Chain Act does not expressly require this.

Languages/depictions : It may also be necessary to offer a complaint procedure in more than one language.

In the opinion of the BAFA, companies should include languages common in the country.

Compensation for an inability to read or write could take the form of illustrated/graphic posters at locations particularly often frequented by the target groups.

However, no guidance is given on how to identify such places.

The question also arises as to how companies should actually implement this outside their own area of business.

Awareness :

The BAFA also recommends that companies should proactively publicize their complaint procedure."
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: government guidance on complaint procedure,"Awareness :

The BAFA also recommends that companies should proactively publicize their complaint procedure.

This is to be accomplished by means of clearly communicated information on the company’s website or a website specially set up for the purpose and, for example, providing regular information to and training sessions for target groups.

Costs : The guidance does not unambiguously clarify whether the complaint procedure can incur costs.

On the one hand, the guidance mentions that information is to be provided on possible costs.

On the other hand, the guidance refers to access free of charge and the fact that the complaint procedure will not serve its purpose if some people cannot use it due to the costs entailed.

Thus, a complaint procedure free of charge fulfils the requirements of the BAFA in any case.

Rules of procedure The guidance also deals with rules of procedure (section 8(2) of the Supply Chain Act).

Unfortunately, the guidance only sketches individual elements, some of which were already familiar from the explanatory memorandum to the Supply Chain Act.

The guidance states that existing rules of procedure drawn up by industry initiatives provide inspiration for a company to draw up its own rules of procedure.

More orientation would have been desirable in this context, for example in the form of one or more specific examples.

It is new that companies are apparently expected to remain in continuous contact with the reporting person.

Accordingly, the rules of procedure are to designate the stage or time at which the person is to be informed of the progress made in investigating the complaint.

Even after the procedure has been concluded, the guidance states that it is advisable to remain in contact to ensure that the person filing the complaint is not at risk of retaliation.

The guidance does not set any time limit.

Effectiveness According to the BAFA, a complaint procedure is effective if all target groups are familiar with it, if it is considered trustworthy and if it enables and encourages target groups to submit information or complaints even before a violation of obligation has occurred.

Companies are to refer to key performance indicators (KPIs) to determine whether their complaint procedure is effective.

In practice, the challenge is precisely to define suitable KPIs.

Although the guidance gives examples of KPIs, for example  the number of complaints or the satisfaction of those who submitted a complaint, whether these KPIs are suitable to reliably gauge the designated effectiveness requirements can at least be questioned.

Time is short Companies for which the Supply Chain Act applies as of 1 January 2023 should make sure they set up a complaint procedure according to the Supply Chain Act as soon as possible if they haven’t already done so.

The guidance points out that these must have a complaint procedure available as of 1 January 2023.

Companies for which the Supply Chain Act will not be applicable until 1 January 2024 will still have slightly more than one year.

It cannot be denied that there is a certain amount of circular reasoning here.

In the opinion of the BAFA, companies need not have conducted the first risk assessment by 1 January 2023.

This begs the question as to why a complaint procedure must be available as early as 1 January 2023 although its most important target groups will only be ascertained later in the course of the risk assessment.

Thus, it would be desirable for the BAFA to give companies the option of setting up their complaint procedures during the course of 2023 after a thorough risk analysis.

This is all the more important due to the fact that the target groups are to be consulted on how the complaint procedures are designed.

We will continue to keep you updated."
Noerr,Next step following implementation of the First German Sanctions Enforcement Act: draft bill for a Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act submitted,"On 28 May of this year, the First German Sanctions Enforcement Act ( erstes Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz - SDG I ) entered into force.

The new legislation was designed to allow for broader powers to investigate and to freeze assets when enforcing the EU’s sanctions against Russia in practice and to facilitate the exchange of information between different authorities.

The German Federal Ministry of Finance has now jointly put forward a draft bill for the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act ( zweites Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz - SDG II ) together with the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

The bill aims to bring structural improvements when enforcing sanctions and fighting money laundering in Germany.

I. Design of the new act The Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act is an omnibus act which on the one hand serves to modify a range of different German acts, including the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, Anti-Money Laundering Act, Banking Act and Securities Trading Act.

At the same time, the act contains the draft of a new Sanctions Enforcement Act ( Sanktionsdurchsetzungsgesetz - SanktDG-E ) which is to be introduced.

This new Act is to contain the main provisions regarding the new central authority (more on this below).

1.

Creating a central authority responsible for enforcing national sanctions at federal level The creation of this responsibility for exercising the investigative powers under section 9a onwards of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act ( Außenwirtschaftsgesetz - AWG ) (see in particular section 1 Sanctions Enforcement Act – SanktDG-E) at federal level is the key element of the draft act.

Considering how responsibilities are currently split up between diverse authorities at the level of the individual states, this is the only way to ensure that measures are coordinated and enforced uniformly throughout the country.

Leaving the responsibilities of the Federal Office for Economics and Export Control or the Bundesbank (the German central bank) unaffected, this new central authority is to be subordinated to the Federal Ministry of Finance in order to achieve synergy effects between the enforcement of sanctions and the fight against money laundering.

For reasons of efficiency, the unit will initially be affiliated to the Central Customs Authority, an existing authority.

Over the course of time, the plan is that it will be transferred to a newly established higher federal authority responsible for combatting financial crime.

2. Reporting requirement and creation of an administrative procedure for investigating assets of sanctioned persons The reporting requirement in section 23a Foreign Trade and Payments Act introduced as a result of the First German Sanctions Enforcement Act is modified by section 10 of the draft Sanctions Enforcement Act.

Only sanctioned persons themselves are required to report, and no longer logistics providers.

Sections 11 and 12 of the draft Sanctions Enforcement Act provide for the possibility of administrative procedures to identify domestically located funds or economic resources owned or controlled by listed persons or to identify owners or beneficial owners of known domestic assets.

According to section 14 of the draft Sanctions Enforcement Act, in this case a register will be set up containing details of sanctioned persons and assets controlled by these persons.

Information about such assets is also to be included where there are doubts about ownership or beneficial ownership.

This register will be publicly accessible on the central authority’s website.

3. Setting up a whistleblowing agency Based on the model of the EU whistleblowing unit, a unit responsible for receiving tip-offs by whistleblowers is to be set up at the new Central Authority for Sanctions Enforcement ( Zentralstelle für Sanktionsdurchsetzung )

(section 15 of the draft Sanctions Enforcement Act)."
Noerr,Next step following implementation of the First German Sanctions Enforcement Act: draft bill for a Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act submitted,"(section 15 of the draft Sanctions Enforcement Act).

It will be responsible for receiving tips from Germany or abroad on sanctions-related matters, checking their validity and initiating any measures to investigate the matter.

4. Possibility to appoint a special representative to monitor compliance with sanctions in companies If a legal entity or partnership breaches prohibitions on providing or transferring funds or if there are indications that it may breach them, the central authority will have the possibility to appoint a special representative (monitor) to supervise compliance with sanctions (section 9 draft Sanctions Enforcement Act).

5.

Transparency reports by notaries When legal transactions involving the incorporation of associations or legal structures subject to transparency requirements or amendments to such associations or structures are performed, it will no longer be the parties themselves who have to file the reports to the Transparency Register in the future, but notaries (see the new section 19c

Anti-Money Laundering Act).

6.

Real estate data linked to the Transparency Register In order to bridge the time until the joint land register database of the German states is up and running and to provide authorities and other parties subject to requirements with the possibility to assess the risks and inform themselves about which association is registered in which of the approximately 530 land registers in Germany, information on real estate owned by legal entities or partnerships will be accessible through the Transparency Register.

This is also intended to make company histories much easier to follow in the event of corporate changes.

7. Requirement of foreign organisations to file notifications regarding existing real property in Germany as well Foreign companies holding existing real estate are now also required to file notifications to the Transparency Register, not just when acquiring new properties.

8.

Introduction of a ban on cash purchases in real estate transactions Section 16a of the German Anti-Money Laundering Act ( Geldwäschegesetz - GwG ) states that the consideration due when acquiring real estate can only be remitted by means other than cash, cryptocurrencies or commodities.

By incorporating this provision, the German government has implemented its mission to introduce a ban on cash payments in real estate transactions within the framework of the Money Laundering Act, which was one of its main priorities.

9. Increased transparency for the concept of the deemed beneficial owner pursuant to section 3(2), fifth sentence German Anti-Money Laundering Act In the future, legal entities subject to notification requirements will have to justify why they are making use of the concept of the deemed beneficial owner.

They will have to state that either (1) no individual meets the requirements for a beneficial owner (“diversified holdings”) or (2) that the beneficial owner cannot be identified.

This is intended to avoid circumvention tactics and to enable the party subject to notification requirements to act in line with the risks in the more suspicious second case group.

10.

Making ownership and control structure overviews useable for authorities The Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act is intended to make the overviews showing ownership and control structures that are prepared by the Transparency Register during the procedure for reviewing discrepancy reports under section 23(3a)

German Anti-Money Laundering Act usable for authorities and parties subject to reporting requirements.

11.

Declarations regarding UN listings to be immediately applicable To avoid time gaps in the implementation of new listings by the United Nations, the Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act will declare them to be automatically applicable in Germany.

12."
Noerr,Next step following implementation of the First German Sanctions Enforcement Act: draft bill for a Second German Sanctions Enforcement Act submitted,"12.

Adjustment of rules regarding trustworthiness in the financial supervisory legislation In the future, a presumption of untrustworthiness is to apply to individuals, legal entities and partnerships that are themselves included in a EU sanctions list.

Different rules will apply to persons acting on behalf of sanctioned parties or representing their interests.

Such persons are to be considered untrustworthy only as a general rule, but it will be possible for them to clear themselves of this presumption.

This provision is intended to reflect the typical dangers posed by sanctions and is therefore structured in a similar way to strict liability, which applies regardless of fault.

II.

Outlook

Besides the measures provided in the draft act, other measures are also planned, including linking the registers on the assets of sanctioned persons to other registers, setting up and rolling out a new real estate transactions database in which information from notarisations of real estate transactions will be saved and other measures designed to prevent concealment of assets and to combat money laundering."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: New guidelines on personal data breach notification,"The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) recently published new guidelines on personal data breach notification under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for public consultation .

Companies should take these guidelines as an opportunity to review internal processes and policies for managing data protection incidents to determine whether they take into account the requirements of the European supervisory authorities.

Background:

Strict personal data breach notification obligations under the GDPR and established guidelines issued by the Article 29 Working Party

The GDPR requires companies to notify the competent supervisory authority of any personal data breaches without undue delay – if possible, within 72 hours .

Such notification is only not compulsory if the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to data subjects.

If the risks to data subjects are likely to be high, companies must also communicate the personal data breach to the data subjects .

Regardless of these risks and the resulting notification obligations, companies must document all personal data breaches internally.

Companies that do not comply with these obligations can be subject to official measures , fines and possibly even claims for damages asserted by data subjects.

Even before the GDPR came into force, the group then known as the Article 29 Working Party adopted guidelines on personal data breach notification on 3 October 2017 .

As the successor to the Article 29 Working Party, the EDPB formally endorsed these guidelines on 25 May 2018 .

Only some clarifications on notification obligations of companies not established in the EU Apart from editorial changes, the EDPB’s new guidelines on personal data breach notification largely repeat the content of the established Article 29 Working Party’s guidelines without revision.

Only in one section did the EDPB see a need for minor adjustments to clarify notification obligations of companies not established in the EU .

Companies that are not established in the EU but are subject to the applicability of the GDPR usually must appoint a representative in the EU .

However, according to the EDPB, the mere presence of such a representative in the EU does not trigger the “ one-stop-shop ” principle .

This principle gives companies established in several EU Member States the option, if necessary, to notify a single “lead supervisory authority” competent for them in the event of a personal data breach.

If a personal data breach affects individuals in several Member States, companies not established in the EU have to contact the competent supervisory authorities of each of these Member States.

Where individuals in Germany are affected by a personal data breach, companies not established in the EU must notify the supervisory authorities of each German federal state.

In practice, this can lead to enormous expenses for companies not established in the EU for notifying several different supervisory authorities of a personal data breach.

Unfortunately, some other questions regarding notification of personal data breaches that had not been conclusively clarified remain unclear in the new EDPB guidelines.

One such question that is often particularly relevant in practice is whether a company is released from the obligation to notify the competent supervisory authority if the risks involved are merely minor .

Such release is advocated, for example, by the Conference of the Independent Data Protection Authorities of Germany ( Datenschutzkonferenz ) in its brief paper on data protection risk.

Public consultation and companies’ possible need to revise processes and internal guidelines for managing data protection incidents"
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: New guidelines on personal data breach notification,"Public consultation and companies’ possible need to revise processes and internal guidelines for managing data protection incidents

The EDPB will continue to welcome feedback regarding its new guidelines in the public consultation process until 29 November 2022, explicitly pointing out that the consultation does not cover all of the guidelines, but rather only the section on notification obligations of companies not established in the EU, the content of which has been updated.

It cannot be ruled out that the EDPB will make changes to its guidelines based on the feedback in the consultation process.

However, these changes are usually only of an editorial nature.

Substantial changes to the content are not to be expected.

Companies not established in the EU that fall within the scope of the GDPR should therefore begin now to take the EDPB’s new clarifications into account when notifying authorities of personal data breaches, especially since the published version of the guidelines reflects the common line of the European supervisory authorities.

We also recommend that companies established in the EU take the guidelines now adopted by the EDPB as an opportunity to review processes and internal policies for managing data protection incidents to determine whether they take into account the requirements of the European supervisory authorities.

Practical emergency planning and resilient data breach management form the backbone of an effective preventive policy to avoid data protection litigation regarding official measures, fines and claims for damages by data subjects due to personal data breaches.

Effective and regularly tested processes for managing data protection incidents are essential for rapid management and timely notification of personal data breaches.

Internal data breach management policies are an essential component of robust data protection governance documentation , not least due to data protection accountability ."
Noerr,Romania: Significant amendments regarding employment relationships,"Law no.

53/2003 - Labour Code (the “ Labour Code ”) will be amended by Law no.

283/ 2022 for amending and supplementing Law no.

53/2003, as well as by Government Emergency Ordinance no.

57/2019 regarding the Administrative Code, which was published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, no. 1013 of 19.10.2022 (“ Law 283/ 2022 ”).

Law 283/2022 enters into force on 22 October 2022 and provides for a series of significant amendments regarding employment relationships that are based either on employment agreements or governed by special laws in the private or public sector.

Some of the most important amendments in respect of employment relationships based on employment agreements relate to the following matters: 1.

Additional information for candidates and employees In addition to the information currently provided by employers to candidates or employees, employers will have to inform them with respect to the following: a) if the employee does not have a fixed work location, whether the travel between different workplaces is covered or reimbursed by the employer; b) the means for paying the employee’s salary; c) conditions for performing and compensating overtime and organizing shifts, where applicable; d) the requirements related to the probation period; e) the benefits in cash or in kind to be granted (e.g., private health insurance, additional contributions to voluntary/ occupational pension schemes); f) the rights and conditions regarding the vocational training provided by the employer.

The aforementioned provisions must be also included in the employment agreement.

2. Limitation on the right to perform work under multiple employment agreements Employees continue to be entitled to perform work for different employers or for the same employer based on multiple employment agreements, however without the possibility of overlapping work schedules.

3.

Additional rights for employees who have been with the same employer for at least six months Employees with at least six-months of service with the same employer may request a transfer to a vacant position offering more favourable conditions.

The employer will have to provide the employee with a written answer (with reasons) within 30 days of the receipt of the employee’s request.

4. Individualised work schedule for all employees An individualised work schedule may also be established for a limited period of time, including for employees on carer’s leave.

If the employee requests an individualised work schedule, the employer will be obliged to respond in writing (giving reasons) within five business days of the receipt of such request.

Furthermore, if the individualised work schedule is of a limited duration, the employee will be entitled to return to the original work schedule: upon expiry of the agreed period; prior to the expiry of the agreed period, if the circumstances which led to the establishment of the individualised schedule have changed.

New days off for employees Employees will benefit from the following days-off: a) Five business days per year of carer’s leave, namely the leave granted if the employee has to offer care or personal support to a relative (child, mother, father, spouse) or an individual with whom they live in the same household and who has a serious medical condition.

Failure to observe this obligation may trigger an administrative fine of up to RON 8,000 (approx.

EUR 1,600).

b) Ten business days per year for unforeseen situations determined by a family emergency caused by illness or accident, which make the immediate presence of the employee indispensable.

Such days off work are granted provided that the employer was informed in advance and the employee makes up for the period of absence."
Noerr,Romania: Significant amendments regarding employment relationships,"Such days off work are granted provided that the employer was informed in advance and the employee makes up for the period of absence.

The manner in which the absence period is made up for will be established by an agreement between the employer and the employee; c) paternity leave in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 210/1999, irrespective of the period in which the employee’s activity has been carried out or the length of service.

Failure to observe this obligation may trigger an administrative fine of up to RON 8,000 (approx.

EUR 1,600).

Such days off are considered periods during which work was performed when computing the number of annual leave days.

6.

New rules regarding the Internal Regulation In addition to the current provisions, the Internal Regulation has to include the following: a) rules regarding the notice period; b) information related to the general policy on vocational training, if any exists.

The employer has to inform each employee regarding the provisions of the Internal Regulation on their first day of work and provide evidence of this.

The Internal Regulation may be communicated to the employee in paper or in electronic form, provided that, in the latter case, the document is accessible to the employee and can be stored and printed by them.

Noerr,Romania: Important amendments to the Companies Law and Trade Register legislation,"On 26 July 2022, Law

No 265/2022 regarding the Trade Register and the amendment and supplementation of other legal acts relating to the registration with the Trade Register (the “ Amendment Law ”), was published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, No 750 and introduced a significant number of amendments to the Companies Law

No 31/1990 (the “ Companies Law ”), as well as to other legislation which refers to Trade Register formalities.

The Amendment Law brings a series of changes to Trade Register formalities and the main activity of the Trade Register from a logistical and operational standpoint.

Regarding a few of the recent legal provisions implemented due to this Amendment Law, certain relevant aspects which should be noted in this respect are listed below: I. Amendments to the Companies Law (i)

The shareholder(s) of a limited liability company must pay at least 30% of the amount of its subscribed share capital not later than 3 (three) months from the date of registration at the Trade Register responsible for the company, but in any case prior to the commencement of any business operations by that company.

It is worth mentioning here that the difference of 70% of the subscribed share capital must be paid by the company’s founders: for cash contributions – within 12 (twelve) months from the date of registration of the limited liability company; and for contributions in kind – within a maximum of 2 (two) years from the date of registration.

(ii) The company's articles of incorporation will contain an additional clause in which its founders assume responsibility for meeting the conditions placed on founders of companies.

Previously, this requirement was met by issuing a separate affidavit in this respect; (iii) The articles of incorporation of joint stock companies must expressly specify, inter alia, the type of company (i.e., private or public) and also if there are any restrictions or limitations with respect to the further transfers of shares; (iv) Corporate resolutions approving certain share capital increases will enter into full legal effect only if and when they are actually implemented by the shareholders of the company within a period of 18 (eighteen) months as of their issuance date – the current legal provisions provide for an implementation period of only 12 (twelve) months; (v) Although the requirement for reserving the name of a future company has been retained under the Amendment Law, the actual filing of this document with the Trade Register when submitting the incorporation documents has been eliminated; (vi) The company’s acquisition of certain assets from its founders or shareholders (i.e., acquisition within a maximum of two years from its founding/authorization for operation), in exchange for an amount or other consideration representing at least 1/10 of the subscribed share capital of the company is to be registered based on the actual transfer deed and must be subsequently published in the Official Gazette of Romania.

II.

Amendments to Trade Register formalities (i)

The Amendment Law provides the legal foundation for establishing the Electronic Trade Register Bulletin.

The Electronic Trade Register Bulletin will be a nationwide electronic platform which will be organized and maintained by the National Trade Register Office and contains information such as: (a) Trade Register clerks’ resolutions and court decisions relating to various matters submitted to the Trade Register for approval and (b) other documents registered with the Trade Register that have to be registered on this electronic platform as per the applicable legal provisions.

(ii) The Amendment Law also introduces a new “ interconnection system of Trade Registries ” which will link the commercial registers of all EU Member States."
Noerr,Romania: Important amendments to the Companies Law and Trade Register legislation,"(ii) The Amendment Law also introduces a new “ interconnection system of Trade Registries ” which will link the commercial registers of all EU Member States.

This system is designed to facilitate access to the information available in the commercial registers of other EU Member States and will serve as a centralized database for the Romanian Trade Register.

More exactly, this interconnected system will make it possible for the Romanian Trade Register to access documents and information regarding the shareholders of Romania-based companies that are registered in other EU Member States.

(iii) Applicants will no longer be required to apply for approval from the General Secretariat of the Government if the company’s corporate name contains terms such as “ national ”, “ Romanian ”, “ institute ” or derivatives thereof – the Trade Register will verify this itself; (iv) Affidavits may be issued under private signatures; (v) Specimen signatures issued by the directors to be appointed will no longer be required.

From the perspective of the actual implementation, the provisions of the Amendment Law will enter into force as of 26 November 2022.

It should be noted that formalities commenced before the entry into force of the Amendment Law remain subject to the law in force on that date.

Noerr,Romania: Implications of the amendment to Romanian Companies Law No 31/1990 and the Trade Registry’s laws on establishing and operating companies,"Law

No 265/2022 on the Trade Registry and on the amendment and completion of other acts of law affecting the registration with the Trade Registry (“ Law No. 265/2022 ”) was published in the Romanian Official Gazette on 26 July 2022 and will enter into force on 26 November 2022.

The normative act introduces important changes to the legal regime of founding, operating and winding up companies in Romania, amending Companies Law

No 31/1990 (the “ Companies Law ”), including the Trade Registry laws, simplifying the formalities required for this purpose and reducing administrative burdens by ensuring efficient procedures adapted to globalisation and modern, digital trade registry services.

According to the explanatory memorandum of the draft bill, these amendments aim to simplify procedures, and it proposes a uniform approach to the process of registration with the Trade Registry, including standardising the procedures used by local Trade Registry offices.

In the context of the above, and until the publication of the Methodological Norms regarding the procedures at the Trade Registry, we will present and summarize the most relevant changes.

1.

One of the novelties that will have a significant impact on establishing limited liability companies concerns deferral of the full payment of the share capital .

According to the current provisions of the Companies Law, a limited liability company’s share capital must be fully paid in when the company is established, but in practice, the process of opening a bank account to transfer these amounts of money often involves excessive red tape due to cumbersome banking procedures.

“Know Your Customer” (KYC) bank policies, applicable when bank accounts are opened by individuals or entities, require banks to provide a complex set of documents and forms, and obtaining this documentation, especially for foreign entities, is usually a laborious and lengthy process.

The diversity of documents (in terms of form and information contained in the corporate statements issued by the competent foreign authorities), alongside with the occasional lack of flexibility of Romanian banks, make banking procedures longer in an excessive, unpredictable and impractical manner.

However, banking procedures remain unchanged for the time being, as they are governed by the policies established by the National Bank of Romania, but also by the banks' internal policies.

In this context, the legislative amendment allowing the full payment of share capital to be deferred is very welcome.

In concrete terms, it gives limited liability companies the option of paying in only 30% of the amount of the subscribed share capital within the first three months from the date of registration, provided that the company does not commence business until this amount of capital has been paid up.

The difference in share capital may be paid in (i) in the form of a cash contribution , within 12 months from the date of registration, and (ii) in the form of a contribution in kind , within a maximum of two years from the date of registration.

Basically, this deadline for postponing the payment of share capital for a maximum of three months supports legal entities for which the KYC procedure is more time-consuming but must be completed within this period.

For the reasons mentioned above, if the share capital is not completely paid in on the company’s registration date, we consider it appropriate to include in the articles of association the manner in which the share capital will be paid in.

General partnerships and limited partnerships remain obliged to pay in the full amount of the share capital subscribed on their founding date.

2. Another important change introduced by Law

No 265/2022 requires declaring the company’s beneficial owners, as well as the way in which they exercise control over the company, in the articles of association, where applicable, when provided by the law ."
Noerr,Romania: Implications of the amendment to Romanian Companies Law No 31/1990 and the Trade Registry’s laws on establishing and operating companies,"This provision covers all types of companies stipulated in the Companies Law.

In view of the provisions of Law No 129/2019 on preventing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as amending and supplementing certain regulatory acts (“ Law No 129/2019 ”), all private entities must have adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on their beneficial owner.

We consider the phrase “ where applicable, when provided by the law ” in the proposed form of the Companies Law to be ambiguous, as it is not clear what will apply when this provision is not mandatory.

At the same time, the new provision raises certain practical issues.

For example, if the beneficial owners are to be declared in the articles of association, it will have to be clarified who the signatories will be, taking into account that Law

No 129/2019 stipulates that designating beneficial owners is the sole responsibility of the directors.

Also, will the obligation to file the beneficial owner affidavit under Law

No 129/2019 still apply?

3.

From the perspective of simplifying Trade Registry procedures, we would like to mention that the requirement to issue certain documents, such as founders’ affidavits and directors’ specimen signatures, has been eliminated .

4. Another new element introduced by Law

No 265/2022 is that future directors expressly accept their mandate , regardless of the type of company, and that the first directors, members of the management or supervisory board are no longer required to submit affidavits upon submission of the company's founding file.

According to the current provisions of the Companies Law, express acceptance of the mandate is compulsory only for joint stock companies when they appoint a director or a member of the management or supervisory board.

According to the new provisions of the Companies Law, all representatives of the companies (regardless of the company’s legal form) will be obliged to expressly accept their mandates, which is tantamount to attesting to the fulfilment of the conditions imposed by Article 6 of the Companies Law and assuming responsibility for them.

In the context of eliminating the obligation for the first directors and members of the management or supervisory board to submit their affidavits with the submission of the file to establish the company, they will have to either (i) be signatories of the articles of association, together with the founding members, in order to accept their mandates and certify the fulfilment of the conditions of Article 6 of the Companies Law, or (ii) issue a separate declaration of acceptance of the mandate, but this would contradict the purpose of the new regulation.

For legal representatives of foreign natural persons/entities, an affidavit is currently required certifying that the person concerned is not registered for tax purposes in Romania, that he/she is not in debt to the Romanian state and that he/she has not committed any acts of the kind that are recorded in the tax record.

In the context of the new changes, it is unclear how this will be dealt with formally, since affidavits are no longer required.

One possibility could be to incorporate this affidavit into the articles of association to accommodate the new provisions or to keep the declaration as a separate document.

5. Another change eliminates the requirement that all shareholders of a limited liability company must vote on resolutions to amend the articles of association .

This amendment aims to avoid the bottlenecks that previously existed in limited liability companies.

Now, decisions will be taken by an absolute majority of members and shares unless the articles of association provide otherwise.

It also introduces a new penalty : a fine of RON 5,000 to RON 15,000 for joint-stock companies that do not comply with the obligation to maintain a register of shareholders as required by law."
Noerr,Romania: Implications of the amendment to Romanian Companies Law No 31/1990 and the Trade Registry’s laws on establishing and operating companies,"It also introduces a new penalty : a fine of RON 5,000 to RON 15,000 for joint-stock companies that do not comply with the obligation to maintain a register of shareholders as required by law.

With regard to company reorganisations, we note that the expected changes regarding the competence to pass resolutions regarding mergers and spin-offs have not been included in the Companies Law.

According to the draft bill’s explanatory memorandum, the intention is to extend the competence of the Trade Registry to the final settlement of mergers and spin-offs, i.e., to eliminate the competence of the courts.

Naturally, the new regulation should have included an amendment to the Companies Law for this purpose, although this aspect of competence is currently included only in the Methodological Norms on how to maintain the commercial registers, implement registrations and issue information.

Thus, it remains to be seen what provisions will be added to the new Methodological Norms on the change of jurisdiction in the case of mergers and spin-offs.

6.

By far one of the most anticipated changes brought by Law

No 265/2022 concerns the digitalisation of procedures at the Trade Registry .

This means that essential procedures in the work of the authority, such as setting up companies or registering new branches, will be able to take place entirely online.

This initiative, useful at first glance, leaves room for a number of practical questions, such as whether everyone interested in opening a company or a branch will have access to this platform, or whether it will be necessary to open an account and meet special conditions in addition to having a qualified electronic signature.

It also remains to be seen what significant advantages the online founding procedure will bring compared to the current procedure of electronic transmission of documents.

According to Law No 265/2022, in the procedure of online founding of companies , both the execution of the articles of association and the registration with the Trade Registry will take place entirely by electronic means.

The procedure makes it necessary to have a qualified electronic signature issued within the framework of an electronic identification system included in the list published by the European Commission as a means of electronic identification.

In order to further simplify the founding process, the online platform of the Trade Registry will provide users with model articles of association, which will contain a predefined set of essential clauses that can be completed online and signed with a qualified electronic signature.

Thus, a key advantage of the new procedure, especially for businesspeople who do not rely on professionals for these registrations, could be online filing by completing all the necessary documents and complying with the registration steps for each document until the online file is fully completed.

However, it is not clear whether the standard form will allow for new clauses to be inserted, or whether investors will have to choose from the existing predefined options, or whether subsequent updates to the articles of association will have to follow the same digital procedure.

Another novelty in the area of digitalisation introduced by Law

No 265/2022 is the introduction of a direct channel of communication and transmission of information between the trade registers of the Member States of the European Union.

To this end, the trade register kept by the ONRC will be part of the interconnected system of the trade registers of the Member States of the Union .

Thus, the Trade Registry will make documents and information on the professionals registered in its records available to the public, ensuring better transmission of this data throughout the European Union."
Noerr,Romania: Implications of the amendment to Romanian Companies Law No 31/1990 and the Trade Registry’s laws on establishing and operating companies,"It will also allow for free exchange of documents and information between the trade registers of the Member States of the European Union in the case of cross-border mergers and branches set up by companies established in a Member State.

7.

In order to ensure unified practice of the ONRC and of the court registry offices, Law No 265/2022 establishes the ONRC's Commission for Analysis and Unified Practice (the “Commission”) , which includes registrars and legal specialists to be chosen annually by the general manager of the ONRC.

The Commission will have the task of drawing up opinions on a variety of legal aspects of the activity of the Trade Registry, which will be brought to the attention of the structures within the ONRC and the territorial offices of the Trade Registry.

In actual practice over time at Trade Registry offices in various territorial districts, different requirements have often been set by different offices, giving rise to non-uniform practice, which leads to a lack of predictability and delays in working with the Trade Registry.

We consider it very appropriate to set up a body to be responsible for monitoring and optimising the offices’ practices by standardising them in a way that supports professionals in their cooperation with the authority.

In conclusion, Law No 265/2022 creates a modern and digitalised approach to the Trade Registry’s operations, but it also gives rise to many questions, the answers to which can only be a matter of conjecture at this point until the Methodological Norms are amended.

Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control publishes information leaflet on reporting obligation and questionnaire,"The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für

Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle – the “ BAFA ”) has published a leaflet and the announced questionnaire on the reporting obligation under the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ‒ the “ Supply Chain Act ”).

We reported on this on 19 August 2022 .

Overview The information leaflet and questionnaire set forth the information that must be reported under the Supply Chain Act and the formal requirements for doing so.

We have selected some of the important points and summarised them below: In addition to the extensive catalogue of questions, the 38-page leaflet contains a preface, a preamble with instructions on how to complete the questionnaire and an extensive glossary.

All in all, the leaflet does contain a few surprises.

Questionnaire

The questionnaire is divided into three sections: The first section requires a company subject to these obligations to enter its master data, such as the names of its authorised representatives, the number of its employees and a contact person.

The second section contains what is called a “short-form” reporting obligation.

In this section, the BAFA asks specific questions on the fulfilment of the due diligence obligations in the Supply Chain Act, including information on the monitoring of risk management, the risks identified and any breaches detected.

The company is allowed to only submit a short-form report if it provides plausible reason as to why it has not identified any risks or found any violations.

On the other hand, if a company has identified human rights or environmental risks or violations, it is obliged to complete the entire” questionnaire in the third section.

In this case, the company must provide comprehensive answers to questions on how it handles the individual due diligence obligations imposed by the Supply Chain Act.

If the BAFA considers the answers to be implausible, it will regard this as an important criterion for launching a more intensive audit.

First impressions The publication touches on fundamental topics that will need to be addressed in greater depth.

Self-incrimination: The questionnaire is designed such that a company subject to these obligations must state if and how it has complied with the due diligence obligations imposed by the Supply Chain Act.

It must therefore disclose in detail to the authority whether it has committed any administrative or criminal offences.

This is ‒ to say the least ‒ highly remarkable since as a matter of principle companies are not required to incriminate themselves.

As an example, once can take a look at the first question, which immediately illustrates the dilemma that companies will face :

In Question A1.1, the BAFA asks whether the company subject to these obligations has defined responsibility for monitoring risk management during the reporting period.

This refers to a statutory obligation (section 4(3), sentence 1 of the Supply Chain Act), which is subject to fines in the event of non-compliance (section 24(1), number 1 of the Supply Chain Act).

By answering “no”, the company would disclose that it has not complied with its due diligence obligation.

It is true that the preamble “instructs” companies as to their right to refuse to testify in the event of potentially self-incriminating statements.

But even a right to “refuse to testify” does not help companies escape their dilemma.

This is because the exercise of the right will obviously give the BAFA all the more reason to launch an investigation.

Mandatory use?

In light of the above, it will be necessary to clarify whether companies can be obliged to use this questionnaire and thereby in any event risk incriminating themselves.

Even after studying the Supply Chain Act and its explanatory memorandum, it is not apparent to us on what basis the use of the Federal Office questionnaire should be mandatory."
Noerr,German Supply Chain Act update: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control publishes information leaflet on reporting obligation and questionnaire,"Even after studying the Supply Chain Act and its explanatory memorandum, it is not apparent to us on what basis the use of the Federal Office questionnaire should be mandatory.

Pursuant to section 10(2) of the Supply Chain Act, a company is obliged to prepare an annual report on its fulfilment of the due diligence obligations and make the report publicly available.

Section 12 of the Supply Chain Act requires the company to submit the report electronically via an access provided by the BAFA.

From our perspective, there is a serious difference between the provision of an electronic interface and the imposition of specific requirements on the content of reporting.

“Resolution of open questions” addressed en passant: Without any discernible deeper analysis in the document, the BAFA clarifies statutory ambiguities with one stroke of a pen.

As an example, the direct supplier of a subsidiary belonging to the parent company’s own business operations will be treated as the direct supplier of the parent company.

In any event, this can hardly be reconciled with the definition of a direct supplier in section 2(7) of the Supply Chain Act.

It would have been at least desirable if the BAFA had explained its view somewhat more extensively rather than just in the glossary.

All in all, the publication of the BAFA raises numerous new questions and at least at first glance, seems to provide cold comfort to the companies within the scope of the Supply Chain Act.

We will continue to keep you updated."
Noerr,International data transfer: Transition period for old standard contractual clauses ends on 27 December 2022 - companies urgently need to review their contracts,"Following the “Schrems II” decision of the European Court of Justice (CJEU) of 16 July 2020, the European Commission adopted new standard contractual clauses for the transfer of international data on 4 June 2021.

The new standard contractual clauses have replaced the standard contractual clauses for controllers from 2001 and the standard contractual clauses for processors from 2010 , which had applied up until such time.

The Commission’s Implementing Decision on new standard contractual clauses , which came into force on 27 June 2021, provides for a three-month transition period during which companies were able to continue agreeing the previous standard contractual clauses.

Thus, since 27 September 2021, companies have been permitted to use only the new standard contractual clauses for new contracts.

The Commission’s decision also provides for an additional transition period of a further 15 months, during which old standard contractual clauses that have already been agreed will continue to apply under certain conditions.

This transition period will end on 27 December 2022.

We therefore strongly recommend that companies review their existing contracts with their service providers and other business partners as soon as possible in order to verify whether they still contain old standard contractual clauses.

Since the transition period for the change to the new standard contractual clauses will end soon, companies would be well advised to quickly take the steps needed to update their old contracts that are affected."
Noerr,A turning point in crypto regulation,"The Council of the European Union has approved the draft Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets ( MiCAR ) and has thus taken another decisive step towards creating a harmonised regulatory framework for crypto-assets across Europe.

In its meeting on 5 October 2022, the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States (COREPER) approved the draft, which had been materially further developed compared to the original version of 19 November 2021, clearing the way for a final vote by the European Parliament.

On 10 October 2022, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament approved the proposal.

A vote in the plenary of the European Parliament (first reading) is expected to take place shortly.

The new regulation could become applicable in early to mid-2024, subject to certain transitional provisions.

Objectives of MiCAR and summary of key points The details of the new regulation were discussed in interinstitutional negotiations between representatives of the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament.

The initial legislative proposal for MiCAR had been originally prepared and presented by the European Commission on 24 September 2020 as part of the Digital Finance Package.

The package included strategies for the digitalisation of the financial sector, a strategy for large-volume payments, as well as drafts of MiCAR and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

MiCAR aims to create a uniform EU-wide regulatory framework for crypto-assets, their issuers and certain service providers, as well as measures to protect investors and prevent market abuse.

In this respect, MiCAR will regulate both primary market activities (especially issuing crypto-assets) and secondary market services.

For these purposes, the current draft of MiCAR contains rules on transparency and disclosure obligations for the issuance of and trading in crypto-assets, an authorisation obligation and regulation of crypto-asset service providers and issuers of crypto-assets, conduct-of-business rules for crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers, investor and consumer protection regulations for the issuance, trading and custody of crypto-assets, as well as regulations to combat market abuse on crypto trading platforms.

Scope of MiCAR

The scope of MiCAR is primarily intended to cover fungible crypto-assets, which are not covered by currently applicable EU legislation on financial services, such as MiFID II.

Therefore, tokens that qualify as securities ( security tokens ) do not fall under the new regime, but will instead continue to be treated as securities.

MiCAR defines the term crypto-asset as “digital representations of a value or a right which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology”.

Unlike the definition of the corresponding term in the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ), it is not necessary that the crypto-asset be accepted as a means of exchange or payment or serve investment purposes.

Similarly, it is irrelevant whether the crypto-asset is issued or guaranteed by a central bank or public body and has the legal status of currency or money.

MiCAR further divides the term “crypto-asset” into the following three sub-categories : Asset-referenced tokens , which are tokens other than e-money tokens that purport to have a stable value by referencing another value or a right or a combination of both, including one or more official currencies; Electronic money tokens , which are tokens that purport to have a stable value by referencing the value of an official currency of a country issued by a central bank or other monetary authority.

These are tokens that primarily serve as a means of payment."
Noerr,A turning point in crypto regulation,"These are tokens that primarily serve as a means of payment.

They also include stable coins if their value is linked to a central bank currency such as the US dollar or the euro; and Utility tokens , which are tokens intended to provide access to a good or service supplied by the issuer of these tokens.

Unique and non-fungible crypto-assets , which includes, for example, digital art and collectibles, as well as crypto-assets that represent existing goods and services in the real economy, are to be expressly excluded from the scope of MiCAR.

As a consequence, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or utility tokens are largely excluded from the scope of MiCAR.

Although these types of crypto-assets could also be traded in market places and be accumulated speculatively, these crypto-assets are – as stated by the recitals of MiCAR – not readily interchangeable as their relative value cannot be ascertained due to their unique character, so that the risk emanating from these crypto-assets is limited.

However, MiCAR specifies an exception for the issuance of fractional parts of unique and non-fungible crypto-assets: The issuance of crypto-assets as non-fungible tokens in a large series or collection shall be considered as an indicator of their fungibility.

Thereby, MiCAR qualifies certain NFTs divided into fractional parts as crypto-assets falling in the scope of MiCAR, however, without further defining the terms “series” or “collection”.

In terms of timing, MiCAR will give market participants time to adapt to the new regulations.

In principle, MiCAR will not be applicable until 18 months after entering into force , although the provisions on asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens will already apply 12 months after MiCAR comes into force.

In addition, MiCAR stipulates generous transitional provisions that postpone in particular the applicability of the newly introduced authorisation requirements by up to another 18 months.

However, Member States can deviate from this timeline and individually provide for an earlier applicability (see Article 123 MiCAR).

New authorisation obligations The central element of MiCAR is the new authorisation requirement for issuers and offerors of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens as well as for offerors of certain crypto-asset-related services.

In addition, MiCAR provides for certain conduct-of-business rules for issuers and offerors of crypto-assets as well as for offerors of crypto-asset-related services.

Authorisation requirement for issuers and offerors For the purpose of the authorisation requirements, MiCAR distinguishes between the issuer of crypto-assets, i.e. the natural or legal person or other undertaking that issues the crypto-assets, and the offeror of crypto-assets, i.e. the natural or legal person, or other undertaking or the issuer, that offers crypto-assets to the public.

Once MiCAR comes into force, asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens will no longer be allowed to be issued or offered in the EU without the corresponding authorisation of the competent authority .

Requirements for issuing and offering asset-referenced tokens Issuers of asset-referenced tokens must have been established in the EU and have sufficient own funds and reserve assets.

The latter requirements were significantly tightened during the interinstitutional negotiations.

There is an exemption from the authorisation requirement for the issuance of asset-referenced tokens by credit institutions .

These issuers are only obliged to prepare and submit a white paper for approval.

In addition, MiCAR provides exemptions from the authorisation requirement if a certain outstanding value of the issued asset-referenced tokens is not exceeded or if the offer of crypto-assets is only addressed to qualified investors."
Noerr,A turning point in crypto regulation,"Contrary to all efforts by crypto lobbying organisations, MiCAR introduces a cap on the issuance of asset-referenced tokens by an issuer if trading in the relevant token exceeds 1 million transactions or EUR 200 million in trading volume per day .

However, as the cap only applies to asset-referenced tokens, stable coins that are linked to the euro (e-money tokens) are not covered by the provision.

This could possibly increase the number of stable coins linked to the euro in the long term.

E-money tokens E-money tokens can only be issued by credit institutions and e-money institutions .

Furthermore, e-money tokens issued by these issuers must meet certain additional requirements regarding the issuance and redeemability of e-money under the E-Money Directive .

A new requirement introduced in the course of the interinstitutional negotiations is the obligation of the offeror of e-money tokens to notify the issuance of the e-money tokens to the competent authority 40 working days in advance.

Significant crypto-assets In addition, EBA may under certain circumstances classify individual asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens as significant , which results in stricter regulatory requirements applying to such tokens.

For asset-referenced tokens, this is the case, for example, if the number of holders has exceeded the threshold of 10 million , the market capitalisation of the crypto-asset is higher than EUR 5 billion or the number of transactions with this crypto-asset has exceeded 2.5 million or EUR 500 million respectively per day.

In addition, certain issuers may voluntarily apply with the competent authority for a classification of their asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens as significant.

Authorisation requirement for offerors of certain services In future, offerors of certain services in connection with crypto-assets will also require an authorisation from the competent authority.

The relevant crypto-asset services covered by MiCAR are similar to those services that require an authorisation under existing German banking regulatory law, which is in particular due to the broad definition of “financial instruments” there.

The relevant services under MiCAR include: custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of third parties, operating a trading platform for crypto-assets, exchanging crypto-assets for funds, exchanging crypto-assets for other crypto-assets, executing crypto-asset orders on behalf of third parties, placing crypto-assets, providing transfer services for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties, receiving and transmitting crypto-asset orders on behalf of third parties, providing advice on crypto-assets; and providing portfolio management on crypto-assets.

Credit institutions are exempt from the authorisation requirement when providing crypto-asset services if they notify their competent national authority of the intended activity in advance.

For investment services companies, MiCAR stipulates facilitations with regard to crypto-asset services that correspond to those for which they have already been granted a corresponding authorisation under MiFID II or the respective national regulatory provisions.

EU passporting and reverse solicitation Comparable with the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ) and the German Securities Institutions Act ( Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz ), MiCAR allows the provision of cross-border crypto-asset services in other EU Member States, so that the offeror of crypto-asset services does not have to apply for a separate authorisation in each Member State where it offers its services.

For this purpose, the offeror must notify the competent authority in its home Member State of the intended activity.

Upon entry in a register kept with ESMA and EBA and the notification of the crypto-asset service offeror, the offeror may operate in the respective host Member State."
Noerr,A turning point in crypto regulation,"Upon entry in a register kept with ESMA and EBA and the notification of the crypto-asset service offeror, the offeror may operate in the respective host Member State.

In this context, it is worth mentioning that MiCAR makes no distinction in regulatory requirements between cross-border activities and the establishment of a branch, as is usual for banking and financial services.

Comparable with the currently existing authorisation requirements under German banking regulatory law, offerors of crypto-asset services may make use of the so-called reverse solicitation exception from the authorisation requirement, which allows to provide crypto-asset services in other EU Member States without authorisation if an EU-based client initiates at its own exclusive initiative the provision of a crypto-asset service or activity by a third‐country firm.

Obligation to prepare a white paper Based on the provisions of the EU Prospectus Regulation with regard to the public offering and admission of securities to the regulated market, MiCAR provides for certain publication obligations.

These depend on the type of crypto-asset being offered.

White paper for issuing crypto-assets For crypto-assets that are not asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens , there is an obligation to prepare a white paper for a public offering and admission to trading on a trading platform.

The white paper must also be registered with the competent national authority and published on the website of the issuer or admission applicant.

No approval of the white paper by the national authority is required.

The authority of the Member State in which the crypto-assets are to be marketed or admitted to a trading platform is responsible for registering the white papers.

The required content of the white paper has been scaled down considerably in the course of the interinstitutional negotiations.

For example, instead of a “detailed description” of the main risks, the white paper now only has to provide “information on risks”, and instead of a “detailed description” of the offeror, the white paper now only has to provide “information on the offeror”.

The white paper serves disclosure and information purposes and its content is based on the requirements of the EU Prospectus Regulation and the associated Delegated Regulations.

White paper for issuing asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens For asset-referenced tokens , MiCAR stipulates further content requirements for the white paper.

Also in this respect, considerable changes were made in the course of the interinstitutional negotiations.

As with other crypto-assets, the white paper does not have to be approved by the competent authority.

However, it must be submitted as part of the authorisation-granting procedure and will be examined by the competent authority in this context.

The white paper is deemed to have been approved once the applicant issuer has been authorised .

In the case of issuances by credit institutions that do not require further authorisation to offer asset-referenced tokens, the white paper must be approved separately by the competent authority.

For e-money tokens, MiCAR stipulates further content requirements for the white paper, which rules once again have been amended during negotiations.

In contrast to asset-referenced tokens, the white paper for e-money tokens is not subject to review by the authority .

Instead, the white paper is merely registered with the competent authority.

Liability for white papers As under securities prospectus law, the white paper under MiCAR entails civil liability on the part of the issuer.

In the case of a white paper for crypto-assets that are not asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens, the offeror, the person seeking admission to trading of crypto-assets for admission and the operator of a trading platform or their respective board members bear civil liability if the required content is not included in the white paper."
Noerr,A turning point in crypto regulation,"This also generally applies to asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens.

In contrast to the previous draft, MiCAR now (irrespective of a possible national civil liability rule) directly provides the normative nexus for civil liability (see Articles 14, 22 and 47 MiCAR).

Protection against market abuse MiCAR also contains prohibitions and requirements to prevent market abuse in connection with crypto-assets.

However, the scope of application of these provisions is limited to crypto-assets admitted to trading on a trading platform for crypto-assets or for which admission to trading has been applied for.

Comparable to the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation, issuers of admitted crypto-assets must disclose inside information.

Furthermore, MiCAR includes provisions to prevent insider trading, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation.

Conclusion MiCAR will, if passed in the current form by the European Parliament in the near future as is likely, represent a milestone in the regulation of crypto-assets.

For Germany, however, this does not follow from the introduction of new authorisation requirements, as German regulatory law – due to the broad definition of “financial instruments” which covers crypto-assets – has already imposed a licensing requirement on essential crypto-asset services.

Instead, the special significance is due to the creation of harmonised rules within the EU and the enabling of passporting.

This creates a level playing field including the option of passporting, which market participants have been awaiting for some time.

Nonetheless, the German legislator will eventually have to adapt the national German regulatory law to the requirements of MiCAR.

However, in view of the generous applicability and transitional provisions of MiCAR, there is no immediate time pressure for this.

Furthermore, even though MiCAR represents a major step towards a harmonised regulation of crypto-assets, it has to be acknowledged that MiCAR will not solve all legal challenges in the crypto-asset sector in one swoop.

Further need for regulation and clarification, especially for NFTs, can already be foreseen.

It is therefore likely that the regulatory framework for crypto-assets and related services will continue to evolve dynamically."
Noerr,Light at the end of the tunnel for data transfers to the US – the European Commission is preparing an adequacy decision for a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework,"Background: CJEU “Schrems II” decision, EDPB recommendations and coordinated audit by German supervisory authorities In its “Schrems II” decision of 16 July 2020, the European Court of Justice (CJEU) invalidated the European Commission's adequacy decision on the EU-US Privacy Shield without providing for a transition period, and thus dealing a harsh blow to transatlantic data transfer .

Thereafter, on 11 November 2020, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) published detailed recommendations on measures that supplement remaining transfer tools for international data transfers and, following public consultation, adopted the final version of its recommendations on 18 June 2021.

Several German supervisory authorities have declared that they intend to “broadly enforce” the requirements set forth by the CJEU in “Schrems II” and have announced an audit of international data transfers by companies as part of a coordinated audit .

On the one hand, there is still scope for data transfers to the US on the basis of transfer tools and statutory exceptions for certain individual cases that have not been objected to by the CJEU, for example on the basis of new standard contractual clauses for international data transfers adopted by the European Commission on 4 June 2021.

However, on the other hand, the “Transfer Impact Assessments” (“TIA”) recommended by the EDPB, which are also required in the new standard contractual clauses, as well as any supplementary measures that result therefrom, present companies with enormous challenges in practice.

New “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” and US Executive Order on “Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities”

On 25 March 2022, the European Commission and the US published a joint statement on a new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” .

The successor to the “EU-US Privacy Shield”, which the CJEU had found inadequate, is intended to address also the concerns expressed by the CJEU in “Schrems II”.

On 7 October 2022, US President Joe Biden signed a new Executive Order on “Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities” , which is supposed to implement into US law the agreements reached with the European Commission under the new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework”.

Preparation of an adequacy decision for new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework”

On this basis, the European Commission will now prepare a draft adequacy decision in relation to the new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” and launch its adoption procedure.

Although, unsurprisingly, the new provisions have already been the subject of some harsh criticism, the European Commission strongly assumes that the “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” would withstand a new review by the CJEU.

We can expect the “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” to sooner or later also end up before the CJEU.

However, at least for the time being, companies would be able to base data transfers to the US on the new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” on the Commission's new adequacy decision.

At the current time, it is not possible to say with any certainty when the adequacy decision announced by the European Commission will actually come into force.

The Commission still has, among other things, to obtain an opinion from the EDPB.

In addition, it needs to receive the green light from a committee of representatives from EU member states.

Moreover, the European Parliament also has a right of control over adequacy decisions.

Until now the Commission has not specified an official date for the adoption of its adequacy decision.

Accordingly, we can expect its adoption by the end of 2022, at the earliest, although the beginning of 2023 seems more likely.

In spite of the setback inflicted by “Schrems II”, it would thus seem that there is a light at the end of the tunnel for transatlantic data transfers– at least in the medium term."
Noerr,Light at the end of the tunnel for data transfers to the US – the European Commission is preparing an adequacy decision for a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework,"In spite of the setback inflicted by “Schrems II”, it would thus seem that there is a light at the end of the tunnel for transatlantic data transfers– at least in the medium term.

Nevertheless, and particularly in light of the accountability obligations under data protection law, companies should, in compliance with the comprehensive TIAs recommended by the EDSA , continue to review the risks of international data transfers and, if necessary, take measures to address such risks."
Noerr,Romania: Latest changes to Romanian research and development over-deduction rules,"A joint order of the Ministers of Finance and of Research, Innovation and Digitization, No 3.265/21.453/2022, published in Official Gazette No 967 on 4 October 2022, (the “Order”) amends and supplements joint order of the Ministers of Public Finance and of National Education and Scientific Research No 1.056/4.435/2016 to approve norms on de-ductions for research and development expenses when calculating the taxable result for profit tax purposes.

The Order stipulates that, starting from 1 January 2023, to qualify for an additional 50% deduction for expenses related to research and development when calculating taxable result for profit tax purposes, activities must meet all of the following conditions: 1.	They are carried out in the context of a research and development project defined by GO 57/2002 on scientific research and technological development, which must include: (a)	project purpose and objectives; (b)	the field of research and development; (c)	the project period; (d)	the resources allocated to the project; (e)	the project budget; (f)	the category of the result of the R&D activity according to Article 74 of GO 57/2022; (g)	innovative character.

2.	They constitute applied research and/or experimental development activities.

Also, to determine which projects and activities qualify as research and development projects, the Order establishes a body of experts registered in the National Register of Experts for the certification of research and development activities.

To have their projects and activities classified as research and development and to benefit from the tax incentives provided for in Article 20 of the Fiscal Code, taxpayers now have the option of requesting certification of their activities by an expert registered in the National Register of Experts.

“Large” taxpayers, as defined in ANAF Order no.

3.609/2016, are obliged to request certification of their R&D activity.

Such certification is not required for R&D projects and activities that are financed from national and international public funds."
Noerr,German Federal Government publishes plans on antitrust reform,"The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (“ BMWK ”) has published draft legislation for an amendment to the German competition act (Act Against Restraints of Competition or Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen , “ GWB ”).

The bill, entitled the ""Competition Enforcement Act"", would be the 11th amendment to the GWB since its entry into force in 1958.

The draft essentially provides for three significant changes: Sweeping new powers for the German Federal Cartel Office (“ FCO ”) in connection with sector inquiries; Facilitating a disgorgement of economic benefits from undertakings that have infringed competition law; Various measures to enable the enforcement of the European Digital Markets Act ("" DMA "") at the national level.

1) Sector inquiries Sector inquiries are investigations by the competition authorities into sectors of the economy or into types of agreements across various sectors, when they believe that a market is not working as well as it should.

The FCO and authorities from the German Länder have already had the power to carry out sector inquiries since 2005 (Section 32e GWB).

However, the BMWK has identified two shortcomings in the current system: sector inquiries sometimes take too much time; and while the competition authorities may publish their findings in a report issued at the end of the inquiry, they have no or few powers to intervene in the market to address potential competition issues.

To tackle these shortcomings, the BMWK now proposes the following: The bill aims to make the procedure shorter and more transparent.

The FCO will be required to publish the initiation of an investigation on its website, and it “should” conclude the investigation within 18 months.

It will be possible to exceed the time limit of 18 months; however, the FCO will need to justify a longer duration.

Similarly, if the investigation is closed without any results, the FCO will need to publish its reasons for doing so.

The bill also aims at strengthening merger control in those markets where a sector inquiry reveals competition issues.

In future, following a sector inquiry, the FCO may order undertakings to notify all mergers and acquisitions in one or more sectors of the economy.

The filing obligation will apply to transactions where the acquirer has a German turnover of more than 50 million euros and the target has a worldwide turnover of more than 500,000 euros.

It will apply for a period of three years (commencing upon service of the order), renewable at three year intervals for as long as the conditions that gave rise to the order continue to exist.

It is proposed that the FCO will be given new powers to impose specific remedial measures at the end of a sector inquiry if it identifies “a significant, persistent or repeated distortion of competition.”

Such remedies could be both of a behavioural or a structural nature.

In particular, the measures imposed by the FCO may concern any of the following: Access to data, interfaces, networks or other facilities; Obligations to supply other undertakings, including the licensing of intellectual property rights; Administrative or other approvals or authorisations; Supply relationships between undertakings in the same market or at different market levels; Norms and standards; Obligations regarding certain types of contracts or contractual arrangements, including contractual arrangements for the disclosure of information; Organisational measures to separate business divisions.

Finally, if necessary to “eliminate or substantially reduce a significant, continuing or repeated distortion of competition” and if none of the aforementioned measures is sufficiently effective, the FCO may also order an undertaking to divest parts of its business or assets (ownership unbundling).

2) Disgorgement of benefits The bill also aims to boost a power of the competition authorities that has been largely dormant and never attracted much attention (Section 34 GWB)."
Noerr,German Federal Government publishes plans on antitrust reform,"2) Disgorgement of benefits The bill also aims to boost a power of the competition authorities that has been largely dormant and never attracted much attention (Section 34 GWB).

Already today, the German competition authorities may order the “disgorgement of the economic benefit” that an undertaking gained by breaching competition law, and the undertaking may be ordered to make a payment to the federal budget.

This is meant purely as an instrument of administrative law, not as a penalty or criminal fine.

Its purpose is to ensure that no economic advantages obtained through a cartel or any other violation of the law remain with the perpetrator.

However, this tool has never been applied in practice because of various obstacles, in particular because of the complexities involved in determining the amount of economic benefits to be disgorged.

The bill now proposes various changes to facilitate this disgorgement.

In particular, it would introduce a rebuttable presumption of a minimum amount of benefits that can be disgorged.

This minimum amount is one per cent of the turnover generated in Germany from products or services related to the infringement.

Also, contrary to the current law, the competition authorities would no longer would have to prove intent or negligence in order to apply the disgorgement tool.

3) Enforcement of the DMA The third and final amendment is the adaptation of the provisions in the GWB regarding the DMA in order to enable effective enforcement of the new provisions both at the level of the authorities and at the level of civil law.

For example, the FCO will be able to initiate investigations and conduct inquiries in the event of breaches of the obligations under the DMA by central platform operators who have been classified as “Gatekeepers” within the meaning of the DMA.

Likewise, private enforcement is to be strengthened by making the rules for cartel damages also applicable to breaches of the DMA.

For example, the binding effect of official decisions regarding a breach of the DMA and the suspension of the statute of limitations in investigations also would apply.

However, no presumption of damage for breaches of the DMA has been introduced.

In addition, the regional courts will have jurisdiction for actions with regard to the DMA.

Conclusions The bill is most notable for the new powers that it would give the FCO in connection with sector inquiries.

Whereas currently the FCO may investigate one or more sectors of the economy and publish its findings in a report with few immediate consequences, the proposals would enable the FCO in the future to make significant interventions and change the structure of competition.

The new powers of the FCO would be far-reaching in particular as regards new merger filing obligations, potential access or supply obligations and the option of divestiture orders.

What is more, a sector inquiry is, by definition, not limited to a single undertaking.

The new powers of the FCO could therefore affect many companies and market players simultaneously.

Moreover, unlike today, the FCO could impose remedies without the need to prove an infringement of competition law; in fact, supply obligations or divestitures could be ordered even if it is clear that every player in the market has acted within the boundaries of the law.

The new law could therefore bring about a paradigm shift in the application of competition law in Germany."
Noerr,European Commission changes its policy on providing guidance on questions of competition law,"Background In 2004, the European Union modernised the rules and procedures that govern the enforcement of its competition law.

The entry into force of Council Regulation (EC)

No 1/2003 on 1 May 2004 brought about the most comprehensive reform of the enforcement rules since they were first laid down in 1962.

The EU moved from a system of centralised notification and authorisation to a decentralised system where the Treaty’s provisions on competition law (Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) have become directly and fully applicable.

In particular, an agreement that is covered by the prohibition in Article 101(1) TFEU due to its anti-competitive effects but meets the conditions for an exemption in Article 101(3) TFEU is now directly valid and enforceable, without the need for a prior decision to that effect.


The modernised system of competition law allows, and also requires, companies to assess for themselves the legality of their agreements and practices and whether efficiencies and consumer benefits outweigh any restriction of competition.

Companies are usually in a good position to conduct such a self-assessment.

However, the flipside of the abolition of the notification system is that companies have lost the option of applying for an official exemption from the Commission which would confirm the validity of an agreement under EU competition law.

Despite the considerable body of case law from the courts and guidance documents issued by the competition authorities, there often remains a degree of uncertainty regarding the validity and legality of individual contracts and agreements.


To alleviate the uncertainties and risks for businesses created by the modernised system of enforcement, Regulation 1/2003 has authorised the Commission to issue, on its own initiative, non-infringement decisions where it finds that this is in “Community public interest” (Article 10).

However, recourse to such decisions is limited to ""exceptional cases"" (Recital 14), and it appears that none have ever been taken.

The Commission also published a notice offering informal guidance to undertakings in cases presenting “novel or unresolved questions” (“ 2014 Notice ”, EU OJ C 101, 27/4/2004, p. 78

[ Background ]).

But again, the requirements for obtaining such informal guidance were stringent and strictly interpreted by the Commission, and consequently, this option was hardly ever used.


Following the experiences of the COVID-19 health crisis, where the Commission issued a couple of comfort letters, the Commission appears to have realised that businesses require guidance from the competition authorities in more situations than originally envisaged in the 2014 Notice or in Article 10 of Regulation 1/2003.

It thus relaxed the requirements for informal guidance in a new notice published on 3 October 2022 (“ New Notice ”, C(2022) 6925 final [ Background ]).

Details Although the Commission generally has the ability to issue informal guidance to individual undertakings, the New Notice still emphasises that this ability should not interfere with the self-assessment principle of Regulation 1/2003, and that any informal guidance should be compatible with the Commission’s enforcement priorities.

The Commission has, therefore, set up a “filter” consisting of two tests that must be passed before it even considers a request for a guidance letter: Novel or unresolved question : Whereas, under the 2014 Notice, it was necessary that a question had not yet been clarified by the case law of the European courts in order to be considered “novel”, the New Notice potentially lowers the required degree of uncertainty so that it is now enough to show a lack of ""sufficient"" clarity from the case law or from publicly available general guidance at the EU level."
Noerr,European Commission changes its policy on providing guidance on questions of competition law,"Interest in providing guidance : It is necessary for the Commission to find that public clarification of the applicability of EU competition law by means of a guidance letter “would provide added value with respect to legal certainty”.

Regarding the interest test, the New Notice lists several elements that need to be taken into account in this regard; the second element is new compared to the 2004 Guidance Notice: Economic importance of the goods or services concerned; Whether the objectives of the agreement or the practice in question are relevant for the achievement of the Commission’s priorities or EU interests; Magnitude of the investments made or to be made; Whether the agreement or practice in question is widely used in the EU.

The New Notice further clarifies that the Commission will not ""normally"" consider a request for guidance if the questions raised are similar or identical to issues raised in a case pending before the European Court of Justice, or if they are the subject of proceedings pending with the Commission, a national court of a national competition authority.

Finally the New Notice includes instructions on how to request advice, in particular on the information to be included in a request letter.

In contrast to the 2004 Notice, it is specified that applicants should include their own preliminary assessment of (i) why the request raises new or unresolved questions; (ii) why there is an interest in providing guidance; and (iii), to the best of their abilities, how EU competition law should be applied in the case at hand.

Regarding the effects of a guidance letter, it is clarified that an applicant remains responsible for assessing the applicability of EU competition law, and that the clarification provided by the Commission depends on the accuracy and truthfulness of information provided by the applicant.

A guidance letter does not create any rights or obligations, and it may be modified or revoked by the Commission if the public interest so requires.

Furthermore, a guidance letter is not binding on the courts or the competition authorities of the Member States, which are also empowered to apply EU competition law.

Moreover, the fact that a guidance letter has been issued does not preclude the Commission from subsequently investigating that same agreement or practice in a procedure under Regulation 1/2003.

However, the Commission assures companies that it will not impose a fine if a company has relied in good faith on a guidance letter.

Conclusion While the 2004 Notice laid down strict requirements for the issuance of guidance letters, these criteria have been relaxed somewhat by the New Notice.

In particular, the Commission now has more flexibility to respond to a wider range of issues with guidance letters where it deems it relevant to the achievement of the Commission's priorities and the EU's interests.

In addition, the notion of ""novel"" issues has been broadened a little.

Most importantly, in its press release on the New Notice, the Commission expressed the view that it would apply more “flexible conditions” with the aim of “increasing legal certainty, to the benefit of businesses” ( Conclusion ).

Therefore, we are hopeful that the Commission will apply this tool more often than in the past."
Noerr,EU adopts eighth sanctions package against Russia,"Introduction Following a proposal by the European Commission (“the Commission”), the Council of the European Union (“the Council”) has consented to a new set of sanctions against the Russian Federation (“Russia”) on 6 October 2022.

According to a press statement by Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the EU is thereby reacting to Russia’s escalating war of aggression against Ukraine and Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories.

The newly adopted measures include the legal basis for a price cap on Russian oil, further restrictions to trade and additional listings of individuals and entities.

Moreover, the EU takes steps against the circumvention of existing sanctions.

The EU legislators also implemented a variety of minor changes, where previous provisions did not achieve the desired effect, adding further complexity to the sanctions regime.

The eighth sanctions package amends Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilizing the situation in Ukraine (sectoral sanctions) and Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (financial sanctions).

The newly adopted provisions entail a price cap on Russian crude oil implemented by prohibiting its maritime transport to third countries as well as technical assistance and financial services related to the respective logistics.

With the price cap on Russian oil, the EU targets the Kremlin’s financial resources and also hopes to stabilize global energy prices.

By expanding import bans on steel and paper, amongst other commodities, the EU aims at depriving the Russian economy of revenues of around EUR 7 billion.

The expanded restrictions on EU exports to Russia intend to weaken its military industry, while the prohibition of providing certain services, including legal advisory services, to Russian customers prevents them from utilizing European knowledge and expertise.

Also, reacting to the recent illegal referenda, the EU expands the geographical scope of certain trade restrictions from Donetsk and Luhansk to the areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson by amending Regulation EU 2022/263 concerning restrictive measures in response to the recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine and the ordering of Russian armed forces into those areas.

Besides amending sectoral sanctions, the Implementing Regulation 2022/1906 to Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 extends the financial sanctions list.

Newly listed individuals include those responsible for organizing the illegal “referenda” staged by Russia in Ukraine’s occupied territories, strengthening Russia’s military capabilities and spreading disinformation.

As a new category, financial sanctions are being imposed on individuals who bypass the sanctions regime.

A. Price cap on Russian oil As a new instrument, the eighth sanctions package introduces the legal basis for a price cap on Russian oil.

To this end, an exception to the – equally newly introduced – prohibition for the provision of maritime transport services to third countries regarding crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from Russia is introduced.

At the same time, an exception from the prohibition to provide technical assistance, brokering services or financing or financial assistance related to maritime transports is implemented.

Utilizing the exception will require compliance with a pre-established price cap.

The actual price cap remains to be agreed upon by the so-called “Price Cap Coalition”.

For the exception regarding services related to maritime transport, see Article 3n of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as amended.

As the existence of the price cap triggers the prohibition of the maritime transport services, Article 3n of Regulation (EU)"
Noerr,EU adopts eighth sanctions package against Russia,"As the existence of the price cap triggers the prohibition of the maritime transport services, Article 3n of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 remains – for now – merely an empty shell.

B. Additional import bans In order to further deprive the Kremlin of revenues, the existing EU import bans are extended.

This applies to certain categories of products that originate in Russia or have been exported from it.

They include steel and steel products, wood pulp and paper, certain elements used in the jewelry industry such as stones and precious metals, certain machinery and chemical items, cigarettes, plastics and processed chemical products such as cosmetics.

Refer, for example, to Article 3g (d) of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended for the import prohibition with regard to new types of steel products.

C. Additional export restrictions The additional export restrictions imposed by the EU aim at Russia’s military and technological capability and the development of its defense and security sector.

Thus, the newly restricted items include chemical substances, nerve agents and certain goods used for inhuman treatment.

In addition, the eighth sanctions package extends export restrictions targeting the industrial sector as well as the aviation industry.

Also, the newly adopted measures include a prohibition to sell, supply, transfer or export firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, according to Article 2aa para.

1 of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended.

D. Additional restrictions on services and activity in Russian SOEs Extending the ban to engage in any transaction with certain Russian State-owned or controlled legal persons, entities or bodies (“SOEs”), the new measures introduce a general prohibition for EU citizens to hold a post in the respective governing bodies of these entities as from 22 October 2022, Article 5aa para.

1a of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as amended.

Also, the ban on the provision of certain services to Russia is extended.

This includes, amongst others, legal advisory services to the Government of Russia, legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia, namely in non-contentious matters like commercial transactions.

Legal representation and related advice regarding official proceedings is exempted, according to the amended version of Article 5n of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, see also Recital (19) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1904.

As has been the case with regard to the existing ban of certain services, the provision of services is not forbidden if the services are intended for the exclusive use of legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia that are owned by, or solely or jointly controlled by, a legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted under the laws of a Member State, a country member of the European Economic Area, Switzerland or a partner country, Article 5n para.

7 of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended.

Also newly included is the prohibition of provision of IT consultancy services to above-mentioned recipients.

According to Recital (19) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1904 these cover “consultancy services related to the installation of computer hardware, including assistance services to the clients in the installation of computer hardware (i.e. physical equipment) and computer networks, and software implementation services, including all services involving consultancy services on, development of and implementation of software.”

E. New exceptions The amendments of the existing sanctions regulations also bring further exceptions from existing prohibitions.

Among others, contradictions have been resolved where exceptions from the transaction ban of Article 5aa of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 could not be used because of the prohibition to make funds and economic resources available to such entities according to Article 2 para.

F. New listings Like previous amendments, the eighth sanctions package adds individuals and entities to the financial sanctions list.

This relates to the ongoing escalation of the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side, especially mass mobilization, the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories and a threat to use weapons of mass destruction.

Thus, the list now includes individuals responsible for the organization of the illegal referenda, “officials” of annexed territories, defense officials and companies in the military sector.

See Article 1 in conjunction with the Annex of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1906 amending Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 for an overview of newly listed individuals and entities.

G. Circumvention of sanctions Finally, a new category for financial sanctions listing is added.

This includes natural or legal persons, entities or bodies facilitating infringements of the prohibition against circumvention of sanctions.

Amongst others, Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 and Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 are mentioned as points of reference, according to the recently inserted Article 3 para.

1

(h) of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014.

Summary and evaluation Among the newly adopted measures, the price cap on Russian oil will likely have the most significant impact.

Relatively high prices on crude oil have continued to contribute to a steady flow of revenue for Russia despite reduced export volumes, thus supporting the Kremlin’s war effort in Ukraine.

With the sixth sanctions package , adopted on 3 June 2022, the EU already imposed an import ban on seaborne crude oil and petroleum products aimed at Russia’s most important export commodities.

By introducing a price cap on oil, enforced by restricting its maritime transport to third countries and related services, the EU practically expands the geographical and personal impact of the sanction regime regarding oil sales.

However, the price cap’s actual amount remains to be decided.

Reaching a final agreement on the exact amount of the price cap will require that significant political divides between EU Member States are overcome.

It seems obvious that the decision to introduce the legal framework first most likely helped to accelerate the adoption of the new sanctions package.

A related discussion concerns a temporary price cap on Russian gas, an idea introduced by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

This idea has not reached consensus among EU Member States yet, as media outlets report .

Compared to the price cap on Russian oil, other newly introduced restrictions to trade will likely have a less significant impact in a broad context.

For example, depriving Russia’s economy of EUR 7 billion in revenues by introducing new import bans has to be assessed in view of its overall export volume s which, in 2021, reached almost USD 500 billion.

However, within the branches directly affected by import bans or export restrictions, the newly adopted measures will have a noticeable effect.

The fact that, once again, exceptions needed to be implemented, underlines the rather complex system of the EU sanctions regime.

Unlike in other jurisdictions, authorizations need to have a very exact legal basis and, therefore, need to be implemented in the regulations directly in a quite detailed manner.

In situations like the present, where regulations have to be drafted and agreed upon rather quickly, situations requiring exceptions might be easily missed and, therefore, need to be included afterwards.

This, of course, brings along painful delays for those relying on the exceptions.

As far as financial sanctions are concerned, the targeting of individuals circumventing sanctions constitutes the most remarkable amendment."
Noerr,EU adopts eighth sanctions package against Russia,"As far as financial sanctions are concerned, the targeting of individuals circumventing sanctions constitutes the most remarkable amendment.

By imposing sanctions without a direct link to European jurisdictions, the EU may be seen as taking light steps towards a secondary sanctions regime.

Considering the EU’s firmly settled view – confirmed by the European Court of Justice - that secondary, or extraterritorial, sanctions such as those imposed by the United States, are inconsistent with basic principles of public international law, this move will certainly not go unnoticed.

Besides, the prevention of circumventing sanctions is in line with earlier measures imposed by the maintenance and alignment package of sanctions adopted 21 July 2022, which also served this purpose."
Noerr,Romania: New employment rules for microenterprises,"Law no. 275/2022 to repeal Government Emergency Ordinance no.

37/2021 to amend and supplement Law

no.

53/2003 - Labour Code has been published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, no. 961 of 3 October 2022 (“ Law 275/2022 ”).

Based on the provisions of Law 275/2022, as of 6 October 2022, microenterprises with up to 9 employees will no longer be exempted from the obligation to: -	draft and implement an internal regulation; and -	agree with their employees on job descriptions.

Thus, starting on this date, all microenterprises that have chosen to benefit from the applicability of Government Emergency Ordinance no.

37/2021 will now be required to have an internal regulation in place and/or agree on job descriptions with all their employees.

Given the tight deadline for implementation, these new rules will have a significant impact on and be cumbersome for such microenterprises, especially with respect to the job descriptions.

While the internal regulation is a unilateral document issued by the employer (regarding which employees are merely consulted), job descriptions are components of the employment agreements; therefore, any amendment to them is subject to both par-ties’ consent.

Consequently, microenterprises that have chosen to either forego agreeing with their employees on job descriptions or remove them from the employment agreements will now have to conclude addenda to the employment agreements to include the job descriptions.

Failure to conclude the job descriptions may trigger administrative fines and make it difficult for the employer to exercise its prerogatives as employer (to perform a disciplinary investigation or professional performance assessment, justify a redundancy, etc.)."
Noerr,Czech Republic: Amendment to the Czech Labour Code – Get ready for changes in 2023!,"A draft amendment to the Czech Labour Code, to transpose European legislation into the Czech legal system, is currently being considered by Czech ministries.

As the amendment introduces significant changes that will affect almost all employers, allow us to present you with a brief summary of at least the most important ones.

Remote work A welcome revision is the fact that the amendment brings about the long-awaited explicit regulation of remote work.

Remote work will be possible once the employer and the employee enter into a written agreement, for which the amendment sets forth certain requirements.

Existing written agreements between employers and employees on the terms and conditions of remote work will also have to be supplemented with these requirements within 3 months of the date the amendment comes into force.

The introduction of compulsory agreements on remote work should unify the currently highly fragmented practice, where only a small number of employers have been using these agreements, while the remainder dealt with remote work via their internal regulations and some did not lay down rules for remote work in writing at all.

Under certain conditions, the employee may request remote working from their employer and the employer may unilaterally order the employee to work remotely.

Above all, however, the amendment finally introduces clear rules for the reimbursement of costs associated with remote work, which has been the most pressing issue when implementing remote work.

A flat rate for the reimbursement of utilities expended is introduced; its value is to be set by law and periodically adjusted by subsequent legislation depending on the increase in given indicators (i.e. the aggregate prices of the commodities and services concerned).

Other, incidental, costs are not to be included in the flat rate.

Their reimbursement will thus depend on the employee’s ability to prove their existence and amount.

Agreements on work performed outside of employment (“AWPOE”)

Employers should be prepared for stricter rules when employing persons by way of an AWPOE (in Czech “dohoda o provedení práce” and “dohoda o pracovní činnosti”).

The amendment will impose a new obligation on the employer to schedule working hours for an employee working under an AWPOE.

These employees are now also to be entitled to annual leave, additional pay for working on public holidays, at night, in difficult working environments and on weekends, as well as given rights related to obstacles at work.

In addition, in certain circumstances, these employees may ask their employer employ them in a traditional employment relationship or ask to be provided with a reason for the termination of their AWPOE.

Information on the terms of employment The employer’s duty to provide information to the employee will be extended.

For example, the employer will be obligated to inform the employee about the procedure for the termination of employment or to inform them about the furtherance of their professional development.

Employers will also be obligated to notify existing employees of the above information within one month of the amendment coming into force.

Electronic communication The amendment introduces significant changes to the area of service of employment-related documents, which should lead to a substantial simplification of electronic communication between the employer and the employee.

A most welcome change is the abolition of the requirement to deliver documents relating to the creation of employment and amendments thereto, as well as agreements on termination of employment or an AWPOE, to the addressee’s own hands – these documents can now be drawn up electronically and then merely sent to the employee’s personal email address."
Noerr,Czech Republic: Amendment to the Czech Labour Code – Get ready for changes in 2023!,"In addition, the requirement to sign documents with a recognised electronic signature is to be abolished, allowing for a simple electronic signature to suffice (i.e. a scanned copy of a signed document will be sufficient).

The proposed legislative changes may facilitate employment law-related issues a great deal.

For other documents, such as unilateral acts relating to the termination of employment or an AWPOE, recall or resignation of a manager, wage or salary statements or a record of a breach of the temporary incapacity for work regime of an insured person, the stricter service regime will unfortunately remain in place and such documents will still have to be de-livered to the addressee’s own hands.

However, under the amendment, the fiction of service, previously only applied to electronic data boxes, will now also apply to any other form of electronic communication.

The fiction of service will take effect 10 days after the “delivery” of such documents, for example, to the addressee’s email address.

Other The amendment also introduces changes in other areas, such as parental leave or the posting of employees to other EU countries in the context of the transnational provision of services.

Entry into force The amendment is to enter into force on the first day of the calendar month following its promulgation – for the time being, it is estimated that this could happen in the first half of 2023.

We will keep you informed of further developments in the legislative process."
Noerr,Tougher rules for product liability in Europe,"EU Commission presents draft of new EU Product Liability Directive after 37 years On 28 September 2022, the Commission presented its long-awaited draft of a new Product Liability Directive.

The current Directive, which harmonises strict product liability in Europe, dates back to 1985.

The new draft certainly packs a punch.

If it comes into force in its current form after further discussion in the Council and Parliament, industry players will have to prepare for a much tougher approach to product liability in Europe.

At the same time, product liability will in future also extend to economic operators for whom this issue has not played a role so far.

What has been tightened up for product manufacturers and importers?

In future, European product liability will no longer apply only to movable objects and electricity, but also specifically to digital production files and to software.

The term “software” also includes artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

The experts therefore no longer need to argue about whether software can be included in the term “movable object”.

A product is defective if it does not meet the justified safety expectations of the average consumer.

This will not change in future.

However, in future new aspects will have to be specifically taken into account, such as the cyber-security requirements of the product.

This will be interesting to see, because these requirements are just beginning to emerge.

The currently applicable deductibles (€500 for property damage) and maximum liability limits (€85 million for personal injury) will no longer apply.

All relevant terms in the new Directive will be adapted to current European product safety law and thus to the New Legislative Framework (NLF).

The continuous and long-overdue linking of product liability with European product safety law runs through the entire draft Directive and has multiple practical consequences: in future, for example, anyone who “substantially alters” a product within the meaning of product safety law will be liable in the same way as a manufacturer, depending on the degree of fault.

In future, the placing of products on the market will no longer be the sole decisive connecting point for product liability.

In future, a manufacturer may still be liable if it can still control its product after it has been placed on the market (e.g. through appropriate security software updates).

In addition to the manufacturer, the quasi-manufacturer and the importer, in future the manufacturer’s authorised representative within the meaning of product safety law and the fulfilment service provider may also be liable for product defects like the manufacturer is.

This is one of the biggest surprises in the draft, because it means that economic operators will have to brace themselves for huge product liability risks of their own, although they were previously not confronted with such liability, either directly or indirectly.

In light of this, it therefore seems doubtful whether the model of the authorised representative established under product safety law has a future.

The currently applicable facilitation of proof for injured parties will be significantly expanded.

The required causal connection between a product defect on the one hand and the damage on the other hand will in future be presumed in favour of the injured party if the damage was caused by “obvious malfunction of the product during normal use”.

In the future, the injured party will therefore no longer have much to prove if it wishes to assert claims for damages against the manufacturer following an accident in connection with the use of a product.

The exclusions of liability currently existing in favour of economic operators, of which there are very few in any case, will also be further restricted."
Noerr,Tougher rules for product liability in Europe,"The exclusions of liability currently existing in favour of economic operators, of which there are very few in any case, will also be further restricted.

For example, where the product defect is not recognizable when it was placed on the market will no longer exonerate the manufacturer if the defect could have been remedied by a security software update.

This means that it is not only the tech industry that will have to think twice about whether it can afford to discontinue security updates for “older products” after a few years.

What is really surprising is that in future companies may be forced to hand over evidence in their possession (e.g. design documents, documented findings from product observation) which the claimant needs to substantiate their claims.

If the companies fail to do so or do so incompletely, they may lose the case because the defectiveness of the product will then be legally presumed.

Such “disclosure of documents”, as is typical in common-law jurisdictions, has been unknown in German civil proceedings so far.

The enforcement of the Product Liability Directive will also gain an additional dimension through the implementation of the EU Representative Actions Directive and the introduction of a new remedy for performance (further information can be found in our article New type of class action in Germany ).

This allows qualified entities to bring a representative action for compensation, repair or price reduction.

Consumers and small businesses can join these actions (opt-in).

Does the draft contain any relief for industry players?

There are no apparent aspects providing relief for the economic operators concerned.

The current draft Directive entails tightening up and expanding the product liability regime throughout, which industry players will have to adapt to in the short term as part of their risk management.

Indeed, the draft specifies a very short implementation period for the Member States of 12 months from entry into force.

Will the new AI Liability Directive lead to even more stringent product liability?

The draft of a new AI Liability Directive, also published on 28 September 2022, has no effect on liability under the Product Liability Directive.

The far-reaching disclosure obligations for evidence and the facilitation of evidence in favour of potential claimants who find themselves harmed by AI systems provided for in the AI Liability Directive cannot be combined with the privileges of the Product Liability Directive.

The European legislator has deliberately placed the AI liability privileges in a separate Directive and limited them to the assertion of non-contractual fault-based damage claims.

In this context, i.e. within the framework of tortious liability under German civil law, the provisions of the AI Liability Directive will come into full effect to the detriment of the economic operators concerned."
Noerr,New type of class action in Germany,"Consumer Rights Enforcement Act: Ministerial draft passes to the stage of interdepartmental coordination At the end of this year

, a new type of class action will be introduced in Germany, by which associations can collectively file actions for performance for consumers against companies for the first time.

This is what the European Directive on representative actions requires of the German legislator.

For companies, this creates the risk of being sued collectively by many consumers for compensation, repair or price reduction in the event of breaches of duty.

Last Thursday , the Federal Ministry of Justice submitted a corresponding ministerial draft of the Consumer Rights Enforcement Act for interdepartmental coordination.

This draft is likely to provide plenty of material for discussion in the coming weeks.

Procedure for the new representative action The new representative action enables qualified consumer associations for the first time to sue directly for performance, i.e. obtain a decision on redress.

While the model declaratory action can only achieve a declaratory judgment stating that the conditions for claims are in place or are not in place, the new representative action allows companies to be sued directly for payment.

The ministerial draft specifies that a qualified association may bring an action for redress if at least 50 people register similar claims in the register of representative actions.

Registration is possible until the day before the first oral hearing.

The Federal Ministry of Justice thus proposes an opt-in model.

In this respect, the representative action corresponds to the existing model declaratory action.

What is new is that smaller companies (those employing fewer than 50 people and with annual turnover or an annual balance sheet below €10 million) can also register their claims.

The purpose of the representative action is that all claims by a large number of consumers against a company can be brought.

Since the Directive on representative actions only requires that certain consumer rights (e.g. under the law on data privacy) can be enforced by means of representative actions, the ministerial draft represents an implementation that goes beyond this.

In Germany, representative actions could therefore also become important in other areas, such as claims for cartel damages, capital investment cases or the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act.

The procedure following an action for redress will be divided into several stages as follows: Estimate of damage and determination of a collective total In the representative action, it will be up to the qualified associations to present specific indications of the amount of damage.

The court will then be authorised to estimate the damage pursuant to section 287 of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

In the final redress judgment, the court will award a collective total by assuming all claims filed are fully justified.

The individual claims will only be examined in the implementation proceedings and any excess awarded will be refunded.

Litigation funding possible The ministerial draft states that litigation funding will generally be possible.

There are certain admissibility requirements to avoid conflicts of interest between consumers and the litigation funder.

Since qualified associations often have limited financial resources, litigation funding can give them significantly more room for manoeuvre.

However, the question is what motivation litigation funders would have to fund a representative action, since generally the entire amount claimed must be paid out to consumers and no profit-sharing can be agreed.

Right of action for foreign associations too Article 4 of the Directive on representative actions stipulates that qualified associations from other Member States will also be able to bring representative actions in Germany if they meet certain requirements."
Noerr,New type of class action in Germany,"Companies may therefore face lawsuits from foreign associations, such as those that have operated for many years in Portugal or the Netherlands.

In some cases, companies must raise objections in separate proceedings Companies might have objections to the claims of individual consumers that they cannot assert in the redress proceedings.

For these cases, section 40 of the draft Consumer Rights Enforcement Act states that companies must assert the objections in their own legal proceedings against the consumers and reclaim the amounts paid out on the basis of unjust enrichment.

Next steps The draft that is now available will first be discussed within the federal government.

Next, it must go through the parliamentary procedure.

This is a matter of urgency.

The Directive on representative actions must be transposed into German law by 25 December 2022, and the new law must be applicable by 25 June 2023 at the latest.

It remains to be seen whether and what changes will be made to the draft of the Act during the rest of the procedure.

Noerr,Romania: Changes to income tax on salaries - maximum benefit at minimum cost,"According to the latest figures from the National Institute for Statistics and other public information, the annual inflation rate has continued to rise and, at 15.32% in August, reached its highest rate in 20 years.

Inflation has been rising at a galloping rate over the past year, both globally and nationally.

Although Christmas is just around the corner, Romanian businesses do not seem to have any faith in a seasonal miracle and, most likely, 2022 will end with even higher inflation.

The why High(er) inflation usually means a higher cost of living, which places pressure on consumers to increase their income - at least to cover the impacts of inflation.

A natural move will be for employees to transfer some of this pressure to their employers by asking for a raise.

In turn, this will increase employers’ costs and thus affect their overall profitability.

How does one escape this dilemma?

How can employers maintain the balance between cost optimisation and employee satisfaction?

The answer is likely to be different for everybody… However… The how Recently, the Romanian government enacted a set of changes to Romanian tax law, which although restrictive at first glance, may create an unexpected opportunity for Romanian companies to redefine their remuneration policies and work towards the elusive goal of securing the maximum benefit for their employees at the minimum cost to themselves.

As from 1 January 2023, employers will be able to offer non-taxable benefits within an aggregate limit of 33% of gross wages for qualifying employees.

The pool of benefits subject to this limitation will comprise benefits already existing in the tax legislation as well as new benefits, as follows: (i) remuneration received based on mobility clauses (with some exceptions); (ii) food allowances within certain limits and subject to certain conditions; (iii) voluntary health insurance premiums or healthcare subscriptions; (iv) private pension contributions; (v) reimbursement of the costs with tourist and/or treatment services, including transport, during the holiday period, for the employees and their family members under certain conditions; (vi) certain accommodation allowances.

In this context, the scope of application of the benefits package opens up and employers can rethink their Ben&Comp policies to offer their employees higher net salaries.

Good numbers speak louder than words For illustrative purposes, we can consider a gross salary of RON 6,000, which, assuming no personal deductions apply, would correspond to a net salary of about RON 3,510 (after social contributions and tax).

As from 1 January 2023, the net salary based on a gross salary of RON 6,000 would remain unchanged.

However, what if the gross salary were redistributed as follows ¹ : (i) RON 4,515 gross base pay; (ii) RON 600 monthly food allowance; (iii) RON 600 mobility clause remuneration; (iii) RON 285 monthly holiday allowance?

This redistribution would result in an overall net wage (without considering any personal deductions) of RON 4,126, which would provide employees with a 17.5% increase in their net salary in a scenario in which the employer does not have to increase its salary costs at all.

Sweet!

Too good to be true?

Real-life application will reveal the answer.

Any re-shuffling of salary packages will need to be made in accordance with the requirements of the relevant labour legislation, which may give rise to various complications.

Furthermore, employers should not lose sight of the fact that the above tax rules may yet be subject to changes/refinements, and implementing instructions could still be issued to make the real-life application of the “non-taxable benefits” rule more cumbersome.

Even so we believe it is definitely worth some brainstorming if there is even the slightest chance of giving people more money without actually spending more.

Noerr,Romania: HR challenges and the new Whistleblowing Act,"The Whistleblowing Act in Romania (currently in the form of a revised bill, again waiting for a final vote in the Parliament) has been hotly debated over and over again during the past year:

authorities, consultants, lawyers, employers and anti-fraud specialists have been going through the bill in detail and working out the challenges it will raise, both for public entities and private companies.

The focus of the bill is on granting proper protection for whistleblowers and on future compliance challenges, especially for private companies employing at least 50 employees.

However, not much has been said about how the future Whistleblowing Act will shape a company’s relations with its employees in the long run.

In other words, the impact of the Whistleblowing Act on employment regulations remains unclear, because (allegedly) more pressing concerns have taken precedence to date.

Nevertheless, we consider that focusing on future HR challenges is highly advisable and hope to provide a different perspective on this key matter.

We have analyzed how the workplace will be different and what HR representatives should take into account in light of the new Whistleblowing Act, already considered a key instrument for increasing business transparency and preventing fraud.

Whistleblowing:

A fine line between loyalty and fairness Whistleblowers have never enjoyed a good reputation, regardless of the wrongdoings they have helped uncover.

This perspective will most likely survive even after the whistleblowing bill passes and despite the fact that the bill focuses on (as the name shows) protecting people who report breaches of the law.

There are many reasons for this perspective, which places the whistleblower in a conflict between the search for fairness and respect for individual rights and liberties, and the disclosure of wrongdoings involving the employer.

Therefore, especially in case of external and public reports that could lead to serious consequences for an employer, the relationship between the latter and the whistleblower becomes tense and is marked by mutual dissatisfaction and potential abuse.

Such sensitive matters have to be managed by HR representatives and this is not an easy task to do.

The following matters (some of which are specific to the Romanian Whistleblowing Act, some not) will have to be considered in particular: #1 Employment confidentiality seen in a new light Employment relations are founded on longstanding principles, including the obligation of employees to maintain confidentiality with regard to employer-specific matters (such as finances, client portfolio, know-how, commercial secrets etc.).

However, in light of the upcoming Whistleblowing Act, employees are no longer liable for disclosure of confidential matters if such disclosure is deemed necessary to uncover a breach of law by an employee.

Moreover, whistleblowers are not liable for infringements of IP rights, commercial or professional secrets, GDPR breaches or harm to a person’s reputation or image, should such infringements be generated as a result of a whistleblowing report (internal, external or public).

Therefore, employment confidentiality is to be seen in a new light from now on, albeit still subject to legal limitations and the employer’s right to respond to a breach of confidentiality.

Moreover, such a breach of confidentiality can no longer be regarded as misconduct leading to a disciplinary investigation and a penalty for the employee.

Last but not least, the liability exemption will be extended even further and cover the actions of an employee that would otherwise be considered misconduct if committed for the purpose of obtaining access to information or data about a potential breach of law.

In this case, disciplinary investigations will also be considered illegal, with all related consequences."
Noerr,Romania: HR challenges and the new Whistleblowing Act,"In this case, disciplinary investigations will also be considered illegal, with all related consequences.

#2 Increased protection against whistleblowing-related harassment While direct retaliation and/or harassment by the employer of an employee who has decided to blow the whistle is more easily preventable, the same does not apply to bullying or harassment initiated by coworkers.

In other words, employers cannot easily control a collective response towards a whistleblower, although, from a legal perspective, it should be able to.

Here we refer to Government Ordinance no.

137/2000 on the prevention and penalization of discrimination, which imposes a general obligation on every employer to prohibit and prevent any form of discrimination or harassment in the workplace.

Unless the prohibition of direct or indirect whistleblowing-related harassment and discrimination becomes a general principle in every company, with the right tone set at the top, employers will become susceptible to claims for damages and serious lawsuits, since ostracization of a whistleblower is a common and unfortunate reaction we see every day.

It is especially this reaction that entitles the whistleblower, according to the upcoming Whistleblowing Act, to obtain full compensation for any damages suffered as a result of a whistleblowing report.

#3 Disciplinary investigations The general rule in this regard is clear: any form of retaliation for a whistleblowing report is forbidden, especially retaliation consisting in a disciplinary investigation or employment penalty.

It is also clear that the limitation of the employer’s disciplinary prerogative refers solely to the act of whistleblowing – however, what is or is not linked to a whistleblowing report is not as clear and will be determined by the courts of law when dealing with cases of potential retaliation disguised as a disciplinary measure imposed for a different instance of misconduct.

However, a reference point in this regard is provided by the whistleblowing bill: as per the express provisions of the current bill, any employee subject to a disciplinary investigation initiated within one year of the filing of a whistleblowing report will benefit from free legal assistance during that disciplinary investigation.

In other words, it is presumed that disciplinary investigations initiated in the first year after a whistleblowing report might be still connected or linked to the whistleblowing report, regardless of the official or formal reason for the disciplinary investigation.

The challenges above are just some of the aspects to consider from an HR perspective and we consider that many more will follow once the whistleblowing bill is passed.

Employment relations and overall workplace regulations will be impacted by this game-changing law and employers will have to adjust longstanding guidelines to accommodate a new principle: fairness trumps loyalty, at least when it comes to potential breaches of the law.

Internal matters in a company, protected to date by specific legal means and employer rights, will lose this protection in favor of a more transparent working environment.

Noerr,New decision on franchise law by the Higher Regional Court Frankfurt a.M.,"Recent decisions on the franchisor's pre-contractual duty to inform and on jurisdiction agreements in franchise agreements The Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt on the Main (“Higher Regional Court” or “the court”) has dealt with the franchisor's pre-contractual duty to inform in two decisions.

In the first decision of 01 December 2021 (Case No. 12 U 7/21), the Higher Regional Court provides findings on whether a franchisor is liable for statements made by a consulting firm recommended by him or for a business concept prepared by this consultancy firm.

The second decision of 08 December 2021 (Case No. 4 U 251/20) deals with the pre-contractual duty to inform in cross-border master franchise agreements.

As an aside, the Higher Regional Court takes a position on the question of whether jurisdiction agreements in franchise agreements with business founders can be effectively agreed.

I. Judgment of 01 December 2021 – 12 U 7/21 Facts The defendant franchisor runs a franchise system, the object of which is to operate cosmetic studios for permanent hair removal .

The plaintiff franchisee approached the franchisor in May 2015, expressing interest in the franchise system.

As part of the initial provision of information, the franchisor gave the franchisee a company brochure on its franchise system.

After a reservation agreement had been signed, the franchisor sent the franchisee an information brochure for prospective franchisees and a location check.

Upon the franchisor’s recommendation, the franchisee then engaged a consultancy firm to draw up a business plan which also included information from the franchisor’s area of business.

The franchisee presented this plan to its bank in order to obtain financing for the franchise business.

The wife of the consultancy firm’s CEO was also a franchisee of the franchisor.

In February 2016, the franchisor and the franchisee entered into the franchise agreement.

The business plan included the recommendation for the franchisee to conduct cold calling, e.g. by approaching potential customers in shopping malls.

After the franchisee was unsuccessful in her cold-calling campaign to win customers, she closed her business.

She challenged the franchise agreement on the grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation due to faulty pre-contractual information given by the franchisor and demanded the cancellation of the franchise agreement.

The franchisor refused to cancel the agreement, demanded further payment of the franchise fees and imposed various contractual penalties after issuing a warning.

In essence, the parties were in dispute over the question of whether the business plan provided by the consultancy firm had given the franchisee false expectations due to misleading information and whether this could be attributed to the franchisor.

The trial court (Darmstadt Regional Court, judgment of 25 November 2020 – 9 O 198/18) ruled that the franchisor had not breached its pre-contractual duty to inform the franchisee.

The information package provided contained all essential information and the business plan prepared by the consultancy firm could not be attributed to the franchisor.

It was only prepared at the franchisee’s instigation and was not produced for clarification purposes, but to be presented to the bank for obtaining financing.

Decision The Higher Regional Court confirmed the ruling of the Darmstadt Regional Court.

It came to the conclusion that any misrepresentations in a business concept prepared by a consultancy firm recommended by the franchisor but commissioned by the franchisee cannot be attributed to the franchisor and therefore cannot be the basis of a pre-contractual breach of duty to provide information.

The court first repeats the requirements that are generally placed on the franchisor's pre-contractual duty to inform (within the meaning of section 311 (2) of the German Civil Code ):

In principle, each party bears its own contractual risk."
Noerr,New decision on franchise law by the Higher Regional Court Frankfurt a.M.,"In principle, each party bears its own contractual risk.

They must inform themselves about the risks and opportunities of the envisaged business relationship and form their own opinion of the market opportunities.

It is not up to the franchisor to provide start-up advice to a potential franchisee.

In particular, the franchisor does not have to inform the franchisee about the general risks of self-employment or draw up calculations for a franchisee which it is able to prepare itself with basic business knowledge.

However, the franchisor must not deceive or mislead the franchisee about circumstances essential to the contract.

Also, the franchisor must inform the franchisee about circumstances which are known only to the franchisor and regarding which the franchisor knows, or ought to know, that they influence the franchisee’s decision.

This applies in particular to circumstances which are key to the franchisee’s business success and which the franchisor is more familiar with due to its knowledge of the system and its position in the market.

The scope of this duty to provide information cannot be defined in general terms, but depends on the circumstances of the individual case, taking into account the principle of good faith (see also Hamburg Higher Regional Court, judgement of 25 February 2022 - 1 U 104/19).

Based on these principles, the court held that the franchisor had not breached any duty to inform.

The court did not have to comment on whether parts of the business plan prepared by the consultancy firm were misleading or insufficient.

It is already lacking that the actions of the consultancy firm could be attributed to the franchisor according to section 278 of the German Civil Code.

According to section 278 of the German Civil Code, the franchisor would only have had to accept the fault of the consultancy firm if the consultancy firm had been a vicarious agent (“ Erfüllungsgehilfe ”) of the franchisor, which the court denied in the present case.

Since the creation of the business concept was not a separate obligation of the franchisor that it had to fulfil towards the franchisee.

The purpose of the business plan was to obtain financing from a bank.

It did not serve to inform the franchisee.

Additionally, the consultancy firm was not commissioned by the franchisor, but by the franchisee.

No attribution can be made solely based on the recommendation of the consultancy firm by the franchisor or on the basis of personal connections (via the wife of the firm’s CEO ).

Even an overall view of the circumstances did not justify a different result in the opinion of the court: irrespective of whether the franchisor had provided the consultancy firm with incorrect or insufficient, i.e. outdated, information regarding the business plan, it was the responsibility of the consulting firm to update information on the franchisor or on the development of the system.

II.

Judgment of 08 December 2021 - 4 U 251/20 Facts In the second case, the plaintiff master franchisor based in Germany concluded a master franchise agreement with a defendant master franchisee based in France.

The master franchisee was a business founder when the master franchise agreement was concluded.

The parties had made a choice of law in favor of German law in the franchise agreement as well as an agreement on the place of jurisdiction on the courts in Frankfurt on the Main, Germany.

The master franchisor brought an action seeking payment of the contractually agreed entry fee.

The master franchisee defended itself against this claim.

For a start, it was of the opinion that the choice of law clause was inadmissible and that French law should be applied.

Furthermore, it took the view that the jurisdiction agreement was invalid and that it had no obligation to pay the entry fee because the master franchisor had breached its pre-contractual duty to inform."
Noerr,New decision on franchise law by the Higher Regional Court Frankfurt a.M.,"The master franchisee alleged that the assertion of the claim for payment of the entry fees was therefore in any event an abuse of law (section 242 of the German Civil Code).

Decision Regarding the agreement on the place of jurisdiction, the court confirmed the legal opinion of the lower court that this agreement was admissible.

The master franchisee was a business founder who did not take up a commercial activity until the master franchise agreement was concluded.

In such cases, it is controversial whether a jurisdiction agreement can be validly concluded under German law (cf. section 38 of the Code of Civil Procedure ).

While the Stuttgart Regional Court, for example, recently held such a so-called prorogation to be inadmissible ( Stuttgart Regional Court, decision of 18 October2021 - 15 O 298/21), the lower court took the position that it is sufficient for the status of a merchant that a commercial enterprise is first established by the master franchise agreement.

A jurisdiction agreement could therefore be effectively agreed with business founders.

The Higher Regional Court confirmed this legal opinion.

In addition, the court stated in the context of the argumentation on the consumer contract ( Art. 6(1) and (2) of the Rome I Regulation ) that the purpose for which the contract is concluded is decisive for the classification as a consumer.

The fact that the master franchisee only started the commercial activity for the future does not change the fact that the activity is of a commercial nature and the master franchise agreement was therefore concluded for a commercial purpose.

In the matter of the pre-contractual duty to inform, the court initially reiterated the principles provided in the first decision: The master franchisor must inform the master franchisee completely, unambiguously and correctly about all circumstances that are obviously of substantial importance for its investment decision .

The reason for the pre-contractual duty to inform is the information gap that typically exists between the parties.

Th e (master) franchisor often has information on the investment needs, sales, costs and earnings of the existing system operations, which it can use to draw conclusions about the development of new operations and for making forecasts as to future developments.

This is usually not possible for the (master) franchisee.

The information gap exists especially when the franchisee - – as in the present case – is not an experienced business person , but rather a business founder.

In the present case, it was undisputed between the parties that the master franchisor had made inaccurate statements prior to the conclusion of the contract; in particular, the defendant master franchisee was inaccurately informed about the sales opportunities and the prospects of success of the franchise system.

Moreover, the master franchisee only found out after the conclusion of the contract that the marketing opportunities – contrary to the statements in the recitals of the master franchise agreement – were scientifically disputed.

As a result, the master franchisor was thus not entitled to payment of the entry fee This was because the entry fee had been validly agreed, but due to the breach of the duty to inform, the master franchisor would have had to pay the entry fee as damages pursuant to sections 280 (1), 311 (2) no.

1 German Civil Code in conjunction with section 249 German Civil Code, so the master franchisee would have had to return the entry fee to the master franchisee almost immediately, which would have made it   contrary to the principles of good faith to claim the entry fee.

III.

Conclusion The Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt on the Main confirms and clarify the existing standards regarding the scope of the franchisor's pre-contractual duty to inform in national and cross-border situations."
Noerr,New decision on franchise law by the Higher Regional Court Frankfurt a.M.,"If (as is usually the case) the franchisor has no contractual obligation to provide a business plan to the franchisee, the franchisor is also not liable for a business plan that an external consultancy firm prepares on behalf of the franchisee.

This also applies if the franchisor has recommended a certain consultancy firm firm which then prepares the business plan.

Nevertheless, the ruling shows that the outcome always depends on the circumstances of the particular case.

In fact, the franchisor may become liable if it promises support in preparing a business plan or instructs an external consultant to prepare the plan.

In these cases, or where the franchisor deliberately collaborates with the consultant to the detriment of the franchisee, other bases for liability are conceivable as well.

Both the franchisor and the franchisee are therefore well advised to clearly define who is responsible for the assignment and the purpose of the assignment before commissioning an external consultant, if necessary by seeking legal advice.

The Higher Regional Court affirmed the still controversial question of whether effective jurisdiction agreements can also be concluded with franchisees as founders of a business - in pleasing contrast to the Stuttgart Regional Court ( decision of 18 October 2021 - 15 O 298/21) .

Nonetheless, parties should be aware that there is a risk that German courts will regard jurisdiction agreements with business founders as invalid until such time as the issue has been resolved by the Federal Court of Justice."
Noerr,European Commission Issues Second Annual Report on FDI Screening,"On 1 September 2022, the European Commission (“Commission”) released its second Annual Report on the application of the EU FDI Screening Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/452, hereinafter “FDI Screening Regulation”).

As with the first report, this second Annual Report on FDI Screening was simultaneously adopted together with the Annual Report on Dual Use Export Controls , the second report on export controls under the upgraded Dual-Use Regulation ( Regulation (EU) 2021/821 ).

Both the FDI Screening Regulation and the Dual-Use Regulation are key mechanisms for strategic trade and investment controls in security-sensitive areas of EU policy.

Our news alert regarding the first Annual Report on FDI Screening can be found here .

Key Messages and Trends The second Annual Report on FDI Screening marks the second year of full application of the FDI Screening Regulation (which has been in force since 11 October 2020) and focuses on developments in 2021 .

The COVID-induced slowdown in foreign investments seems to be history, as FDI into the EU in 2021 resurged to levels above 2019 (+ 11 %.)

A closer look at the sectors targeted by FDI screenings reveals that FDI in ICT (Information and Communications Technology) and Manufacturing was the driving force. 

This upward trend of investments seems to reinstate the EU’s aim of openness to foreign investments.

The United States was the top home country of foreign investor in 2021, followed by the United Kingdom.

Notable anomalies to this resurgence are China and Japan, remaining below their 2020 levels.

The report suggests that strict Chinese capital controls and a concentration of investment activities by Chinese investors in core industry sectors explain this trend for China.

Germany, with a share of 16.4% of all acquisitions done by foreign investors, was the top FDI destination within the EU in 2021, with a 20% increase in the number of transactions with respect to the previous year.

Notable increases compared to 2020 can also be seen in Spain, France and the Netherlands, which follow Germany with a share of foreign transactions at 13.8%, 10.7% and 10.5%, respectively.

As regards the value of transactions, a majority of the transactions valued less than EUR 500 million; however, the value of 34% of transactions was above EUR 500 million.

Discrepancies between, and Developments in, Member States

Although the introduction of a national screening mechanism is within the discretion of Member States and remains optional, the Commission has not hesitated to underline its importance on several occasions.

Most EU Member States have since adopted a national screening mechanism or are in the process of establishing one.

Bulgaria and Cyprus are currently the only exceptions.

Significant divergences among EU Member States remain with regard to the requirements to initiate the formal screening of a foreign transaction, including with regard to applicable timelines, sectoral coverage and notification requirements.

Healthcare and energy are two key industries that have been severely affected by the pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions and, consequently, many EU Member States decided to intervene and establish or expand their screening mechanisms to cover these industries.

As a result, in 2021, three Member States adopted a new screening mechanism, six amended their existing one and seven initiated consultative or legislative processes to establish such a mechanism.

In total, two thirds of all EU Member States have an FDI screening legislation in place.

Notably, Germany has added 16 new categories to its list of emerging/sensitive technologies.

The number of authorisation requests remains unevenly distributed across EU Member States.

Four Member States accounted for roughly 70% of all authorisation requests and ex-officio cases in 2021."
Noerr,European Commission Issues Second Annual Report on FDI Screening,"The number of authorisation requests remains unevenly distributed across EU Member States.

Four Member States accounted for roughly 70% of all authorisation requests and ex-officio cases in 2021.

As regards the notification of transactions undergoing national screenings, 13 Member States submitted a total of 414 notifications, compared to 11 during the period covered by the first Annual Report.

Five Member States, namely Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, were responsible for more than 85% of those notifications.

Key Differences from the First Annual Report on

FDI Screening

Although authorisation requests are still not evenly distributed across the EU, there are timid signs of diversification since the first Annual Report on FDI Screening , when this figure was at 86.5%.

In 2021, there has been an increase in the proportion of formally screened cases (in 2020: 20%, 2021: approximately 29%).

This could mean that national authorities are paying more attention as to what they consider to be potentially critical.

Compared to the year 2020, the number of cases requiring mitigating measures (remedies) almost doubled from 12% in 2020 to 23% in 2021.

However, Member States blocked only 1% of transactions in 2021, compared to 2% in 2020.

The Commission did not screen any ex-officio investments under Article 7 EU FDI Screening Regulation, which allows the Commission to screen investments with a Member State independent of whether that Member State has its own screening mechanism (Article 7 EU FDI Screening Regulation).

Future Challenges due to the Russian War of Aggression against Ukraine In light of the far-reaching and comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus as a consequence of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Russian and Belarussian direct investments in the EU are more tightly scrutinised.

This goes further than simply blocking investments by persons or entities that are subject to financial sanctions.

Any investment related to a person or entity associated with the Russian or the Belarussian government in sensitive areas in the EU may be seen as posing a threat to security or public order in the EU and its Member States.

In this context, the European Commission issued a decision entitled Guidance to Member States on how to use FDI from Russia and Belarus in April 2022 . 

This Guidance calls for greater vigilance towards Russian and Belarussian FDI into the EU and assistance in adhering to EU restrictive measures affecting these investments.

Concluding Remarks We see that the Regulation has now entered its consolidation phase with positive developments, despite the fact that FDI notifications create another layer of complexity to M&A deals.

For example, of the 414 notifications examined, 86% could be completed in Phase 1 and only 11% went into Phase 2.

However, the sharp increase of clearances subject to remedies shows that national governments are not shying away from rigorous enforcement.

Merely 3% of cases led to a Commission opinion, highlighting that the focus remains on fewer cases that potentially pose a threat to security and public order.

Given the Commission’s emphasis on a national screening mechanism in all 27 Member States and on the alignment of these mechanisms, in order to safeguard the security of the EU against potentially risky foreign investments from third countries, we expect that FDI control will remain a top priority focus of the Commission.

Finally, the Commission launched a study on the FDI cooperation mechanism in 2021 with the aim of assessing the links between  screenings carried out by national authorities and the Commission, and identifying significant efficiency and/or effectiveness problems in the current system.

The outcome of the study (which shall be released soon) will feed into the Commission’s evaluation of the FDI Screening Regulation planned for 2023."
Noerr,Romania: State aid call for submission of applications under Government Decision 959/2022 will open on 1 November,"The Ministry of Economy today has officially announced the opening of the call for submission of applications under the state aid scheme regulated by Government Decision no. GD 959/2022 for financing assets and/or salary costs.

The period for submitting financing requests is scheduled between 1 November 2022 to 16 December 2022, when investors may file the relevant documentation.

The available budget for the scheme is EUR 300 million, with an estimated annual budget of EUR 150 million.

The current state aid scheme was launched earlier this year by the Ministry of Economy, with the main purpose of supporting regional development through investments.

The grant received from the Romanian state may finance up to 75% of the investment value, depending on the region of implementation and applicant size."
Noerr,Responsibility for occupational health and safety – does the mere opportunity for influence lead to employer status?,"Employers in Germany have to comply with occupational health and safety regulations with respect to their “workers”.

Obviously, their workers include the people they employ.

But who else?

Many other natural persons who do not have a contractual relationship with the employer – at least that was the interpretation of Ansbach Administrative Court (ruling of 6 May 2022 - AN 4 S 22.01071, AN 4 S 22.01073).

Ruling by Ansbach Administrative Court

The occupational health and safety authority found major shortcomings in occupational health and safety at a construction site and, after some discussion, issued an order to suspend construction, addressed to the general contractor.

The general contractor raised the objection that it was not its own workers who were working on the construction site, but those of subcontractors.

It claimed that therefore it was not an employer within the meaning of occupational health and safety legislation, and thus not the correct addressee of the order.

Ansbach Administrative Court took a different view: While it considered the order issued by the occupational health and safety authority to be invalid, as the authority had not sufficiently justified its discretion to select the interferer, it upheld the authority’s arguments on the merits: “[...]

In view of the purpose of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, in particular to ensure and improve the safety and health of employees at work by means of occupational health and safety measures, the concept of ‘employer’ is to be understood broadly in principle.

Even the general contractor of a construction site which commissions other companies to carry out work for the individual trades is itself an employer within the meaning of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, since it, as the commissioning contractor, has initiated the employment taking place on the construction site and has the ultimate responsibility on the construction site, irrespective of the number of intermediary contractual relationships under civil law with the person ultimately employed [...]”.

Does the general contractor have all-encompassing responsibility?

This line of argument which is understandable for pragmatic reasons is not covered legally by the Occupational Health and Safety Act or other occupational health and safety regulations.

Section 2(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act conclusively defines who is an employee for the purposes of occupational health and safety.

What all the groups of people mentioned there have in common is that they have a direct contractual relationship with the company.

Such a broad interpretation as used by Ansbach Administrative Court conflicts with the recognisable intention of the legislator.

In the case of temporary workers, the legislator has expressly regulated (e.g. in section 12(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and section 11(6) of the Temporary Workers Act) the obligations of the hiring company .

The regulations were created because temporary workers are not employed by the hiring company, and the hirer, due to the close proximity and knowledge of the hazards in its company, can protect the temporary worker much more efficiently than the temporary agency, i.e. the contractual employer.

Ansbach Administrative Court relies on the following idea, which is correct in substance: The general contractor has the ultimate responsibility on a construction site, and thus it can most effectively protect the workers of a subcontractor that only carries out a trade.

However, this idea is not reflected in the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

If, as did Ansbach Administrative Court, one were to disconnect the concept of “employer” from a direct contractual relationship, there would be no need for the separate regulations for temporary agency workers, which means the statutory regulations would be superfluous.

However, there is no indication the legislator wished to regulate superfluous matters."
Noerr,Responsibility for occupational health and safety – does the mere opportunity for influence lead to employer status?,"However, there is no indication the legislator wished to regulate superfluous matters.

Impact in practice If Ansbach Administrative Court’s interpretation of the term “employer” were to prevail, this would affect not only the general contractor of a construction site.

Wherever workers from different employers work together outside of a temporary work situation, the problem of responsibility for occupational safety arises.

This also applies, for example, to agile IT projects that have to take place on the client’s premises for reasons of IT security.

Thinking even further ahead, if a company carries out maintenance work on a client’s plant under a contract for work and services, the client might be governed not only by the general duty of care under section 618 of the German Civil Code (analogously applied), but also by all occupational health and safety regulations.

Conclusion The ruling by Ansbach Administrative Court should encourage companies to review their own compliance with occupational health and safety regulations, especially when workers who are not temporary workers work on their premises.

If a company faces action by the occupational health and safety authority even though those workers are neither its own employees nor temporary workers, it is advisable to challenge the decision in the administrative court on this basis."
Noerr,Romania: Significant changes to the authorisation framework of the Romanian representative offices of foreign companies,"The legal framework regarding representative offices of foreign companies in Romania was recently amended with the publication in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, no.

779 of 4 August 2022, of Ordinance

no.

18/2022 on the authorisation and operation in Romania of representative offices of foreign companies and business entities ("" Ordinance "").

The Ordinance entered into force on 07 August 2022 and amends the legal and institutional framework governing the authorisation and operation in Romania of foreign companies and business entities ("" Represented Entities ""), expressly regulating the various related formalities.

In order to briefly present the recent legal provisions implemented by the Ordinance, we mention below some of the most important aspects to be noted on this matter: 1. Aspects of issuing an operating permit The authorisation procedure of the representative offices will be carried out in front of the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tourism ("" MET "") in a simplified manner, exclusively online.

The MET will issue the operating permits based on a request sent via an electronic platform within 30 days of the submission of a complete file, or when the MET considers it to be complete.

From a formal standpoint, the applications submitted to the MET must contain the following standard set of information: (i) the name, registered office and tax registration code of the Represented Entities; (ii) the business activity of the representative offices; (ii) duration of the business operations; (iii) the identity of the persons appointed by the representative offices for dealing with third parties; (iv) the registered office of the representative offices.

Under the Ordinance, future applications which will be submitted to the MET must also be accompanied by the following types of documents: (i) various corporate documents pertaining to the Represented Entities (e.g. excerpts from the relevant authorities, constitutive documents, powers of attorney), as well as letters of good standing from a credit institution; (ii) proof of the existence of the representative office's headquarters in Romania; (iii) proof of payment of the authorisation fee (i.e. EUR 1,000 per year).

Following the completion of the abovementioned formalities, the MET may either issue the operating permit or reject the registration of the representative office, based on grounded reasons, within a maximum of 30 days from the date of application for registration or, where applicable, from the date of completion of the application as requested by MET.

The operating permits granted by MET are valid for a minimum of one year, with the possibility of extension for the same period, subject to payment of the authorisation fee.

2.          Amendment and extension of the operating permit According to the Ordinance, Represented Entities are obliged to notify the MET of any changes in its data, including those appearing on the operating permit, within 30 days of the date of their occurrence, and the Represented Entities must request that the operating permit be updated accordingly if necessary.

Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the application with the complete documentation, the MET will update the operating permit if the changes concern the items included on it.

It is important to note that the operating permit can only be extended at the request of the representative office filed at least 30 days before the expiry date.

3. Issuance and rescission of operating permits, deregistration of representative offices Operating permits may also be rescinded by the MET at the request of supervisory authorities for any of the following reasons: (i) violation of the provisions on money laundering and terrorist financing by the representative office staff; (ii) failure to comply with the business activity stated in the operating permit and the conditions for carrying it out; (iii) non-compliance with tax obligations."
Noerr,Romania: Significant changes to the authorisation framework of the Romanian representative offices of foreign companies,"Deregistration of representative offices from the MET records may also requested through the electronic platform developed as per the Ordinance, based on proof of prior removal from the records of the tax authority and supporting documents issued by the Represented Entities.

The MET will process deregistration requests within 30 days of submission of the file or, as the case may be, its completion as required by the MET.

On a separate note, operating permits may be withdrawn ex officio 30 days after they expire when no extension has been requested.

4.          Limitations and obligations It is important to emphasize that the activity of representative offices in Romania must be carried out as per the business activity established under the operating permit and that business activities are never to be carried out in the representative office’s own name.

Accordingly, it is important to note that the Represented Entities and the employees of the representative office are jointly liable for any damage incurred due to any unlawful acts committed in the course of the activity of the representative offices.

In addition to the obligation to obtain a operating permit, representative offices in Romania must register for tax purposes and pay the taxes and duties established by the Romanian Fiscal Code.

The Ordinance specifies that the representative offices’ financial-banking activities may be carried out only through bank accounts opened with credit institutions legally established on Romanian territory.

It is worth mentioning that the operating permits issued to representative offices before the entry into force of the Ordinance remain valid, as provided by the previous regulations.

Until the electronic platform developed under the Ordinance becomes operational, applications will be submitted and processed pursuant to the former legal formalities.

The guidelines related to the Ordinance shall be drawn up by 60 days after its entry into force (i.e. 7 August 2022).

Also, the new electronic platform must be fully operational by 180 days after such date."
Noerr,LIV Golf v. the PGA,"What is it about?

The golf world is in turmoil.

The main reason for this is the LIV Golf Tour, which was launched at the beginning of 2022 and is sponsored by the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.

It has stepped up to compete with the venerable PGA Tour.

Since then, LIV Golf has been able to persuade a number of well-known players such as Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau or the German golf pro Martin Kaymer to join the alternative tour with generous financial incentives.

Most recently, it became public that Tiger Woods turned down an offer of up to EUR 800 million from LIV Golf and remained loyal to the PGA.

Those players who, unlike Tiger Woods, accepted the offers of LIV Golf and participated in tournaments and other events of LIV Golf were threatened by the PGA with lifetime bans from PGA tournaments.

Currently, participants of the LIV Golf Tour are also barred from participating in PGA tournaments.

As a reaction to this, eleven LIV golf professionals around Phil Mickelson have now filed a lawsuit against the PGA Tour before a court in California.

At the same time, three of the plaintiffs also want to obtain interim legal protection to participate in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, which are important for world ranking points.

In both cases, the plaintiffs argue that the PGA's actions against the LIV golf professionals violate antitrust law.

Accordingly, the PGA is said to have exploited its (hitherto) monopoly power by imposing participation restrictions, thereby denying the players the opportunity to sell their services (in the form of the high-profile game of golf) to others.

At the same time, this would be an attempt to squeeze competing providers of professional golf tournaments out of the market from the outset.

The dispute in the golf world joins a number of other disputes in the sports world over the establishment of alternative leagues and event formats in competition with the established federations and organisers.

The most prominent example of this is probably the so-called Super League in football.

Last year (2021), an association of twelve top European clubs (including Real Madrid and Manchester United) presented a concept for the Super League, which is intended to compete with the Champions League but also with the national leagues.

Originally, only invited teams were to be allowed to play in this Super League in addition to the twelve founding clubs.

Due to negative feedback from fans and politicians, some clubs have since withdrawn from the project.

Even though the Super League has not yet been started, the organisers of the planned Super League are arguing with UEFA and FIFA in a Madrid court about the legality of UEFA's and FIFA's reactions to the Super League plans.

Similar to the PGA's response to the LIV professional golfers, UEFA and FIFA have also threatened those clubs that also wanted to participate in the Super League with participation bans for UEFA and FIFA events.

In the meantime, the court in Madrid has also referred the matter to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling and asked for clarification on the question of whether UEFA and FIFA have exploited their dominant position and thus violated the prohibition of abuse of market power (Article 102 TFEU).

What role does antitrust law play?

Besides golf and football, alternative sports federations and the organisation of competitions outside the organisation of existing federation structures have also been observed in other sports.

In basketball, for example, there are several European league competitions organised by different organisations (FIBA Europe and ULEB).

In boxing, too, there are different federations (WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO, among others).

Another example comes from speed skating.

The International Skating Union (ISU) has received competition from a private, commercial organiser who organises the well-funded ""Icederby""."
Noerr,LIV Golf v. the PGA,"Another example comes from speed skating.

The International Skating Union (ISU) has received competition from a private, commercial organiser who organises the well-funded ""Icederby"".

The reaction of the PGA Tour as well as UEFA/FIFA to the plans regarding the LIV Golf Tour and the Super League are again comparable to that of the ISU towards potential competition.

It threatened participants of the Icederbys on the basis of the ISU statutes with, among other things, a life-long exclusion from ISU competitions.

The European Commission then took up the complaint of two speed skaters concerned and found a violation of the European ban on cartels.

According to the European Commission, the violation of the ban on cartels consists in the regulations of the ISU Statutes, which restrict the possibilities of athletes to participate in speed skating competitions organised by third parties.

In doing so, the ISU forecloses the market for the organisation and marketing of international speed skating competitions.

The General Court of the European Union has since upheld this decision of the European Commission (T-93/18).

The appeal proceedings before the ECJ are currently still pending (C-124/21 P).

In addition to a violation of the ban on cartels, a violation of the ban on abuse of market power by the established sports associations can also be considered in such constellations.

This is based on the assumption that the established sports associations - such as the PGA Tour or UEFA - could drive the new competition out of the market by means that do not improve their own product - in this case the PGA tour or the Champions League - but merely hinder competitors such as the Super League in their activities.

It is open whether in the case of the Super League the clubs involved could also have violated cartel law.

In this context, a violation of the ban on cartels cannot be ruled out.

Above all, the exclusive arrangement of the Super League in favour of the top clubs and the accompanying coordination between these clubs could be seen as a restriction of competition (whereby it would have to be examined whether such a restriction is permissible).

In all these questions and the legal assessment, the special nature of sport and the autonomy of sports associations is also relevant.

This is because sport is often not directly comparable with other economic sectors.

The reason for this is, for example, that in football, the clubs each depend on other high-performing clubs to offer an interesting competition that entertains the audiences.

Outlook

Recent developments in golf, football and other sports suggest that antitrust law will play an increasingly prominent role in the fight for attention, prestige as well as prize and advertising money.

It cannot be ruled out that, in addition to the legal disputes between the competing associations and organisers, further antitrust proceedings by competent authorities will sooner or later be added.

This would be to be expected above all if the majority of courts side with the emerging sports associations and classify the defence measures of the established organisations as problematic under antitrust law.

Competition authorities such as the European Commission or national cartel authorities (e.g. the Federal Cartel Office) could then take a closer look at the sports associations and their defence measures.

Depending on the further course of events, official fines and, above all, claims for damages by the disadvantaged actors are conceivable."
Noerr,Deforestation-free supply chains: EU draft hints at new requirements for economic operators,"The increased awareness of sustainability and climate protection has stepped up the pressure to introduce product-related due diligence obligations to comprehensively protect the ecosystem.

One key aspect of this is the increasingly uncontrolled deforestation and degradation of forests worldwide.

Forests are felled to make way for the extraction of raw materials and the production of certain consumer goods.

The consequences include topsoil erosion, the loss of trees as carbon sinks, and the loss of biodiversity.

The EU Commission therefore published a proposal for a Regulation on deforestation-free products in the Official Journal of the EU on 17 November 2021, which goes far beyond existing European measures against deforestation and forest degradation.

The Regulation aims to reduce the EU’s contribution to deforestation and forest degradation in global supply chains.

Product compliance then extends to production – similar to the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation and the German Supply Chain Sourcing Obligations Act.

The proposed Regulation contains the following provisions: Raw materials and products covered The proposed Regulation covers particularly forest- and climate-harming raw material productions such as soy, wood, coffee, cocoa, beef and palm oil (“relevant raw materials”) including certain products for which the relevant raw materials are frequently used (“relevant products”).

Definition of the term “deforestation-free” The linchpin of the proposed Regulation is the definition of the term “deforestation-free”.

Relevant raw materials and products are thus to be assessed as deforestation-free if they do not originate from areas that were deforested after 31 December 2020 or that were the scene of forest degradation after this date.

In the proposed Regulation, the term deforestation means the conversion of forest into agricultural land.

Restrictions in the supply chain In order to reduce the EU’s contribution to deforestation and forest degradation in global supply chains, relevant raw materials and products should only be placed or made available on the Union market or exported from the Union market if they are deforestation-free, have been produced in accordance with the laws of the country of production, and are covered by a due diligence declaration.

Due diligence obligations of economic operators In order to ensure conformity with the requirements for placing relevant raw materials and products on the market, the proposed Regulation provides for the following due diligence obligations for economic operators: Collection of information on relevant raw materials and products: Quantity of relevant raw materials and products Geolocation coordinates of the areas where the relevant raw materials and products are produced Date or time period of production Contact details of companies in the supply chain Verifiable information that the relevant raw materials and products are deforestation-free and that their production complies with the relevant legislation of the country of production.

On the basis of this information: Perform regular and documented analysis and classification of the risk that the relevant raw materials and products do not meet the conformity requirements.

Where appropriate: Take adequate and proportionate risk mitigation measures.

By making their due diligence declaration, economic operators take responsibility for ensuring that due diligence obligations have been met and that there is no or only a negligible risk that the relevant raw materials and products are not deforestation-free or have not been produced in accordance with the laws of the country of production.

The due diligence declaration should be submitted by economic operators to the competent authorities in an information system or register specifically provided for by the proposed Regulation.

Benchmarking system"
Noerr,Deforestation-free supply chains: EU draft hints at new requirements for economic operators,"Benchmarking system

In addition, the proposed Regulation provides for varying degrees of due diligence on the part of economic operators, depending on the assessment of the level of risk in the country or region of origin of producing relevant raw materials or products that are not deforestation-free or do not comply with national laws.

The risk categories are to be determined with the help of a benchmarking system based on certain assessment criteria set out in the Regulation, such as the deforestation rate of a country.

Retention and reporting obligations Economic operators will have to keep their due diligence records for at least five years and report annually in full to the public on the measures they have taken to comply with their due diligence obligations.

Notification obligation Finally, the proposed Regulation contains a notification obligation for economic operators if there is reason to believe that relevant raw materials and products they have already placed on the market or made available on the market or exported do not comply with the requirements of the Regulation.

Penalties In the event of breaches of the planned obligations, the proposed Regulation provides for enormous fines to be imposed and for the confiscation of the raw materials in breach of the Regulation or the resulting proceeds.

In addition, economic operators may be temporarily excluded from public procurement in the event of breaches."
Noerr,Risk analysis update from the Federal Office of Economic Affairs and Export Control,"The German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – “ Supply Chain Act ” ), which comes into force on 1 January 2023, defines from section 3 onwards the requirements that obligated companies must carefully work through.

One element is conducting a risk analysis.

In this brief article, we outline the essential elements of the risk analysis and consider the current publications by the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control ( Bundesamt für

Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle – the “ Federal Office ” )

Legal situation: Risk analysis According to section 3(1)(3) and section (5) of the above Act, companies must regularly conduct a risk analysis in order to identify human rights and environmental risks in their own business and at their direct suppliers.

The Act does not specify exactly how to perform the risk analysis.

Section 5(2) simply states that the risks identified are to be weighted and prioritised appropriately.

According to the explanatory memorandum, the risk analysis is to be done in two steps:

First, the company should gain an overview of the procurement processes as well as the structure and key players at its direct supplier and the key groups of people who may be affected by the business activity.

Second, the risks must be assessed and prioritised.

On this basis, the company should decide which risks to address first.

The legislation is not any more specific.

However, in section 20 of the Act, the Federal Office of Economic Affairs and Export Control was assigned the task of publishing cross-sector or sector-specific information, handouts and recommendations on compliance with the Act.

Current publications on risk analysis from the Federal Office Last week, the Federal Office of Economic Affairs and Export Control published a summary about conducting a risk analysis .

The Federal Office says it will publish a handout on conducting a risk analysis by mid-August.

Until then, it remains to be seen how the Federal Office will fine-tune the requirements for risk analysis and whether this will also include instructions on the directly related risk management.

We will also see whether the guidance on conducting risk analysis in Part VIII of the Questions and Answers on the Supply Chain Act is adapted.

This guidance still reflects the status of 28 April 2022.

Conclusion and outlook The recent activities show that structures at the Federal Office have been created with regard to supply chains and that the authority is taking action.

The Federal Office is currently putting together a risk analysis handout and also preparing a structured questionnaire to help obligated companies meet their reporting obligations.

The Federal Office’s perspective will of course increasingly influence the implementation and execution of the due diligence obligations of the Act.

Companies will incorporate the Federal Office’s current work into their plans for implementing the Act.

They will also consider the published requirements and in particular the Federal Office’s handouts.

We are following the current developments and will keep you posted."
Noerr,EU adopts maintenance and alignment package of sanctions against Russia,"Introduction On 21 July 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed to new EU measures in response to the Russian Federation’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine.

At the same time, existing sanctions have been readjusted to increase their effectiveness and additional individuals and institutions have been added to the sanctions list.

The additional sanctions, referred to as the “maintenance and alignment package”, amend Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine (sectoral sanctions) and Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (financial sanctions).

The new sanctions are aimed at the trade in gold, one of Russia’s important export commodities.

There are also further restrictions on the export of certain goods and high technologies in order to weaken Russia’s defence and security sector.

Action is also being taken to prevent circumvention of existing sanctions.

In contrast, sanctions are being eased in certain areas; for example, exemptions for transactions relating to agricultural products are being expanded to counteract global food crises.

Correspondingly, the EU is emphasising that none of the new measures is aimed at food supplies.

Another easing of sanctions involves transactions that serve to provide legal protection.

By adopting the implementing regulations (EU) 2022/1270 and (EU) 2022/1274 to Regulation (EU) No 269/2014, the EU has also added more high-ranking politicians, military personnel and legal entities from the business, research and political sectors to the sanctions list.

Those affected include companies from the defence sector and Sberbank, a large Russian financial institution.

The latter has already been subject to financial sanctions in the USA and the UK for some time; the EU has now followed suit with European sanctions.

A. Trade in gold A major change arising from the EU’s maintenance and alignment package concerns the gold trade, which constitutes Russia’s most significant export after energy (Recital (4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1269).

The new restrictions make it even more difficult for the Russian Federation to finance the Ukraine war.

For example, the new regulation introduces a prohibition to purchase, import or transfer of specified products of gold and jewellery and of goldsmiths’ wares originating in Russia.

The same applies to specified products when processed in a third country incorporating the banned Russian gold products, Article 3o in conjunction with Annex XXVI and Annex XXVII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, as amended.

B. Export of goods and technologies The list of items that could contribute to strengthening Russia’s technological position in the areas of security and defence, and which are therefore not permitted to be sold, transferred, supplied or exported to Russia, is extended.

Consequently, with the new maintenance and alignment package, the list in Annex VII to Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 now includes water cannon systems and other police equipment, certain chemicals and machine tools.

In addition, the list of Annex XXIII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 has been adjusted.

The adjustment includes goods that contribute to strengthening Russia’s industrial capacity.

The extended prohibitions can be found in Article 2a in conjunction with Annex VII as amended and Article 3k in conjunction with Annex XXIII as amended of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

C. Preventing circumvention of sanctions Another change is intended to prevent the circumvention of existing sanctions.

Until now, ships flying the Russian flag were only denied access to ports in the Union."
Noerr,EU adopts maintenance and alignment package of sanctions against Russia,"Until now, ships flying the Russian flag were only denied access to ports in the Union.

Under the new version, this ban has been extended to the use of locks after 29 July 2022, thus further restricting the movement radius of ships registered in Russia, Article 3ea(1) Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended.

Another adaptation to prevent the circumvention of sanctions concerns Article 5b of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, which previously prohibited accepting deposits from Russian nationals or companies established in Russia.

This prohibition now also covers legal persons, entities or bodies in third countries that are controlled by Russian nationals or natural persons residing in Russia.

It is not permissible to accept from such natural or legal persons, entities or bodies deposits with a total value that exceeds EUR 100,000 (Article 5b(1) Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended).

In addition, the previously applicable exception in Article 5b(4) for deposits required for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between the Union and Russia has been removed.

A ban on acceptance now also applies to such deposits.

D. New exceptions In addition, some exceptions have been created.

For example, some aspects of the general transaction prohibitions with legal entities under Russian state control have been lifted.

Thus, among others, transactions which are necessary for the purchase, import or transport of medical products, but also of food and agricultural products, are now permissible, provided that this is allowed under the regulation.

Transactions that serve to provide access to the legal system in a Member State are also possible.

With these amendments, the EU’s maintenance and alignment package continues the line of the sixth sanctions package, in which certain legal services were already exempted from sanctions.

The exemptions can be found in Article 5aa(3) lit.

f and lit.

g of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as amended.

The exemption from the prohibition of transactions strictly necessary for the wind-down of a joint venture has been extended until 31 December 2022, Article 5aa(3) lit.

d of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 as amended.

E. Financial sanctions against further persons and institutions The freezing obligation and the provision prohibition of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 have been extended to additional persons and institutions, and the list in Annex I of the Regulation has been expanded accordingly.

The newly listed persons include in particular military personnel and politicians from Russia and in the occupied territories.

The institutions now listed include the important Russian bank Sberbank, which was previously only subject to a securities trading ban in the EU and excluded from SWIFT , as well as companies in the shipbuilding and defence sectors.

Individuals and institutions from Syria that support the Russian war of aggression have also been added to the list.

Summary and evaluation At first glance, the most striking innovation of the new sanctions package in terms of sanctioned goods is the ban on gold trade with Russia.

Gold is Russia’s second most important single export good.

Compared to oil, petroleum products and related goods at 35.67%, gold for non-monetary purposes amounted to a 5.5% share of Russia’s export trade in 2020, according to Statista .

These figures make the sanctions package entitled “maintenance and alignment package” appear less ambitious than the previous six sanctions packages, not only in terms of its name.

In addition, the demand by some Member States for a gas embargo did not make it into the new sanctions package.

It also does not include a restriction on the acquisition of real estate by Russian persons in the EU – a measure that had already failed to make it into the sixth sanctions package.

However, the EU’s efforts to further enable trade in food and agricultural products in view of global food shortages should be highlighted."
Noerr,EU adopts maintenance and alignment package of sanctions against Russia,"However, the EU’s efforts to further enable trade in food and agricultural products in view of global food shortages should be highlighted.

With regard to the listing and freezing of assets of individual institutions, the Sberbank, whose majority shareholder is the Russian Central Bank, is particularly noteworthy.

Noerr,Romania: Permitting process for renewable energy projects revised,"Here is some good news for the renewable energy industry:

Law no. 254/2022 amending and supplementing Law no. 18/1991 on land fund (hereafter the “ Law ”) has been published in the Romanian Official Gazette.

The Law provides for measures to make the permitting process for renewable energy projects easier by reducing land planning formalities and thus, project development time.

The main points of the Law are: Solar, wind, biomass, bioliquid and biogas projects can be developed outside city limits (Romanian: extravilan ).

Thus, it is no longer necessary to designate land inside city limits or to draw up the related zonal urban plan (PUZ) As before, projects cannot be implemented on agricultural land of quality type I or II Permanent/temporary removal of the land from agricultural designation is still necessary.

This formality will be included in the building permit process An innovation for the Romanian legislation is the introduction of dual use of land located outside the city limits i.e. for agricultural use and energy production.

As per the Law, only the portion of the land actually occupied by the energy production facility will no longer be removed from agricultural designation; the designation of the other portion of land will remain unchanged It is to be noted that pastureland can be designated for dual use, but arable land cannot All of the above points apply to projects covering an area of up to 50 hectares Removal from agricultural designation is subject to a fee, but dual use of land does not currently require any payment (no further provisions has been enact-ed in relation to dual use of land)

The Law applies only until 31 December 2026.

It remains to be seen if and how the law will be amended/extended for the period thereafter.

Also, the legal status of projects started but not finalized by the end of 2026 must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

In closing, we note that coordination is necessary between the Law and the recent amendment to Romanian construction law by Law no. 159/2022, which provides that building permits may be issued without land planning documentation for production of electricity from renewable sources and hydrogen."
Noerr,Romania: Important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Code,"Government Ordinance no. 16/2022, published in Official Gazette no.

716/15.07.2022 on 15 July 2022, entails important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Code.

The most important changes to the Fiscal Code include the following: Starting on 18 July 2022, the new law will: 1. establish consistent rules on the corporate form and tax status of companies for the purpose of applying the dividend tax exemption on the distribution of dividends (i) between Romanian companies; and (ii) from Romanian companies to other EU companies; 2. introduce an additional condition for the applicability of income tax and social security relief for the construction sector – i.e. 80% of the qualifying employers’ total turnover must be from activity carried out in Romania; 3. provide that the turnover on which tax relief for the construction sector is based must be calculated in real time, taking into consideration only year-to-date information from the current year and not using historical data (as has been the case until now).

Starting on 1 August 2022, the new law will:

1. decrease from RON 30,000 per month to RON 10,000 per month the maximum monthly gross salary threshold up to which tax relief for the construction, agriculture and food sectors is granted.

Tax relief will not apply to the portion of monthly gross income that exceeds RON 10,000; 2. increase income tax rates on gambling income from 1%-25% to 3%-40% as follows: 3% income tax on gross income up to and including RON 10,000, RON 300 + 20% income tax on the amount by which gross income exceeds RON 10,000 for gross income up to and including RON 66,750, and RON 11,650 + 40% income tax on the gross salary amount that exceeds RON 66,750 on gross income higher than RON 66,750; 3. introduce an obligation to pay social security and health insurance contributions on an amount equivalent to the minimum gross salary for full-time or part-time employees whose employment contracts provide for income below this level.

The additional tax liabilities are to be paid by employers; 4. increase excise duties on cigarettes.

Starting on 1 January 2023, the new law will: 1. bring about a major overhaul of the micro-company tax regime by making applicability of the micro-company income tax regime optional as of incorporation.

Conditions related to share capital amount and number of employees will no longer apply; decreasing the turnover threshold for applicability of the regime from EUR 1 million to EUR 500,000; maintaining the 1% micro-company income tax rate and eliminating the 3% tax rate; introducing the obligation to have at least one employee; rescinding the applicability of this regime to companies active in banking, insurance, reinsurance and capital markets, including intermediation activities in these fields; gambling; and exploration, development and exploitation of sources of oil and natural gas; rescinding the applicability of this regime to companies that obtain more than 20% of their total turnover from consulting and management activities; allowing shareholders to hold shares in a maximum of three micro-companies where they hold at least 25% of the value / number of shares or voting rights; requiring micro-companies that shift to profit tax starting on 1 January 2023 because they no longer qualify for the micro-company tax regime to inform the Romanian tax authorities of the change by 31 March 2023.

2. eliminate the specific tax for Romanian companies operating in the HORECA industry.

These companies will be able to opt for the micro-company regime without having the obligation to fulfil the conditions for qualifying for the profit tax regime.

3. increase the dividend tax on dividends distributed after 1 January 2023 from 5% to 8%, for both companies and individuals.

4. extend the profit tax exemption for profit used to finance investments made in assets used in production and processing, as well as in assets representing re-technologization."
Noerr,Romania: Important amendments to the Romanian Fiscal Code,"4. extend the profit tax exemption for profit used to finance investments made in assets used in production and processing, as well as in assets representing re-technologization.

5. change income tax and social security contributions by: a) instituting a major review of the system for granting personal deductions to individuals who earn salary income; b) introducing a new non-taxable income threshold for income tax and social security contributions, up to a maximum of 33% of monthly gross salary for certain benefits in kind such as contributions to optional pension funds, voluntary health insurance premiums, additional benefits received by employees based on the mobility clause (except employees in the transport sector), certain accommodation and meal costs; c) establishing taxable income at the level of real gross income and eliminating the flat-rate deduction of 40% on income from letting (im)movable property; d) decreasing from EUR 100,000 to EUR 25,000 the maximum threshold up to which net taxable income is determined on the basis of income quotas; e) amending the provisions on taxation of income from the transfer of real estate from one’s own personal assets by eliminating the fixed RON 450,000 deduction from the value of the transaction when establishing taxable income; calculating income tax on the value of the transaction by applying a rate of 3% for properties owned for up to and including three years or 1% for properties owned longer than three years; f) amending the annual basis for calculating pension insurance contributions for individuals earning income from independent activities and/or income from intellectual property from one or more sources and/or income categories with a cumulative value of at least twelve minimum gross salaries.

The annual taxable base will be the income chosen by the taxpayer, but not less than: 12 minimum gross salaries if the income is equivalent to between 12 and 24 minimum gross salaries; 24 minimum gross salaries if the income is equivalent to more than 24 minimum gross salaries; g) amending the annual basis for calculating health insurance contributions for individuals earning income from independent activities; intellectual property; letting of (im)movable property; agricultural, forestry and fishery activities; investments and other sources; from one or more sources and/or income categories, with a cumulative value of at least six minimum gross salaries.

The annual taxable base will be the income chosen by the taxpayer, but not less than: 6 minimum gross salaries if the income is equivalent to between 6 and 12 minimum gross salaries; 12 minimum gross salaries if the income is equivalent to between 12 and 24 minimum gross salaries; 24 minimum gross salaries if the income is equivalent to more than 24 minimum gross salaries.

6. amend VAT law by: a) increasing the VAT rate for non-alcoholic beverages containing added sugar or other sweeteners or flavorings from 9% to 19%; b) increasing the VAT rate for restaurant and catering services and hotel accommodation from 5% to 9%; c) decreasing the maximum value threshold for providing individuals with housing under social policy from RON 700,000 to RON 600,000 and restricting the applicability of the reduced 5% VAT rate for the acquisition of a single dwelling by any individual."

The law will no longer provide any caps for the relevant tax rates.

The new rates for 2023 must be made available by 13 September 2022; and e) providing that local authorities will also determine the taxable base for such properties based on the new rules.

Failure to react within 30 days from being served with the official notices concerning the taxable values will imply that the taxpayer agrees with the assessment of the local tax authorities.

Noerr,New draft EU Machinery Regulation published,"On 12 July 2022, a new draft EU Machinery Regulation was published.

This European regulation is to replace Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC after more than 15 years and become the new core policy on machine and plant safety in the European Economic Area.

The current draft was prepared by the representatives of the Member States in the working group of the European Council under French leadership.

It is to be understood as a suggestion for a compromise that takes into account the various viewpoints of the Member States.

Timeline until the new EU Machinery Regulation enters into force From the current status, it seems conceivable that the new EU Machinery Regulation will be published in the EU Official Journal by the end of 2022, enter into force shortly thereafter and be largely subject to mandatory implementation after a 36-month transitional phase.

Important changes and consequences for mechanical and plant engineering The new draft is the result of discussions among the representatives of the Member States in the Council Working Group.

Thus, it can be assumed that the current draft is already close to the final wording of the Regulation.

With this in mind, it can be said that the new EU Machinery Regulation cannot be expected to constitute a paradigm shift, but rather to consist of many changes in details.

Nevertheless, the following important changes will probably be significant for many in the mechanical and plant engineering sectors: The list of machines with strong risk potential currently found in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive will be expanded and located in Annex I of the new EU Machinery Regulation.

The EU Commission will be able to make changes to this list in the future via delegated acts.

Consequence:

Manufacturers must expect the list of machines with strong risk potential to be dynamically adjusted in the future and certain machines to be added to the list of machinery in Annex I at short notice.

A notified body will have to be involved in conformity evaluations for machines with strong risk potential (currently regulated in Annex IV of Directive 2006/42/EC on Machinery).

Consequence: The requirement to call in notified bodies will result in higher conformity evaluation costs for companies.

New requirements for secure technology in relation to cyber security and artificial intelligence (AI) will apply.

Consequence: Increased costs for assessments of conformity for machines.

Definitions of terms and catalogues of duties for economic operators (manufacturers, importers, distributors and authorised representatives) will be reworded and adjusted to reflect the current European legal status (“new legislative framework”).

Consequence: Introduction of official reporting obligations if machines in the field constitute risks, new obligations for distributors, but also more legal certainty on the whole for the industry due to adjustments that reflect the current legal situation.

Digital instructions will generally be permitted for B2B machines.

Upon request, paper versions must be subsequently delivered to end customers by six months after purchase.

Consequence: The long-awaited permission to issue digital instructions is now in sight, but with significant restrictions.

No clear affirmation of digitalising instructions for use The new provisions regarding digital instructions will probably be of great interest to the mechanical and plant engineering sector.

Manufacturers are still required to deliver detailed manuals in paper form along with their products – in all of the official languages of the EU countries in which a product is sold.

The expenditure of resources involved here has understandably been a source of exasperation for the industry for years.

The new EU Machinery Regulation has taken a long running start for its jump into the digitalisation age, yet ultimately not jumped far enough.

Admittedly, digital instructions will be permissible in the future."
Noerr,New draft EU Machinery Regulation published,"Admittedly, digital instructions will be permissible in the future.

However, manufacturers will be required, at purchasers’ request, to provide them with a complete paper version of the instructions by six months after purchase of the machine.

The current wording of the draft indicates that this time period will begin to run when the end customer purchases the machine.

Instructions in paper form in which the safety instructions are summarised will also continue to be required for machines that are to be classified as consumer products (B2C products).

These restrictions stem from the concerns of several Member States that not every user in every situation would be able to access purely digital instructions.

For manufacturers that do not deliver directly to end consumers but rather to distributors, an indefinite time period remains in which they may have to deliver voluminous instruction tomes in paper form at short notice.

No coordination of timing with the new European AI Regulation The extremely expedient idea of coordinating the timing of publication of the new EU Machinery Regulation with that of the new European AI Regulation as originally considered now seems to be off the table.

This is also unfortunate because it practically ensures that inconsistencies in requirements placed on machines with AI will occur."
Noerr,The German Supply Chain Act: risks for companies and their governing bodies due to possibility of increased pressure from the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control,"The German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (the “ Supply Chain Act "") will come into force on 1 January 2023 (see also News from 14 June 2021 ). 

In this short article, we are going to outline the risks that companies and their governing bodies could face if they fail to fulfil their obligations under the Supply Chain Act.

Responsibility According to the government’s explanatory memorandum on the Supply Chain Act, the newly created due diligence obligations are “merely” obligations to make an effort.

This is true if one considers the expected results of the due diligence obligations owed: companies are not responsible for preventing all human rights violations or violations of environmental protection regulations covered by the Supply Chain Act.

They are, however, responsible for carefully working their way through the Supply Chain Act’s list of obligations.

In this respect, they are definitely required to achieve results, i.e. they are obliged, for example, to carry out a proper risk analysis, establish an appropriate risk management system and take preventive and remedial measures.

If business managers violate these obligations and their companies suffer damage as a result, there is a risk that they will be held liable.

In addition, there are sanctions under public law, ranging from exclusion from the award of public contracts to heavy fines.

In addition, there is the risk that the proceeds flowing from a  violation could be confiscated.

Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control increases its resources The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für

Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle – the “ BAFA ”) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the obligations imposed by the Supply Chain Act.

It is currently developing the substantive and technical prerequisites to be able to fulfil its legally mandated duty to monitor compliance with the Supply Chain Act as from 1 January 2023.

The BAFA’s effectiveness in this regard should not be underestimated.

Although the explanatory memorandum indicates that the legislature anticipates the BAFA having 65 full-time employees, well-informed sources suggest that the BAFA expects to have 140 staff positions in 2023 and that it considers 300 to be necessary in the medium term.

It is therefore to be expected that the BAFA will act as a proactive supervisory authority, take its statutory monitoring mandate very seriously and also issue administrative fines and confiscate benefits obtained from violations.

Outlook Companies subject to the Supply Chain Act should therefore thoroughly examine their due diligence obligations, comply with them and meticulously document all steps taken.

If a violation of one of the prohibitions standards set out in sections 2(2) and 3 of the Supply Chain Act does in fact occur in the course of the company’s business or in its supply chain, the only way the company will be able to defend itself against accusations that it did “not at all, incorrectly, incomplete or not on time” “carry out the implementation” and the associated fine is by proving it did comply with the necessary steps mentioned above."
Noerr,Non-Fungible Tokens – Structuring Options and Legal Frameworks,"For the first time, crypto assets and services will prospectively be subject to an EU-wide regulatory regime under the MiCA Regulation (= Markets in Crypto Assets).

According to the recent outcome of negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, however, non-fungible tokens (“ NFT ”) are to remain excluded from the scope of the draft regulation unless they fall into one of the categories of crypto assets covered by the draft regulation.

Within 18 months, the European Commission is to be tasked with examining the need to regulate the NFT market and, if necessary, to draft a corresponding regulatory framework.

As there will therefore be no EU-wide harmonised regulatory regime for NFTs in the foreseeable future, a look at the current framework for NFT trading is worthwhile.

Due to the wide range of options for generating and trading in NFTs, the appearance of NFTs is multiform.

What Is an NFT?

To start with, an NFT is a singular, non-reproducible digital unit that refers to a specific asset (in most cases digital but possibly also another kind of asset, e.g. a physical object).

Unlike other types of tokens – digital units representing the functions and properties assigned to them when they are created (referred to as token “minting”) – NFTs are unique and not interchangeable.

This distinguishes them from other crypto assets, especially digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ether.

Tokens are stored and traded via blockchains (chains of data blocks stored on a decentralised ledger together with transaction information).

In any event, this specific form of distributed ledger technology (“ DLT ”) is currently so firmly established for trades in tokens that the use of a blockchain is generally expected.

In theory, however, other types of (DLT-based) infrastructure could also be used.

The German Electronic Securities Act ( Gesetz über elektronische Wertpapiere, “ eWpG”), for example, uses the open term “recording system”, thus expressly not limiting the technologies that may be used ( cf. sect. 

4 para.

11 eWpG).

In current practice, many NFTs are based on the Ethereum blockchain as it allows for the definition, creation, and transfer of individual types of tokens, and allows the convenient use of Ether as a transaction currency.

Via its identification number, each NFT can be uniquely identified and referenced specifically.

An NFT can therefore be understood, in non-technical terms, as a kind of digital exhibit : the allocation of the NFT to its “ owner ” is recorded digitally and is protected against forgery by the decentralised nature of the DLT database.

In principle, NFTs can refer to many different types of assets.

Common use cases are digital artworks, digital (sports) trading cards, or other digital assets ( e.g. music files, videos).

NFTs are also used in virtual realities (“ metaverses ”), for example to document rights to virtual properties within that metaverse.

It is also possible, although less common in practice, to link them to physical objects.

Even if the asset is digital (such as a file), in order to save storage space the asset is usually not stored on the blockchain together with the NFT.

Instead, the NFT contains a link pointing to the asset (“ token URL ”).

The token URL therefore benefits from the security standard guaranteed by the blockchain but the asset itself does not, as it is usually stored at an external location (see below).

The Minting of an NFT The tokenisation of digital assets, i.e. the minting of NFTs, is frequently accomplished via established NFT trading platforms .

On these platforms, the creator of an NFT can provide a file (and, if necessary, upload it to the platform server), and store a token with a link to this file on the respective blockchain used by the platform.

This NFT is assigned to the creator’s “account” , i.e. the creator’s digital address which is assigned to the creator individually as a blockchain participant."
Noerr,Non-Fungible Tokens – Structuring Options and Legal Frameworks,"This NFT is assigned to the creator’s “account” , i.e. the creator’s digital address which is assigned to the creator individually as a blockchain participant.

Initially, the NFT can therefore only be sold or transferred by the creator themselves.

NFTs are typically sold and transferred via a blockchain transaction.

Thus, the process does not differ significantly from transactions in other crypto assets.

On many platforms, an associated smart contract can be defined when minting an NFT.

A smart contract is a set of computer instructions which define the parameters for the tokens to be generated, and their subsequent tradability and transferability.

In a smart contract, for example, the creator can completely exclude the onward transfer of the NFT or define a proportional revenue share in their favour (“ royalty ”).

Each time the NFT is sold, this royalty would then be automatically transferred and credited to the creator in the designated cryptocurrency.

A smart contract can also define the scarcity of NFTs: a freely determinable number of NFT units can be created and each of them is individually trackable via its relevant identification number.

After its creation, the smart contract is also stored on the blockchain and thereby becomes unalterable.

Any transfer of the generated NFTs is then automatically subject to the rules defined in the smart contract.

Protection of the Asset

If the asset is not stored decentrally together with the NFT but only the token URL referring to the asset (as is usually the case when storing on blockchains), the acquirer of the NFT is not protected against a loss of access to the asset, for example as a result of an exchange of the file linked via the token URL, or a loss of data.

The NFT creator could reduce the risk of unauthorised third-party access by storing the asset on a server they operate themselves.

A creator could also add metadata to the relevant NFT, e.g. by giving it a name or describing its properties.

This way, at least a description of the object linked via the token URL can be stored in the NFT.

In order to provide additional protection for highly valuable NFTs, a specific hash value is sometimes calculated from the file linked with the NFT.

This hash value is then only valid for the linked file in its original form and would generally be stored with the NFT as a “ digital fingerprint ” in addition to the token URL.

If one would thereby store the file in a decentralised, publicly accessible database ( e.g. the Interplanetary File System) and thus protect it against tampering, it is as a consequence possible to verify whether the file actually corresponds to the NFT it was linked to at the time of its creation.

Occasionally, the linked file is also handed over to the acquirer of an NFT on a physical data carrier or a physical means of reproduction (such as a digital picture frame).

An NFT does not grant its holder exclusive rights of use or access to the linked asset.

If the NFT refers to a freely accessible file, the holder of the NFT is neither entitled nor technically able to prevent access or reproduction by third parties.

Legal Framework

The acquirer of an NFT does not acquire ownership of the linked asset under civil law , nor do they acquire any corresponding rights of use or other rights ( cf. sect. 

15 seq. and sect. 

44 para. 

1 German Act on Copyright and Related Rights, Urheberrechtsgesetz ).

They merely acquire a registration as the “owner” of the NFT within the used recording system (e.g . the blockchain).

The value of the NFT is thus merely an expression of the “authenticity” certified in it, i.e. its seamless traceability to its creator via the chain of blockchain transactions.

If the acquirer is to acquire rights to the reference object, this has to be agreed separately , for example by concluding a usage or licensing agreement.

It is possible to refer to corresponding contractual terms in the metadata of an NFT."
Noerr,Non-Fungible Tokens – Structuring Options and Legal Frameworks,"It is possible to refer to corresponding contractual terms in the metadata of an NFT.

However, if the contract itself is not stored decentrally together with the NFT, it does not enjoy the protection against loss or modification granted by the blockchain.

All in all, with regard to the legal position acquired by the “owner” of an NFT and the further legal implications, for example from the perspective of copyright law, many questions are still unanswered (see also the Noerr article Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and copyright law of 15 October 2021).

Depending on their specific properties, NFTs may be classified as crypto assets within the meaning of sect. 

1 para. 

11 sentence 1 no. 

10 German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz, “KWG”) or, respectively, sect. 2 para. 

5 no. 

10 German Securities Institutions Act ( Wertpapierinstitutsgesetz, “WpIG”).

Classification as a crypto asset within the meaning of financial regulations may trigger authorisation obligations , e.g. as regulated NFT trading or for providing NFT custody services which could qualify as crypto custody business ( Kryptoverwahrgeschäft ) within the meaning of sect. 

1 para. 

1a sentence 2 no. 

6 KWG.

If applicable, there may also be a license requirement pursuant to sect. 

1 para. 

1a sentence 2 no. 8 KWG ( crypto securities registry management , Kryptowertpapierregisterführung ).

However, the specific regulatory qualification depends on the circumstances of each individual case.

Due to the wide leeway for the creation and specification of NFTs, there is hardly a “one-fits-all” standardised legal approach, also given the fact that the administrative practice of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) in this context is still evolving.

Possible indications for a license requirement may be the use of NFT to generate revenue (in particular, trading with investment expectations in the hope of increasing value) or standardisation of NFTs, e.g. in the case of creating NFTs in fixed number and under conditions which lead to the individual NFTs becoming factually interchangeable (which would ultimately mean that they are no longer NFTs in the true sense).

NFTs can also be relevant from the perspective of capital markets law : depending on their conditions and form, they may be classified as securities (see Art. 4 para. 

1 no. 44 MiFID II Regulation).

Also in this context the essential criteria are whether the acquirers of an NFT act in the expectation of future revenue ( investment function ) and whether there is sufficient standardisation ( tradability ).

Qualification as a security may result in prospectus obligations (pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129) and publication requirements (pursuant to Regulation (EU) 596/2014).

Conclusion While legal parameters and supervisory practice regarding other types of crypto tokens are gradually becoming clearer, the legal framework for the NFT market is noticeably still evolving.

In view of the planned exemption of NFTs from the scope of the MiCA Regulation , an EU-wide, uniform regulatory framework for NFTs cannot be expected in the near future.

Thus, legislators and regulatory administrative practice at the national level will remain authoritative for the time being.

There are a variety of options for modelling NFTs.

Given the proximity of NFTs to regulated business activities, companies should always carefully review the need to comply with financial services or capital markets regulations ."
Noerr,Romania: Hydrogen revolution - Are we there yet?,"It is truly remarkable that in the year 1874, Jules Verne imagined that “water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable”.

After 148 years, Jules Verne’s dream is slowly becoming reality as it is actively acknowledged by global companies, governments and world leaders.

1.

What is hydrogen?

Hydrogen is the lightest chemical element on earth; it is colourless, odourless and non-toxic.

This element is rarely found in isolation in nature since it is not an energy source and therefore must be extracted from molecules ( e.g. water molecules).

The most important characteristic of hydrogen is its versatility, particularly regarding how it is produced and used.

For this reason, hydrogen is produced from all types of energy sources (coal, natural gas, oil, biomass, renewables, nuclear) using many and varied methods including steam reformation, gasification from biomass, electrolysis and pyrolysis.

Hydrogen is often classified using a special colour code to indicate the fuel used for its production.

The colour code can be divided in two categories: (i) Hydrogen based on fossil fuel: Grey hydrogen – produced from coal, lignite, natural gas or methane by way of steam methane reformation releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere (carbon capture and storage (CCS) of GHG is not part of the process).

At the moment, this is the most common method of production.

Blue hydrogen – produced from coal, lignite, natural gas or methane by way of steam methane reformation using CCS technology: carbon is captured and stored during the production process in order to limit the GHG emitted into the atmosphere.

Turquoise hydrogen – produced from coal, lignite, natural gas or methane by way of methane pyrolysis, i.e. methane is split into hydrogen and solid carbon, which limits GHG emissions into the atmosphere.

(ii) Hydrogen based on clean energy sources: Green hydrogen – produced from renewable energy sources by way of water electrolysis; no GHG emissions are released into the atmosphere.

Pink hydrogen – produced using nuclear power by way of electrolysis;  no GHG emissions are released into the atmosphere.

Yellow hydrogen – produced using solar power/energy derived from a mix of renewable and fossil energy sources (there is no expert consensus on the environmental impact of this type of hydrogen).

Hydrogen can be used to carry or store energy so that it can be moved, stored and delivered in various forms.

It can be used in four markets: the natural gas market (hydrogen fed into the transmission/distribution system), the mobility market, the electricity market (hydrogen converted into electricity and fed into the national power grid) or the traditional industrial market.

2. EU regulatory framework Hydrogen will play an important role in pursuing a low-emission, environmentally friendly, cleaner and more sustainable energy system in order to reach climate neutrality by 2050 as required under the European Green Deal policy.

For this reason, the European Union has created a regulatory framework to begin shaping a hydrogen ecosystem supported by valuable financing instruments.

Energy from hydrogen involves a new technology with strong potential to enhance electricity production from renewable energy sources and to act as a means of decarbonizing heavy industries.

Therefore, on 8 July 2020, the European Commission laid the groundwork for the regulation of the European hydrogen market by adopting the “European Hydrogen Strategy”."
Noerr,Romania: Hydrogen revolution - Are we there yet?,"Therefore, on 8 July 2020, the European Commission laid the groundwork for the regulation of the European hydrogen market by adopting the “European Hydrogen Strategy”.

The strategy constitutes a gradual approach to hydrogen scale-up until 2050, as shown below: 2020-2024 (Phase I) : the target of this phase relies on the installation of at least 6 GW of green hydrogen electrolysers in the EU by 2024 that will produce up to one million tonnes of green hydrogen; 2024-2030 (Phase II) : hydrogen technology must be integrated into the energy system and a target of installing at least 40 GW of green hydrogen electrolysers by 2030 and producing up to 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen must be met; 2030-2050 (Phase III) :

green hydrogen technologies should reach maturity and be used on a large scale to reach hard-to-abate sectors where other alternatives might not be feasible or involve higher costs.

On 14 July 2021, the European Commission presented the “Fit for 55” package, which includes several proposals that could support growth in the EU’s hydrogen energy industry.

Such proposals refer primarily to renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs), usually liquid and gaseous renewable hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels used in transportation sectors such as the aviation and maritime industries.

Fast forward to 15 December 2021, when the European Commission (EC) unveiled a package of gas legislation comprised of a (i) “Regulation on the internal market for renewables and natural gases and for hydrogen” and a (ii) “Directive on common rules for the internal market in renewables and natural gases and in hydrogen”.

Both legislative proposals aim to create the optimal conditions for integrating biomethane, hydrogen and other similar renewable and low-carbon-gas fuels into Member States’ energy mix and to create a favourable background for investments and market transactions related to hydrogen.

On 18 May 2022, the EC adopted the REpowerEU Plan to reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports, which will accelerate the development of clean hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels for European markets by changing the clean hydrogen target from 10 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes by 2030.

Subsequently, the EC recently concluded public consultation on the delegated acts of the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001/EU aimed to determine (i) the criteria under which the renewables used in the production of RFNBOs could count as fully renewable and (ii) the computation methodology to determine if such fuels would increase the 70% greenhouse gas emissions savings required by the directive.

3. Available financing opportunities In terms of financing, the EU has put forward various instruments which aim to support the development of hydrogen energy.

At national level, public authorities are currently focused on the absorption of funds under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and the Modernization Fund.

Regarding the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, the Ministry of Energy launched an appeal to support investments in constructing capacities for green hydrogen production through electrolysis.

Romania has a fund of around EUR 150 million available for investment in the production of green hydrogen by electrolysis.

The maximum financing per company which can be granted for an investment project cannot exceed EUR 50 million.

The projects can be submitted until 31 July 2022, but this deadline is expected to be extended.

The Modernisation Fund is a dedicated funding programme to support 10 lower-income EU Member States, including Romania, in their transition to climate-neutrality by helping to modernise their energy systems and improve energy efficiency."
Noerr,Romania: Hydrogen revolution - Are we there yet?,"Activities in the hydrogen energy sector that could be funded via the Modernisation Fund as priority investments include: Generation and use of electricity from renewable sources: production of green hydrogen from renewable electricity, use of hydrogen produced from renewable electricity, zero-direct-emission mobile assets based on renewables (for instance electric green-hydrogen-fuelled trains, trucks or cars).

Improvement of energy efficiency: investment in high-efficiency hydrogen combined heat and power (CHP).

Energy storage and modernisation of energy networks, including district heating pipelines, grids for electricity transmission and increased interconnections between EU countries.

On 9 May 2022, the Romanian Government approved EGO no.

60/2022 regarding the institutional and financial framework for the implementation and management granted to Romania through the Modernization Fund , which ensures the necessary framework to access the funds granted in accordance with this financial instrument under conditions of maximum efficiency.

Overall, the amount granted to Romania is approx.

EUR 15 billion in accordance with the price of allowances on which the Modernization Fund is based.

4. National legislation Many EU countries such as Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands and Norway have published national hydrogen strategies and are currently implementing hydrogen projects.

Romania has not yet published a hydrogen strategy although certain regulatory provisions on hydrogen have been introduced in the energy legislation.

The above-mentioned provisions are limited and not fully aligned with the realities of the four potential hydrogen markets.

Specifically, the legal framework for hydrogen production, storage and transportation must be read in conjunction with a mixture of legal provisions related to energy, dangerous and explosive substances, industrial emissions, environmental, urbanism and construction.

However, these provisions have not been adjusted to hydrogen projects and the application of a general framework might create significant barriers.

Although solutions may be identified in order to implement projects at this current stage of legislative and market development, the permitting process is rather long, with significant burdens.

The Romanian authorities’ support is crucial in the development of hydrogen technologies and related legislation.

It is more a question of who will be first: the legislation or the projects.

Considering the country’s background as well as the PNRR financing scheme mentioned above, it very well might be that pioneering projects will facilitate the enactment of a comprehensive legislation.

(i) Hydrogen Production

The Romanian legislation on hydrogen production began to be developed in 2020, when Electricity and Natural Gas Law no. 123/2012 (the “ Electricity and Natural Gas Law ”) was frequently amended by several pieces of legislation introducing various provisions, such as: The Ministry of Energy is entitled to issue authorizations for the set-up of new hydrogen production capacities on the basis of certain procedures approved by order of the minister – no related procedures have been enacted so far.

The National Energy and Regulatory Authority (“ NERA ”) is entitled to issue licenses for commercial exploitation of hydrogen production installations and authorizations related to the design, execution and use of such facilities.

Hydrogen producers are subsumed under the regulations for natural gas producers.

This sub summation is probably a legislative drafting error; most obligations applicable to natural gas producers are simply incompatible with the production of hydrogen.

It could be concluded that the major downfall of the existing hydrogen production legislation is not separating the four markets on which hydrogen is utilized, as mentioned under Section I above."
Noerr,Romania: Hydrogen revolution - Are we there yet?,"It could be concluded that the major downfall of the existing hydrogen production legislation is not separating the four markets on which hydrogen is utilized, as mentioned under Section I above.

Other applicable requirements Moving forward, it is noteworthy that hydrogen is associated with a chemical, flammable and dangerous gas, and energy legislation must be read in conjunction with the national legislation which transposes related EU directives on chemicals as well as flammable and dangerous gases.

Such national and EU legislation is unclear and inadequate.

This is undoubtedly the result of the historical assumption that production of hydrogen (as an industrial gas) is a chemical process involving emissions, which is not the case when for green hydrogen.

Consequently, legislation designed to regulate large scale, chemical, emission emitting industrial processes ends up applying also to small scale, non-emitting hydrogen projects.

These provisions require  to be properly amended.

More specifically, the main legal provisions indirectly applicable are the following: The control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances risk (SEVESO).

Equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (ATEX).

Operation of boilers, pressure vessels and hoisting equipment if they fill/operate the pressure vessel/cylinder with hydrogen which requires a permit and authorization issued by the State Inspection for Control and Approval of Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Hoisting Equipment (ISCIR).

Industrial emissions (integrated pollution and control – IED).

There is no definition of “industrial scale” in any EU or national legislation.

The term was clarified by the EC, but no quantitative capacity thresholds have been provided, which results in a risk that hydrogen production projects could be subject to legislation that regulates industrial emissions.

Considering that green hydrogen emissions are almost non-existent (0.1%), the application of such legislation does not seem aligned with the actual purpose of clean hydrogen and will require further amendment.

Environmental impact assessment procedures (SEA and EIA); as per the aforementioned, projects involving the production and storage of hydrogen are classified as projects for which the environmental authorities must determine whether they are subject to an environmental impact assessment.

Similarly, with the IED legislation, the application of the environment assessment provisions seems also unintended for green hydrogen (renewable hydrogen) produced via electrolyze.

EU legislation regarding classification, labelling and packaging of substances (CLP Regulation).

Zoning/construction requirements The entire legislative framework related to construction works applies mutatis mutandis to hydrogen production.

In a nutshell, the main steps which must be undertaken are identical to those regarding the development of any onshore energy project, including matters such as PUZ, building permit.

(ii) Hydrogen storage Hydrogen can be stored underground, in salt caverns, in high-pressurized compressed tanks or in chemical compounds.

Almost the entire legislative framework incidentally applicable to hydrogen production (as detailed above) applies mutatis mutandis to hydrogen storage.

As a particularity related to hydrogen storage legislation, it is worth mentioning: The latest national legislation amending the Electricity and Natural Gas Law has introduced the authorization, rights and obligations of a hydrogen terminal operator.

The ATEX legislation which regulates technical conditions and mandatory measures in the design, execution and operation of warehouses holding transportable cylinders or cylinder compressed frames, liquefied or dissolved gases under pressure.

Pressure storage equipment (such as gaseous hydrogen cylinders) must comply with anti-explosive measures and requirements for storage equipment for fuel and compressed gases."
Noerr,Romania: Hydrogen revolution - Are we there yet?,"Pressure storage equipment (such as gaseous hydrogen cylinders) must comply with anti-explosive measures and requirements for storage equipment for fuel and compressed gases.

Hydrogen storage deposits (organized in open spaces and in closed spaces) are subject to mandatory provisions regarding safety distances.

In addition, the latest national legislation amending the Electricity and Natural Gas Law has introduced the authorization, rights and obligations of a hydrogen terminal operator.

(iii) Hydrogen transmission/transportation Due to its versatility, hydrogen can be transported over long distances in a compressed gaseous state by pipeline or in a liquid state via adapted hydrogen terminals or lorries/trucks.

With regard to road transport, which is the most common method of transportation at the moment, the following legal provisions should be considered: European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (“ ADR ”), which includes hydrogen in the list of dangerous goods (Class 2 – Flammable gases); Transportation companies must comply with ADR and the rules implemented in the national technical prescriptions regarding mobile storage equipment; EU and national legislation regarding transportable pressure equipment (TPE Directive);

Hydrogen transport equipment must have certificate of conformity assessments (and certificates of reassessment of conformity, as the case may be) and are subject to periodic inspection, intermediate inspections and exceptional checks.

The legislation in force also provides that certain obligations pertaining to natural gas distributors are applicable to hydrogen.

These obligations refer to feeding hydrogen into the system following a prospective study performed by the distributor and the future conversion of the natural gas distribution system into hydrogen distribution infrastructure.

Moreover, the Electricity and Natural Gas Law provides that NERA is to determine under which conditions hydrogen is to be fed into the existing natural gas transmission/distribution network.

However, no such procedure has been enacted.

(iv) Hydrogen - Refuelling infrastructure for mobility purposes In accordance with national and EU legislation on the use of alternative-fuel infrastructure, hydrogen is recognized as an alternative fuel irrespective of production method.

In 2017, Romania put in place the National Policy Framework for Market Development on Fuel Alternatives in the Transport Sector, which was approved by way of a government decision and enacted Law no.

34/2017 on the installation of infrastructure for fuel alternatives including refueling points with LNG, CNG and hydrogen, which will be further implemented by means of national policy frameworks.

However, there are no provisions in force mentioning a specific number of refueling stations to be developed in a certain amount of time or any guidelines related to their construction requirements.

Therefore, almost the entire legislative framework related to the production and storage of hydrogen – as detailed above – applies mutatis mutandis to hydrogen refueling stations, the following being highlighted: The energy related legislation only for hydrogen refueling stations with on-site production; The SEVESO legislation applies only if a quantity above 5 tonnes can be stored at the hydrogen refueling station location; The IED applies only for hydrogen refueling stations with on-site production; Imposing unreasonable safety distances and other restrictions (such as the fact that hydrogen refueling stations can be constructed in industrial zones) may de facto limit the possibility of co-locating hydrogen in existing refueling stations, thereby making use of existing infrastructure; Application of environmental impact assessment procedures and the related permitting may result in a disproportionate administrative burden."
Noerr,Romania: Hydrogen revolution - Are we there yet?,"In addition, the process itself (involving several permits provided by different authorities that require a great deal of time and effort) imposes high costs and long delays on operators.

In summary, it can be said that Romanian legislation has certain legal and administrative barriers to the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen.

Although solutions can be identified in order to implement projects, at the current stage of legislative and market development, the proper adaptation of the entire legal framework is of utmost importance.

Noerr,Bogus self-employment: Frankfurt Social Court rules bank’s “commercial agent” is employee,"For decades, it has been common practice for retail banks to collaborate with (supposedly) independent financial advisors, who work on the basis of “commercial agent agreements”.

Some banks have more than 100 financial agencies with over 1,000 financial advisors and millions of clients.

One major advantage of this business model is that instead of paying a flat-rate salary and social insurance contributions, the banks pay the financial advisors commission, which is free of social insurance contributions, which is only due when the advisors act as intermediaries for the bank or conclude transactions on its behalf.

The banks also do not pay social insurance contributions because their financial advisors are contractually self-employed.

However, this is subject to the proviso that the financial advisors are actually self-employed.

That is where Frankfurt Social Court got involved, reaching the opposite conclusion: It ruled that the financial advisor in question was an employee, and social insurance contributions were payable on his salary.

Facts The financial advisor worked for the bank for just under two and half years.

According to the commercial agent agreement signed at the start of his work, the financial advisor was a commercial agent pursuant to section 84(1)

German Commercial Code (HGB), as a self-employed intermediary who has continuing authority to negotiate transactions on behalf of another entrepreneur (the “principal”) or to conclude transactions in the latter’s name.

The commercial agent agreement also contained the corresponding wording.

The claimant agreed to register the financial advisor with BaFin (“Federal Financial Supervisory Authority”) as a contractually bound intermediary pursuant to section 2(10) German Banking Act.

The financial advisor agreed to inform clients and potential clients about his status as a contractually bound intermediary before starting his intermediation work and to tell them without undue delay if that status changed.

The financial advisor agreed to report on his sales activities to the bank and adhere to the bank’s latest applicable financial information and guidelines at all times.

Regarding contact with clients and potential clients, he agreed to use the stationery, business cards, accompanying notes and the like provided to him by the bank.

The bank also provided him with product-related advertising materials and product descriptions free of charge for the purpose of his intermediation activities.

The financial advisor agreed to take out a particular professional liability insurance policy with a certain insured sum.

Every business activity had to be conducted using an account to which the bank had unrestricted access with regard to any claims for recovery of overpaid commission.

As part of the performance of the agreement, the financial advisor was free to hire employees or to work for third parties, as long as it was not a competitive activity.

The financial advisor took over a defined geographical work territory which had no territorial or client protection.

The financial advisor was provided with a laptop and the corresponding software free of charge, with support provided by a company commissioned by the claimant.

The tables and conditions the financial advisor’s commission was based on could be changed unilaterally by the bank if required by legal provisions, official stipulations or for reasons of business policy.

The financial advisor was assigned to a financial agency, and the agency manager (who had also signed a commercial agent agreement with the claimant) received some of the commission earned by the financial advisors assigned to him.

The financial advisor claimed he had kept to the bank’s opening hours and had even had to arrive earlier on Thursdays because of team meetings.

When ill, he had to report to the bank’s branch manager and organise a substitute from among his colleagues who also worked at the bank branch."
Noerr,Bogus self-employment: Frankfurt Social Court rules bank’s “commercial agent” is employee,"When ill, he had to report to the bank’s branch manager and organise a substitute from among his colleagues who also worked at the bank branch.

A few months before the end of his work, the financial advisor applied to the German Pension Insurance Association (DRV Bund) for an assessment that he was an employee of the bank with compulsory social insurance payable on his salary.

In a status assessment procedure according to section 7a German Social Code vol. 4, DRV Bund took the same legal view and made the corresponding assessment.

In its action, the bank requested that the DRV Bund’s determination be set aside and that it be found instead that the financial advisor was self-employed.

Ruling Frankfurt Social Court dismissed the claim in its ruling on 8 March 2021 (case S 18 BA 93/18).

The financial advisor was not self-employed, the Court said, but an employee.

Under the law, there is a clear rule for distinguishing between commercial agents and employees, i.e. 2nd sentence of section 84(1)

German Commercial Code, and that rule existed long before the adoption of section 611a German Civil Code.

According to that rule, a commercial agent can only be self-employed, i.e. someone who is essentially able to arrange their activities freely and to determine their working hours.

The court referred to the established case law of the Federal Social Court on the difference between employment and self-employment under social security law.

Employment requires the employee to be integrated into the company and bound by professional instructions; the outcome of the assessment is based on the overall view of the work done.

The basis is the content of the contract.

However, if there are deviations between the content of the contract and its actual implementation, the latter prevails.

With reference to the case law of the Federal Social Court (ruling of 29 January 1981, case 12 RK 63/79), the court stated that according to those principles, commercial agents can be required to follow instructions from the company for which they work.

However, to distinguish the commercial agent from a regular employee pursuant to section 59 German Commercial Code, the instructions must not be so strict that the commercial agent’s core entrepreneurial freedom is impaired by the resulting restrictions.

In the court’s overall assessment, the indications of self-employment, primarily the title of commercial agent in the contract and the performance-based commission agreement, were less important.

For example, the indication of the performance-based commission agreement was diminished by the fact that the bank was able to unilaterally change the tables and conditions the financial advisor’s commission was based on.

The court found the “business policy reasons” (“geschäftspolitische Gründe”) for making such a change were “very vague” (“höchst unbestimmt”).

The court also found the content of the contract was outweighed by the actual execution of the contract, meaning that the financial advisor had been integrated into the bank’s operations.

The court justified this by pointing to the structures and hierarchies created by the bank (“reporting and accountability cascade”), with the result that the financial advisors in the agencies indirectly received job instructions from the regional manager.

The court also considered the request to sell more of certain products and the resulting accountability incompatible with the independence of a financial advisor.

According to Frankfurt Social Court, the fact the financial advisor was able to maintain his own place of business under the contract did not stop him being integrated into the bank’s business.

Without attending the agency in person, it would not have been possible for the financial advisor to earn commission as there was no territorial and client protection, since it was only his specific sales intermediation work that mattered."
Noerr,Bogus self-employment: Frankfurt Social Court rules bank’s “commercial agent” is employee,"He was thus forced to be present during the agency’s opening hours in order to have the opportunity to come into contact with the bank’s clients and to be able to sell them products.

As the financial advisor continued to use the premises formerly used as a “branch”, according to Frankfurt Social Court the bank had created an environment in which the financial advisors appeared to clients to be representatives of the bank.

The entire design of the agency, the placement of the illuminated logo on the outside and the images in the corporate design gave the impression to every customer that it was a normal bank branch.

From the perspective of an average customer, the fact that a poster in the agency window stated the agents were self-employed and that they wore a name badge stating that they were self-employed was completely secondary to the other exterior and interior design features.

The financial advisor’s specialist knowledge required for selling was provided only through the bank.

The financial advisor was also not free to choose either his professional liability insurance or his account.

In general, there was no apparent entrepreneurial risk on the part of the financial advisor, as he had neither his own place of business nor his own staff, did not use his own operating resources or advertising materials and was not exposed to any liability risk for poor performance.

The judgment is not yet final.

The bank in question has lodged an appeal against it.

Outlook and impact on advisory services The judgment relates to the distinction between an employee and a commercial agent, which is not new in itself.

It not only plays a role in the relationship between banks and their financial advisors, but whenever a commercial agency agreement is entered into with a natural person.

The ruling of Frankfurt Social Court shows that the overall assessment of the circumstances of the individual case is required and that there are various individual circumstances that support or negate self-employment.

Therefore, a clear categorisation is not always easy in practice.

When structuring the work of the commercial agent who is meant to work on a self-employed basis, it is important to prevent shortcomings in particular with regard to operational integration and dependence on job instructions and thus the environment the services are to be rendered in.

On the other hand, the legal model of the commercial agent’s work, as set out starting from section 84 German Commercial Code, must also be taken into account.

For example, in its judgment of 20 September 2000 (case 5 AZR 271/99), Germany’s Federal Labour Court ruled with regard to an insurance agent that being subject to a professional instructions does not in itself run counter to his self-employed status.

This is correct because according to sections 92 and 86 German Commercial Code, an insurance agent (commercial agent) also has to follow instructions.

But if there exists a person-specific and process-based right to issue instructions with regard to the circumstances the service is to be provided in, this supports the argument that the person is not self-employed.

This means that it always depends on the overall circumstances in the individual case.

As the bank has filed an appeal against Frankfurt Social Court’s decision, it remains to be seen how the next instance, Hesse Social Court (case L 8 BA 36/21), will rule in the specific case.

Noerr,EU’s new Blue Guide – Interpretation guidance for legal practice?,"On 29 June 2022, the EU Commission published the Guide on the implementation of the product rules 2022 ( Blue Guide ) in the Official Journal of the EU.

The legally non-binding guidance document on the EU’s product law harmonisation rules is intended as an interpretation aid for authorities and economic operators.

However, its application is still not straightforward.

To the extent that the guidance document simply repeats the legal text of the European harmonisation regulations, it offers only limited benefits to economic operators.

Where the EU Commission expands legal definitions or areas of application beyond the wording of the relevant legal provisions under the guise of “interpretative guidance” (most recently, for example, in interpreting the concept of placing on the market in online trade), it is claiming legislative powers it does not have.

The Guide’s own reference to its legally non-binding nature sometimes comes across as a formulaic disclaimer in view of its frequently unquestioned use, even in the official environment.

The revision of the document, which was last updated in 2016, had become necessary because the European legislator has since enacted numerous new legal provisions that have made the explanations in the previous version obsolete or in need of adaptation.

In addition, there are the special difficulties with product compliance in Europe due to Brexit.

The main changes compared to the previous version from 20216 cover the following topics: EU Market Surveillance Regulation (EU) 2019/1020

The new EU Market Surveillance Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 replaces Regulation (EC) No. 765/2008 and harmonises the enforcement work of market surveillance authorities in the surveillance of non-food products across Europe for the first time since 16 July 2021.

From a legal perspective, this was welcome.

Numerous rules in that Regulation were previously found in the old version of the Blue Guide – sometimes difficult to find, awkwardly worded and legally non-binding.

While these rules are now binding throughout Europe, they were previously considered wishful thinking by the EU Commission in the application of the law.

See our news article of 9 July 2021 for the main points of the Market Surveillance Regulation.

The Guide therefore looks extensively at the EU legislator’s response in the Market Surveillance Regulation to the huge challenge of e-commerce, which until recently the market surveillance authorities in Europe were largely powerless and lacking the authority to tackle.

End users, material change and intended use As long as you always keep in mind the non-committal nature of the EU Commission’s pronouncements, the new Blue Guide certainly contains helpful interpretative approaches.

For example, the issue of when a product that has been substantially changed since it was placed on the market can be regarded as a new product and has to comply with the provisions of the legislation in force at the time when it placed on the market again.

The comments on the reasonably foreseeable use and intended use of a product are also interesting.

The new Blue Guide states that for products intended for outdoor use, consideration should be given to how predictions of climate change in the EU could affect the safety and performance of the product during use.

For the first time, the Blue Guide also attempts to define the term “end user”, which is hugely important in EU product law but is not legally defined.

According to the EU Commission, this means any natural or legal person resident or established in the Union to whom a product is made available, either as a consumer outside of its industrial, business, trade or professional activity or as a professional end user as part of its commercial or professional activity.

If the legislator had integrated this definition into the relevant legal acts (such as the EMC Directive 2014/30/EU), its applicability to purely B2B components might be clearer."
Noerr,EU’s new Blue Guide – Interpretation guidance for legal practice?,"If the legislator had integrated this definition into the relevant legal acts (such as the EMC Directive 2014/30/EU), its applicability to purely B2B components might be clearer.

Cross-border activity and accreditation of conformity assessment bodies The Blue Guide also contains a new specification of the opportunities for conformity assessment bodies to delegate certain tasks to subcontractors.

It also clarifies that under certain conditions these bodies can also carry out activities outside the Member State they are established in and maintain staff there, and explains how the cross-border assessment of competence (known as accreditation) can be done.

Mutual recognition within and outside the EU Of course, the new Blue Guide also takes into account Regulation (EU) 2019/515 on the mutual recognition of goods, which has been in force since 19 April 2020 – a widely underestimated piece of legislation that replaced the corresponding rules from Regulation (EC)

No 764/2008.

In the non-European context, the new Guide also provides some background on the Protocol on Mutual Recognition of Results of Conformity Assessment foreseen under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).

This will make it easier for the EU and Canada to export goods through the mutual recognition of conformity assessment certificates.

As a result of Brexit, which took place on 1 February 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the EU, but a “third country” under European law.

The withdrawal agreement provided for a transition period ending on 31 December 2020.

In this context, the new Blue Guide contains explanations on the legal consequences of Brexit, including the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) concluded between the EU and the United Kingdom on 24 December 2020, which has been provisionally applicable since 1 January 2021.

In the context of Brexit, the new Blue Guide also provides explanations of the Northern Ireland protocol, applicable since 1 January 2021, which states that some provisions of EU law are also applicable to the United Kingdom and in the United Kingdom in relation to Northern Ireland.

Products imported from third countries that are not (yet) compliant

Fortunately, the new Blue Guide for the first time expresses itself very clearly on the practically relevant question of whether it is admissible to import products that are not yet compliant into the EU.

Products that have entered the territory of the Union and require further processing there in order to comply with the Union’s harmonisation legislation may be transferred to an appropriate customs procedure that allows such processing.

However, the products may not be released for free circulation until they comply with the rules.

This clarification of the legal situation, which is admittedly not new, will be useful to some product importers in future in their frequent disputes with the customs and market surveillance authorities.

Conclusion – Practical interpretation guidance for economic operators?

Since its update, the EU Commission’s Blue Guide is still the most well known and generally accessible interpretation aid for the European harmonisation regulations on non-food products.

The practical benefit is primarily that it prepares the essential regulatory subjects of the European legislation on non-food products for the reader in a thematically structured form and thus makes the legal texts more accessible, especially for the legal layman.

However, the Guide does not offer a genuine interpretation of the legal provisions based on the case law of the courts and the enforcement practice of the European authorities.

This task will therefore have to be taken on in the future by the technical legal literature and the legal commentaries on the key legal provisions, so that companies can make legally reliable decisions in grey areas regarding the marketability of their products."

Noerr,EU on the verge of imposing controls on foreign subsidies,"Companies should prepare for comprehensive new regulatory requirements There have long been concerns in the EU that subsidies granted by non-EU Member States to companies operating in the EU (“foreign subsidies”) affect the level playing field in the internal market.

This is because investments by third-country companies (including those controlled by third countries) in the EU have increased rapidly in recent years.

These companies may be able to benefit from advantages in terms of state support that EU Member States cannot give to “their” companies as a result of stricter requirements under EU State aid law.

At the same time, the European Commission (“Commission”) believes that foreign subsidies cannot be adequately regulated by the existing tools of EU State aid, merger control, public procurement and foreign trade law,.

In May 2021, the Commission therefore published a proposal for a regulation on the basis of which such foreign subsidies could be regulated (“Proposal”) ( see our article on the Proposal here ).

The aim of the Proposal is to create a level playing field between all companies operating in the EU’s internal market.

Status of developments - what is imminent?

The Proposal was discussed in the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (“Council”) after its publication.

At the beginning of May 2022, both institutions adopted their positions for the upcoming trilogue negotiations with the Commission.

Both the European Parliament and the Council support the Proposal for the regulation and only expressed a desire for coordination and negotiation on specific aspects (such as the applicable turnover thresholds for a notification requirement for a foreign subsidy and also the applicable deadlines).

On 30 June 2022, the Council of the EU has now made public a provisional political agreement with the European Parliament .

According to the agreement, the thresholds proposed by the Commission in the Proposal were unanimously adopted.

However, the period for the retrospective review of foreign subsidies is set at five years.

The Commission had originally envisaged ten years.

The provisional agreement reached must now be formally approved by the Council and the European Parliament.

Provided that the regulation is formally adopted before the end of the year, it could enter into force in the next few months.

What are the key points of the draft?

The existing draft regulation provides for three tools to review the compatibility of foreign subsidies with the internal market: A notification-based investigation tool for transactions – Mergers and the establishment of joint ventures will now be able to be examined for possible influence by foreign subsidies.

To this end, EU-based companies will be obliged to notify such transactions to the Commission under the following conditions: 1) The undertakings concerned exceed an aggregate turnover threshold of €500 million; and 2)

The companies have together received more than €50 million in financial contributions from third countries in the three previous years.

A notification-based investigation tool for bids for large public contracts A general investigation tool – Even in other situations where there is no formal obligation to notify, the Commission will be able to investigate ex officio whether there are potentially distorting foreign subsidies.

Information on potential distortions can come from any source, meaning that complaints from competitors in particular will in all likelihood become a crucial feature.

In both a notification and an ex officio investigation, the draft regulation then requires the Commission to examine the extent to which the foreign subsidies in question distort competition in the internal market.

In doing so, it can examine subsidies granted up to five years before the regulation enters into force and which still cause distortions in the internal market after its entry into force."
Noerr,EU on the verge of imposing controls on foreign subsidies,"In doing so, it can examine subsidies granted up to five years before the regulation enters into force and which still cause distortions in the internal market after its entry into force.

To this end, the draft regulation provides the Commission with far-reaching investigative tools (including requests for information and even inspections of the companies concerned) and the power to impose redressive measures, with infringements being punishable by fines.

At the end of a possible in-depth investigation, the Commission is to take a decision on the compatibility of the foreign subsidy with a level playing field on the internal market, which may include steps such as the prohibition of a planned transaction or also redressive measures.

Failure to comply with the requirements of the regulation may have serious consequences.

If companies do not adhere to the requirements, they can be fined up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover.

If a distortion of the internal market is established, this can lead to a completed transaction being prohibited or an order to reverse it being issued.

Outlook The planned regulation should be of great interest to all companies operating in the EU.

In particular, companies possibly receiving some form of foreign support should familiarise themselves with the draft regulation and the associated regulatory requirements.

A key task for companies when preparing for the regulation’s entry into force will be to make information on financial contributions received from government bodies centrally accessible in internal lists or databases.

Another reason for companies to familiarise themselves with the Proposal is the possibility to use the regulation against competitors who may have been unduly advantaged by foreign subsidies.

This is because the Commission will be dependent on information from the business community when enforcing the planned regulation.

The planned regulation will also have a considerable impact on transactions and transaction management.

This is because, in addition to possible notifications for merger and investment control purposes, and where applicable under State aid law, capacities and above all time must be allocated for possible notifications of foreign subsidies in the future.

The effort involved in coordinating this is likely to be considerable.

Against the backdrop of the current status of the legislative process, companies should now adapt very quickly.

With the political compromise that has now been reached, the EU has made it clear that controls on foreign subsidies is not far off.

The Commission intends to enforce these controls rigorously – it has announced that more staff are planned for overseeing the enforcement of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation than for the application of the much-discussed Digital Markets Act."
Noerr,Significance of register cases– deadline for exemptions extended again,"The German Federal Ministry of Finance has extended the deadline for applying for retrospective exemption certificates for income from registered foreign rights (“register cases” ( Registerfälle ))

by one year (now until 30 June 2023).

It has done this for the second time in a row, just before the time limit was about to end.

But let’s start at the beginning: What exactly are “register cases” and why has the Federal Ministry of Finance published four circulars on them in the last two and a half years?

The whole topic is in fact based on the almost 100-year-old rule contained in section 49(1)(2)(f) of the Income Tax Act ( Einkommensteuergesetz – EStG).

It took until late 2020 for the Ministry’s circular dated 6 November 2020 to clarify the administrative interpretation regarding the application of this provision to extraterritorial royalties (“register cases”).

These are royalties from licences for which neither the party owing the payment nor the recipient is domiciled in Germany.

The only link to Germany is the entry of the rights in a German public record or register.

Under section 49(1)(2)(f) of the German Income Tax Act, the royalty payments relating to these rights are subject to limited tax liability.

They are taxed using the tax deduction process as stated in section 50a Income Tax Act.

In this process, the party making the payment is essentially required to withhold, declare and pay 15% withholding tax on the royalties on the recipient’s behalf.

The Ministry’s circular dated 11 February 2021 discussed the possibility of giving the recipient the option not only to apply for relief from German withholding tax pursuant to section 50a(1)(3) Income Tax Act where a double taxation treaty provides for full or partial exemption from withholding tax on the income earned in Germany, but also to apply for exemption for periods in the past, in analogy to no. 1 of the first sentence of section 50c(2) of the Income Tax Act.

It was possible to file this retrospective application by 30 September 2021 using a simplified procedure.

The application simply had to be received by the Federal Central Tax Office by the deadline of 30 September 2021 to ensure that all payments remitted until this date were exempted from withholding tax.

The Ministry even went on to improve on this in its circular dated 14 July 2021 , extending the deadline for retrospective applications by nine months until 30 June 2022.

The significance of the register cases has now become clear once again: the deadline for retrospective applications has once again been extended by a year now until 30 June 2023 – one day before the deadline was to expire – in the Ministry’s circular dated 29 June 2022 .

This means that applications can also be made to the Federal Central Tax Office up to and including 30 June 2023 using the simplified procedure for payments received after 30 June 2022.

The application must be filed by 30 June 2023 in order to be eligible.

It remains to be seen whether the Federal Ministry of Finance will decide to extend the time limit again before the end of June 2023 or whether it will take a different view of the treatment of the registered foreignrights referred to in section 49(1)(2)(f) Income Tax Act.

Legal scholars not only express major constitutional concerns, but also raise doubts as to how such cases are implemented and reviewed.

Some also argue that the rules are contrary to principles recognised under customary international law.

If you have cases similar to this in your company, we would be happy to assist you in handling and applying for retrospective exemptions."
Noerr,Stricter notification obligations in employment relationships,"Almost 2 years ago, on 31 July 2019, the European Directive (EU) 2019/1152 on transparent and predictable working conditions in the European Union came into force, which must be transposed into national law by 31 July 2022.

The core aim of this directive is to promote ""more transparent and predictable employment"" while ensuring the adaptability of the labour market.

Just in time, on 23 June 2022, the German parliament (Bundestag) passed an act to transpose Directive (EU) 2019/1152 into national law, which will enter into force very soon, on 1 August 2022.

The parliament’s resolution has the greatest impact on a law that so far has not been particularly relevant in practice, the German Act on Notification of Conditions of Employment (Notification Act – Nachweisgesetz) .

This has far-reaching consequences for drafting employment contracts , especially since a violation of the Notification Act will soon even constitute an administrative offence punishable by a fine.

This calls for swift action.

I. Current legal situation In its current version, the Notification Act already provides for a number of obligations on the part of employers to notify their employees of their working conditions, although these have not been very prominent in labour law practice to date.

For example, an employer has been obliged to document the essential contractual conditions in writing no later than one month after the agreed commencement of the employment relationship, to sign the document and to hand it over to the employee.

These conditions included those that are usually found in written employment contracts: the name and address of the contracting parties, the commencement date of the employment relationship, the foreseeable duration of the employment relationship in the case of fixed-term employment relationships, the workplace and working hours, a brief characterisation or description of the work as well as the components and amount of the remuneration, the amount of annual leave and the termination notice period.

There were also special obligations for notification of employees to be sent on foreign assignments.

Before departing, such an employee had to be notified in writing of not only the information required under the general notification obligations but also how long the assignment abroad was to last, the currency in which the remuneration was to be paid, additional remuneration and benefits in kind associated with the assignment abroad as well as the conditions under which the employee would return.

The purpose of the notification obligations is to provide employees with reliable information on the content of their employment contracts.

However, the notification obligations under the Notification Act are not constitutive; as protection for the employee, the employment relationship enters into effect even if the employer does not provide the notification in time.

Up to now, if an employer has not complied with its obligations under the Notification Act, an employee could assert a claim for performance against the employer, i.e. demand that the employer provide a written document of the essential conditions of the contract as required under the Notification Act.

Some employees have also been able to claim damages if they have suffered financial loss as a direct result of the employer's breach of its obligations under the Notification Act, although this has been extremely rare in practice.

Until now, employers who violated the Notification Act have not been subject to a fine.

II.

What will be different now The amendments to the Notification Act that have been adopted and will come into force on 1 August 2022 will expand and supplement existing notification obligations and set down further minimum requirements for certain working conditions.

The previously applicable deadlines for providing proof will be shortened.

Employers that do not meet the deadlines or provide the evidence correctly will now face severe penalties."
Noerr,Stricter notification obligations in employment relationships,"The previously applicable deadlines for providing proof will be shortened.

Employers that do not meet the deadlines or provide the evidence correctly will now face severe penalties.

Violations of the notification obligations may result in a fine of up to EUR 2,000 per violation .

1.

Additional notification obligations In addition to the previously applicable obligations to notify employees of their essential working conditions, new obligations have been added to the list.

For example, in addition to the essential terms and conditions of employment previously provided for in the Notification Act, either the ending date or the foreseeable duration of a fixed-term employment relationship and the duration of any agreed probationary period must be documented.

Likewise, the components and amount of remuneration, including overtime pay, supplements, allowances and bonuses, as well as any special payments, must be stated separately.

The type and due date of each payment must also be included.

Breaks and time between working days as well as any shift system, the shift rhythm and the prerequisites for shift changes are also components of the notification obligation.

Another significant change is that the required notification regarding notice of termination, which already includes notice periods, must now also include documentation of the procedure to be followed (by both employer and employee) when giving notice of termination .

In future, the documentation of the essential contractual conditions must therefore contain at least information on the written form requirement for termination as well as the notice periods applicable to the parties by law, collective agreement or individual contract.

In the case of a probationary period, the length of the shortened notice period must also be documented.

But that is not all.

Employers must also inform employees that, if they are dismissed, they have three weeks in which to bring any action for unfair dismissal according to section 4 of the German Act on protection against dismissal (Kündigungsschutzgesetz) .

However, the legislator correctly clarifies in the explanatory memorandum to the law that a dismissal by an employer is not invalidated by an incorrect or omitted reference to the time limit for bringing an action.

Instead, the preclusive effect of section 7 of the Act on protection against dismissal is to apply even in the case of omitted or incorrect notification, which means that the three-week period for bringing an action for protection against unfair dismissal continues to apply.

Now it will also be compulsory to provide notification of the scope of the employee’s right to participate in training provided by the employer, whether overtime can be required; and the pension fund or provider if there is a company pension commitment.

If an employee works abroad for more than four consecutive weeks , the notification obligations are extended further and made more detailed.

The employer must also document in writing the country or countries in which the work abroad is to be performed, the planned duration of the assignment, if agreed, any cash or non-cash benefits associated with the stay abroad, in particular reimbursable secondment allowances and travel, food and accommodation expenses, whether the employee is to return and if so, the conditions of the employee’s return.

The scope of application of the Notification Act will also be extended .

The previous exception for temporary workers hired for a maximum of one month no longer applies – in future, it will apply to all employees .

2. Shortened deadlines The previous deadline of one month after commencement of employment for documenting the essential terms and conditions of employment will now also be significantly shortened."
Noerr,Stricter notification obligations in employment relationships,"2. Shortened deadlines The previous deadline of one month after commencement of employment for documenting the essential terms and conditions of employment will now also be significantly shortened.

On the first day of work at the latest, information on the name and address of the contracting parties, the components and amount of the remuneration and the agreed working hours must be documented in writing.

No later than seven days after the work commences , conditions such as the starting date of the employment relationship, the duration of the probationary period and the agreed fixed term as well as the workplace, job description and overtime arrangements must be documented.

For the remaining conditions , the one-month period remains in force.

However, to simplify the process, it is advisable to include all the information required by the Notification Act in the written employment contract and – as is customary – to have both parties sign it by hand before the work commences and to hand an original written employment contract to the employee.

If the essential contractual conditions change in an existing employment relationship, it will no longer be sufficient to notify the employee of the change at the latest one month after the change (section 3 Notification Act, old version).

In future, the changes will have to be communicated to the employee in writing on the day they become effective .

3. New: penalties for violations The most noticeable change in the Notification Act is now found in the new section 4, which states that violation of an employer’s obligations under the Notification Act will constitute an administrative offence.

A fine of up to EUR 2,000 may be imposed for each violation if the employer fulfils its notification obligation either not at all, incorrectly, in the wrong form, incompletely or not in good time.

Especially in view of the newly introduced penalties, it is advisable to comply with the shortest of the abovementioned deadlines for notification of the essential working conditions and to hand over to the employee the written essential working conditions on the first day of work at the latest.

However, it remains the case that the notification obligations are not constitutive, and a violation of the notification obligations does not affect the validity of the employment relationship as such.

4.

Still no digitalisation in sight Although the European Directive on transparent and foreseeable working conditions in the European Union explicitly allows for drafting working conditions and making them available to employees in electronic form, the new German law does not.

Thus, as before, the Notification Act requires that the essential terms and conditions of employment be provided in written form .

This means that, in order to fulfil their obligations under the Notification Act, an employer will still have to document the terms and conditions of employment on paper, sign them by hand and hand them over to the employee.

It will remain insufficient to provide the signed conditions to the employee in the form of a scan or to merely sign them digitally .

5.

Additional changes a) German Act on Temporary Agency Work The legislator is also amending the German Act on Temporary Agency Work ( Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz ).

For example, the notification obligations set down in section 11 will be extended to include the obligation to notify the worker of the name of the client .

The temporary worker must now be informed of the client’s company name and address in text form before each In addition, clients will be obliged to provide temporary workers who have been posted to them for at least six months and who express their wish to conclude an employment contract with a reasoned reply in text form within one month.

However, the legislator leaves open the content and scope of the reasoned reply."
Noerr,Stricter notification obligations in employment relationships,"However, the legislator leaves open the content and scope of the reasoned reply.

b) Part-Time Work and Fixed-Term Employment Act The German Part-Time Work and Fixed-Term Employment Act ( Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz ) will also be amended as on 1 August 2022:

Any probationary period agreed upon in a fixed-term employment relationship must now be in reasonable proportion to the duration of the fixed-term employment relationship and the type of work.

This is likely to have the strongest effect on short fixed-term contracts, in which a probationary period of six months, which has been permissible up to now, may no longer be permissible in the future and may instead only be permitted to have a duration of a few weeks or months.

Employees with fixed-term contracts who have been working for an employer for more than six months will be permitted to inform their employer of their wish to establish a permanent employment relationship.

The employer will then be obliged to give the employee a reasoned reply in text form within one month.

Here, too, the legislator leaves open the content and scope of the reasoned reply.

c) Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act The Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act (Gewerbeordnung) has also been amended.

According to its section 111, it is not permissible to charge employees for the costs of training if their employer is obliged by or on the basis of a law, collective agreement or company agreement to offer the training.

Such training is to take place during working hours.

If and to the extent it must take place outside of working hours, it is to be regarded as working hours.

6.

Reference to collective agreements still possible The notification of the essential terms and conditions of employment can still be replaced by a reference to the collective agreements applicable to the employment relationship, such as collective agreements, works agreements and service agreements.

The prerequisite for this, however, is that the relevant collective agreement contains a corresponding provision on the essential terms and conditions of employment.

Employers should act now These changes mean that there is now an urgent need to adapt any employment contract templates used by employers.

When revising the templates, care should be taken – all the more than before in view of the susceptibility to fines – to ensure that all the information required by the Notification Act is included.

What is the situation for older contracts?

The good news is that contracts concluded before 1 August 2022 do not have to be amended.

However, employers are obliged to provide their employees with the essential terms and conditions of their employment in writing within seven days upon request.

In view of this very short time period, it is advisable to prepare for such a case by keeping on hand a corresponding template of the essential contractual conditions that meets the requirements of the amended Notification Act ."
Noerr,DPMA Annual Report 2021: China Continues in the Fast Lane,"The German Patent and Trademark Office ( Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt , „DPMA“ for short) published its annual report 2021 in May 2022.

It contains detailed data on application numbers, rankings, and current technology trends.

The number of decisions to grant was at a record level in 2021, with positive decisions for 21,113 inventions.

This represents an increase of 22% compared to the previous year.

The total number of new patent applications decreased by 5.7% to 58,568 filings but remained at a high level.

With regard to the origin of applications, the share of filings from Germany remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at 68%.

In addition to a particularly strong increase in filings from France (+30.7%), there was also a particular increase in filings from China (+13.8%).

In all technology fields related to digitalisation, the number of published German patent applications by Chinese applicants increased significantly compared to the previous year.

The DPMA groups patent applications in technology areas and technology fields.

In the technology area of digitalisation, the largest number of filings fell into the technology field of computer technology (15,492 applications with an increase of +6.3%), knocking the technology field of digital communication technology (+1.4%) from its top position from the previous year.

Inventions using artificial intelligence and/or machine learning play a major role in this field.

Here, too, Chinese applicants are prominently represented; with 2,017 applications, China is not yet in the same league as the USA (5,943 applications) in the technology field of computer technology, but can report an increase of 33.3% compared with the previous year and overtook Germany and Japan in absolute filing numbers since 2020.

The number of filings from the U.S. increased by 5.1%.

The fastest-growing technology field in digitalisation since 2020 was audiovisual technology (+9.3%).

Here, China grew by as much as 42% and, with 1,055 applications, is close on the heels of the USA (1,234 applications) in absolute terms.

In the technology field of ""digital communications technology"", which covers in particular inventions in connection with the 5G mobile communications standard, China even managed to surpass the USA (4,115 applications at -2.4%) for the first time, taking the lead with 4,308 applications (+6.8%)."
Noerr,Federal Supreme Court: Avoiding preclusion does not require first instance auxiliary requests by patentee after advantageous qualified indicative ruling by Federal Patent Court,"In its decision of March 15, 2022 ( X ZR 18/20 ), the German Federal Supreme Court ruled that a patentee may rely on a qualified indicative ruling of the Federal Patent Court confirming patentability under Section 83 (1) PatG, to the effect that auxiliary requests under Section 116 (2) No. 1 Alt. 2 PatG are eligible for consideration if they are filed for the first time in the appellate instance.

The patentee may lack cause to file auxiliary requests already in the first instance due to a qualified indicative ruling which is advantageous for him.

I. Background Section 116 (2) PatG threatens the patentee with preclusion of auxiliary requests filed for the first time in the appellate instance.

For the patentee, this leads to the question whether he shall file auxiliary requests even after a qualified indicative ruling by the Federal Patent Court that is positive for him, in order to avoid preclusion in the appellate instance.

II.

Decision In the case now decided by the Federal Supreme Court, the patentee had not filed any auxiliary requests following a qualified indicative ruling that was positive for him, and lost in the first instance.

The invalidity plaintiff held that the patentee’s auxiliary requests filed for the first time in the appellate instance were inadmissible.

The Federal Supreme Court ruled in favour of the patentee.

It held that auxiliary requests filed for the first time in the appellate instance are not expedient and therefore not eligible for consideration under Section 116 (2) No. 1 Alt. 2 PatG, insofar as a patentee already had cause to file the auxiliary requests in the first instance.

However, such cause may be lacking where the Federal Patent Court expresses the opinion in its qualified indicative ruling that the subject-matter of the attacked claim is patentable.

In the case decided, therefore, auxiliary requests could permissibly be filed, at least within the time limit for filing the grounds of appeal.

III.

Appraisal The decision reduces the pressure on patentees to draft auxiliary requests in nullity proceedings even after a positive qualified indicative ruling.

In principle, the preclusion rule of Section 116 PatG does not compel this.

Still, it will often be advisable in practice to draft and file auxiliary requests already in the first instance, even if the Federal Supreme Court has issued a positive statement.

In particular, the Federal Supreme Court indicates in its decision that cause to file auxiliary requests in the first instance may also result from new submissions of the invalidity plaintiff after a positive qualified indicative ruling.

The Federal Supreme Court leaves open the standard as to when the threshold for negligence relevant to preclusion is exceeded."
Noerr,The EU’s sixth sanctions package in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine,"Introductory remarks On 03 June 2022, the European Union passed its sixth sanctions package in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

This round of sanctions had been especially fiercely debated between member States, with disagreements over the modalities of a (partial) oil embargo holding up implementation for almost one month.

Once again, the new measures aim to limit the abilities of the Russian government to finance the war.

With the sixth package, again, Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (amending acts here and here ) and Regulation (EU)

No 765/2006 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Belarus and the involvement of Belarus in the Russian aggression against Ukraine (amending acts here and here ) are being amended.

This extension of the sanctions provides for, inter alia, a partial oil embargo, the “de-SWIFTing” of Sberbank and other three Russian banks as well as the Belarusian Belinvestbank, a ban on insurance and reinsurance of Russian ships by EU companies, a ban on certain services and a broadcasting prohibition for three Russian state-controlled media outlets.

Additionally, further individuals and companies are listed as designated person under financial sanctions and the possibilities to apply for derogation are hardened for several Russian and Belarusian companies.

A. Partial oil embargo

The regulation contains a complete import ban on all Russian seaborne crude oil and petroleum products, which covers 90% of the European current oil imports from Russia.

The ban is subject to some transition periods in order to allow the EU and its partners to secure alternative supplies and minimise the impact on global supply chains.

For seaborne crude oil, spot market transactions and execution of existing contracts will be allowed for full six months after entry into force of the new measures; for petroleum products, the grace period is eight months after entry into force.

Member States with a particular pipeline dependency on Russia can continue to receive crude oil until the Council decides otherwise.

In particular, a special temporary derogation to import crude oil and petroleum products via maritime transport has been granted to Bulgaria until the end of 2024; while Croatia will be able to authorise until the end of 2023 the import of Russian vacuum gas oil necessary for the functioning of its refinery, Art. 3m and Annex XXV of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

Additionally, according to Art.

3n of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, the prohibition of assisting services, including insuring and financing, also applies to the transport of Russian crude oil or petroleum products to third countries.

The Council stressed that the general principles of solidarity and regional cooperation will apply in case of possible disruptions to the supply of oil; while the European Commission will monitor closely markets and the security of supply of the Union.

With regard to Belarusian banks, Belinvestbank has been removed from SWIFT, Art. 1zb and newly extended Annex XV of Regulation (EU)

No 765/2006. C. Service ban The new provisions contain a prohibition to provide, directly or indirectly, certain business-relevant services, namely accounting, auditing, statutory audit, bookkeeping and tax consulting services, business and management consulting and public relations services to the Russian government and to legal persons and entities established in Russia, Art. 5n of newly amended Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014.

The scope of the services forbidden under this article is described further in recital (26) of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014: accounting, auditing, bookkeeping and tax consultancy services cover the recording of commercial transactions for businesses and others; examination services of accounting records and financial statements; business tax planning and consulting; and the preparation of tax documents; business and management consulting and public relations services cover advisory, guidance and operational assistance services provided to businesses for business policy and strategy and the overall planning, structuring and control of an organisation.

Management fees, management auditing; market management, human resources, production management and project management consulting; and advisory, guidance and operational services related to improving the image of the clients and their relations with the general public and other institutions are all included.

The prohibition does not apply to the beforementioned services if they are strictly necessary for the right of defence in judicial proceedings and the right to an effective legal remedy (Art. 5n para.

3) or for the exclusive use by entities established in Russia but owned by, or solely or jointly controlled by, a legal person, entity or body incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State (Art. 5n para.

4).

Further, Art. 5n para.

This grandfathering clause applies to contracts concluded before 4 June 2022; the derogation period ends  05 July 2022.

D. Broadcasting prohibition The broadcasting activities of another three Russian State outlets (Rossiya RTR/RTR Planeta, Rossiya 24/Russia 24, and TV Centre International) have been suspended because of their role in disseminating propaganda in support of Russian aggression.

This covers transmission or distribution by any means, such as cable, satellite, IPTV, Internet service providers, Internet video sharing platforms or applications.

The advertising of products or services on sanctioned outlets has also been prohibited;

Art. 2f and Annex XV of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

E. Export restrictions The EU’s sixth sanctions package also includes further export restrictions.

The list of advanced technology items banned from export to Russia has been expanded to include additional chemicals that could be used in manufacturing chemical weapons, Art.

2a, 2b and newly expanded Annex VII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

The proposed list of additional chemicals sanctioned represents more than 600 million Euro of EU exports to Russia.

However, the export of these items remain possible for humanitarian purposes, medical and pharmaceutical purposes and health emergencies.

F. Further amendments Further to the newly added restrictive measures, the legislator, inter alia, added important derogations from the general transaction prohibitions as set forth in Art.

Additionally, the legislator has reacted to the difficulties faced by EU companies bound by and willing to end their engagement in Russian joint ventures: transactions, including sales, are not forbidden if and to the extent they are strictly necessary for the wind-down of a joint venture or similar legal arrangement concluded before 16 March 2022.

The wind down period ends on 05 September 2022 (Art.

The package adds the UK and the Republic of Korea to the Annex of partner countries that have adopted substantially equivalent export restrictions, Art. 2, 2a, 2d and newly extended Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014.

The Council decided to impose restrictive measures on an additional 65 individuals and 18 entities.

Newly amended Annex I of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 adds the military staff responsible for the atrocities committed in Bucha and Mariupol, leading businesspeople, politicians, propagandists and family members of already listed oligarchs and Kremlin officials to the scope of the asset freeze of Art. 2 of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014.

Among the sanctioned entities there are companies supporting the Russian Armed Forces and the Government, including the National Settlement Depository (the largest securities depository of the country).

In total there are now more than a thousand individuals and almost a hundred entities that are sanctioned.

Implementation and outlook This package, that has been coordinated with other international partners, aims to further increase the economic pressure on Russia and to limit its ability to continue its war of aggression against Ukraine in outright violation of fundamental principles of public international law.

In welcoming the adoption of the package, the European Commission expressed its full commitment to assist both Member States and EU operators in order to ensure the implementation of the measures across the Union.

It is in fact the Member States’ primary responsibility to ensure the effective and full implementation of the new sanctions.

In particular, the new provisions require Member States to lay down criminal penalties for violations of Regulation 269/2014, in case they have not done so yet.

Last May, the European Commission also proposed measures to ensure the effective implementation of the EU sanctions by way of supplementary criminal law measures, and to reinforce rules on asset recovery and confiscation.

The tortured process of this sixth sanctions package, in particular with regard to the provisions on the oil ban, underlines the increasing difficulties for the European Institutions to hold together the different needs of the Member States.

However, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, have already declared that nothing is off the table and that a possible ban on Russian gas cannot be excluded."
Noerr,The EU’s sixth sanctions package in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine,"The European institutions are in fact working to end the European dependence on all Russian fossil fuels, including gas, and some European countries (like Poland, Estonia and Latvia) have expressed support for a potential seventh package of sanctions covering also imports of Russian gas into the Union.

Noerr,Noerr GDPR Damages Tracker: Latest news on private enforcement in data privacy law,"There has recently been a huge rise in litigation regarding claims for non-material damages following breaches of data privacy (Article 82(1) GDPR) in Germany.

Given the lack of rulings by the highest courts on many unanswered legal questions on Article 82(1) GDPR, national courts often rely on precedents.

Our Noerr GDPR Damages Tracker shows you at a glance how the case law on non-material damages following a data privacy breach is evolving.

Overview of case law on non-material damages following a data privacy breach Our Noerr GDPR Damages Tracker , available at www.gdprdamages.com and www.damagestracker.com (currently in German only), shows you at a glance the case law of German courts on non-material damages under Article 82(1) GDPR.

A few trends are already visible in case law: In the past, claims for damages following breaches of data privacy were initially rarely enforced.

After a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court in early 2021, however, claimant-friendly case law has been established on non-material damages following data privacy breaches.

Many current decisions by German courts show a very broad concept of damages eligible for compensation.

Exclusion of liability for minor damage is often no longer considered .

Some courts even find that damage has occurred if the person affected simply felt uncomfortable, afraid or anxious.

The courts are broadly in agreement that when calculating the compensation-amounts for a damage, the compensation must be complete and effective .

A growing proportion of decisions are also pointing to a necessary deterrent function of the claim for damages.

Corresponding judgments, some awarding damages of up to €5,000 per claim , may encourage more and more people to file claims for damages following data privacy breaches in future.

Questions referred to the CJEU The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) will shortly clarify some outstanding legal questions as part of the pending referral questions on Article 82(1) GDPR (see examples here and here ).

In particular, the CJEU will decide whether minor damage can be compensated and whether the claim for damages is also intended to have a deterrent effect.

If the CJEU confirms the broad understanding of certain German courts, this could trigger a mass filing of claims for damages for data privacy breaches.

Risk of mass proceedings Private legal service providers see the opportunity for a new, lucrative business model in non-material damages claims after data privacy breaches.

Data privacy breaches often affect a large number of people equally.

This results in potential mass claims, for which collective enforcement makes sense.

Legal service providers can probably build on their experience from other mass proceedings such as cartel damages, the diesel issue or the withdrawal issue in consumer loan agreements.

Besides, data leaks and other data privacy breaches have long been events of general interest.

Media reporting on these topics focus the attention of a broad section of the public on possible data privacy breaches and can push affected persons into the arms of private legal service providers.

Collective redress will therefore probably also become relevant in the area of data privacy law in the future.

The potential new class action and group action models will increase the risk for companies further.

Data privacy litigation at Noerr Given the rising tide of litigation, it is more important than ever for companies to tackle the challenges, opportunities and risks of data protection litigation early on and strategically.

Noerr,Cryptocurrencies: Final circular on taxation from the Federal Ministry of Finance,"Anyone who takes a look at the crypto market these days will notice that the highs of the last few years have come to an abrupt end, and investors’ risk aversion is reflected not only in the stock markets, but also in the crypto markets.

For German investors in cryptocurrencies, planning security and a small sigh of relief are now possible, at least from a tax perspective: The Federal Ministry of Finance published the long-awaited circular entitled Individual Questions on the Income Tax Treatment of Virtual Currencies and Other Tokens on 10 May 2022 (ref.

IV C 1 - S 2256/19/10003 :001).

In its final version of the circular, the Ministry has moved away from the ten-year holding period in section 23 (1) sentence 1 no. 2 sentence 4 German Income Tax Act for the tax-free disposal of cryptocurrencies from private assets.

It is expressly stated that an extension of the holding period from one to ten years for cryptocurrencies is no longer intended, even if they are used as a source of income through lending (crypto-based loan) or staking (provision of units of a cryptocurrency to secure the network and transactions) and income has been generated from that.

This development is very pleasing for cryptocurrency investors, as cryptocurrencies, even if they have been used for lending or staking, can thus continue to be sold tax-free after the expiry of a one-year holding period of section 23 (1) sentence 1 no. 2 German Income Tax Act.

In addition to helpful definitions of the technical terms of the crypto world, the Ministry’s circular contains further interesting tax statements: Cryptocurrencies are always (non-depreciable) assets within the meaning of the German Income Tax Act.

Units of cryptocurrency received due to mining, forging, hard forks, airdrops, lending and staking lead to acquisition transactions in private or business assets.

The acquisition transactions are valued based on the market price of the cryptocurrency at the time of acquisition, addition or inflow (depending on the transaction).

Activities such as mining and forging as well as trading in cryptocurrencies can result in income from commercial operations, e.g. if the activity is carried out on a long-term basis and with the intention of making a profit.

As far as trading in cryptocurrencies is concerned, the income tax criteria for commercial securities and foreign exchange trading can be used to distinguish it from private asset management.

If there is no commercial income, the activities are classified as other income according to section 22

no.

3 German Income Tax Act, but are only taxable if they exceed EUR 256 in a calendar year.

That applies in particular to lending and staking; in the case of airdrops, however, only if there is consideration in return.

Disposals of cryptocurrencies from among private assets (regardless of how they were acquired) are taxable under section 22 no. 2 in conjunction with section 23 (1) sentence 1 no.

2 German Income Tax Act if the period between acquisition and sale does not exceed one year and the total profit from private sales transactions exceeds EUR 600 per calendar year.

Any exchange of a cryptocurrency (including ICOs) also leads to a disposal transaction.

For cryptocurrency newly acquired through the exchange, a new holding period begins at the same time."
Noerr,No new rules on overtime,"Over the past two years, a hot topic of debate has been whether there will be a new approach to the distribution of the burden of proof following the European Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC) and the Court of Justice of the European Union’s (CJEU) “timekeeping” ruling.

In its eagerly awaited decision of 4 May 2022 (5 AZR 359/21), the German Federal Labour Court has maintained its previous line: the burden of proof of overtime is generally on the employee.

There will be relief among employers for the time being, as the feared deluge of lawsuits has been averted.

Suing for overtime pay The situation on which the present ruling is based was very common: The claimant, who had worked for the defendant as a delivery driver for five years, brought an action for overtime pay to the employment court Emden.

He had recorded his working hours electronically.

But the system only recorded the start and end times, not breaks.

An analysis of working hours at the end of his employment showed the claimant had a positive balance of 348 overtime hours.

In 2019 he brought an action for overtime payment of around €5,000.

He made a blanket submission that he had worked the entire time, since no breaks were possible due to the large number of deliveries.

The employer disputed that and refused to pay, saying it would have to deduct many hours for mealtimes and smoking breaks.

Case law to date Since 2013, the Federal Labour Court’s decisions have been clear on this point: overtime is only paid if the employer orders it, approves it or at least tolerates it.

In cases of doubt, the employee must present and prove the overtime worked.

It is not sufficient to make a blanket statement.

Instead, the employee must make a substantiated submission on every overtime hour.

CJEU’s “timekeeping” ruling The established German case law of many years was revisited in the CJEU ruling of 19 May 2019 (C-55/18).

In the well-known “timekeeping” ruling, the Luxembourg judges decided that employees’ actual working time had to be recorded for their own protection.

That was the result of the interpretation and application of the European Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC), according to the judges.

The Member States were called upon by the CJEU to oblige employers to set up an “objective, reliable and accessible system enabling the duration of time worked each day by each worker to be measured.”

Effective worker protection was only guaranteed, they said, if the actual working time was recorded and documented.

Surprising decision by Emden employment court The employment court Emden (partial judgment of 9 November 2020 – 2 Ca 399/18) took this as an opportunity to make a surprising change of direction.

To the claimant’s delight, the court held that the burden of proof in relation to the overtime pay claimed was on the employer, based on the obligation laid down in CJEU ruling to record and monitor working hours.

If the employer fails to record working hours, that constitutes obstructing the obtaining of evidence, according to the judge.

As a result, the court awarded the claimant his overtime pay.

The court made similar decisions in two other cases as well.

However, Lower Saxony Regional Labour Court (judgment of 6 May 2021 – 5 Sa 1292/20) set aside the judgment on appeal, arguing the CJEU ruling was only a statement on the obligation to record working time, whereas payroll accounting was an issue concerning pay, the Court said.

What’s more, the CJEU ruling only imposed an obligation on the Member States and not directly on individual employers.

No change to Federal Labour Court precedents The Federal Labour Court agreed with the Regional Labour Court’s opinion.

And so the situation remains the same: overtime hours still have to be proven by the employee."
Noerr,No new rules on overtime,"And so the situation remains the same: overtime hours still have to be proven by the employee.

The Federal Labour Court set out its grounds in the press release available to date on the judgment of 4 May 2022, stating that the CJEU ruling only dealt with the issue of occupational health and safety and the effective limitation of maximum working hours for employees.

Therefore the European Working Time Directive cannot have any impact on German procedural law, it said.

If the Federal Labour Court had upheld the Emden judges’ decision, companies would have faced a deluge of lawsuits for overtime pay.

Conclusion and outlook To the relief of employers, the Federal Labour Court’s judgment confirms the legal precedents on the burden of presentation and proof in proceedings for overtime pay.

But that is not the end of the matter.

After all, the essential requirements set by the CJEU on introducing an obligation for companies to fully record working hours remains in place.

The ball is currently in the German legislator’s court.

Since the European requirements are likely to be implemented in this legislative period, the upcoming legislative procedure should be closely monitored and employers should start preparing now for the possible introduction of timekeeping systems."
Noerr,Requirements for collective redundancy notices – Case law update,"Back in February, we reported on the latest developments in German case law on collective redundancy notices ( New rules for collective redundancies? ) .

Since then, further decisions have been handed down which are of major significance in legal practice.

These are presented briefly below.

1.

Context: The legal framework Section 17 of the German Unfair Dismissal Act ( Kündigungsschutzgesetz ) obliges employers to submit a collective redundancy notice to the Federal Employment Agency if it wishes to dismiss a certain number of employees within 30 calendar days.

The provision in section 17(3) sentence 4 of the German Unfair Dismissal Act stipulates that the employer must provide certain information (“must information”) in the collective redundancy notice to be submitted to the Federal Employment Agency.

This information consists of details of the name of the employer as well as the type and registered office of the business unit, the reasons for the planned redundancies, the number and occupational groups of the employees to be made redundant and those regularly employed in the business, the period of time in which the redundancies are to be carried out, as well as the envisaged criteria for selecting the employees to be made redundant.

In addition, section 17(3) sentence 5 of the German Unfair Dismissal Act stipulates that, in consultation with the works council, the collective redundancy notice should contain information on the gender, age, occupation and nationality of the employees to be dismissed (“should information”).

The basis of the German regulations on collective redundancy notices is European Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (“Collective Redundancy Directive”).

2. Lack of “should information” does not invalidate notice – Ruling by Federal Labour Court on 19 May 2022 On 19 May 2022 (2 AZR 467/21), Germany’s Federal Labour Court issued a welcome ruling on this issue which provides a little more legal certainty for practitioners.

The facts In February, we reported on the decisions of the lower courts.

The subject of the legal dispute was a termination of employment for business reasons, which was issued as part of a collective redundancy scheme.

The employer had issued a collective redundancy notice in advance but did not provide the “should information”, i.e. on the gender, age, occupation and nationality of the employees concerned.

Both the trial court (Frankfurt Labour Court) and the court of appeal (Hesse Regional Labour Court) concluded the termination in question was invalid because that information was missing.

Essentially, it was argued that the Collective Redundancy Directive requires that all relevant information be included in the collective redundancy notice, without differentiating between “must” and “should” information.

Information on age, gender, occupation and nationality was said to be relevant in any event in this situation.

Decision of the Federal Labour Court

The employer’s successful appeal was directed at the decision of Hesse Regional Labour Court.

So far, only the press release of the Federal Labour Court has been published ( Collective redundancy notice - Lack of should information - Federal Labour Court (in German only) ).

However, it is already clear from that press release that the Federal Labour Court makes a clear distinction between “must” and “should” information when assessing whether a proper collective redundancy notice was issued.

According to the Federal Labour Court, a lack of “should” information in the context of a collective redundancy notice does not expressly invalidate a termination issued as part of a collective redundancy scheme.

Only this conformed to the legislator’s intention, which expressly differentiated between “must” and “should” information in section 17 of the Unfair Dismissal Act."
Noerr,Requirements for collective redundancy notices – Case law update,"Only this conformed to the legislator’s intention, which expressly differentiated between “must” and “should” information in section 17 of the Unfair Dismissal Act.

In the Federal Labour Court’s opinion, the national courts could not disregard this legislative decision by way of an interpretation in conformity with the Directive.

Moreover, such an interpretation was not required.

According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it has already been clarified that the “should” information stipulated in section 17(3) sentence 5 of the German Unfair Dismissal Act is not required under the Collective Redundancy Directive either.

The decision of the Federal Labour Court should be met with approval.

The wording of section 17 of the German Unfair Dismissal Act is clear.

The requirements for proper collective redundancy notices are already strict and should not be overstretched by requiring additional (“should”) details.

Also, employers often do not have the required information at all (or at least not in full).

Therefore the Federal Labour Court’s decision is welcome in practice.

3. Incorrect company number does not invalidate notice It is worth mentioning another decision on collective redundancy notices, which specifies the requirements and consequences of errors more precisely.

Specifically, Berlin-Brandenburg Regional Labour Court (judgment of 7 December 2021, 7 Sa 1273/21) had to rule on a case in which the collective redundancy notice was properly submitted but contained an incorrect company number.

In contrast to the trial court (Berlin Labour Court), Berlin-Brandenburg Regional Labour Court is of the opinion that stating an incorrect company number does not invalidate the collective redundancy notice.

The facts The claimant worked for the defendant employer as an order picker.

The employer decided to close the warehouse the claimant was employed in and also terminated the claimant’s employment as part of a collective redundancy scheme.

In the collective redundancy notice to be submitted to the relevant Federal Employment Agency, the defendant employer stated which company the claimant was employed at.

The collective redundancy notice was signed by the two authorised signatories of the defendant using a company stamp indicating the defendant’s company.

However, the defendant had made a formal error: the company number every employer has to apply for from the Federal Employment Agency in order to use the social insurance registration procedure (section 18i German Social Code vol. 4) and which must be stated in the form provided by the Federal Employment Agency when submitting collective redundancy notices was not assigned to the defendant, but to its legal predecessor.

Accordingly, the Federal Employment Agency issued confirmation of receipt of the collective redundancy notice to the legal predecessor of the defendant, and not to the defendant.

The claimant now argued that the termination of his employment – in addition to other asserted grounds of invalidity – was invalid in any case due to the incorrect collective redundancy notice.

The decisions In the first instance, the claimant was successful with his arguments.

Berlin Labour Court ruled that the collective redundancy notice had not been submitted in the name of the employer, but in the name of another legal entity designated by the company number.

Thus, at the time the notice of termination was issued, there was no collective redundancy notice and the termination was accordingly invalid.

The employer’s appeal against this was successful: In the Regional Labour Court’s opinion, the collective redundancy notice is open to interpretation under sections 133 and 157 of the German Civil Code.

The content of a declaration is therefore determined by how the parties should understand it in good faith, taking into account customary practices, with the precise wording to be taken as a basis."
Noerr,Requirements for collective redundancy notices – Case law update,"The content of a declaration is therefore determined by how the parties should understand it in good faith, taking into account customary practices, with the precise wording to be taken as a basis.

According to the Regional Labour Court, based on these standards, interpreting the notice despite the incorrect company number led to the conclusion that the defendant had issued the collective redundancy notice.

This was because the defendant was designated in the company name, had expressly signed the notice of termination and had issued it for the company concerned.

The fact that the notice referred to the legal predecessor did not mean that in the event of differences between the written information and the company number the Federal Employment Agency was exempt from interpreting for itself which company had filed the notice.

If the notice contains information on the correct employer as well as on the company concerned and if it is also signed by the correct employer, it is to be attributed to that employer, even if the company number might be wrong.

The fact that the Federal Employment Agency initially wrote to the legal predecessor, because of the wrong company number, was therefore harmless.

This is because the Agency’s letter is automatically generated using the company number entered, without this having any effect on the content for the recipient of the collective redundancy notice.

This decision also deserves approval.

The collective redundancy notice primarily pursues labour market policy purposes.

The obligation to give notice is meant to let the Federal Employment Agency take timely action to increase the chances of redundant workers finding new jobs and avoiding unemployment.

If the employer can be identified based on the information in the collective redundancy notice, it would therefore be nonsensical to negate the existence of an otherwise proper collective redundancy notice simply because of an incorrect company number.

Besides, the company number is not mandatory information either, according to section 17(3) sentence 4 of the Unfair Dismissal Act.

4. Conclusion and practical advice Once again, the decisions described make it clear that there are multiple legal issues in connection with (alleged) errors employers can make in issuing a notice and implementing collective redundancies.

The two decisions provide further legal clarity and are also welcome in this context."
Noerr,Romania: New fiscal incentives and changes in taxation of capital gains for individuals,"Fiscal incentives for increasing the minimum gross salary GEO no. 67/2022, published in the Official Gazette on 23 May 2022, enforces the application of fiscal incentives for companies who decide to increase their employees’ salaries from the minimum gross salary, i.e. RON 2,550, to RON 2,750, for salaries from 1 June - 31 December 2022.

For the aforementioned period, no income tax and social insurance contributions are due for the RON 200 increase.

On a separate note, GEO 67/2022 enforces the obligation for postal services providers to submit to the Romanian tax authorities, on a monthly basis, information regarding postal shipments with payment at delivery by the consignee.

Changes in taxation of capital gains for individuals Starting from 1 January 2023, Law no. 142/2022, published in the Official Gazette on 23 May 2022, amends the provisions regarding the taxation of capital gains obtained by individuals from the transfer of securities (shares and financial instruments classified as such by the relevant legislation of the State in which they were issued) and from transactions with derivatives.

Capital gains earned from the transfer of securities and from transactions with derivatives are taxed differently depending on how the transactions take place, as follows: (1) if said transactions are carried out through a Romanian intermediary or a non-resident intermediary having a permanent establishment in Romania, the income tax is calculated and withheld by the intermediary for the gain obtained from each transaction, and not on annual basis, as is the case under the current regulations.  

Therefore, losses from one transaction cannot be offset against gains from another transaction; In this case, the income tax withheld by the intermediary is calculated as follows: ✓ in the case of securities: 1% on gains for the transfer of securities that have been acquired and sold in a period of more than 365 days, including the date of their acquisition; 3% on gains for the transfer of securities that have been acquired and sold in a period of less than 365 days from the date of their acquisition; ✓ in the case of transactions with derivatives: 1% on gains for transactions with derivatives held for a period of more than 365 days, including the date of their acquisition; 3% on gains for transactions with derivatives held for a period of less than 365 days from the date of their acquisition.

(2) otherwise, i.e. if the transactions are not carried out through an intermediary, the income tax is calculated on an annual basis, cumulatively, by the beneficiary of the income.

The income tax rate remains 10% in this case and is calculated on the difference between the gains and losses recorded during the fiscal year.

The same taxation rules apply to non-resident individuals earning income from the transfer of securities through Romanian intermediaries.

In this case, the Romanian intermediary is required to apply for the tax registration in Romania of the non-resident individual."
Noerr,Romania: Fiscal incentives for the agriculture and food industry,"Law no. 135 of 13 May 2022, published in the Official Gazette on 17 May 2022, enforces the application of fiscal incentives for employees who earn salary income in the agricultural and food industry.

The fiscal incentives are similar to those existing for the construction sector and consist of: An exemption from the payment of income tax; An exemption from the payment of health insurance contributions; A 3.75 percentage point reduction in social insurance contributions; A reduction in the work insurance contribution payable by employers.

The application of the fiscal incentives is subject to the following conditions: The employers carry out activities in the agricultural and food industry in Romania defined by the following NACE codes: - NACE 01 - Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities, except NACE 017 - Hunting, trapping and related service activities - NACE 10 - Manufacture of food products The employers obtain turnover from the aforementioned activities of at least 80% of their total turnover.

At the same time, the Law provides that: For the agricultural and food industry, the minimum gross base salary will be at least RON 3,000/month, without including allowances, bonuses and other additions.

The fiscal incentives are granted for a gross monthly salary income of up to RON 30,000.

Above this threshold the normal income tax and social contribution rates apply; The fiscal incentives are applicable between June 2022 and December 2028."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: New guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines,"The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has recently published new Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR for public consultation .

In their new guidelines, the European supervisory authorities formulate a common methodology for the calculation of fines for the first time.

The five-stage calculation method is intended to contribute to further harmonisation and transparency of the data protection authorities’ fines practice.

The new guidelines could also become an essential tool for businesses to better assess the risk of fines in practice, for example in the case of data breaches.

In practice, the authorities’ considerations of aggravating and mitigating circumstances based on the behaviour of the controller to increase or reduce fines (step 3) are likely to play a key role.

Both past and present behaviour can affect the amount of the fine, which is also an essential strategic factor in any data protection litigation .

The EDPB is seeking feedback on its new guidelines in the public consultation process until 27 June 2022.

While it cannot be ruled out that the EDPB will make some changes to its guidelines on the basis of the feedback received, experience shows that the final version of the guidelines is likely to contain clarifications rather than any fundamental changes.

We therefore recommend that the guidelines formulated by the EDPB already be taken into consideration at this point, especially since the published version of the guidelines reflects the common line of the European supervisory authorities."
Noerr,German federal government’s new Bill for more effective enforcement of Russia sanctions,"Background and objective On 10 May 2022, Germany’s federal cabinet adopted the first Sanctions Enforcement Bill.

The Bill was provided to the coalition parties’ parliamentary groups and was introduced into the legislative process on 12 May 2022 by the German Bundestag.

The Sanctions Enforcement Act envisaged by the SPD, Greens and FDP is intended to enable effective enforcement in Germany of the numerous EU sanctions issued in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine in violation of international law and to remedy structural weaknesses in operational enforcement, particularly concerning the freezing of assets and the prohibition of providing economic resources to listed persons, as well as the movement of goods and services.

For effective enforcement of these measures at national level, it is now necessary to combine the expertise of various authorities and agencies at federal and state levels and to enable collaboration.

To this end, the Bill aims to create a legal framework specifically designed for sanctions enforcement and to close regulatory loopholes.

Specific design The Sanctions Enforcement Bill will amend the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the Money Laundering Act, the Banking Act and the Securities Trading Act.

The authorities responsible for sanction enforcement, namely the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control, the Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport, the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Agency for Agriculture and Food, as well as the authorities responsible under the laws of Germany’s federal states are to be given the power under the draft section 9a of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act to investigate funds, assets and economic resources in order to request information and the submission of documents; summon and question witnesses; secure evidence; search homes and business premises; inspect land registers and other public registers; and identify and query accounts.

The draft section 9b of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act is intended to give the competent authorities the power to seize funds or economic resources to prevent their transfer or disposal.

Restrictions on disposal may be ordered for the same purpose.

Seized objects are to be kept in custody, although the draft section 9c also permits realisation in certain conditions, for example if there is a risk of a significant reduction in value or if custody would involve disproportionately high effort.

Persons affected by an asset freeze and the prohibition on making funds/resources available and those listed as part of a sanctions measure are to be obliged under the draft section 23a of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act to notify the Bundesbank of any funds and the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control of any economic resources located in Germany.

The same obligation is also to apply to logistics service providers within the meaning of sections 453 and 467 German Commercial Code who have knowledge of such funds or economic resources.

Breaching the notification obligations of the draft section 23a Foreign Trade and Payments Act is to be punishable as a criminal offence with a penalty of imprisonment of up to one year or a fine (draft section 18(5b) of the Act).

Breaching bans on broadcasting, transmission, dissemination or other services, some of which up to now have only constituted an administrative offence under section 82 Foreign Trade and Payments Act or were not penalised are to be upgraded to a criminal offence under the draft section 18(1)

no. 1 a) of the Act as a breach of sanctions."
Noerr,German federal government’s new Bill for more effective enforcement of Russia sanctions,"no. 1 a) of the Act as a breach of sanctions.

In addition, the first Sanctions Enforcement Bill contains further procedural regulations, namely substitute jurisdiction of the German states’ authorities to investigate and take seizure measures, more opportunities to exchange sanction-related information between authorities by creating data access and data transmission powers, the involvement of the Central Office for Financial Transaction Investigations (FIU) in identifying assets and an addition to the urgent measures by the FIU to prohibit transactions with possible sanction relevance as well as operational analysis ex officio and the establishment of a special statutory authority for the German financial regulator BaFin to order all measures to enforce trading prohibitions with sanctions relevance.

Interpretation and outlook These regulations are far-reaching and clearly go beyond the existing instruments.

In part, they involve far-reaching encroachments on fundamental rights.

The basic problem of enforcing sanctions, namely that it is difficult to establish that a particular listed person has control over assets, especially in the case of nested group structures with the involvement of foundations, trusts and similar structures, will presumably not change much as a result.

Reporting obligations under the draft section 23a

Foreign Trade and Payments Act only exist for assets located in Germany.

Obligations to provide information under the draft section 9a (2) Foreign Trade and Payments Act can also only be enforced against people resident or based in Germany.

The First Sanctions Enforcement Act is to be followed later by the Second Sanctions Enforcement Act.

Its aim is to establish a national register for assets of unclear origin and for assets subject to sanctions.

In addition, an independent administrative procedure for clarifying assets of unclear origin is to be introduced and a special whistleblower hotline is to be set up.

Noerr,Germany’s Federal Labour Court provides welcome clarification on cross-border assignment of temporary agency workers,"While assigning temporary agency workers is often very useful from an operational standpoint, it is also quite complicated, if only due to the number of people, entities and legal relationships that must be kept in mind.

It becomes even more complex if the assignment is a cross-border one because then various legal systems must be coordinated.

Mistakes can have significant consequences: The possible consequences of a legally noncompliant domestic assignment of a temporary agency worker can include not only penalties on the hirer for failing to deduct and forward social security contributions under section 266a German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch – StGB) and for tax evasion under section 370 German Tax Code (Abgabenordnung – AO), but also claims to remuneration and social security contributions, and the fact that a fictious employment relationship is assumed to exist with the illegally assigned temporary agency worker (section 10(1) first sentence German Act on Temporary Agency Work – Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz – AÜG).

Especially in the context of IT assignments and large projects, contractors from outside Germany (and sometimes Europe) are often commissioned who assign their own employees to work for their clients.

Quite often this constitutes temporary agency work, e.g. because foreign contractors (agencies) and domestic hirers (clients) misinterpret domestic applicable laws or simply do not comply with them in practice.

So in the case of temporary agency workers of the foreign agency assigned across borders in Germany, are the domestic clients subject to the same risks or perhaps even greater risks than those in the case of an illegal domestic assignment of temporary agency workers?

In a judgment dated 26 April 2022 (9 AZR 228/21), the German Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht ) diverged from the previous decision of Baden-Württemberg Regional Labour Court (12 Sa 15/20) and provided the welcome clarification that, in the case of cross-border assignment of temporary agency workers, no fictious employment relationship with the German client is assumed to exist, but basically, “only” fines are possible.

I. Background

The French plaintiff claimed the existence of a fictious employment relationship with the defendant, a company domiciled in Germany (client), as well as overtime and compensation of the difference in remuneration based on what she argued constituted the illegal assignment of a temporary agency worker.

The plaintiff had been employed as a consultant/engineer by the French company (agency) since 1 October 2014.

The agency is a globally operating consulting group with a focus on technology consulting.

The two companies concluded a contract for technology consulting services on the basis of which the plaintiff was seconded to work for the German company, which was thus a client.

However, both the contractual wording of the legal relationship and its practical implementation revealed that the performance owed was not certain services that could be separated from the client’s operations and that were organised by the external worker herself, but the assignment of the plaintiff.

The contract between the two companies – as well as the employment contract between the plaintiff and the agency, which required interpretation – provided for the application of French law.

The agency did not have a German temporary worker agency permit.

The plaintiff’s action was dismissed by the first-instance labour court.

However, on appeal, the regional labour court partially found in favour of the plaintiff by assuming that an employment relationship had been established with the hirer.

The defendant’s (hirer’s) appeal against this was successful.

II.

Decision of the German Federal Labour Court While only the press release has been published so far, the main reasons for the decision can already be found in it."
Noerr,Germany’s Federal Labour Court provides welcome clarification on cross-border assignment of temporary agency workers,"II.

Decision of the German Federal Labour Court While only the press release has been published so far, the main reasons for the decision can already be found in it.

The Federal Labour Court clarified that even a factual assignment of a temporary worker does not constitute a fictious employment relationship with the German client.

The decisive arguments are as follows: A prerequisite for a fictious employment relationship with the client according to section 10(1) first sentence AÜG is the invalidity of the underlying temporary agency worker contract between the foreign agency and the temporary worker due to the lack of a permit (section 1 AÜG).

However, based on the conflict-of-law rules this was not the case If the temporary agency worker contract was subject to the law of another European Member State (here: French law), its validity was governed by the law of that Member State.

Neither section 2 no. 4 German Act on Posting Workers (Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz  – AEntG) nor the AÜG have the effect of giving precedence to corresponding provisions of the AÜG.

If and to the extent that the former version of section 2 no. 4 AEntG – that transposed the former version of Article 3.1(d) of Directive 96/71/EC – provides that the “conditions for the outside assignment of workers, in particular by temporary worker agencies” between an employer established abroad and its workers employed in Germany must be applied, then this does not include any provisions on the existence of the employment relationship with the agency.

In addition to legal and administrative provisions regulating the working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers, this only refers to the requirements of the law on assigning temporary agency workers under trade, agency and permit law applicable in Germany.

Also, section 9 AÜG is not an overriding mandatory provision within the meaning of Article 9(1)

Rome I Regulation, i.e. not a mandatory provision under German law from which no deviation is possible.

Rather, the public interest in obtaining a permit to operate a temporary worker agency is sufficiently protected via the administrative offences pursuant to section 16(1) no. 1 and (2) AÜG.

III.

Outlook The Federal Labour Court’s decision, which is welcome for practitioners, alleviates many of the concerns usually associated with cross-border assignment of temporary agency workers.

It reduces the risks associated with the implementation of cross-border assignment of temporary agency workers.

While German hirers do not have to fear an undesired, fictitious employment relationship, foreign lenders do not have to fear an undesired migration of their employees.

German companies are also not threatened with criminal liability for failure to deduct and transfer social security contributions under section 266a of the German Criminal Code or for tax evasion under section 370 of the German Fiscal Code.

Nevertheless, even in this case, an illicit assignment of temporary agency workers is not without consequences: As the Federal Labour Court rightly points out, in this case, too, there is the threat of fines according to section 16 AÜG.

Therefore, as in the case of a purely national assignment of temporary agency workers, also in the case of a cross-border assignment of temporary agency workers attention must be paid not only to the proper drafting of the contract, but also to the actual contractual practice in order to avoid fines and bad publicity.

Noerr,18th Regulation Amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation in effect,"On 3 May 2022, the 18th Regulation Amending the German Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation (18.

Verordnung zur Änderung Außenwirtschaftsverordnung – AWV) entered into force.

This law defines new administrative offences that are subject to fines so that penalties can be imposed for violations of sanctions entailing restrictive measures against Belarus, Russia and the regions of Ukraine not controlled by the Ukrainian government, Donetsk and Luhansk.

As regards Belarus, this concerns prohibitions of transactions in connection with reserves and assets of the Belarussian Central Bank, listing shares of Belarussian companies in which the state holds more than 50% on European stock exchanges, granting new loans, credits or entering into similar agreements with the Republic of Belarus, its government, public institutions, companies and agencies or with organisations designated in Annex IX of Council Regulation (EC)

No 765/2006 or organisations directly or indirectly controlled by the above, accepting deposits of more than €100,000.00 from Belarussian citizens or entities domiciled there.

In connection with restrictive measures against Russia, this concerns violations of the prohibition to participate in or contribute to a project co-financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund, to expand a participation in a company that was founded according to Russian law or the law of a third country and that is active in the energy sector in Russia, to participate in granting loans, credits or funds to a company active in the energy sector in Russia, to establish a joint venture to be active in the energy sector in Russia, to purchase, trade in or list on a stock exchange securities or money market instruments from the companies designated in Annex III of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014, to reach any agreements with companies designated in Annex III, V, VI, XII or XIII on granting new loans or credits, to conduct any transactions in connection with the administration of reserves and assets of the Russian Central Bank, to conduct transactions with any organisations listed in Annex XIX, to accept deposits of more than €100,000.00 from Russian citizens or from entities domiciled there, to grant Russian individuals or entities access to rating activities, to support Russian persons in procuring funds or financial aid, to register a trust or legal structure for any Russian persons.

In connection with restrictive measures against the regions Donetsk and Luhansk, this concerns violations of the prohibition to expand a participation in real estate or companies, to grant loans, credits or similar agreements, to establish joint ventures and to cooperate in performing sanctioned contracts or transactions.

It was necessary to amend section 82 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation in order to close sanction loopholes in the event of violations of sanction measures.

Section 18(1) of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act only provides that export, import, transit, shipment, sale, acquisition, delivery, provision, passing on, service, investment and disposal are punishable.

However, a number of the newly introduced prohibitions do not fall under any of the abovementioned categories, which has meant that violations of them were not punishable either as a crime or as an administrative offence.

It should be noted that the references to the sanction regulations in section 82 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation are “static references” that refer to the version of the sanction regulations designated in each law.

Consequently, any future expansions of the prohibitions in the sanction regulations will not fall under the elements of an administrative offence.

Only violations of the abovementioned provisions of the sanctions regulations that occurred after entry into force of the amended version of section 82 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation are subject to punishment."
Noerr,Czech Republic: Start-ups,"1. Set up rules for founders & investors In the early days of a new business, the founders believe that they will always agree on everything.

Often this feeling persists even when they decide to invite the first investors into their company.

While it is of course possible that some lucky shareholders will not be confronted by any problems, relying on absolute agreement throughout the life of the company is rather naive.

It should always be kept in mind that start-ups usually begin and grow differently than traditional companies.

Start-ups tend to grow rapidly, with intensive involvement by their (often more than one) investors, individuals and entities that are often not interconnected and that join the company gradually in individual investment rounds.

A start-up, therefore, needs to be established professionally and with an eye to how the company will develop in the future.

Hence, it is essential to have a well-thought-out shareholders agreement that regulates not only the shares of individual shareholders in the company, but also the method of taking fundamental decisions, daily management of the company, division of the roles of founders and investors, as well as the procedure in case of disagreements between individual shareholders who are unable to agree on the further functioning of the company.

The shareholders agreement should be drawn up as soon as possible, at the latest when the first investor comes on board.

It is advisable to remember that the life of a start-up is fast-paced, and companies that are unable to make internal decisions quickly and efficiently have no chance of long-term survival.

Similarly, it is important to keep in mind the fate of companies where internal disputes between founders or disputes with investors have rendered the start-up toxic for any further investment.

2. Draw up bulletproof contracts The first and foremost endeavour of any start-up is to develop its own product or service.

However, by the time it is possible to launch this product for sale to customers, good contracts must already be in place.

A primary purpose of contracts is to protect the company from potential problems.

But they can also be seen as a kind of instruction manual that describes the company's relationship with its customers.

Many start-ups think of contracts only in the former sense, and often end up finding and using the longest and strictest terms and conditions used by a competing company.

Every company is different, and copying terms and conditions from another company simply doesn't work.

Contracts, terms and conditions that are too strict, unbalanced and possibly unreadable due to technical language also tend to put customers off.

Good business conditions should protect the start-up and allow it to grow without being overwhelmed by bureaucracy.

They should also convey to customers that the start-up plans to deal fairly with them.

3.

Comply with the law Laws govern everything we do.

That's why every new idea and business must comply with the law.

Often there is no easier way to lose an investor or even an entire business than to fail to operate in accordance with the law.

Before launching a start-up, founders must always check carefully whether they have all the necessary permits, licences and registrations required for its activities.

It is also necessary to keep in mind the day-to-day management and its compliance with the law.

Depending on how companies (and that includes start-ups) do business, they have to comply with obligations arising from data protection (GDPR) law, employment law, health and safety regulations and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, just to name a few.

One of the things every potential investor examines is just how the start-up operates on a day-to-day basis and how it complies with applicable law.

Failure to do so is a red flag for investors, telling them that something is wrong with the start-up."
Noerr,Czech Republic: Start-ups,"Failure to do so is a red flag for investors, telling them that something is wrong with the start-up.

4. Protect knowhow and high-quality employees Start-ups must protect their trade secrets and know-how.

Competition is fierce, and there are few situations worse than finding out that you've spent years developing a product and building a team, only to have your competitors literally destroy your business overnight by poaching key knowhow or team members.

So for key employees, it is important to consider at an early stage entering into confidentiality agreements and keeping sensitive information confidential.

Such an agreement will ensure that the employee does not disclose sensitive information to anyone for an agreed period of time, even after the employment ends.

It is also advisable to negotiate a non-compete clause for even greater protection.

Its purpose is to ensure that the employee is not allowed to work for a competitor for an agreed period of time after the employment ends.

Last but not least, it is also advisable to think about a non-solicitation arrangement.

This agreement places employees (especially those in management positions) under obligation not to actively entice other members of the team to leave and start their own company or move to a competitor.

5. Do not neglect intellectual property rights Most start-ups are built on a new, creative and important idea.

It's quite surprising that some start-ups idea from a legal perspective.

First of all, it is advisable to find out whether the idea is really new or if someone else already has exclusive rights to the idea in the form of a patent, design, trademark, etc.

If not, and the idea is genuinely new and revolutionary, it is important to protect it.

This protection can include registration in the above-mentioned forms.

However, it is also important to think about ensuring that the idea and its further evolution really belong to the company.

If the start-up already has employees working on the idea, for example in the form of software programming, it is important to think about their contracts and add clear clauses stating that the intellectual property created by them is the property of the company.

Another IP issue to clarify up front is choosing an appropriate company name, brand or project name, logo or domain name that will not conflict with the rights of others.

If the name of the start-up or its product is identical to the name of another company or its products, the start-up may be required to reimburse the other company for the resulting damage and rename itself or its product.

A good name is essential in business, and avoiding these mistakes, which is quite easy with good preparation, can prevent a start-up and the whole business from being ruined."
Noerr,Corporate law 2.0,"Options for virtual voting during the Covid-19 pandemic and afterwards A commonly expressed desire is for the simplest possible procedure for voting and/or internal alingment and discussions in German companies.

Legal requirements and thus the limits on flexibility depend not only on a company's legal form (limited liability company (GmbH), joint stock company (AG), partnership limited by shares (KGaA), European company(SE) or limited partnership (KG)) but also on the governing body (shareholders, supervisory board, management board) in which the voting and/or internal alingment and discussions is to take place.

In everyday practice, a broad spectrum of options for conducting voting and/or internal alingment and discussions has developed that allow at least some increase in flexibility.

In response to the pandemic, German legislators have also created special rules, applicable until August 2022, in Article 2 of the Act on Mitigating the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Civil, Insolvency and Criminal Law – Covid-19 Act).

The increased flexibility and reduction in travel and the number of in-person meetings will therefore still be of interest for shareholder meetings and annual general meetings in 2022.

Noerr,Hungary: What can we learn from the annual report of the Hungarian DPA (NAIH),"The Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) recently published its annual report for 2021, which contains some useful information for data controllers.

You can read the full report here .

In 2021, NAIH opened a total of 56 ex officio investigations and official proceedings in relation to the GDPR and 2,161 new investigations and official proceedings in response to complaints (of which 184 were related to a data breach).

This shows that the overwhelming majority of procedures are initiated by request.

This may be due to the limited capacity of the NAIH and to the fact that, due to growing awareness of privacy rights and concerns, more and more individuals are turning to the NAIH for help with alleged or actual breaches of their personal data.

In view of this trend, data controllers are well advised to pay increased attention to data protection compliance.

Compliance with the GDPR is becoming an increasingly important factor in processing the personal data of data subjects (e.g. employees, customers) and includes the need to comply with the prior information obligation, to clarify the purposes and legal bases of the data processing and the scope of the data, to properly document consents and to prepare the test for balancing the interests of controllers and data subjects required by the GDPR.

In relation to the latter, it should be stressed that the NAIH analyses the content of the balancing tests in detail particularly often.

A balancing test must be carried out in all cases where the legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest of the data controller or a third party (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).

The  authorities have a great deal of experience in preparing balancing tests, and knowledge of such tests is necessary for a thorough and appropriate assessment of the interests involved.

The NAIH critically examines when the controller carried out the balancing test (whether the test precedes the start of data processing) and whether the data controller has properly weighed the various aspects (relevance of its legitimate interest, rights and freedoms of the data subject, necessity and proportionality and other principles of the GDPR).

In its 2021 report, the NAIH underlines that drawing up a document (e.g. the balancing test) does not in itself constitute compliance with the obligations.

For example, in the description of the most significant Hungarian case to date (250 million HUF) involving the use of artificial intelligence by a bank, the NAIH emphasised that the content of the documentation did not meet the requirements.

The bank only documented that the data processing was necessary to pursue its interest but did not actually examine proportionality and the data subjects’ interests, while trivialising the significant risks to fundamental rights.

The NAIH also mentions the shortcomings of a test of balancing of interests in its description of another significant case (concerning an investigation into the fundraising activities of a foundation).

Here, the NAIH describes how the balancing test failed to consider the rights and freedoms of data subjects and to include an analysis of the impact of the processing on data subjects and a justification of why the interests of the foundation prevailed over these.

The NAIH's report also shows that in many cases, data controllers do not carry out a proper risk assessment in the event of a personal data breach (incident).

In a number of cases, data controllers classified a higher-risk incident as risk-free and thus failed to notify the data subject, i.e. failed to comply with the obligations imposed by the GDPR in relation to high-risk incidents.

In many cases, the NAIH was only notified of high-risk incidents via a public interest notification, as in many cases the data controllers themselves were not even aware of the incident or had not identified the incident as a personal data breach."
Noerr,Hungary: What can we learn from the annual report of the Hungarian DPA (NAIH),"It should be kept in mind that the NAIH will assess the failure to notify the personal data breach as an aggravating factor in its proceedings.

A number of recommendations and guidelines have been produced in the context of incident classification and related risk assessment.

At the initiative of the NAIH, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), developed its Guideline 1/2021 , which contains a practical description of typical data breaches."
Noerr,Romania: State aid law updates,"After the recent alignment of Romanian state aid law with applicable European law, the procedure for granting state aid in Romania has also been updated as follows: the list of eligible activities has been reduced so as to ensure allocation of financial resources to sectors generating a significant multiplier effect in the economy, a scoring mechanism has been introduced to analyse applications in order to prioritize projects with higher investment amounts and those that are implemented in less developed regions of Romania, the analysis period for reimbursement documentation has been changed from 30 working days to 60 working days, thus making it equivalent to the period used for analysis of the application documentation, and specific intensities have been assigned to each county, ranging from 30% in the western region to 60% in the northeast, southeast, South Muntenia and Southwest Oltenia.

According to the Romanian authorities, the next call for submission of applications will be opened in the next calendar quarter, and a generous budget will be available."
Noerr,The Whistleblower Protection Act reloaded,"Bill by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Justice kicks off next round of sparring for a German law to protect whistleblowers Just before Easter, on 13 April 2022, the Federal Ministry of Justice published its long-awaited Bill for a German law to protect whistleblowers (“ Whistleblower Protection Bill ”), which certainly contains a few surprises for companies.

With its Bill, the Ministry has taken the first step towards a German law to protect whistleblowers.

The Whistleblower Protection Bill serves to implement the European Whistleblower Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/1937, “ WBD ”), which aims to improve protection for whistleblowers across Europe, partly by requiring companies to set up internal reporting channels.

In December 2021, Germany let the deadline for implementing the WBD pass after disagreements in the last federal government.

The EU Commission then initiated infringement proceedings against the Federal Republic of Germany in early 2022.

The new coalition government had already announced in its pact that it wanted to implement the directive “in a legally secure and workable manner” and on time .

The federal government’s Bill was therefore eagerly awaited.

While the Whistleblower Protection Bill essentially implements the provisions of the WBD consistently, in some points it deviates from or goes further than the Directive.

These deviations will be of great importance in practice if the Whistleblower Protection Bill is actually passed in the present version.

This article summarises the key requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Bill in corporate practice with regard to the obligation to set up internal reporting units: 1. Number of employees or field of business is the decisive criterion The Whistleblower Protection Bill contains an obligation for the following companies to set up at least one unit for internal notifications : Employers that usually have at least 50 employees , section 12(2) Whistleblower Protection Bill Employers according to section 3(9)

Whistleblower Protection Bill mean natural persons and legal entities under private law which employ at least one person Employees according to section 3(8)

Whistleblower Protection Bill mean employees and apprentices The number of employees is determined by looking back at the size of the workforce to date and estimating future development ( no rule focussing on a particular reference date )

Companies in areas “prone to disruption” regardless of their number of employees (e.g. investment services enterprises or investment management companies; there is an exhaustive list in section 12(3)

Whistleblower Protection Bill)

Practice note: The Whistleblower Protection Bill contains a grace period for companies with 50-249 employees .

The obligation to put in place a reporting unit will only apply to them from 17 December 2023 .

Even companies with fewer than 50 employees should consider voluntarily putting in place whistleblower structures to avoid reputation-damaging external leaks (which are also protected by the Whistleblower Protection Bill).

2. Whistleblowing subjects The internal reporting units (hotlines) must be available for at least the following types of whistleblowing: Infringements punishable by law , section 2(1)

no. 1

Whistleblower Protection Bill Infringements punishable by a fine if the breached provision serves to protect life, limb and health or to protect the rights of employees or their representative bodies, section 2(1)

no. 2

Whistleblower Protection Bill Infringements of national or European legal acts in specifically listed areas of law (e.g. in public procurement or environmental law, section 2(1) nos.

3-7 and (2) Whistleblower Protection Bill)

Practice note: The coalition government will, as it has announced, implement the WBD by even going beyond the requirements stipulated in the WBD."
Noerr,The Whistleblower Protection Act reloaded,"3-7 and (2) Whistleblower Protection Bill)

Practice note: The coalition government will, as it has announced, implement the WBD by even going beyond the requirements stipulated in the WBD.

While the WBD only covers infringements in certain areas of European law and politics, the scope of application of the Whistleblower Protection Bill also includes offences punishable by law and fines.

This broad scope must be reflected in the subjects permitted to be reported to the whistleblowing hotlines.

3. Practical use Companies have some room for manoeuvre regarding the group of people entitled to make whistleblowing reports: The internal hotline must be available to employees and temporary workers , first sentence of section 16(1)

Whistleblower Protection Bill The internal hotline can be made available to other natural persons (such as suppliers, customers or their employees), second sentence of section 16(1)

Whistleblower Protection Bill Practice note: Companies should consider making their hotline available to all natural persons who may obtain information on infringements within the company in the course of their work.

These persons also enjoy protection from reprisals under the Whistleblower Protection Bill if they report infringements (internal or external).

4.

Organisational requirements The Whistleblower Protection Bill closely follows the requirements of the WBD as far as the organisational integration of the hotline into corporate structures is concerned.

However, the Bill has a surprise in store, particularly with regard to group-wide hotlines: The whistleblowing hotline must be operated by an independent and competent person or department (performance of other tasks is permissible , i.e. operating the whistleblowing hotline can be one of several tasks), section 15 Whistleblower Protection Bill Provision of clear and easily accessible information (e.g. on the website or the intranet) on external (national) reporting channels as well as reporting units at European institutions (e.g. at OLAF, ESMA), section 13(2)

Whistleblower Protection Bill Companies with 50-249 employees are permitted to share resources by means of a joint whistleblowing unit , section 14(1) Whistleblower Protection Bill

The joint whistleblowing unit may be authorised to receive information and to take certain follow-up steps (especially clarification measures).

However, each employer remains obliged to take steps to remedy the infringement and to report back to the whistleblower.

Outsourcing the internal whistleblowing unit to third parties is permissible (e.g. ombudspersons or affiliated group companies such as the parent company; see p86 of the Whistleblower Protection Bill), section 14(1) Whistleblower Protection Bill.

However, operating the hotline and taking necessary follow-up steps may not be completely outsourced to third parties ( no transfer of responsibility to third parties ).

The original responsibility for maintaining confidentiality in handling the whistleblowing report and for remedying the infringement always remains with the obligated employer.

Close coordination is therefore required between the employer and the third party, for example with regard to internal investigations and measures to remedy the grievance.

Practice note: In the Whistleblower Protection Bill, the federal government is specifically in favour of a group privilege, i.e. group-wide whistleblowing hotlines will still be permitted .

For companies, this is certainly the biggest surprise in the Whistleblower Protection Bill, because the coalition thereby deviates from the EU Commission’s interpretation of the WBD.

In several statements, the EU Commission expressly rejected the recognition of group companies as “third parties”.

Given this obvious contradiction between the Whistleblower Protection Bill and the EU Commission’s view, it is advisable to ask critical questions about the admissibility of group-wide whistleblowing hotlines ."
Noerr,The Whistleblower Protection Act reloaded,"Nobody knows whether this Easter present from the coalition, which companies are pleased about, will withstand scrutiny by the ECJ (and beforehand, in the ongoing legislative process).

5. Requirements regarding reporting channels The Whistleblower Protection Bill contains mandatory procedural requirements for operating internal reporting channels: Maintain the confidentiality of the whistleblower and the person/people affected by the whistleblowing, section 8 Whistleblower Protection Bill Comply with documentation obligations including the obligation to delete the documentation two years after the conclusion of the procedure, section 11 Whistleblower Protection Bill Option of whistleblowing in writing or verbally, first sentence of section 16(3)

Whistleblower Protection Bill At the whistleblower’s request, a personal meeting must be guaranteed within a reasonable time, second sentence of section 16(3)

Whistleblower Protection Bill

No obligation to allow anonymous tip-offs , third sentence of section 16(1)

Whistleblower Protection Bill Acknowledgement of receipt of the whistleblowing report within seven days , section 17(1)

no. 1

Whistleblower Protection Bill Tasks of the whistleblowing unit: Check the admissibility of the subject of the report and the validity of the allegations made, contact the whistleblower and, if necessary, request further information, section 17(1) nos.

2-5 Whistleblower Protection Bill Take follow-up measures (e.g. internal investigation, discontinuation of investigation, forward the information to authorities), section 17(1) no. 6 and section 18 Whistleblower Protection Bill Give feedback to whistleblowers on follow-up steps planned and already taken as well as reasons for these within three months of confirmation of receipt , section 17(2)

Whistleblower Protection Bill 6.

Penalties for not setting up a hotline Section 40(2)

no. 2

Whistleblower Protection Bill provides another surprise for companies.

Unlike the European legislator, the federal government wants to penalise failure to set up an internal whistleblowing hotline with a fine .

Accordingly, failure to set up internal reporting channels that meet the requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Bill can be punished with a fine of up to €20,000.

Practice note: All companies that come within the scope of the Whistleblower Protection Bill’s obligation to set up whistleblowing structures should start doing so now at the very latest.

This applies in particular to companies with more than 249 employees, because there is no grace period envisaged for them and the setup obligation will therefore (probably) apply as soon as the Bill becomes law.

Due to Germany’s failure to implement the WBD in time, the legislative process is likely to be concluded quickly now.

In order to avoid fines, companies should pay special attention and take steps quickly."
Noerr,Amendment to the Bavarian Hospitals Act,"The Bavarian state government is planning a major amendment to the Bavarian Hospitals Act to allow hospitals to outsource their IT to external service providers in future.

Corresponding IT strategies can thus lead to increased IT professionalisation and cost savings in future.

Current legal situation According to the sixth sentence of Article 27(4) of the Bavarian Hospitals Act, hospitals in the state have so far only been permitted to process patient data internally – on the hospital premises – or to have other hospitals process patient data, in the case of patient data required for more than merely administrative purposes when treating the patients.

This rule has so far prevented Bavarian hospitals from having an IT infrastructure operated off their own premises by external service providers, which the GDPR and the 2017 amendment to the provision on the confidentiality obligation in section 203 of the German Criminal Code would already allow in principle.

This applies in particular to the service portfolio of cloud service providers.

In addition, since 1 January 2022, hospitals have had to take into account the requirements of section 75c German Social Code Vol. 5 in relation to IT security.

Large hospitals in particular may also count as operators of critical infrastructure under the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security, and therefore section 8a of that Act applies.

Planned amendment The Bavarian government’s Public Health Service Bill now contains the following amendment: The aforementioned sixth sentence of Article 27(4) of the Bavarian Hospitals Act is to be deleted, paving the way for IT outsourcing by hospitals.

This is what the explanatory memorandum to the Bill says: “The repeal of the sixth sentence of Article 27(4) of the Bavarian Hospitals Act is intended to allow hospitals to also have patient data processed outside the hospital by processors that are not hospitals.”

(Bavarian Parliament, printed paper 18/19685, p53)

According to the new version of the Act, however, it will also be necessary to observe the provisions of Articles 28 and 32 of the GDPR in future IT outsourcing.

A new provision in Article 27(6) Bavarian Hospitals Act clarifies that the protective measures to be taken against unauthorised use or transmission must comply with the GDPR.

This means in particular: Hospitals must enter into a data processing agreement with their outsourcing companies in accordance with Article 28(3) of the GDPR.

Since the patient data to be processed mainly consists of special categories of personal data, hospitals are likely to attach particular importance to the security of the processing.

Supplementary agreements will also be agreed in view of section 203 German Criminal Code.

Furthermore, both the external processor and the hospital responsible must ensure the necessary protective measures in the form of a suitable security strategy in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR.

According to the state legislature, the interest groups of the Bavarian hospital operators and their umbrella organisations should also prepare a set of rules on the technical and organisational requirements of outsourcing.

Hospitals that outsource IT services in future but are publicly owned will have to put the project out to public tender, depending on the extent of the planned outsourcing.

From an IT contractual point of view, the content and necessary level of detail of the outsourcing agreement will be based on the expected forthcoming rules and regulations of the umbrella organisations, as well as on those of other regulated industries, such as the financial sector.

Conclusion The state legislature itself realises that the planned amendment is only a way of legally catching up with digital progress.

This is what the explanatory memorandum says: “The rapid advance of digitalisation also affects hospitals in Bavaria."
Noerr,Amendment to the Bavarian Hospitals Act,"This is what the explanatory memorandum says: “The rapid advance of digitalisation also affects hospitals in Bavaria.

It requires the fast adaptation of individual points of the Bavarian regulations on data protection in hospitals.

The aim of the amendment ... is to enable hospitals to provide modern, IT-assisted patient care in terms of digitalisation and innovation and at the same time to ensure a high level of data protection in hospitals.

Given the stricter IT security requirements, the opportunities in particular for outsourced processing of patient health data must be considered for the future.”

(Bavarian Parliament, printed paper 18/19685, p2)

The planned change in the legal admissibility of involving external service providers is thus very welcome and long overdue.

This would mean that in Bavaria, similar to hospital laws in Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Rhineland-Palatinate, comparatively liberal conditions would prevail for the use of processors by hospitals.

However, the hospital laws of Baden-Württemberg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt still contain comparatively strict restrictions that make the use of processors more difficult."
Noerr,Romania: New legal framework for foreign direct investments,"Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2019 establishing a framework for screening foreign direct investments into the Union (the “ Regulation ”) has been implemented into Romanian legislation in the form of Government Emergency Ordinance no.

46/2022 on foreign direct investments (“ GEO no. 46/2022 ”).

GEO no.

46/2022 establishes the conditions under which certain foreign direct investments are subject to screening for the approval of the Commission for the Examination of Foreign Direct Investments (“ CEFDI ”) before being implemented in Romanian territory.

The screening is for the purpose of preventing such investments from disturbing the essential interests of national security and public order, as well as the interests of the European Union.

The new ordinance provides the procedure and conditions to be fulfilled by certain investors that are considered to be “foreign” under the definitions provided by GEO no.

46/2022 and the Regulation prior to implementing a foreign direct investment in order to avoid potential penalties due to violations or criminal actions.

The main conditions to be fulfilled by the foreign direct investor have to do with: (i) certain targeted domains, and (ii) the value of the envisaged transaction.

GEO no.

46/2022 targets a variety of fields, such as the security of citizens, borders and the energy, the security of industrial and critical infrastructure, as well as protection of the environment, agriculture or processes of privatisation of state companies.

As regards the minimum value of the investments, the main rule provides that investments exceeding €2 million ( the RON equivalent calculated at the relevant exchange rate of the Romanian National Bank ) are concerned, with certain exceptions.

The obligation to file for screening by the CEFDI and later the Competition Council or the Romanian government, as the case may be, is applicable (among others) to investors whose citizenship/place of incorporation is in a state outside the European Union, as well as to EU entities that are under the control of non-EU persons or entities.

Failure to comply with certain requirements of GEO no. 46/2022, such as the obligation to obtain the aforementioned approval prior to implementing a foreign direct investment in Romania, constitutes a violation ( if it does not qualify as a criminal offence ) which may result in civil fines of up to 10% of the investor’s worldwide turnover.

The provisions of GEO no.

46/2022 entered into force on 18 April 2022, with the exception of those concerning civil penalties and their legal regime, which are to enter into force 30 days as of the publication date of GEO no. 46/2022.

Our legal team will gladly assist you in any matters related to this new regulation and its many implications for investments in Romania."
Noerr,Poland: Occupational Burnout,"It is widely accepted that, due to the increasing pace of today’s life and work, employees’ mental health is deteriorating.

This problem has been compounded by the situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many workers complain of difficulty in adjusting to the new situation.

For workers who have been (or are) permanently or periodically forced to work from home, personal issues are added to professional problems.

This additional stress can be expected to increase the prevalence and intensity of professional burnout in employees.

What is Professional Burnout Professional burnout is most often understood as a situation in which work stops giving us satisfaction, we have a feeling that we have stopped developing and we feel overloaded with duties that are no longer pleasant for us.

The medical designation for such a situation is “professional burnout syndrome”.

Its official definition is found in the ICD-11, the eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases drawn up by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Like its previous versions, the ICD-11 is a set of terms used in health care to refer to diseases and other medical conditions and procedures which are assigned appropriate codes.

The purpose of creating these terms was to standardize the designations of diseases and procedures around the world.

The new version of the classification went into effect on 1 January 2022.

The ICD-11 actually includes a description of occupational burnout.

It is defined as a set of symptoms resulting from chronic workplace stress and characterized by feelings of exhaustion, increased mental distance from one's work or a sense of negativity or cynicism about one's work, and a sense of ineffectiveness and lack of achievement.

Burnout has been assigned code QD85 in the ICD-11.

Sick Leave Certificate and Polish Law

In Polish law, the rules for issuing medical certificates for sick leave (popularly known as L4) are regulated by the provisions of the Polish Act of 25 June 1999 on monetary benefits from social insurance in case of sickness and maternity (i.e. Journal of Laws of 2021, item 1133, as amended).

Pursuant to Article 55 of this act, such a certificate is issued (as a rule) via the IT system of the Polish Insurance Institution (ZUS), after a direct examination of the health condition of the insured or a sick member of the insured’s family, and is confirmed by an entry in the patient’s medical documentation.

The content of the certificate itself includes data concerning the insured (the patient), the contribution payer (the employer) and the doctor, the period of the certified temporary inability to work, medical indications (either: “the patient may walk” or “the patient should lie down”) and the statistical number corresponding to the insured's illness as established in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, i.e. the ICD version in force at the time.

Such a certificate justifies the employee's absence from work and entitles him/her to sick pay (as provided for in Article 92 of the Labour Code) or sick benefits in accordance with the provisions of the abovementioned act.

It should be highlighted, that according to the regulations in force, the certificate must include the number of the disease described in the ICD.

This cannot be just any code in the classification, but must refer to a medical condition recognized by the medical community.

Burnout in ICD-11

The definition of burnout is found in the chapter of the ICD-11 entitled Problems associated with employment and unemployment , along with such situations as Occupational exposure to dust (code QD84.0) or Problems associated with a change of job (code QD81)."
Noerr,Poland: Occupational Burnout,"Such classification of burnout indicates that it is not a medical condition such as for instance depression, which is classified in the chapter on Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders and which is assigned a group of codes that allow to further describe varieties of this disease (e.g. code 6A70 refers to a single episode of depressive disorder, code 6A70.0 refers to a single mild episode of depressive disorder, and code 6A70.4 refers to a single severe episode of depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms).

Occupational burnout is currently considered an “occupational phenomenon” that is reported by patients and must therefore be classified accordingly by healthcare specialists.

The fact that occupational burnout has been entered into the ICD-11 classification does not mean it has been defined as a new disease.

This is confirmed by an official statement on the WHO website , in which it is also reminded that occupational burnout was already included in ICD-10.

The definition introduced in ICD-11 is more detailed, but its mere presence in the classification is not a novelty.

Burnout: a reason for sick leave?

For these reasons, a physician should not issue a certificate of inability to work which indicates professional burnout as its basis.

This would be contrary to the provisions of the Act on monetary benefits from social insurance in case of sickness and maternity and will very likely be challenged by the relevant social security institution.

If a certificate with a code indicating professional burnout is issued as a result of a doctor's error, the doctor may correct it within three days by sending a correction to the ZUS.

Incorrectly issued medical certificates are also subject to inspection by the ZUS, as a result of which the certifying physician may set an earlier date of cessation of inability to work, determined in the e-ZLA medical certificate, in which case he/she will issue a new certificate.

This will, of course, result in the employee being denied the right to sick pay for the time when he or she was able to work.

However, the question arises as to whether employees themselves should have to bear the consequences of the doctor’s issuance of a certificate which erroneously indicates professional burnout as the basis.

There is as yet no definitive answer to this question.

On the one hand, employees should not bear the consequences of the mistakes of others, and employees cannot be expected to control their medical diagnoses themselves.

Of course, this would be different for employees who mislead their doctors, but this seems unlikely in this context.

Nevertheless, such action on the part of employees should be considered grounds for imposing consequences on them, including termination of their employment contracts.

In addition, due to the fact that in such a case there will be no grounds for recognizing the employees’ incapacity to work, they would not have the right to receive the remuneration referred to in Article 92 of the Labour Code.

It is also important to note that occupational burnout itself may also be accompanied by other ailments more consistent with a standard illness.

Chronic stress at work may be accompanied by psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression) and/or a number of somatic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases).

Thus, occupational burnout may be a part of the diagnosis and, as such, may appear in the patient's medical record, but it should not be the only reason for a physician to certify that employees are unable to work.

Employers would be well advised to consider whether their employees’ work atmosphere could be conducive to occupational burnout and to try to limit employees' exposure to stress and burnout."
Noerr,Delivery times: Environmental bonus uncertain,"The automotive industry is currently experiencing a radical change.

The developments of the last few years, combined with steadily rising fuel prices and attractive government subsidies, have made electric vehicles increasingly attractive and initiated a new public mindset.

However, due to persistent supply bottlenecks, the automotive industry is currently facing many actual and legal challenges.

The previously existing shortage of raw materials is now being increasingly exacerbated by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and new sanctions against Russia which are being imposed almost every day, with the result that delivery times for new vehicles are sometimes stated in years.

At the same time, the state subsidy for electrically powered vehicles known as the “innovation premium” will expire on 31 December 2022.

For customers, dealers and manufacturers, increasingly long delivery times are making it uncertain whether there will be time to apply for the innovation premium for a new vehicle ordered now.

Questions about the legal situation are likewise arising as to whether customers may not receive a state subsidy at all or in the foreseen amount due to long delivery times.

Application for the innovation premium can be made for new hybrid and battery electric and fuel cell vehicles registered for the first time by 31 December 2022.

The application must be submitted by 31 December 2022.

The current federal government has been reticent in addressing this issue, leaving open the question as to whether and how the innovation premium and other benefits will be granted after 2022.

Until recently, there was absolutely no communication as to how a revamped innovation premium would be structured.

Now, German Federal Minister of Economics Robert Habeck has announced that the environmental bonus for plug-in hybrids will be completely abolished after 31 December 2022 and the environmental bonus for purely electric vehicles will also be reduced.

Contrary to calls from the automotive industry, the decisive date will continue to be the date of registration of the vehicle and not, for example, the date on which the contract with the end customer was concluded.

Under these circumstances, manufacturers and dealers are faced with a variety of legal issues.

Depending on each individual case and the wording of each contract, the question arises as to who bears the risk of long delivery times in relation to state subsidies and whether the dealer or the manufacturer may even be liable for lost subsidies.

In some cases, delivery delays may also entitle the customer to withdraw from the contract.

In this context questions are increasingly arising as to whether the parties must or can adhere to their contracts in the event of foreseeable delivery difficulties and whether and to what extent customers, when concluding purchase or leasing contracts or having already placed orders, must be informed of the risk of receiving state subsidies in a lower amount or not at all in the event of delivery after 31 December 2022.

Since there are no indications that the current situation will be improving soon, manufacturers and dealers are well advised to consider such issues in regard to their offers and when drafting their contracts, to set the decisive conditions as early as possible and to avoid legal uncertainties in their everyday business."
Noerr,Romania: New legal framework on unfair business-to-business trading practices in the agricultural and food supply chain,"Directive (EU) 2019/633 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 concerning unfair business-to-consumer trading practices in the agricultural and food supply chain has recently been transposed into Romanian legislation by Law no. 81/2022, in force since 15 April 2022 ("" Law no. 81 /2022 "").

Subject matter and scope Law no. 81/2022 regulates the commercial relations between suppliers and buyers in the supply chain with respect to unfair trading practices carried out in connection with the sale of agricultural and/or food products (the "" Products "") in the context of sales with effects on the territory of Romania, regardless of the place the sale took place or the services provided by the buyer to the supplier.

Law no. 81/2022 applies on the basis of a comparative turnover mechanism of the parties involved, which is intended to reflect their bargaining power (e.g. supplier's turnover ≤ EUR 2 million vs. buyer's turnover ≥ EUR 2 million; supplier's turnover between EUR 2 million and EUR 10 million vs. buyer's turnover ≥ EUR 10 million, etc.), but excludes agreements between suppliers and consumers.

Unfair trading practices prohibited The most important trading practices classified as unfair and thus prohibited for the buyer are: exceeding the payment deadline by more than 14 calendar days from the due date in case of perishable Products and by more than 30 days for non-perishable Products (with certain exceptions); unilaterally amending a commercial agreement with regard to the frequency, method or place of supply or delivery of the Products, or with regard to the prices/payment terms for the services provided; requesting invoicing and/or re-invoicing and charging the supplier for any other costs than those contractually agreed or using self-billing, except in cases provided for by law; applying financial and trade discounts in the form of rebates on the Products, with the exception of discounts and rebates with cumulative discounts exceeding 20%; returning unsold Products to the supplier, delaying their receipt and preparation of the acceptance documents; invoicing the value of certain services rendered in excess of maximum 5% of the amount charged by the supplier under the agreement entered into by the parties; asking the supplier to provide certain products, services or a payment for listing or displaying for sale its Products or to buy or sell from a third party; charging the supplier fees, regardless of their type and name, in order to oblige the supplier to artificially increase the billing price; delisting, threatening to delist or withdrawing from display a Product in order to put pressure on or take commercial retaliation against the supplier for accepting contractual unfavorable terms for the supplier; listing and displaying only the buyer's own brand on the shelf; applying different commercial conditions to private label products of manufacturers compared to private label products of the trader for listing/display on the shelf."
Noerr,Romania: New legal framework on unfair business-to-business trading practices in the agricultural and food supply chain,"In addition, the buyer is also prohibited from: asking the supplier for payment for advertising of agricultural and/or food products made by the buyer; asking the supplier for payment of the marketing services provided by the buyer for agricultural and/or food products; refusing to grant the supplier a price renegotiation within a period of more than 10 days from the date of the request; the conditions of the price renegotiation take effect within the period laid down in the agreement; asking the supplier to pay for staff who arrange the sales premises used for the sale of the supplier's products or obliging the supplier to provide staff for the sale of the products or any other activity related to the sales-promotion process; charging the supplier a fee for the secondary placement of its agricultural and food products for sale; asking the supplier to bear all or part of the cost of any discounts for agricultural and/or food products sold by the purchaser as a promotion, unless they have been agreed in advance at the supplier's request in clear and unambiguous terms in the commercial agreement or in a subsequent addendum.

Authorities designated to enforce Law no. 81/2022 and their powers The implementing authority of Law no.

81 /2022 is the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, with powers to monitor unfair trading practices and the authority with a role in the enforcement of Law no.

81/2022 is the Competition Council (collectively the "" Authorities "").

Suppliers and purchasers can complain to the authorities and lodge complaints about suspected unfair trading practices.

The regulation on the procedure for registration, investigation and settlement of complaints will be approved by Government Decision within 30 days of the entry into force of the Law no. 81/2022.

Referrals are dealt with within 60 days from the date of the start of the in-depth investigation, with the possibility of extending the time limit in complex situations, not exceeding 90 days from the referral.

In the course of the investigation, the Competition Council may, in principle, adopt any appropriate interim measure.

In case of an obligation to cease the prohibited trading practice, the termination decision will apply to all similar commercial agreements entered into by the buyer concerned with all its suppliers.

Before taking a decision, the Competition Council gives the parties the opportunity to express their opinion within 5 working days.

Uncontested penalty decisions are enforceable and those ordering measures to prohibit unfair trading practices will be monitored.

In the event of infringement of the ordered measures, the main and additional fines provided for in Law no. 81/2022 will be imposed.

Penalties The contraventions provided for by Law no. 81/2022 are established and enforced by the Competition Council.

Among others, the following acts committed by the buyer or supplier, with the exception of public authorities, constitute contraventions (if they are not offences): a) supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information or incomplete documents or failing to supply the requested documents; b) unjustified refusal to submit to unannounced inspections; c) failure to comply with the imposed measures; d)

the commission of an unfair trading practice within 2 years of the first infringement decision.

These contraventions are penalized, as appropriate, by fines ranging from RON 250,000 to RON 600,000, or of 1% of the total turnover achieved in the previous financial year.

Additional penalties of 1% of the principal fine per day of delay may also be imposed as of the date set by decision in order to induce them to cease unfair practices, to comply with the obligations imposed, to provide correct and complete information and documents or to submit to unannounced inspection.

In the event of damage to the supplier as a result of the unfair trading practice, the buyer will be liable to pay 3 times the amount of such damage."
Noerr,Romania: New legal framework on unfair business-to-business trading practices in the agricultural and food supply chain,"In the event of damage to the supplier as a result of the unfair trading practice, the buyer will be liable to pay 3 times the amount of such damage.

The penalty is determined according to the gravity of the offence, the duration and the existence of other contravention penalties applied according to the Law no. 81/2022 in the last 3 years prior to the offence.

In case of certain infringements, if the company expressly acknowledges, when submitting its point of view, that it has carried out the unfair trading practice and proposes measures which lead to the removal of the causes of the infringement, the Competition Council may, at its express request, apply for a reduction of the fine of between 1% and 25% of the final fine, even when it is set at the minimum.

If, before the decision is taken, the company submits a proposal for an acknowledgement, the Competition Council may apply a simplified procedure, but the benefit of the reduction of the fine is lost if an action for annulment of the decision is brought in respect of those recognized.

Right to apply to the courts On the one hand, actions arising out of an unfair trading practice fall within the jurisdiction of the court where the act was committed or within whose territorial jurisdiction the plaintiff has its registered seat or, failing that, his domicile.

On the other hand, decisions finding and penalizing unfair trading practices may be appealed to the Administrative and Fiscal Litigation Section of the Bucharest Court of Appeal within 30 days as of the notification.

Thus, although Law no. 81/2022 does not expressly provide for it, in our interpretation, it gives the persons harmed by an unfair trading practice (i) the possibility of applying to the Competition Council in order to report the anti-competitive conduct, with a view to the competent authority penalizing the actor and putting a stop to the behavior, or (ii) the possibility of applying to a court of law, with a view to obtaining damages for the harm suffered as a result of this infringement.

As a consequence, as regards the remedies available to the injured party, such may apply to the court of appeal from the territorial jurisdiction of the court that issued the decision in the case provided for in point (i) above, or to the Administrative and Fiscal Disputes Section of the Bucharest Court of Appeal in the case provided for in point (ii) above.

Disputes may also be settled amicably through mediation, without prejudice to the right of suppliers to lodge a complaint with the Competition Council and without affecting the rights of the parties to take legal action at any time before, during or after mediation.

Law no. 81/2022 is without prejudice to national regulations aimed at combating unfair trading practices and falls outside their scope.

The new regulation applies only to commercial contracts entered into after 15 April 2022, when it enters into force, and for those entered into before, the parties are obliged to bring them into line with the provisions of this law by 31 December 2022."
Noerr,U.S. Supreme Court Limits Federal Courts’ Jurisdiction to Confirm or Vacate Arbitral Awards,"On March 31 st , the U.S. Supreme Court in Denise A. Badgerow v. Greg Walters, et al. , decided an extremely important case regarding federal courts’ ability to confirm or vacate arbitral awards.

Previously, the Court held in Vaden v. Discover Bank that under Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq ., a federal court may decide whether to enforce an agreement to arbitrate so long as the court has jurisdiction via the petition itself or through the underlying substantive controversy (the “look-through approach”).

The Court found in Badgerow , however, that petitions seeking to have a federal court confirm or vacate arbitral awards are different.

Procedural Posture

The underlying dispute in Badgerow involved arbitration of an unlawful termination claim under both federal and state law.

After the arbitrators sided with the respondent and dismissed the petitioner’s claims, the petitioner sued the respondent in Louisiana state court to vacate the arbitral decision.

In response, the respondent removed the case to Federal District Court and applied to confirm the arbitral award.

The petitioner argued that the federal court did not have jurisdiction under Sections 9 and 10 of the FAA to decide whether to uphold the arbitral award.

The Federal District Court adopted the look-through approach utilized in Vaden to find that it did have jurisdiction.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Federal District Court’s finding of jurisdiction.

The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, however, and reversed.

The Supreme Court’s Reversal U.S. federal courts’ jurisdiction is limited to two types of cases: diversity cases (suits between citizens of different states as to any matter valued at more than USD 75,000.00) or federal-question cases (suits arising under federal law).

The FAA authorizes parties to arbitration agreements to ask the federal courts for assistance through petitions to compel arbitration (under Section 4) and to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitral awards (under Sections 9 through 11).

These petitions, however, must still have an independent jurisdictional basis.

This means the actual petition itself must involve a diversity issue or a federal question issue; otherwise, they belong in a state court.

Since the petitioner and the respondent in Badgerow were from the same state and the application contested the enforceability of the arbitral award rather than the wrongful termination at issue in the arbitration, there was no diversity nor federal issue.

To get around this, the Federal District Court adopted the look-through approach utilized in Vaden to go beyond the face of the application to where there was a federal law claim in the underlying employment action.

The Court in Vaden found that Section 4 of the FAA allowed a federal court to look to the underlying controversy through Congress’s express language that a party to an arbitration agreement may petition for an order to compel arbitration in a “ United States district court which, save for [the arbitration] agreement , would have jurisdiction ” over “ the controversy between the parties. ”

(Emphasis added.)

The Court reasoned that the words “ save for [the arbitration] agreement ” instruct a court not to find jurisdiction by looking to the petition to enforce the agreement but rather to the underlying controversy of the parties.

In Badgerow , however, the Court held that Sections 9 and 10 of the FAA contained different language, as they lacked the “ save for ” clause, and thus the look-through method should not apply under ordinary principles of statutory construction.

Key Takeaways From the Opinion and Dissent

The “ preeminent ” purpose of the FAA was to overcome some judges’ reluctance to enforce arbitration agreements when a party tried to sue in court instead; therefore, Section 4 petitions to compel arbitration call for an expansion of federal jurisdiction (thus, the look-through approach)."
Noerr,U.S. Supreme Court Limits Federal Courts’ Jurisdiction to Confirm or Vacate Arbitral Awards,"FAA Section 9 and 10 applications to confirm or vacate arbitral awards, when they raise claims between non-diverse parties involving state law, concern the contractual rights provided in the arbitration agreement which are generally governed by state law and belong in state courts.

Other sections of the FAA may now be impacted by this new decision.

For instance, Section 5 allows a petition to the court to designate and appoint an arbitrator.

Justice Breyer in his dissent states that a party could ask a judge to order arbitration under Section 4 but then might not be able to ask that same judge to appoint an arbitrator.

Section 7 allows a federal judge to compel attendance of witnesses.

The dissent underlines the issues that could arise if a witness lives out of State but another lives in State and who exactly the parties for diversity jurisdiction purposes in that situation are.

It will now be extremely difficult to bring an application to confirm or vacate an arbitral award in federal court.

If the arbitration agreement does not involve a federal issue, it could be tough to prove the USD 75,000.00 threshold required for diversity jurisdiction on the face of the petition alone.

Conclusion It will be interesting to see how the law progresses with regard to the other sections of the FAA dealing with federal court powers and how the federal courts decide which roles they may take on and which must be left to the state courts.

For now, at least, it is clear that federal courts are very limited in their ability to decide to confirm or vacate arbitral awards.

That issue remains almost solely within the state courts’ purview."
Noerr,Fifth round of EU sanctions over Putin’s regime in the Ukrainian crisis,"Following the actrocities of Bucha and other areas recently liberated from the Russian troops, the EU agreed on a fifth package of measures with the aim to further weaken Russian’s financial and economic system, also targeting for the first time energy exports.

Ministers and members of the People’s Council of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic” are also subject to restrictive measures.

As a result, 216 individuals and 18 entities have been added to the list of persons, entities and bodies subject to restrictive measures set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014.

Altogether, EU restrictive measures (asset freeze and travel ban) apply now to a total of 1091 individuals and 80 entities.

Outlook

With this fifth round of sanctions, the EU has significantly tightened its economic and financial sanctions against Russia – and has further increased the extreme complexity of its sanction’s regime.

While each detail of the new measures deserves full attention in its own right, two aspects are particularly noteworthy when looking ahead.

First and foremost, the EU no longer shies away completely from restrictions on fossil fuels and has for the first time directly targeted Russia’s energy exports.

Additional, far-reaching restrictions in this area, are an increasingly likely option.

The European Commission and the European External Action Service are already working on new proposals for possible additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

Second, the fact that the EU has decided to impose outright transaction bans on four banks in a way that is expected to have real and major impacts on payments to and from Russia, indicates that additional financial sanctions may follow.

Noerr,The Data Governance Act,"Data are generally regarded as a key resource for every conceivable type of progress, from medical innovations and modernisations to managing the “green deal”.

It is not surprising that the European strategy for data (Communication from the Commission COM(2020) 66 final ) places data at the heart of developments in the European Single Market.

An important pillar of the European data strategy is the Data Governance Act (“DGA”) .

Its goal is to increase the availability of data for commercial use, data sharing and, not least, for research purposes in order to create a competition advantage for the European market as regards data-driven innovation.

On 30 November 2021, the members of the EU trilogue reached consensus on a final version of a DGA.

In terms of legal policy, this would seem to represent another step towards a sovereign single market for data.

The three key topics addressed by the DGA are as follows: (i) making data from public sector bodies available, (ii) the concept of data intermediation services and (iii) “data altruism”.

On 6 April 2022, Parliament debated the negotiated draft and approved it by a large majority.

Now it only needs to be approved by the Council.

Overall, it is noticeable that the DGA – as its title suggests – has a strong regulatory approach in the following outlined areas of interest but does not provide many incentives of its own for becoming a data intermediation services provider or a data altruism organisation.

The legislator is (seemingly) placing its trust in the power of the market.

However, it will be of critical importance for players in the data economy to concern themselves in more detail with, for example, the concept of data intermediation services or, for example, for research institutions to keep in mind the concept of data altruism.

Essential content – data sharing, data altruism and digging up the public sector’s “data treasure” a.

Providing access to data from public-sector bodies To promote the competitiveness of the European data economy while protecting the rights of third parties, the DGA provides framework conditions for (secure) sharing of protected data of public sector bodies.

However, the express intention is not to create a right under European law to claim access to these data (Article 1(2) DGA).

This remains the responsibility of the Member States.

Protected data in this context are data that are in the possession of public sector bodies and are protected for reasons of (i) commercial or statistical confidentiality, (ii) protection of intellectual property rights of third parties or (iii) protection of personal data (insofar as such data fall outside the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 (the “Open Data Directive”))

(Article 3(1) DGA).

This means that the Data Governance Act supplements the Open Data Directive.

The DGA establishes basic rules for making these data of public sector bodies available for re-use.

This is based on the idea that even protected data generated or collected with the help of public funds should benefit society and that this has not occurred up to now due to a lack of uniform framework conditions (Recital 6 DGA).

With this in mind, the DGA now provides for such uniform framework conditions: Upholding the protection of personal data or data relevant to trade or business secrets using appropriate safeguards such as anonymisation or aggregation and secure processing (see Article 5(3) DGA).

Making data available exclusively to selected actors (thereby restricting competition) is prohibited (with broad exceptions in the public interest (see Article 4 DGA)).

A primary requirement is that the conditions of re-use must be transparent and non-discriminatory (see in particular Article 5 DGA).

As regards personal data , “re-users” are expressly prohibited from re-identifying any data subject and are required to take technical and operational measures to prevent re-identification."
Noerr,The Data Governance Act,"As regards personal data , “re-users” are expressly prohibited from re-identifying any data subject and are required to take technical and operational measures to prevent re-identification.

There are notification obligations in the event of a data breach .

Because the interests of legal entities can also be affected, there is a corresponding notification obligation even in the event of the unauthorised re-use of non-personal data (Article 5(5) DGA).

Transmission of data that are confidential or protected by intellectual property rights to re-users that intend to transfer those data to a third country is permissible only if the re-user contractually commits to protecting the data (Article 5(10) DGA).

This means that further restrictions imposed under EU law are also possible in this regard (Article 5(13) DGA).

Data re-use is to be supported by a “single information point” in each Member State to make data from public sector bodies easily accessible (see Article 8 DGA).

b.

Data intermediation services – Rules for data sharing services To enable a competitive environment for data sharing, the DGA sets out framework conditions for the data intermediation services providers that, in the opinion of the framers of the Regulation, are significantly involved in data sharing (Recitals 27 and 33).

Data intermediation services providers offer services that aim to establish commercial relationships for the purposes of data sharing between data holders and data users (see Article 2(1)

no. 11 DGA).

Here, the framers of the Regulation picture jointly used “data pools” or marketplaces for data (Recital 28 DGA).

In this context, it should be noted that: A data intermediation services provider is to be a neutral player, which means, for example, that it is not permitted to use the data for its own purposes

(Article 12 DGA).

The legislator considers this critical to creating trust and incentives for voluntary disclosure of data (Recitals 27, 33).

Particularly in regard to prices, data intermediation services providers must be fair, so that easy access is ensured (Article 12(1f) DGA).

Overall, the Regulation is intended to create fair, secure and highly interoperable exchange of data via neutral intermediaries.

Data intermediation services providers are subject to a notification obligation (Article 11 DGA).

A data intermediation services provider need not be established in the EU but can also be located outside the EU; in such a case, it must designate a representative in the EU (Article 11 Abs. 3 DGA).

c. “Data altruism” The concept of data altruism is intended to facilitate making data available for objectives of general interest such as research, combating climate change, and improving the provision of public services (Article 2(1) no. 16 DGA).

This voluntary sharing of data occurs either on the basis of consent (within the meaning of the GDPR) or, in regard to non-personal data, on the basis of permission.

An entity can also have itself registered as a data altruism organisation (Article 18 DGA), thus enabling itself to be provided with such data for the abovementioned objectives.

While carrying out their data altruism activities, data altruism organisations are subject to wide-ranging transparency requirements and reporting obligations (Article 20 DGA).

Where personal data are processed, there are extensive information obligations towards the data subjects (purpose, place of processing, etc.)

(Article 20(1) DGA).

To simplify data altruism operations, the Commission is to issue a “ r ulebook ” in the form of delegated acts with details on such aspects as informing data subjects and technical safeguards (Article 22 DGA).

To facilitate consent in the context of data altruism, Article 25(1) DGA provides for the creation of a uniform European data consent form.

Conclusion The Data Governance Act contains wide-ranging provisions to standardise data sharing in the Single Market."
Noerr,The Data Governance Act,"Conclusion The Data Governance Act contains wide-ranging provisions to standardise data sharing in the Single Market.

It remains to be seen whether the very extensive obligations placed on individual players do not in some cases hinder rather than promote the desired effect.

In particular data altruism and operating a data altruism organisation hardly seem possible unless accompanied by comprehensive data protection counsel."
Noerr,Romania: Tax amnesty law regarding the reclassification of daily allowances as salary,"Law 72/2022 on the enforcement of a tax amnesty for tax liabilities, including interest and penalties for late payment, imposed by the tax authorities following the reclassification of daily allowances as salary, was published in the Official Gazette on 31 March based on a bill submitted in September 2021.

You can find the link to our news alert here .

The tax amnesty applies to all tax liabilities from 1 July 2015 until now imposed by the tax authorities following the reclassification.

The main companies affected by this reclassification are those in the construction and international transport sectors and temporary work agencies.

The tax amnesty targets both assessed and unpaid tax liabilities as well as tax debts already paid by companies.

In the latter case, companies will be able to apply for a refund.

The tax amnesty will be applied automatically by the tax authorities without the need for companies to make a special request to benefit from it, as decisions will be issued to cancel the tax debts and these will be officially served to qualifying taxpayers.

The Law also provides clarifications on the tax treatment of daily allowances with a view to avoiding future reclassification: Primarily, the new tax regulations make explicit reference to the delegation allowance, the secondment allowance, amounts paid under mobility employment clauses and the transnational secondment allowance.

A new deductibility threshold (at the level of the company) and non-taxable threshold (at the level of the employee) of 3 base salaries for external daily allowances is implemented.

The tax authorities will be able to reclassify the daily allowances only based on the findings of the Labour Inspectorate."
Noerr,Russian gas deliveries can still be paid for in compliance with sanctions,"Background On Thursday, 31 March 2022, one week after the public announcement which drew considerable attention, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree changing the regulations on payment for gas deliveries to other countries.

The new regulations came into force on Friday, 1 April 2022.

Specifically, the decree requires countries described as “unfriendly states”, i.e., EU Member States, USA, UK and all other states that have imposed financial and economic sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to open a rouble account with Gazprombank, which has been specially authorised for this purpose, and to settle their payments for gas deliveries via the bank.

The states concerned must therefore ensure payment in roubles via these special Gazprom bank accounts, which have one division for foreign currency, i.e., US dollars or euros, and one for roubles.

It is still expressly permissible to pay euros or US dollars into the Russian account as the first step.

Then, as the second step is an exchange, the plan is for Gazprombank to convert the funds into roubles, followed by a transfer to Gazprom as the gas supplier.

Gazprom will bear the exchange rate risk.

Assessment under sanctions law The new mechanism announced by Russia does not breach the current legal requirements at the level of EU sanctions.

Although Gazprombank is on sanctions lists in both the USA and the EU, it is only listed for capital market restrictions.

Payments via Gazprombank, on the other hand, are currently not restricted in general, as long as the payments are not made to people or companies subject to a direct or indirect provision ban, i.e. a ban on providing funds or economic resources directly or indirectly to or for the benefit of the listed persons or entities.

There is currently no such prohibition for Gazprom.

In this respect, it should be noted that although the new payment mechanism reduces the effectiveness of the existing sanctions, participation in the new payment mechanism would appear not to amount to a breach of the general circumvention prohibitions in the relevant Article 9 of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 and Article 12 of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014.

The new payment mechanism put into perspective On the one hand, the Russian decree on the new regulations for international gas payments can be seen as a face-saving climb-down by Russia.

It is still expressly permitted to pay euros or US dollars into the Russian account, and thus for the buyer to pay for Russian gas deliveries in the currency specified in the respective supply contract.

In the second step, the Gazprombank will then convert the money into roubles and transfer the amount to Gazprom as the gas supplier and final recipient of the payment, thus ensuring that Russia receives the final payment in roubles.

On the other hand, with the new mechanism, Russia has also anticipated possibly stricter sanctions and ensured that payments for its gas deliveries cannot be blocked as easily as would currently be possible with a transfer in euros or US dollars via a European bank.

Therefore, from a purely legal perspective, it seems highly unlikely that Russian gas deliveries could be stopped in the short term (due to lack of payment).

Payment via Gazprombank is currently not restricted.

However, it cannot be ruled out that individual banks will refuse to make payments to Gazprombank in order to preserve their good reputation.

Finally, a formal rejection of the new payment mechanism, at least by individual states, is also quite likely, which could require a reassessment of the situation.

Noerr,Public Nuisance Claims as a Way to Prove Business Liability in U.S. Courts: How Great is the Risk?,"Any business involved in the chain of manufacture of a product sold in the United States (including component part manufacturers, assembling manufacturers, wholesalers and even retailers) could find itself embroiled in mass products liability litigation due to design, manufacturing or marketing defects.

The legal defence costs associated with such claims, from pre-trial discovery and drafting and arguing pre-trial motions to hiring expert witnesses, can be extraordinary, not to mention potential high damage awards if the case goes to trial and a business is found liable.

There has been an interesting trend in the past couple of decades, however, toward another potential claim in mass tort litigation that could similarly affect these same businesses: public nuisance.

What is “Public Nuisance”?

Public nuisance is a tort (an act or omission, other than under contract, giving rise to injury or harm and amounting to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability) that stems from 12 th century England.

The crown utilised public nuisance claims to cease conduct it considered a hindrance to the public, such as blocking a public roadway.

Adopted and adapted by the U.S. , governmental entities also historically used public nuisance claims to enjoin conduct that interfered with a public right.

Due to the availability of numerous other legal remedy routes, however, public nuisance was so rarely utilized that it was not even included in the First Restatement of Torts (1939), a publication upon which U.S. courts widely rely and frequently cite.

In 1979, public nuisance was added to the Second Restatement of Torts as “an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.”

Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821B (1979).

The Second Restatement further clarified that interference may be considered “unreasonable” if the conduct involves significant interference with the public health, safety, peace, comfort or convenience, or if it is proscribed by a statute, ordinance or administrative regulation, or if the conduct is continuing in nature or has a permanent or long-lasting effect, and as the actor knows or has reason to know, has a significant effect upon the public right.

Since the focus of public nuisance is on the impact to the public, public authorities retain the right to sue, and individuals only have a right of action under public nuisance if they can prove a special injury/particularized harm different than that suffered by the public at large.

Public Nuisance in Mass Torts Cases There is typically some public injury aspect of mass tort actions, which usually involve product liability claims requiring plaintiffs to prove very specific elements that may vary depending on the jurisdiction.

These elements generally include, inter alia, a defective product, an injury to the plaintiff, and the defective product was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.

Proving liability in products liability cases is not particularly easy since defendants have multiple defences at their disposal, including state-of-the-art, causation-in-fact, proximate cause, remoteness doctrine, product alteration, failure to maintain product, assumption of the risk and statute of limitations.

For public nuisance claims, the elements of proof may include that the defendant’s actions were unreasonable, the defendant continued such acts for an unreasonable period, there was a causal connection between the defendant and the nuisance complained of and there was an injury or damage threat to the plaintiff.

Defences may include coming to the nuisance or assumption of the risk.

It is important to note that defences to a products liability case are not necessarily available in a public nuisance action."
Noerr,Public Nuisance Claims as a Way to Prove Business Liability in U.S. Courts: How Great is the Risk?,"Defences may include coming to the nuisance or assumption of the risk.

It is important to note that defences to a products liability case are not necessarily available in a public nuisance action.

In some of the first instances where public nuisance was utilized as a claim to prove liability in mass tort actions, New York plaintiffs in the 1980s successfully sued chemical manufacturers for disposing chemical waste that seeped into the public water supply.

Other public nuisance mass tort actions involved claims against asbestos manufacturers in the 1990s.

In the latter cases, the courts held the manufacturers lacked control of their product after it was installed in various buildings and were therefore not liable for what occurred in those buildings.

Big tobacco litigation was another area where public nuisance cropped up as a viable claim with 46 states suing tobacco companies for the governmental and societal costs of treating smoking-related disease.

Thereafter, public nuisance saw additional movement in lead paint litigation, where such claims were occasionally allowed to move forward.

The Opioid Crisis and Beyond The latest situation in which public nuisance is again making an appearance is litigation regarding opioid abuse.

In the late 1990s, healthcare providers began to prescribe opioid pain relievers at greater rates ultimately leading to widespread misuse of these highly addictive medications.

In one of the most widely known cases, the State of Oklahoma claimed that pharmaceutical companies’ marketing and sale of opioids created a public crisis and thus public nuisance under Oklahoma law.

The judge ruled that the companies engaged in deceptive marketing and downplayed negative side effects of opioids to the public, which led to higher rates of addiction, overdose deaths and birth defects and that the companies were the direct and proximate cause of that public nuisance.

The court ordered the companies to pay USD 465,000,000 in damages to assist in funding a number of governmental programs to clean up the consequences of the opioid epidemic.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned that ruling last November, however, and found that the lower court wrongly interpreted the state’s public nuisance law.

Particularly, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the pharmaceutical companies had no control of their products after they sold the opioids to distributors and wholesalers who then disbursed them to pharmacies, hospitals and doctors’ offices.

The court also stated that the companies had no control over how patients used the products.

In another recent ruling, the Southern District of Illinois in February of this year dismissed plaintiffs’ public nuisance claim against two chemical manufacturers in a lawsuit alleging harm to agricultural workers as a result of exposure to the herbicide paraquat.

The court held that the plaintiffs did not claim a public right and that defendants did not exert control over the product at the time of its application.

Further, the court recognized that paraquat is a legally sold product, complying with the applicable regulations required for sale within the U.S. Conclusion There appears to be a national trend toward rejecting public nuisance as a viable claim in mass products liability cases; however, there are still multiple lawsuits making their way through courts across the U.S. and other rulings could be different.

There are a variety of factors at play, and public nuisance law differs from state to state.

Further, some trials are bench trials while others are jury trials, with juries tending to side more for plaintiffs in such cases.

Additionally, there are already public nuisance lawsuits stacking up against other manufacturers, including manufacturers of e-cigarettes.

It’s worth keeping an eye on these cases to see what defences could be useful against public nuisance claims and where and how courts are allowing them to proceed."
Noerr,Romania: New price caps and measures to ensure security of supply as of 1 April,"On 22 March 2022, Emergency Government Ordinance no. 27/2022 on the applicable measures for final customers on the electricity and natural gas market for the period from 1 April - 31 March 2023 was published in the Official Gazette and entered into force.

Before the background of rising global energy prices, the national legislative framework put forward in October 2021 is amended as follows: New electricity and natural gas price caps for household and non-household consumers have been introduced.

There are no price caps for large electricity household consumers or for large natural gas non-household consumers.

The mechanism to compensate suppliers for the difference between the price cap and the cost price has been modified.

The existing aid scheme for household consumers and certain non-household consumers has not been extended.

The supplemental tax on electricity producers (80% applied to the difference between the average monthly price and RON 450 (EUR 91)/MWh) remains in force.

However, the following new provisions are included: (i) an exception for new production capacities and (ii) a computation method.

An obligation for suppliers to keep in stock a minimum of 30% of the total quantity of natural gas required to be delivered to final customers.

The obligation applies between 1 April 2021 and 31 October 2022.

A new obligation for natural gas producers (onshore and offshore) to sell quantities of natural gas to suppliers of household consumers and to thermal energy producers/suppliers at a regulated price of 150 RON/MWh and 250 RON/MWh respectively.

However, the relevant gas quantities are exempted from the windfall taxes imposed by EGO 7/2013 and Offshore Law 256/2018.

The gas release programme will be suspended from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2022.

The compatibility of these measures with EU legislation remains to be analysed.

Also, the overall effects on the economy are questionable, especially considering the supplemental tax and the regulated prices for producers."
Noerr,New legislation related to the war in Ukraine,"On 21 March 2022, new laws came into force (provisionally on a temporary basis until 31 March 2023) to regulate certain issues relating to the status of refugees from Ukraine.

We provide you with a basic summary of these laws and their impact on refugees below.

1.

General measures Temporary protection

The law introduced the institute of “temporary protection”, under which war refugees from Ukraine can legally reside in the Czech Republic.

The institute of temporary protection will be introduced until 31 March 2023 and will be a gateway for war refugees from Ukraine to the labour market, education, social system or the Schengen area.

This special permit to reside in the Czech Republic is granted upon request by the Ministry of the Interior or the Police of the Czech Republic to: a) Ukrainian nationals residing in Ukraine before the invasion of the Russian Federation (24 February 2022); b) stateless persons and third-country nationals from countries other than Ukraine who were granted specific protection in Ukraine prior to the invasion; c) family members of persons referred to in a) and b); and d) foreigners who prove that on the date of the invasion of Ukraine they held a valid permanent residence permit in Ukraine and their departure to the state of which they are citizens is not possible due to a threat of real danger.

An application for temporary protection should usually be submitted in person at the Ministry of the Interior or the Police of the Czech Republic, and must be accompanied by an ID card and, if necessary, a photo.

The application will not be successful if a similar application has already been submitted in another Member State of the European Union or if the foreigner has already been granted temporary protection in another Member State.

The granting of temporary protection will be shown as a label in the ID card.

The institute of temporary protection also applies to war refugees from Ukraine who are already residing in the Czech Republic on the basis of a previously granted special residence visa (granted after the invasion of Ukraine).

Healthcare Refugees who have been granted temporary protection (see above) are entitled to healthcare paid for by public health insurance.

This entitlement also applies to refugees who received health services no more than 30 days before being granted temporary protection (but no earlier than on the date of the invasion).

2. Employment and social security Employment without a special work permit Temporary protection holders will have full access to the labour market.

Therefore, holders of temporary protection will not be required to obtain any work permit to be employed and employers will be able to employ temporary protection holders without restrictions in any position.

Humanitarian benefit Holders of temporary protection are entitled to humanitarian benefit in the amount of CZK 5,000, and in cases where the refugee cannot afford the basic necessities of life, this benefit may be paid repeatedly for the following five months.

Childcare and social services Children of refugees from Ukraine will be allowed to attend children’s group activities, with the state contributing to participation by foreign children.

The law also makes it easier for temporary protection holders to work in children’s activity groups or as social service workers.

They will be able to prove their professional qualifications for these professions for a certain period of time by just providing an affidavit.

3. Education The law sets out special rules for the admission of children as war refugees from Ukraine to kindergartens, primary schools, high schools and conservatories etc., where they can be admitted to the first year of school already in progress.

In addition, schools can adapt their study plans according to the children’s needs.

The Ministry of the Interior is planning intensive Czech language courses in order to facilitate the integration of students into schools."
Noerr,New legislation related to the war in Ukraine,"The Ministry of the Interior is planning intensive Czech language courses in order to facilitate the integration of students into schools.

To ensure children’s access to education, the law extends the deadline for applying for high school and the time for taking the entrance exam.

War refugees from Ukraine are also exempted from paying a fee for nostrification (i.e. recognition of foreign education) to facilitate their access to qualified professions.

Finally This was just a brief summary of the new legislation adopted to improve the situation of war refugees from Ukraine in the Czech Republic.

Although the situation is serious, we believe that the long-term stay of refugees from Ukraine can also potentially benefit domestic society and the economy."
Noerr,10 FAQs on entry into Germany from Ukraine,"Українська версія тексту за посиланням .

The current conflict in Ukraine and the EU Mass Influx Directive (2001/55/EG), activated for the first time in this context, have led to many questions for those who have fled Ukraine, for employers and for helpers.

The flood of information and sources has made it difficult for those affected to know what to do.

We have compiled the answers to the most frequently asked questions on issues involving entry into Germany, residence, work and social benefits below.

1.

Can people fleeing from Ukraine enter Germany without a residence permit/visa?

Ukrainian citizens can travel to Germany and remain for 90 days without a visa.

They must have a biometric passport.

Entry is currently permitted even without such a passport, but then a police identification process is usually conducted.

2.

Do Ukrainian citizens have to apply for asylum?

No, this is not necessary.

Based on the resolution to accept displaced persons according to Article 5(1) of Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for giving temporary protection, starting immediately, people fleeing from Ukraine will be granted a residence permit according to section 24 (Granting residency for temporary protection) of the German Residence Act ( Aufenthaltsgesetz ) after making the appropriate application.

3.

What are the rules for people who were already legally residing in the EU before 24 February 2022?

According to instructions issued by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior ( Bundesministerium des Innern und für Heimat – BMI ), the temporary protection is also extended to include those who fled from Ukraine not long before 24 February 2022 or who were staying in the EU shortly before this date, e.g. on holiday, visiting relatives or to work, and could not/cannot return to Ukraine due to the conflict.

4. Where should Ukrainians apply for temporary protection according to section 24 German Residence Act?

As a rule, the immigration office in the city in which the applicants have their usual place of residence is responsible. 

You can find the relevant office by entering the city name or postal code here .

Some authorities offer the option of filing the application online on a registration website set up specifically for that purpose, e.g. the LEA immigration office in Berlin, or when they register for the first time.

It is advisable to consult the website of the relevant municipality or city.

5.

How long does the residence permit according to section 24 German Residence Act remain in effect?

The temporary protection is granted until 4 March 2024 at the latest.

6. Are people fleeing from Ukraine permitted to work in Germany?

Yes, the residence permit to be issued according to section 24 German Residence Act automatically entitles the bearer to commence self-employment or employment.

Even if there is no prospect of a specific job, when the residence permit is issued, the immigration office will enter into it that employment is permitted.

This means that no separate work permit from another authority is required.

7. How long does it take to issue the residence permit according to section 24 German Residence Act?

That depends on the competent immigration office.

However, the immigration office can first (after the application is made) issue a temporary residence certificate ( Fiktionsbescheinigung ) under which employment is allowed even before the actual permit has been issued.

8.

What are the rules for employment?

As soon as the residence permit according to section 24 German Residence Act or the temporary residence certificate is available, employment can commence.

A written employment contract should be entered into in any event.

This can be for a “mini-job”, an internship contract or a “normal” employment contract according to German labour law – in this case, everything is the same as when hiring German employees."
Noerr,10 FAQs on entry into Germany from Ukraine,"This can be for a “mini-job”, an internship contract or a “normal” employment contract according to German labour law – in this case, everything is the same as when hiring German employees.

As a rule, this employment is subject to German social security deductions and income tax.

Employers must register their (new) employees with the authorities.

The (new) Ukrainian employees will probably not yet have, for example, a German social security number; this will be sent to them automatically by the German pension authority ( Deutsche Rentenversicherung ) by post as soon as the employer has registered them – here as well, everything is the same as with German employees.

However, the employer must place a copy of the residence permit or the temporary residence certificate in the employee’s file and comply with its terms of validity.

9.

What do Ukrainians need to do in order to receive social benefits?

People who have fled from Ukraine and are in need can receive social benefits starting upon arrival and without needing a residence permit (e.g. according to section 24 German Residence Act).

The only requirement for this is registration with an initial registration facility.

The registration (also referred to as “initial registration”) is also possible throughout Germany at any immigration office or the German Federal Police ( Bundespolizei ).

After the registration, an arrival document ( Ankunftsnachweis ) is issued with which social benefits application can be made with the local social welfare office ( Sozialamt ) under the German Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act ( Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz – AsylbLG).

10. Is it possible to travel onward within the EU?

Ukrainian citizens who have entered an EU Member State (that is also a Schengen country) without a visa with a biometric passport are free to travel within the Schengen area and remain for up to 90 days (within 180 days).

If an EU Member State has already issued a residence permit, such residence is permitted in other EU Member States for this time period.

Moving to another EU Member State for residence requires compliance with the laws of that state.

As a rule, it is not easily permissible to take up employment in another state."
Noerr,Romania: Employment requirements eased for Ukrainian citizens,"I. EU-synchronized international aid On 4 March 2022

, the Council of the European Union adopted a unanimous decision ¹ establishing the existence of a mass influx of displaced persons from Ukraine and activated the provisions of Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001 ² (“ Temporary Protection Directive ”) to grant temporary support for Ukrainian citizens escaping the current military aggression (and for other individuals affected by it).

The purpose of the above decision was to alleviate pressure on national asylum support services in order to create a synchronised reaction and harmonised rights across the EU.

The proceedings related to various matters ( i.e. residence, access to the labour market and housing, medical assistance and access to education for children) have been expedited.

Therefore, it was necessary for each Member State to implement national provisions in order to effect the temporary protection measures (unless existing laws already provided equivalent or better protection).

II.

New Romanian labour regulations for Ukrainian citizens Since Romania shares a border with Ukraine, a significant number of Ukrainian citizens have already entered  Romanian territory, and some have opted to remain in the country.

A large number of refugees are still expected to arrive.

Considering the above, as well as the provisions of the Temporary Protection Directive, national legislation was amended to grant humanitarian assistance.

On 8 March, Emergency Government Ordinance no.

20/2022 on amending and supplementing certain normative acts and to establish certain support and humanitarian assistance measures, published in the Official Gazette of Romania under no. 231/08.03.2022 (“ EGO 20/2022 ”) entered into force.

Moreover, on 10 March, the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity approved the procedure for the employment of Ukrainian citizens ³ in line with the provisions of EGO 20/2022.

According to the provisions of such regulations, the main labour-related measures amending the applicable labour legislation may be summarised as follows: Ukrainian citizens who legally enter Romania and who do not apply for a form of protection under Law 122/2006 on asylum in Romania can be employed without a work permit, and their right to stay for employment purposes is extended without the obligation to obtain a long-stay visa for employment purposes.

Ukrainian citizens wishing to be employed in Romania but not having documents attesting to their professional qualification or work experience can apply to government employment agencies for support and registration.

Ukrainian citizens will have the opportunity to work in Romania based on an affidavit in which they declare that they possess the appropriate professional training and experience in the field of activity in question and that they have no criminal record.

Note: The above derogations do not apply for work in regulated professions (e.g. physician, pharmacist, architect etc.), irrespective of whether such professions are carried out within a company or independently.

Career guidance counsellors will provide them with information and professional counselling services and assist them in filling in the affidavit, which will also be available in Ukrainian.

Note: Ukrainian citizens that contact an employer directly without requesting the services of the government employment agencies must fill in the affidavit with the employer's assistance.

After receiving professional information and counseling services, the Ukrainian citizen is placed in a vacant job that corresponds to the qualifications and experience as declared and receives an assignment order to present to the employer.

Note: The work permit is valid for twelve months as of the employment, with the possibility of pre-extension by periods of six months, for a maximum of one year."
Noerr,Romania: Employment requirements eased for Ukrainian citizens,"Note: The work permit is valid for twelve months as of the employment, with the possibility of pre-extension by periods of six months, for a maximum of one year.

Ukrainian citizens now have access to the Romanian unemployment insurance system, to statutory measures on preventing unemployment and to employment promoting measures, which will be granted following registration at the employment agencies.

Closing remark This is a brief summary of the relevant labour-related amendments aimed at filling the legislative void an employer may face in relation to the impact of the military crisis in Ukraine.

However, it does not cover all obligations and rules to be observed by an employer and/or employee in a specific employment relationship.

² Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof.

³ The Procedure was approved by way of Order no. 301/2022, published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, no. 240 of 10 March 2022."
Noerr,Current information on Ukraine,"The EU Mass Influx Directive 2001/55/EC, introduced in 2001 in response to the Yugoslavian wars, has entered into effect for the first time due to a decision by the EU Council on 4 March 2022.

This triggers temporary protection status in all EU Member States.

Certain minimum standards must be guaranteed, including a work permit.

The implementation of the Directive in Germany is governed by section 24 German Residence Act (Aufenthaltsgesetz ).

The following groups of individuals who have been driven out of Ukraine since 24 February 2022 by Russia’s military invasion can now apply for temporary protection at the competent immigration authority: Ukrainian citizens who had their place of residence in Ukraine before 24 February 2022, Stateless persons and citizens of countries other than Ukraine who were under international protection or equivalent national protection in Ukraine before 24 February 2022, Family members (i.e. spouses, unmarried life partners, minor single children and close relatives under additional conditions) of those in the above two groups even if they are not Ukrainian citizens.

While under temporary protection, the abovementioned people are permitted to pursue self-employment or employment.

The competent immigration authority will state in the residence permit that employment is permitted, even if there is no specific prospect of employment yet.

This means that it is no longer necessary to apply for or procure a separate work permit from another authority.

Persons with a residence permit for temporary protection in Germany are also entitled to receive advisory and placement services from government employment agencies.

Thus, the only prerequisite for employment is to register with the  residential registration offices and to apply for a residence permit at the immigration authority responsible for the place of residence.

Noerr,Another package of sanctions from 15 March 2022,"On 15 March 2021, the European Union published another package of sanctions that includes new severe measures .

Prohibition of transactions with certain state-owned companies A new transaction prohibition is likely to have the most extensive economic effects.

This affects certain state-owned companies listed by name in the likewise new Annex XIX.

It makes it prohibited to initiate or continue to directly or indirectly engage in transactions of any kind and with any content with these companies, Art.

5aa and Annex XIX of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014 .

This transaction prohibition applies to important Russian companies such as Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corporation, Uralvagonzavod, Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft, Alsmast Anty, Kamaz, Rostec, Sofcomflot and United Ship Building Corporation.

The prohibition also applies to companies established outside the European Union whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50% by these companies.

However, the Regulation also provides for significant exceptions to this prohibition, for example regarding a grandfather clause for the execution until 15 May 2022 of contracts concluded before 16 March 2022, or for certain transactions in connection with the purchase, import or transport of fossil fuels and certain metals into the European Union or related to energy projects outside Russia.

Additional measures: sanctions related to capital markets and goods The measures affecting the capital markets and payment systems were supplemented with a prohibition to provide credit rating services to any Russian national or entity (Art. 5j of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014).

In addition, it is now prohibited to import certain iron and steel products which originate in or have been exported from Russia (Art. 3g and Annex XVII of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014) and to sell, supply, transfer or export certain luxury goods to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia insofar as their value exceeds EUR 300 per item (Art.

3h with Annex XVIII of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014).

Another new prohibition is to invest in or grant any new loan or credit or otherwise provide financing to any legal person, entity or body incorporated or constituted under the law of Russia or any other third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia, particularly Art.

3a of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014.

Wide-ranging additions have likewise been made to Annex IV of Regulation (EU) no. 

833/2014: it is only permitted under very strict conditions to grant approval to the companies listed there for exceptions to the prohibition of supplying dual-use and Annex VII goods that could contribute to strengthening Russia militarily or technologically.

Sanctions against natural persons The list of natural persons and entities covered by prohibitions such as the supply prohibition, which is wider-ranging in places than the new business prohibition, has also been expanded, Annex I of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 269/2014 .

For example, the oligarchs Abramovich, Khan and Kerimov and the entities Rosneft Areo, Rosoboron Export, Russian Helicopters, United Aircraft Corporation, United Ship Building Corporation and Uralvagonzavod (see also Russia Sanctions / Consolidated Short List of Sanctioned Legal Entities and Persons ) have been added to the list.

These measures add a new dimension to the already head-spinning complexity of current sanctions law.

It has become very difficult, even for experts, to discern what business can still be conducted with which listed persons or entities.

To implement these measures in an effective compliance structure, companies need to have a completely automated sanctions list screening that includes all lists and the information needed to correctly evaluate a listing."
Noerr,Another package of sanctions from 15 March 2022,"Additionally, the rules and exceptions also include vague passages that make it very difficult for companies to clearly determine what their obligations – including contractual obligations – are and when – punishable – prohibitions apply.

Noerr,Russia Sanctions / Consolidated Short List of Sanctioned Legal Entities and Persons,"Within the framework of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and of Russian military actions in Ukraine severe sanctions have been imposed by the EU, its member states, the US, the UK and others against Russia (collectively “ Russia Sanctions ”).

Russia Sanctions target individuals, companies and institutions with whom specific types of transactions or business dealings are restricted or entirely prohibited until further notice (“ Sanctioned Persons ”) and further trade restrictions as e.g. export and import bans, the prohibitions of investments or services.

It is every individual company’s responsibility to verify immediately whether any of its ongoing or envisaged operations may be subject to Russia Sanctions.

Breach of sanctions entails severe liability risks, including criminal liability for directors.

Consolidated Short List Since the Russia Sanctions are regulated in numerous different legal acts and since the lists of Sanctioned Persons contains already more than 1000 persons and companies, while at the same time the bigger part of these is of limited relevance for the business relations, please see below a Consolidated Short List of the most prominent and from a business perspective relevant Sanctioned Persons (“ Short List of Particularly Relevant Sanctioned Persons ”).

The Short List of Particularly Relevant Sanctioned Persons was generated on the basis of the comprehensive US, EU and UK sanction lists.

It is not exhaustive and contains sometimes simplifications.

It shall provide a first high level navigation to identify sanction risks, but does not constitute legal advice.

If you identify a relation of your company’s business operations to any of the below short-listed Sanctioned Persons or to any of their affiliates or to entities with a similar name it is highly recommended to review the relevant relation in question from the perspective of Russia Sanctions and to suspend any transactions until sanction clearance has been obtained.

Noerr,Payment service providers’ reporting obligations in the event of security incidents,"Payment service providers must inform the German Federal Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht , “BaFin” ) without undue delay of any serious operational or security incidents, according to section 54(1) sentence 1 Payment Services Supervision Act ( Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz , “ ZAG ” ).

On 10 March 2022, BaFin issued its circular 03/2022 (BA) (“ Circular ”), firstly specifying when an operational or security incident should be classified as “ serious ” thus requiring reporting; and secondly, amending the details of the requirements for the reporting process.

As of 1 October 2022, the Circular will replace circular 08/2018 (BA) of 7 June 2018 on reporting serious payment security incidents.

The reporting obligation in section 54(1) sentence 1 ZAG is intended to ensure that BaFin and also the European supervisory authorities (due to the German supervisory authority’s reporting obligation to the EBA and the European Central Bank in section 54(1) sentence 2 ZAG) are informed about any circumstances affecting payment transactions within the remit of payment service providers and can take any necessary steps against the institutions.

Thus, there is a specific supervisory reporting obligation for security incidents on top of the more general legal reporting obligations for security incidents in data protection law (Article 33 GDPR) or in the law on critical infrastructure (section 8b(4) of the German Act on the Federal Office for IT Security) which complements the notification obligation particularly addressing incidents in outsourcing relationships (section 24 (1) no. 19 of the German Banking Act). 

Given the increasing significance of cyberattacks, ensuring compliance with these reporting obligations as well as, of course, measures to avoid security incidents in principle, is an important element of proper business organisation.

With the amendment of the Circular, BaFin is responding to the adaptation of the guidelines from the European Banking Authority (EBA) on reporting major incident cases under the Payment Services Directive ( EBA/GL/2017/10 ) last year.

The amendment revises the criteria for classification as a serious security incident, streamlines the reporting process and specifies some requirements, especially on the expected timing of reports.

In addition, the forms to be used for submitting reports have been revised.

Addition and amendment of the classification criteria for “serious” incidents The criteria for qualifying operational and safety incidents as serious have basically remained unchanged.

In line with the previous requirements, the Circular defines various criteria and thresholds for assessing whether an operational or safety incident has occurred.

The following are particularly relevant: (i) the payment transactions affected, (ii) the payment service users affected, (iii) the security breach in network and information systems, (iv) the downtime of a service, (v) the financial impact, (vi) a high internal escalation level, (vii) the impact on other payment service providers or relevant infrastructure; and (viii) any reputational damage.

Out of the above criteria, only one is new, namely the assessment criterion “ security breach in network and information systems ” (point 1.2 (iii)).

According to this criterion, a payment service provider must determine whether the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of its network or information systems (including the relevant data) associated with the provision of payment services has been breached by a malicious act.

For each criterion, the Circular defines whether and under what conditions it is affected at a high or low impact level."
Noerr,Payment service providers’ reporting obligations in the event of security incidents,"For each criterion, the Circular defines whether and under what conditions it is affected at a high or low impact level.

According to this, an operational or safety incident is “serious” and thus needs to be reported if, on the basis of the criteria and thresholds described in the Circular, it meets at least one criterion of the “ high impact level ” or meets at least three criteria of the “ low impact level ”.

The Circular now clearly states that all operational and security incidents must be assessed and classified as either serious or non-serious.

Therefore, payment institutions must assess every incident according to the requirements of the Circular and cannot limit themselves to considering only (allegedly) serious cases.

Payment service providers should also document this assessment with auditable documentation.

For the institutions concerned, the Circular contains some clarifications.

For example, with regard to the criteria of “ payment transactions affected” (No. 1.2 (i)) and “ payment service users affected” (No. 1.2 (ii)), it is clarified that incidents affecting the ability of a payment service provider to initiate and/or process transactions are generally only to be reported if the incidents last longer than one hour.

However, this restriction will not apply if the thresholds of the high impact level are exceeded.

For the criterion of “ payment transactions affected” , the relevant thresholds for determining the impact level are raised in each case.

Thus, in addition to the incident lasting over an hour, an incident at a low impact level requires that either (i) more than 10% of the payment service provider’s usual transaction volume (in this respect the same as the requirements of circular 08/2018 (BA)) or (ii) a transaction amount of €500,000 (previously the relevant threshold was €100,000) is exceeded.

In the case of a high impact level incident, either 25% of the payment service provider’s usual transaction volume is affected (in this respect equal to the requirements of circular 08/2018 (BA)) or the total amount of the affected payment transactions exceeds €15 million (previously, the relevant threshold was €5 million).

With regard to the criterion of a “ high internal escalation level ” (No. 1.2 (vi)), the Circular states this is only present if due to the impairment of payment-related services the management has been informed or is likely to be informed about the incident outside the regular reporting procedure and continuously during the duration of the incident.

Under circular 08/2018 (BA), it was still sufficient to involve the Chief Information Officer.

With regard to the criterion of “ reputational damage ” (No. 1.2 (vii)), the assessment by the payment service provider must now also take into account whether (i) payment service users and/or other payment service providers have complained about the adverse effects of an incident and (ii) contractual obligations have not been fulfilled or are unlikely to be fulfilled as a result of the incident.

Furthermore, the assessment of the visibility that an incident acquires or is likely to acquire in the market will no longer depend solely on the knowledge but on the "" best knowledge "" of a payment institution.

This is likely to be accompanied by an obligation to proactively obtain such knowledge where appropriate.

Probability of an incident having negative effects It is also notable that the Circular modifies the probability required to identify an “ operational and security incident ”.

If there are not yet urgent, but imminent adverse effects of an incident on the integrity, availability, confidentiality and/or authenticity of payment-related services, an incident “ in all likelihood ” is no longer required, as was the case according to circular 08/2018 (BA); instead, it is sufficient for corresponding future consequences to be simply “ likely ”."
Noerr,Payment service providers’ reporting obligations in the event of security incidents,"In parallel, the wording "" extremely likely "" was replaced by “ likely ” for the individual classification criteria (e.g. regarding the payment transactions affected, the payment service users affected, the service downtime, the high escalation level, the impact on other payment service providers or relevant infrastructures and any reputational damage) with regard to the future impact of an incident.

This means a stricter standard will be applied in future, when the simple probability of negative consequences of an incident will be sufficient to classify it as a serious operational or security incident.

Revision of the reporting process The process for reporting in accordance with section 54(1) sentence 1 ZAG has also been revised.

In principle, however, the reporting process still has three different stages, namely an initial report, one or more interim reports and a final report.

With regard to the initial reports, new terminology is used for the triggering of the submission of the initial report.

Whereas previously, according to circular 08/2018 (BA), the initial report had to be submitted within four hours of “ identification” of a serious operational and/or safety incident, with identification being an equivalent term to classification as serious, a conceptual distinction is now made between identification on the one hand and classification on the other, with “ classification ” being decisive for the start of the four-hour period for submitting the initial report (No. 2.8).

This conceptual differentiation can only be interpreted such that the “identification” of an incident refers to the knowledge of the relevant factual circumstances, while “ classification ” includes assessing them as serious or non-serious within the meaning of section 54(1) sentence 1 ZAG.

In addition, there is a specific obligation for the payment service provider to carry out the classification promptly.

This must be done no later than 24 hours after the incident has been identified and immediately after the information required for classifying the incident is available (No. 2.9).

A positive factor is the new structure of the previously fragmented system of interim reports.

Now, interim reports only have to be submitted if: the activities/processes achieve the same level of performance/conditions again in terms of processing times, capacity, security requirements, etc., set by the payment service provider or externally specified by a service level agreement and no contingency measures are in place anymore (No. 2.12); regular business activities have not yet been resumed after three business days (No. 2.13); significant changes in information have occurred since previous reports (e.g. if the incident is worse or become less serious, new causes have been identified or action has been taken to correct the problem) (No. 2.14); and/or at the request of BaFin (No. 2.14).

The final notification must now be made within 20 business days of regular operations being resumed, instead of within two weeks as before (No. 2.18).

Other additional obligations of payment service providers In addition, payment service providers are now obliged to report any reclassification of an incident from serious to non-serious or vice versa to BaFin without undue delay (No. 1.5).

Previously, BaFin had to be informed about the reclassification as soon as possible and no later than the estimated date of the next (interim) report (No. 2.10 of circular 08/2018 (BA)).

Where the reporting obligation is delegated by a payment service provider to a third party and that third party is allowed to submit the report in a consolidated form (i.e. by submitting a single report referring to several payment service providers affected by the same serious operational or security incident), the payment service provider must also ensure a list of the payment service providers involved is submitted to BaFin (No. 3.2 (d))."
Noerr,Payment service providers’ reporting obligations in the event of security incidents,"Furthermore, in the case of a delegated reporting obligation, payment service providers must ensure in future that the delegated report refers to the individual data of the relevant payment service provider in the event of an incident caused by a technical service provider (or technical infrastructure) which affects several payment service providers (No. 3.6).

The only exception is if it is a consolidated report that relates to several payment service providers.

Timetable and implementation The provisions in the Circular for reporting serious security incidents pursuant to section 54(1) sentence 1 ZAG will apply from 1 October 2022.

Until then, BaFin’s administrative practice will be based on circular 08/2018 (BA), which will be repealed when the amended Circular comes into force.

Conclusion The amendment of the rules for reporting serious operational or security incidents according to section 54(1) sentence 1 ZAG is a reaction to the increasing risks of cyberattacks and is therefore welcome in principle.

For example, it makes sense for the criterion of a “ security breach in network or information systems ” to be included in the criteria for incidents to be reported.

Of course, this would appear to lead to more reports just as much as the lowering of the probability threshold to be reached for incidents to be reported.

On the other hand, the exclusion of incidents (with a low impact level) that are resolved within one hour, assuming suitable organisation of the internal processes at payment service providers for rapid fault resolution, should instead lead to a reduction in the number of relevant incidents to be reported.

Obviously, this does not affect the obligation to review the incident internally to see if it needs to be reported.

Streamlining the procedure for interim reports is ultimately a welcome simplification.

All in all, the amendment is certainly not a “smash hit”.

But this was not to be expected in view of the clear changes to the EBA guidelines on reporting major incident cases under the Payment Services Directive.

In this respect, the practical relevance is likely to be that the amendment once again focuses the attention of payment service providers on IT security and the reporting processes for security incidents as a key component of a proper compliance system."
Noerr,Russian countermeasures getting more comprehensive,"+++ Update 14.03.2022 +++ Export bans / threatened expropriation of foreign investors In response to the sanctions imposed on Russia by the US, the EU and other countries, the Russian Federation has expanded its countermeasures designed to protect the Russian economy.

In particular, new measures were introduced by the Decree of the President of Russia No. 100 dated 9 March 2022 ("" Decree 100 "") and by the Order of the Russian Government No. 311 dated 11 March 2022.

Export ban for numerous products While the previous Russian countermeasures were mainly aimed at stopping the flow of capital out of Russia, the Russian government has now imposed an export ban on a large variety of goods.

The ban is intended to prevent a ""flight of goods"" - including telecommunications, medical, automotive, agricultural and electrical equipment as well as timber products - and to ensure the ""uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the Russian economy"".

The list of goods that can no longer be exported to the EU and the USA , among others, includes more than 200 products. 

Oil and gas are not among them.

The export ban was initially imposed until 31 December 2022.

While the export ban is probably of minor significance for companies based in the EU and the US, it complicates the situation for subsidiaries of Western companies in Russia.

They are now prevented from selling stock to customers in the EU or the USA.

However, in view of the current lack of Russian customers and the weakness of the rouble, such sales would be necessary as measures to secure liquidity (also as part of the preparation for an orderly solvent withdrawal from Russia).

Draft law on the quasi-expropriation of foreign investors On 9 March, the Russian government passed a draft law allowing Russian companies with foreign shareholdings to be placed under external management.

The respective companies must have a balance sheet value of 1 billion roubles (approx.

7 million euros, based on the EUR/RUB exchange rate of 11.3.2022) and at least 100 employees.

In addition, they must be linked to so-called ""unfriendly states"" (i.e. states that have imposed sanctions against Russia).

Such a link exists if foreign companies from ""unfriendly states"" control the relevant Russian company (the "" Company "") or hold at least 25% of the Company's shares.

According to the draft law, there are two reasons for introducing external management: The management bodies of the Russian Company concerned or its shareholders/participants have effectively ceased managing the company's business in violation of legal requirements.

For example, the management has left Russia, leaving the Company without management ""contrary to the interests of the company""; or actions/omissions have been committed that significantly reduced the value of the Company's assets, rendered the Company unable to meet its obligations, or forced it to cease operations in violation of legal requirements The management bodies of the Russian Company concerned or its shareholders/participants have taken actions that may lead to an unjustified cessation of the Company's activities, its liquidation or insolvency.

According to the draft law, this could be the case, for example, if the cessation of the Company's activities was publicly announced without obvious economic reasons, contracts that are essential for the operation of the Company were terminated or measures were initiated to dismiss more than 1/3 of the workforce.

The decision to appoint external management is made by the court on the basis of a request from the Russian Federal Tax Service or a member of the Company's supervisory board.

The Tax Service makes the application on the basis of a decision of the Committee of the Ministry of Economic Development, which in turn may be taken at the request of the head of the region in which the Company is located, the competent minister, the public prosecutors and some other officials."
Noerr,Russian countermeasures getting more comprehensive,"External management is carried out by the state development company VEB.RF or, if the Company is a financial institution, by the DIA (Deposit Insurance Agency).

The draft law provides for the Russian Company concerned to be reorganised following external administration in the form of a demerger or spin-off: The assets of the company are thereby transferred to a newly founded company.

The shares in this newly formed company are then sold by the external administrator by auction and the original Company is liquidated.

+++ Update 07.03.2022 +++ Mandatory Sale of Currency Proceeds

According to Decree 79, Russian currency residents (first of all, Russian companies) are obliged to sell 80% of foreign currency received under “external trade” contracts with non-residents (e.g. foreign companies or citizens) on transfer of goods, IP or information to non-residents, or rendering of services or works for non-residents.

Decree 79 requires Russian currency residents, which engage in foreign economic activities (presumably legal entitles incorporated in Russia), to sell 80% of the foreign currency proceeds received from those activities in their accounts with Russian banks on the basis of “foreign trade” export contracts with non-Russian currency residents.

From 28 February 2022, Russian residents must perform such sale of foreign currency not later than 3 business days from the day such proceeds were credited to their accounts.

This requirement also applies to proceeds credited to accounts of the residents from 1 January until 27 February 2022.

Such proceeds must be sold not later than 3 business days from the day Decree 79 entered into effect, i.e. 28 February 2022.

The above requirement covers all external contracts between residents and non-residents, irrespective of whether such contracts were registered at Russian banks or not.

The mandatory sale of foreign currency will be performed according to procedure established by the Bank of Russia.

No such procedure has been introduced yet.

Transactions with Real Estate and Securities, RUB Loans According to Decree 81, from 2 March 2022 certain transactions (operations) with respect to securities (including shares in Russian joint stock companies) and real estate between Russian residents and Persons Related to Unfriendly States (as defined below) are subject to obtaining of permits from the Governmental Commission on Control over Foreign Investments (the “ Governmental Commission ”).

The restriction applies to transactions that result in appearance of the ownership title on the securities or real estate.

Persons Related to Unfriendly States are persons related to foreign states that perform unfriendly actions with respect to Russian entities and individuals.

Such persons include (i) foreign persons related to such states (including if they have citizenship of such states, or such states are place of their registration, place of predominant doing business or place of predominant making profit for them), or (ii) persons controlled by such foreign persons irrespective of place of their registration or predominant doing business.

The restriction seems to apply to the above transactions irrespective of whether Persons Related to Unfriendly States are sellers or purchasers.

This also potentially covers transactions entered into before 2 March 2022, but not consummated yet.

The restriction also extends to such transactions (operations) with foreign persons that are not Persons Related to Unfriendly States, if the relevant securities or real estate were acquired by such persons from Persons Related to Unfriendly States after 22 February 2022.

The above permits of the Governmental Commission can, if necessary, contain conditions of making/performance of such transactions (operations).

The Government must establish the order of issue of the permits within 5 days from the time Decree 81 entered into effect, i.e. 1 March 2022."
Noerr,Russian countermeasures getting more comprehensive,"The Government must establish the order of issue of the permits within 5 days from the time Decree 81 entered into effect, i.e. 1 March 2022.

Foreign Currency and RUB Loans with Non-Residents From 1 March 2022, Decree 79 prohibits currency operations related to provision by Russian residents to non-residents of foreign currency under loan agreements.

According to Decree 81 such transactions can be however made/performed based on permits issued by the Governmental Commission.

According to comments of the Bank of Russia cited in mass media, “the prohibition on provision of currency loans to non-residents shall apply only to new loans and shall not apply to servicing the current debt.”

We therefore believe the restriction applies only to granting of new loans by Russian residents-lenders to borrowers – non-residents.

Due to some uncertainty of the wording of the Decree however, this restriction can be interpreted broadly by Russian banks.

According to Decree 81, as from 2 March 2022 permits of the Governmental Commission are required for transactions (operations) on provision of RUB loans to Persons Related to Unfriendly States, if such provision is not prohibited by other regulations.

Sales of Securities From 28 February 2022, the Bank of Russia prohibited brokers to perform sales of securities at instructions of foreign legal entities or individuals (non-residents).

Ban of Dividends and Other Payments under Securities Instructions of the Bank of Russia dated 28 February prohibited payments of dividends to foreign persons.

Although the instructions applies only to registrars of joint stock companies, many Russian banks suspended any dividend payments (also from limited liability companies) to foreign persons.

Instructions of the Bank of Russia dated 28 February also prohibited depositaries and registrars to transfer any incomes under securities of Russian issuers to foreign persons.

Ban of Repayment of Loans and Payments under Financial Instruments The decree of the President of Russia dated 5 March prohibited Russian residents to repay loans to Persons Related to Unfriendly States in amounts exceeding RUB 10 mio.

(equivalent of approx.

USD 95k) per month.

The relevant funds may be credited by Russian residents to Russian bank accounts opened for Persons Related to Unfriendly States in Rubles upon request of Russian residents.

This will be treated as a due performance of the obligations.

The same procedure applies to payments to Persons Related to Unfriendly States under Financial Instruments issued by Russian residents.

Cash Export From 2 March 2022

Decree 81 prohibits export from Russia of foreign currency in cash in foreign currency in the amount exceeding USD 10,000.

Threats of Insolvency Proceedings and Criminal Liability for Termination of Business Activities by Foreign Investors According to the statements to Russian mass media by Mr. Belousov, deputy Head of the Russian Government, on 4 March, suspension of activities in Russia by a foreign investor (closing a production, etc) will be treated by the Russian authorities as intentional insolvency.

According to Mr. Belousov, in such case insolvency proceedings over the relevant enterprise will be commenced by the authorities.

It should be also noted that intentional insolvency is a crime prohibited by Article 196 of the Criminal Code punishable up to 7 years imprisonment.

The information is being monitored and updated.

Noerr,Overview of German banking regulation 2022,"Financial regulation is subject to permanent development.

Recent changes can be attributed to a multitude of economic, pandemic, political and technological factors.

Dr Jens H. Kunz and Klaudyna Lichnowska from our practice group Financial Services Regulation have taken the opportunity to contribute an article to GLI’s “Banking Regulation 2022” including an overview of banking regulators and key regulations.

The contribution also addresses the key regulatory topics as well as the most recent developments of the last year including the legislative responses to trends like digitalisation, crypto assets, blockchain and artificial intelligence.

Bank governance and internal controls, bank capital requirements as well as the rules governing banks’ relationships with their customers and other third parties are also discussed in the article."
Noerr,Electronic signatures in transactions,"In times of advancing globalisation and new technologies allowing large amounts of data to be exchanged in encrypted form in fractions of a second, traditional written form, i.e. only concluding contracts when the parties or their representatives are simultaneously present or by exchanging manually signed documents through the post, seems somewhat outdated.

The call for digital solutions has become even louder in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and there is hardly a transaction where someone does not ask whether documents can also be signed electronically (for example using Adobe Sign or DocuSign).

Against this background, we take a closer look at the possibilities for using electronic signatures below.

Types of electronic signature There are three different types of electronic signature which originate from the definitions contained in the European eIDAS Regulation : I. Simple electronic signatures The term “simple electronic signature” is not mentioned in the eIDAS Regulation, but is instead inferred.

It is commonly understood as covering any electronic signature not corresponding to the advanced or qualified signature levels.

“Electronic signature” means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign.

A simple electronic signature includes, for example, a scanned signature, a signature created on a touch screen or an e-mail in which the sender makes it clear that the e-mail is being sent in his or her name.

II.

Advanced electronic signatures By contrast, an advanced electronic signature has to meet the following cumulative requirements: it is uniquely linked to the signatory; it is capable of identifying the signatory; it is created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of confidence, use under his sole control; and it is linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable.

Uniquely linked to signatory and capable of identifying the signatory The distinction between the first two criteria is not completely clear-cut.

In practice, the best-known providers of advanced electronic signatures, Adobe Sign and DocuSign, use a multi-stage authentication procedure.

An access code is sent to the user’s e-mail address which is valid once and replaced by a personal password.

The second stage is a telephone call or an SMS sent to the number provided by the user.

Finally, the user’s identity card or passport is checked over the platform.

Creating electronic signature data and preventing subsequent changes to data In practice, signature software will be required in order to create an advanced electronic signature, even although the eIDAS Regulation does not contain any detailed information on this.

The technical process involves generating a hash value from the signed document consisting of a unique combination of numbers and letters.

The person signing encrypts the hash value using their private key (= the digital signature) and the recipient then decrypts it using the public key transmitted and at the same time creates a hash value for the document received.

The recipient can determine whether the document was subsequently changed by comparing the hash values.

III.

Qualified electronic signatures A qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device and which is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures.

Qualified trust service providers for consumers are listed by the German Federal Network Agency under the link Bundesnetzagentur - Signatur .

Qualified electronic signatures can be technically implemented using a signature card, a reader and the associated signature software or by remote signature."
Noerr,Electronic signatures in transactions,"Qualified electronic signatures can be technically implemented using a signature card, a reader and the associated signature software or by remote signature.

No hardware is needed for a remote signature because the signature is created by a qualified trust service provider on the signatory’s behalf.

Unlike in advanced electronic signatures, the signatory’s identity is verified by the qualified certificate.

The requirements for obtaining the certificate are higher than those for the authentication methods used by electronic signature providers.

On the one hand, certification is only carried out by a few trust service providers accredited by the Germany Federal Network Agency;  on the other, the user’s identity has to be proven by providing an identification document.

The qualified trust service providers establish the user’s identity by using the identity card’s online ID function (eID) or by the video ID procedure, for example.

Use of electronic signatures in transactions and in the management of portfolio companies In this section we take a closer look at the possible uses of electronic signatures when executing and amending the documents typically required for transactions and for managing portfolio companies.

This is based on the general principle under German law that the parties are not subject to any formal requirements for documents, to which there are just a few statutory exceptions.

If none of these exceptions apply, electronic signatures can be used.

I. Share purchase agreements (SPAs)

Concluding SPAs If the items being purchased are shares in a German limited liability company ( Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung , or GmbH ), the contract has to be recorded in the presence of a notary (qualified specialist lawyer) as set out in section 15(3) and (4) German Limited Liability Companies Act ( GmbH-Gesetz – GmbHG).

In contrast, shares in other types of companies can normally be acquired without any special requirements as to form.

However, if the seller is a German stock corporation ( Aktiengesellschaft , or AG ) and the shares being sold are the company’s main assets, a resolution by the general meeting pursuant to section 179a(1), first sentence German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz – AktG) which is authenticated by a notary may be required.

If it is possible to acquire shares without any special formal requirements, using an advanced or qualified electronic signature is particularly suitable since it is easy to determine whether changes have been made by comparing the hash values in an large contract.

Amending SPAs If the conclusion of an SPA had to be recorded before a notary due to section 15(4) German Limited Liability Companies Act, any amendments to the agreement as a rule also have to be authenticated by a notary due to the “principle of completeness” developed in German case law.

This does not apply if only provisions not related in any way to the obligation to transfer the shares are to be changed, for instance a change of address for notifications.

Any form (including electronic) can then essentially be used for the amendment agreement unless the parties have agreed otherwise.

For example, agreements frequently contain a “dual written form clause” stating that amendments also have to be in writing and signed and, where applicable, authenticated by a notary and that this also applies to the agreement regarding written form itself.

In order to comply with voluntary stricter requirements as to form it is sufficient for a message to be transmitted by means of telecommunications and for a contract to be transmitted by exchanging letters, unless a different intention is to be assumed, as set out in section 127(2), first sentence of the German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB)."
Noerr,Electronic signatures in transactions,"The prevailing opinion is that a handwritten signature is not necessary as long as the declaration is embodied in text (e.g. as an e-mail); however others only regard receipt of the signed original version as being unnecessary.

It is also unclear whether an agreement stating that any changes to the clause regarding such dual requirements as to form can also be interpreted as meaning that text form is not sufficient where the stricter requirements have been opted for voluntarily.

Due to the ambiguous legal situation, it is essential to include a clear provision in the contract.

If electronic form has been agreed in the legal transaction, a qualified electronic signature is not required in case of doubt – an advanced or simple electronic signature will then be sufficient.

However, if there is no explicit agreement, under section 127(3), second sentence German Civil Code each party can subsequently require that the contract is signed using a qualified electronic signature or authenticated by a notary.

Despite this, the legal transaction already becomes effective when the lower requirements as to form have been met.

II.

Shareholders’ agreements (SHAs)

The statements regarding SPAs made above apply by analogy to shareholders’ agreements entered into between the (future) shareholders, usually containing provisions on matters such as cooperation between the shareholders, exits and shareholdings.

In principle, SHAs can be concluded or amended in any form.

However, if there is an obligation to acquire shares in limited liability companies either now or later (e.g. in connection with a pre-emptive right or a drag-along requirement), the SHA should also be notarially recorded due to the principle of completeness advocated by case law.

III.

Shareholder loans Shareholder loans, which are often used for funding the acquisition structure, can also be taken out or modified in any form.

The requirement that a document must be in writing under section 492(1), first sentence German Civil Code is limited to consumer loan agreements in which the borrower is a consumer.

It is advisable to use at least an advanced electronic signature for shareholder loans as well in order to make sure that the signatories and time of conclusion are documented.

If a guarantee is to be issued to secure the loan, the mandatory requirement of signed written form according to section 766, first and second sentences German Civil Code, which cannot be replaced by electronic form, has to be observed.

IV.

Shareholders’ resolutions Section 130(1), first sentence of the German Stock Corporation Act requires that resolutions by the general meeting of a listed stock corporation are always set down in minutes recorded by a notary.

For resolutions by the general meeting of an unlisted stock corporation for which the law does not stipulate a majority of three quarters or more, minutes to be signed by the chairman of the supervisory board are sufficient.

Resolutions by the shareholders of a limited liability company are as a rule adopted in meetings as required by section 48(1) German Limited Liability Companies Act.

Under section 48(2) of the Act, a meeting does not have to be held if all the shareholders declare their consent to the item being adopted in text form or by casting their votes in writing.

This rule is not mandatory, which is why the articles of association can provide various options for the adoption of resolutions, such as voting by telephone conference.

Although the provisions of the articles of association are generally authoritative, certain resolutions still have to be notarised by law.

According to section 53(2)

German Limited Liability Companies Act, these include resolutions that involve amendments to the articles of association, such as an increase in the share capital."
Noerr,Electronic signatures in transactions,"According to section 53(2)

German Limited Liability Companies Act, these include resolutions that involve amendments to the articles of association, such as an increase in the share capital.

Certain resolutions such as the appointment and dismissal of managing directors are generally not subject to requirements regarding form (to the extent permitted by the articles).

However, if there is a change in managing directors, this has to be reported to the commercial register.

Section 12(1), first sentence of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) requires that this is done electronically in publicly certified form.

At the moment the documents can only be certified in person, as a rule during an appointment at the notary’s office (section 40(1)

German Notarial Recording Act ( Beurkundungsgesetz – BeurkG)).

When the German Act Implementing the Digitalisation Directive ( Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Digitalisierungsrichtlinie – DiRUG) comes into force on 1 August 2022, remote certification to be carried out by the notary by means of a video communication system operated by the German Federal Chamber of Notaries will be possible for the first time (under the future section 40a German Notarial Recording Act).

V. Powers of attorney Powers of attorney can essentially be granted without observing any particular form, as stated in section 176(2) German Civil Code.

Only in a few legal cases is a power of attorney authenticated by a notary required, such as when setting up a limited liability company or transferring a property.

However, if a contract is recorded by a notary, then the notary has to check the powers of representation of the parties involved in accordance with section 17 in conjunction with section 12 German Notarial Recording Act.

The original copy of the power of attorney has to be presented to the notary, meaning that it has to be a document signed in writing.

Final comments Where the law does not require a specific form, the parties have a wide range of options for using electronic signatures.

In the context of transactions and the management of portfolio companies, these come into consideration notably for share purchase agreements and shareholder agreements (unless shares in limited liability companies are involved), shareholder loans (if no consumers are involved as borrowers), shareholder resolutions (if this form is permitted in the articles of association and this complies with legal regulations) and powers of attorney (unless they are required for notarial authentication).

In order to avoid any ambiguity, each agreement should specify that an electronic signature is possible and what type or types of electronic signature are permitted."
Noerr,Further tightening of sanctions against Russia and Belarus,"Upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, a further tightening of the existing sanctions against Russia and Belarus entered into force on 9 March 2022.

Thereby, the EU implements its announcement that it would continue and strengthen the measures in view of the ongoing aggression against Ukraine and is aligning its sanctions regimes against Russia and Belarus.

Again, the basic legislation ( Regulation (EU) 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures against Russia, Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 concerning measures in response to threats to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and Regulation (EU) 765/2006 concerning restrictive measures against Belarus) were amended, essentially adding more individuals to the list of persons subject to travel and financial sanctions and in particular expanding the capital markets-related sanctions for Belarus.

The restrictive measures that were introduced include the following: Extended scope of sanctions relating to goods and capital markets With regard to Russia , a prohibition of the sale, supply, transfer and export of maritime navigation goods and technologies specified in the Regulation has been added (Articles 3-4 of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014); in addition, the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping is now listed as one of the state-owned companies for which financing restrictions are in force.

The prohibition of trading in transferable securities and money-market instruments of credit institutions comprising the Central Bank of Russia now also includes a ban on transactions in connection with the management of reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia (Article 5a (4) of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014).

An identical prohibition has been introduced for reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Belarus (Article 1ja of newly amended Regulation (EU) 765/2006).

With regard to Belarus , it is now prohibited to provide public financing or financial assistance for trade with, or investment in, Belarus (Article 1t of newly amended Regulation (EU) 765/2006) to accept large deposits from Belarusian nationals or natural persons residing in Belarus, or legal persons, entities or bodies established in Belarus (Article 1u of newly amended Regulation (EU) 765/2006) as well as to sell euro-denominated transferable securities to any Belarusian national or natural person residing in Belarus or any legal person, entity or body established in Belarus (Article 1y of newly amended Regulation (EU) 765/2006).

This does not apply to nationals of any EU Member State or nationals of third countries who have a residence permit in a Member State.

As for Russia , the sale or supply of euro-denominated banknotes to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Belarus is now prohibited (Article 1za of newly amended Regulation (EU) 765/2006).

Finally, three Belarusian banks were also included in the exclusion from the SWIFT system: as of 20 March 2022, it is prohibited to provide specialised messaging services for payment transactions used for the exchange of financial data for the banks Belagroprombank, Bank Dabrabyt and Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus or companies of whose proprietary rights the listed banks own directly or indirectly more than 50 % (Article 1zb of newly amended Regulation (EU) 765/2006).

Individual sanctions The list of persons subject to the personal financial and travel restrictions has been expanded by 160 entries.

The persons now listed are oligarchs, business people and members of the Russian Federation Council.

The listing of Alexander Semenovich VINOKUROV, Andrey Igorevich MELNICHENKO (associated with the companies EuroChem and SUEK), Dmitry Alexandrovich PUMPYANSKY (associated with the Sinara group of companies)"
Noerr,Further tightening of sanctions against Russia and Belarus,Dmitry Arkadievich MAZEPIN (related to Uralchem) and Vadim Nikolaevich MOSHKOVICH (related to Rusagro) seems particularly relevant from a business perspective (see also Consolidated list of sanctioned legal entities and persons ).
Noerr,Romania: Increased state aid intensities starting 2022,"The state aid framework in Romania was officially aligned with the provisions of the European framework adopted during last year in terms of maximum state aid to be granted for investment projects.

Therefore, the updated maximum intensities specific for each development region are as follows: 50% for North-East, South-East, South-Muntenia and South West-Oltenia 45% for some towns in Ilfov county 40% for North-West and Center 30% for West Even if some of the regions have lower intensities compared to the past period, the good news is that the new intensities may be increased with up to 20% depending on several factors such as: (i) type of applicant company (small/medium entity), (ii) locations where population level has decreased between 2009-2018 and (iii) locations being identified as part of the Just Transition Fund.

Overall, in the period 2022-2027, state aid beneficiaries will have the opportunity to benefit from up to 70% state aid intensity, this non-reimbursable co-financing mechanism allowing Romania to remain a highly competitive option to invest."
Noerr,Huge increase in defence spending and new equipment for Germany’s armed forces (Bundeswehr),"In response to the Russian Federation’s attack on Ukraine, Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz issued a government declaration on 27 February 2022 announcing a huge increase in German defence spending.

The Bundeswehr is to receive €100 billion from the federal budget for investment and armament projects via a special fund.

According to initial plans, most of the special fund (about €68 billion) is to go towards major national projects.

Media reports citing an internal list from Germany’s Ministry of Defence mention a planned €15 billion for the successor to the air force’s Tornado fleet, €5 billion for new transport helicopters, €3 billion for digitalising troops (for example, modernising communication systems with new radios) and €20 billion for new munitions.

In this context, the Chair of the Defence Committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, stated that the poor state of troops was not only a matter of money, but also one of organisation and efficient leadership.

She demanded that “the Bundeswehr’s procurement system must urgently become leaner and more effective.

The Bundeswehr should switch over to significantly more direct procurement – from clothing to helicopters to speedboats.”

Implementing this ambitious project raises complex legal issues of both constitutional law and public procurement law.

Constitutional aspects of establishing a special fund The plan is to set up a special fund for the huge increase in defence spending.

This is not a completely new financing tool, as the federal government has already applied it in the past, including in connection with the energy and climate fund and most recently in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In principle, it is possible to set up a special fund for the Bundeswehr both through ordinary (non-constitutional) law and based on a constitutional amendment with a two-thirds majority in the German Bundestag.

For legal and political reasons, the federal government is currently planning to secure the establishment of the special fund in constitutional law.

Following an amendment to the German constitution ( Grundgesetz ), an implementing law would probably be enacted to govern the details of borrowing and repayment.

From the perspective of constitutional law, the main argument in favour of this is that a special fund established only by ordinary law could be seen as an inadmissible circumvention of the “debt brake” enshrined in the constitution.

The debt brake allows total annual new debt of 0.35% of economic output.

This limit may only be exceeded if natural disasters or extraordinary emergency situations occur that are beyond the control of the state and significantly affect the state’s financial situation.

Whether Russian troops invading Ukraine and the resulting need to strengthen Germany’s defence capability constitutes such an emergency situation would be debatable at least.

But a special fund secured by the German constitution could be designed as a special fund that is not subject to the debt brake.

For political reasons, a constitutional basis would have the advantage of ensuring the resources are actually allocated to the purpose of defence and security, since a “reallocation” of the funds would only be possible via another constitutional amendment.

Under European law, setting up a special fund would probably also be admissible, since the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact 2022, which contain a “debt brake” under European law, have been suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to the EU Commission’s guidance paper now published, this suspension is to be kept in place for 2023, not least due to the uncertainties caused by the Ukraine crisis.

A final decision will be made in the spring of 2022."
Noerr,Huge increase in defence spending and new equipment for Germany’s armed forces (Bundeswehr),"A final decision will be made in the spring of 2022.

Public procurement law aspects as well as opportunities and limits of “lean” procurement From the perspective of public procurement law, the initial focus is likely to be on tools for “lean” procurement in order to avoid lengthy procedures and to implement the planned modernisation of the Bundeswehr soon.

Exemptions from the tendering requirement for defence and security-related public contracts Most of the procurement measures now planned are likely to be defence and security-related public contracts pursuant to section 104(1) of the German Act against Restraints of Competition (GWB).

This includes the supply of military equipment and related components.

Such procurement measures are generally subject to public procurement law and must therefore be put out to public tender, usually on a pan-European basis.

However, German and European law recognise special exceptions to the obligation to tender in the field of defence and security.

Section 107(2) GWB is of particular importance in the defence sector.

This contains two exceptions for certain contracts for military equipment: firstly, if the contracting authority would thereby be forced to provide information the disclosure of which would be contrary to essential security interests within the meaning of Article 346(1)(a) TFEU, or secondly, if the public contracts or concessions are subject to the scope of Article 346(1)(b) TFEU.

The second case in particular is likely to be especially important for the planned projects.

According to Article 346(1)(b) TFEU, each Member State may take “such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security” insofar as they concern the procurement of (exclusively) military equipment.

The list of military equipment covered by the regulation was constitutively and finally decided by the European Council on 15 April 1958.

Although the list has not been revised since then, it can be applied to modern military equipment through a dynamic interpretation.

In the Act on Accelerated Procurement in the Field of Defence and Security and on the Optimisation of Procurement Statistics of 25 March 2020 , the legislator has added standard examples of when essential security interests are affected in section 107(2) sentence 2 GWB.

According to this, essential security interests are affected in particular if the public contract or concession involves key defence-industry technologies.

What counts as a key technology was set out in the strategy paper on strengthening the security and defence industry and includes submarines, armoured vehicles and naval surface shipbuilding.

With regard to the prerequisites of Article 346(1)(b) TFEU, the Member States have a wide margin of discretion.

Nevertheless, each procurement transaction must be examined individually and the Member State bears the burden of proof that the actual conditions for the exception have been met.

In recent years, the European Court of Justice has limited the scope of the exception in Article 346 TFEU to cases in which only the security interests of states are relevant and not other interests, such as those of an economic or industrial policy nature.

Nevertheless, in the practice of the Member States, there are significant opposing trends that aim to expand the Member States’ scope of action in view of Article 346 TFEU, as reflected in the addition of the aforementioned standard examples by the German legislator.

It remains to be seen how this tense situation will evolve in the future.

Exemptions from the obligation to tender in the case of other contracts Section 117 of the GWB provides for exemptions from the obligation to tender in the case of non-military goods, too, if essential security interests are affected, for example."
Noerr,Huge increase in defence spending and new equipment for Germany’s armed forces (Bundeswehr),"This includes procurement measures by the Bundeswehr that do not relate to a defence-specific object or to the procurement of equipment for non-military security purposes, such as the procurement of information technology or telecommunications systems.

Accelerated contract-award procedure for urgent reasons Furthermore, public procurement law also offers options for accelerating or dispensing with open competition in certain situations, such as in the case of “urgent reasons in connection with a crisis” in section 12(1) no. 1 b) aa) of the German Defence and Security Procurement Regulation.

Such a crisis usually exists in the case of armed conflicts and wars, as is currently the case in Ukraine.

As part of the Act on Accelerated Procurement in the Field of Defence and Security and on the Optimisation of Procurement Statistics of 25 March 2020, further cases were included in the Regulation.

Thus, an urgent reason “usually” exists if mandated foreign missions or mission-equivalent obligations of the Bundeswehr (no. 1) or peacekeeping measures (no. 2) require new procurement at short notice or increase existing procurement needs.

Depending on the specific situation, an accelerated procedure is now conceivable with regard to the events in Ukraine, for example on the basis of a deployment-equivalent obligation of the Bundeswehr or also as a peacekeeping measure.

Accelerated review proceedings Also worth mentioning in this context is the option of accelerating the review proceedings, especially since the principle of acceleration in section 167(1) GWB does not apply in the appeal court and the proceedings before the Higher Regional Courts can take much longer.

Therefore, the public contracting authority is free to file an urgent application before the Public Procurement Senate or the Public Procurement Division (section 169(2) and section 176(1) GWB).

In its decision, the court will weigh up whether the contracting authority’s interest in acceleration outweighs the claimant’s interest.

In the event of a crisis (no. 1), a mandated deployment of the Bundeswehr (no. 2) or an alliance obligation (no. 4), the interest of the contracting authority is to “prevail as a rule”.

Possible approaches for reforming procurement In the wake of recent events, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht, in coordination with Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, therefore announced further simplifications of procurement law in order to make procurement more efficient.

Suggestions for improvements and reforms were already proposed by a resolution of the FDP parliamentary group last year, which emphasised, among other things, that lawsuits continue to be a factor of uncertainty in procurement and that the exceptions provided for must be better used.

Furthermore, it was suggested that greater use be made of the option of granting advance permission to award a contract on the grounds of special defence and security interests under section 169(2) GWB.

All efforts to accelerate and in some cases dispense with public procurement procedures must comply with the European legislation.

Public procurement law also offers many options, including with regard to public tenders.

Tenders remain an important instrument for using budget funds as economically and thriftily as possible.

This must also be taken into account in the current debate."
Noerr,How the EU Commission wants to hold private companies accountable to the 1.5° target of the Paris Agreement,"The issue The proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence of 23 February 2022 (“ Draft Directive ”) imposes an obligation on some companies to observe the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement in their business strategy.

We have investigated which companies are affected by this obligation, what specific measures need to be taken by these companies and what the consequences are of not complying with this obligation.

Basic idea and addressees of Article 15 of the Draft Directive Article 15 of the Draft Directive stipulates that companies with more than 500 employees and net annual turnover of over €150 million should adopt a plan to ensure their business model and strategy are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5° C in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

This obligation is intended to apply to both EU and non-EU companies that exceed the above thresholds.

This plan must, in particular, identify, on the basis of information reasonably available to the company, the extent to which climate change is a risk for, or an impact of, the company’s operations.

According to recital 8 of the Draft Directive, this due diligence obligation also serves to implement the obligations of the Paris Agreement on the EU and its Member States as signatories.

Although the Paris Agreement only addresses the signatory states, the Commission stresses that the private sector also has a central role to play in implementing the climate targets.

Specific measures in the Draft Directive Article 15(2) of the Draft Directive and recital 50 mention emission reduction objectives as a possible specific measure to be included in the company’s plan.

According to Article 15(2), if climate change is or should have been identified as a principal risk for, or a principal impact of, the company’s operations, the company must include emission reduction objectives in its plan.

In addition, recital 8 also mentions that the investment strategies of companies are decisive for implementing the climate targets.

However, the Draft Directive does not contain any specifications as to how these investment strategies are to be designed.

There are no other specific measures mentioned in Article 15 or in the recitals.

The further provisions of the business plan therefore seems to be at the discretion of the company , unless the Commission publishes further guidelines and recommendations on that topic.

Management’s responsibility According to Article 25 of the Draft Directive, a company’s management, when carrying out its duty to act in the best interests of the company, should also take into account the effects of its decisions on aspects of sustainability, such as climate change, in the short, medium and long term.

Any breaches of this obligation are to be sanctionable under national law in the same way as other breaches of duty by company management.

In addition, Article 15(3) of the Draft Directive states that based on the terms of its variable remuneration components the management should be given an incentive to take into account the duties mentioned in Article 15 or that the amount of variable remuneration should be conditional on the fulfilment of these duties.

With this provision, the Commission aims to both oblige and incentivise company management to take into account not only short-term profits for shareholders in their decisions, but also long-term sustainability considerations.

The Commission already commissioned a study (European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, Study on directors’ duties and sustainable corporate governance: final report, Publications Office, 2020 ) on sustainable corporate governance in 2020 to examine the problem of short-term profit-seeking, which may have influenced the drafting of the Directive in this respect."
Noerr,How the EU Commission wants to hold private companies accountable to the 1.5° target of the Paris Agreement,"The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the objectives of the Paris Agreement would not be achieved under the current status of corporate practices and recommended enacting binding legal requirements.

Consequences of non-compliance with climate targets The obligation arising from Article 15 is not mentioned separately in the provisions on penalties (Article 20 of the Draft Directive) or in the provisions on civil liability (Article 22 of the Draft Directive).

The Member States should therefore have some discretion as to the extent to which they impose fines for breaches of the obligation to comply with the climate targets.

Article 22 of the Draft Directive provides for civil liability only if the company has breached its obligations from Articles 7 and 8 of the Draft Directive, and as a result, an adverse impact that should have been identified, prevented, mitigated, brought to an end or its extent minimised through the appropriate measures laid down in Articles 7 and 8, occurred and led to damage.

The due diligence obligations from Articles 7 and 8 refer to adverse human rights impacts and adverse environmental impacts in the company’s own business or that of its business partners that are to be determined by risk analysis according to Article 6 of the Draft Directive.

Article 3(b) of the Draft Directive defines these adverse environmental impacts as an adverse impact on the environment resulting from the violation of one of the prohibitions and obligations pursuant to the international environmental conventions listed in the Annex, Part II.

The Paris Agreement is not included in this Annex.

Therefore, a breach of the obligations under Article 15 of the draft Directive does not lead to civil liability, even if a corresponding damage based on the breach can be proven.

An action for damages due to a breach of climate targets, such as the one brought against Shell in the Netherlands, is therefore not possible according to the wording of the Draft Directive to date.

Summary So far, the Draft Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence contains only a few specific measures that companies must observe in order to implement the 1.5 °C target.

According to Article 15 of the Draft Directive, emission reduction objectives are to be specified if climate change has been identified as the principal risk for, or the principal impact of, the company’s operations.

The specific terms of the business plan are therefore largely up to the company.

It appears that after implementation of the Directive by the Member States a breach of Article 15 of the Draft Directive would be punishable by fines.

However, a breach of Article 15 does not give rise to civil liability under Article 22 of the Draft Directive."
Noerr,Hungary: How safe is your money in your bank account?,"As a result of three years of Covid and the current war in Europe, we are dealing with an increased level of uncertainty in all areas of life.

Three years ago, living in stable economic and financial circumstances, no one would possibly have believed a bank in Hungary or elsewhere in Europe could go bankrupt overnight.

The Lehman story seemed to be part of the distant past, and in any case it happened far away.

Fortunately, since 2014 national deposit insurance schemes all around Europe have protected depositors’ money in their bank accounts, now up to a limit of EUR 100,000.

Some of those schemes and funds are secured from the outset and are on standby to compensate depositors almost immediately.

Others raise funds from their members (banks) only if there is a situation to deal with.

Like right now.

Shortly after the winding-up of Sberbank Austria was ordered, the Hungarian National Bank (“ MNB ”) also withdrew Sberbank Hungary’s operating licence and ordered its winding-up.

This is a good real-life test of the deposit insurance schemes in each country Sberbank Group operates a subsidiary in and which is now in trouble.

National Deposit Insurance Fund, OBA In Hungary, the National Deposit Insurance Fund (“ OBA ”) protects depositors of credit institutions.

OBA’s main task is to compensate insured depositors if a bank’s operating licence is withdrawn or its winding-up is ordered.

Consequences OBA will provide automatic compensation to eligible depositors of up to EUR 100,000 per person within 10 working days.

This means people entitled to compensation do not have to separately apply for payment.

It should be stressed that the compensation payment is made on a per-person basis.

This means if a person has several accounts with Sberbank HU, e.g. a HUF account and a EUR account, the limit applies once.

All depositors are entitled to compensation.

This means OBA will make payments to both natural persons and legal persons such as companies.

Exceptions may apply, e.g. municipalities, investment funds or insurance companies, as those depositors are not covered.

In the case of self-employed persons, personal bank accounts and self-employment business bank accounts are considered to be separate deposits and are therefore subject to separate OBA compensation up to the EUR 100,000 limit.

The compensation applies to both forint and foreign exchange deposits.

In the case of a foreign exchange deposit, the amount of compensation and the limit will be determined based on the official exchange rate published by the MNB as of the day preceding the day the compensation procedure starts.

Depositors have 5 years to receive the compensation amount from OBA, starting from the day preceding the day the compensation procedure starts.

If for any reason OBA does not have the funds to meet all compensation requests, the Hungarian state, as the ultimate guarantor, will ensure funding.

European deposit insurance scheme In November 2015, the European Commission proposed setting up a common European deposit insurance scheme ("" EDIS "") for bank deposits in the euro area, in addition to the national deposit insurance schemes.

This would deepen the economic and monetary union and would reduce the vulnerability of national deposit insurance schemes to large local shocks, ensuring that the level of depositor confidence in a bank would not depend on the bank’s location and weakening the link between banks and their national sovereign states.

It is now high time to dust off this idea and pursue its completion at full speed.

Although Hungary is not yet part of the euro area, EDIS would certainly make that decision easier."
Noerr,Fifth package of EU sanctions against Russia and Belarus in the Ukraine crisis,"Upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU on 2 March 2022 ( here , here and here ), the following additional EU sanctions against Russia and individuals in Belarus entered into force.

Exclusion from SWIFT and other capital market sanctions The EU has made good on its announcement last weekend that it would be including the SWIFT system in its sanctions.

After a transition period of ten days that ends on 12 March 2022, providing specialised financial messaging services that are used for exchanging financial data will be prohibited for seven Russian banks (Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, VNESHECONOMBANK (VEB) and VTB BANK) or companies of whose proprietary rights the listed banks own directly or indirectly more than 50 % (Article 5h of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014).

With this action, the EU has ordered payment services providers, particularly Belgium-based SWIFT, not to provide their services to the abovementioned banks, which had already been subject to certain capital market sanctions.

However, the EU has refrained up to now from also freezing the assets of the banks Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Sovcombank and VTB BANK, which means that payment transactions with these banks remain possible, just not via SWIFT.

This new sanction will severely restrict payment transactions with Russia but does not make them impossible.

It is now also prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export euro banknotes to individuals or entities in Russia or for use in Russia (Article 5i of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014) or to invest in any project co-financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (Art. 2e (3) of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014).

Broadcast prohibition for Russian media The EU has also put in place a broadcast prohibition for the Russian state-owned enterprises RT and Sputnik that prohibits them from broadcasting in the EU via their subsidiaries (Article 2f of newly amended Regulation (EU) no. 833/2014).

This action is the EU’s response to Russian propaganda justifying military aggression against Ukraine.

Additional sanctions against individuals in Belarus Also on Wednesday, due to Belarus’ participation in the invasion, sanctions against high-ranking members of the Belarusian military and members of the Belarusian Defence Ministry were resolved and announced in the Official Journal.

This means that these individuals are also subject to travel and financial restrictions (expanded Annex I to newly amended Regulation (EU) no.

269/2014

and the expanded Annex to Council Decision 2014/145/CFSP).

Noerr,Russia makes money transfers abroad more difficult,"In response to the Western sanctions, Russia is making it more difficult to transfer foreign currency abroad.

While the disbursement of loans by Russian companies or natural persons (“ residents ”) to foreign borrowers (including within group structures) as well as the transfer of funds by residents to their own accounts abroad was already prohibited starting from 28 February 2022, the payment of dividends from Russian LLCs and the fulfilment of payment obligations from existing contracts for the supply of goods and services is currently (as of 1 March 2022) still permissible.

However, it is likely that transferring such payments abroad, especially in the form of dividend distributions, will also soon be prohibited or will require approval.

Foreign investors in Russia should therefore use the window of opportunity that still exists to repatriate funds from Russia, especially from their Russian subsidiaries.

While the easiest way to repatriate funds is to settle outstanding contractual liabilities (e.g. by not utilising the periods allowed for deferred payment), this is often not sufficient to repatriate liquidity in the desired amount.

This normally requires distributing dividends .

For Russian LLCs (OOOs) dividend distribution resolutions can generally be made at any time by the shareholders’ meeting of the relevant Russian subsidiary, provided that all shareholders are present.

They must, however, be made before a Russian notary public, unless this requirement has been effectively waived in the articles of association or by a prior resolution of the shareholders’ meeting.

The notary public usually requests numerous documents from the company and the shareholders in preparation for the meeting.

In addition to the notary, if one is involved, the account-holding banks of the Russian subsidiaries also require certain documents to be submitted before the dividend is paid out.

As a rule, these are, in addition to the dividend distribution resolution: certified and apostilled powers of attorney for the representatives of the shareholders at the meeting, certified and apostilled excerpts from the commercial register of the shareholders, and, if applicable, tax residency certificates.

Schedule for distributing dividends from a Russian LLC

If companies are currently considering distributing dividends, we advise them to start the necessary preparatory actions immediately.

In principle, the following schedule should be followed:

Step 1: Check whether the shareholders’ meeting of the Russian subsidiary is to be held before a Russian notary public Step 2: Clarify the required package of documents and the formal requirements to be met with regard to the individual documents with the subsidiary’s account-holding bank (which should generally not be a bank subject to sanctions from the US or EU), as well as with the Russian notary, if one has to be involved Step 3: Obtain the required documents in the prescribed form and, at the same time, examine any implications under sanctions laws Step 4: Draft and execute the dividend distribution resolution (before a Russian notary if necessary)

Step 5: Transfer the dividend"
Noerr,"EU imposes second, third and fourth sanctions packages against Russia in Ukraine crisis","The EU has ordered further sanctions in response to Russia’s ongoing large-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The new sanctions mainly focus on restricting Russia’s ability to purchase certain goods and are designed to have a sensitive impact on the flows of funds towards the Russian state, its government and certain individuals.

By taking these measures the EU is continuing and tightening the sanctions of 23 February 2022.

Sanctions affecting certain individuals and goods were imposed and Russia’s access to the capital and financial markets in the EU after Russia recognised the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Russia’s access to the capital and financial markets in the EU was restricted.

Second sanctions package of 25/26 February 2022 When Russia started its military aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the EU agreed on a second round of measures containing additional sanctions designed to put pressure on the country and its economy.

These concern the financial sector, the defence sector, the energy sector and the transport, but also affect President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov personally.

The relevant Regulations ( here and here ) came into force on 25/26 February 2022 and contain the following measures: Sanctions in the financial sector Existing financial sanctions are being tightened in order to cut Russia off from the most important capital markets.

New measures include bans on trading and services related to transferable securities and money-market instruments of credit institutions and other companies under public control and on accepting large deposits from Russian nationals or individuals and legal entities resident in Russia (Articles 5 and 5a of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014).

Goods-related sanctions The ban on exports of dual-use goods has been tightened and no longer depends on an intention to use them for military purposes (Article 2 of newly amended Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014)

.

It is also prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export goods and technology to Russia which might contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement or the development of its defence and security sector (Article 2a of newly amended Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014with new Annex VII).

Goods-related restrictions now apply to the sale, supply, transfer and export of certain goods and technology for use in oil refining as well as restrictions on services in this field (Article 3b of newly amended Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014with new Annex X).

Alongside this, now exports of goods, technology and services in the aviation and space industry are banned (Article 3c of newly amended Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014with new Annex XI).

Travel and financial sanctions The second package of sanctions also extends the list of persons subject to travel and financial sanctions .

Individuals now additionally listed include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (extended Annex I to the latest version of Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014).

Third sanctions package of 27 February 2022 Immediately after issuing the second round of sanctions, the EU Member States consulted on a third package of sanctions against Russia.

Some of these measures came into effect straight away on 28 February 2022.

In the Regulation of 28 February 2022 , the EU closed off its airspace for aircraft owned by Russian air carriers or individuals and legal entities resident in Russia (Article 3d of newly amended Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014and resolved further sanctions against the Russian central bank , notably a freeze on its international reserves (Article 5a(4) to (6) of newly amended Regulation (EU) No 833/2014).

Moreover, targeted restrictions on access by Russian banks to the international bank payment network SWIFT is on the cards; a legal act setting out the exact form of this measure is not available yet."

Fourth sanctions package of 28 February 2022 Finally, the EU Member States also just issued a fourth round of sanctions on 28 February 2022 (further information here and here ) including additional individuals, mainly oligarchs and businesspersons from the energy sector, in the sanctions list."
Noerr,EU imposes a first package of new sanctions against Russia in the Ukrainian crisis,"Background Late on 23 February 2022, and just a few hours before President Putin of Russia effectively declared war against Ukraine and launched missile attacks across the country earlier today as part of what may be but the first step in a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the European Union formally imposed additional measures and sanctions against Russia and specific individuals.

The measures which will no doubt be followed by additional ones after Russia’s most recent acts of aggression against Ukraine and related outright violations of international law, have already been published in the Official Journal of the EU and have entered into force with immediate effect.

This first set of new measures was taken after President Putin’s decision to recognise as independent entities two separatists regions in eastern Ukraine, the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, and to send Russian troops into these areas.

See our related News Alert here .

Right after Putin’s TV message on the evening of 21 February 2022, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the European Council (“Council”), Charles Michel, released a statement condemning in the strongest possible terms the decision by the Russian President as a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine as well as of the Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015 (a series of international agreements concluded to end the war in Ukraine’s Donbas region).

Few hours before Putin’s TV message on 21 February, the Council imposed restrictive measures on additional five individuals (members of the Russian State Duma elected in September 2021 to represent the Crimean peninsula and the City of Sevastopol together with the head and deputy head of the Sevastopol electoral commission) for actively supporting actions and policies undermining or threatening the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (see Council Implementing Regulation 2022/236 and Council Decision 2022/241 ).

The new measures just adopted by the EU

The adopted package of new EU sanctions against Russia targets (i) those who were involved in Russia’s decision to formally recognise the two Ukrainian regions Donetsk and Luhansk as independent; (ii) the banks that are financing Russia’s military and other activities in those territories; (iii) the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU’s capital and financial markets and services; and (iv) annuls any benefits that the Donetsk and Luhansk regions would otherwise enjoy as integral parts of Ukraine in their trading relationships with the EU.

Specifically, the EU has adopted several Regulations imposing the following new measures: Restrictive measures (asset freeze, prohibition from making funds available to them and travel ban) for all the members of the Russian State Duma (351 members), who voted on 15 February in favour of the recognition of the independence of the self-proclaimed republics; Restrictive measures for 27 high profile individuals and entities (including banks and businesspeople) for their role in undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine; An import ban on goods from the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts; restrictions on trade and investments related to certain economic sectors; A prohibition to supply tourism services; An export ban for certain goods and technologies; A sectoral prohibition to finance the Russian Federation, its government and Central Bank.

What companies need to know and need to do now Ensure a clear distribution of competencies and coordination in the company The person responsible for exports in the company should coordinate the further procedure centrally as the competent member of the management board.

It should be ensured that all potentially affected company departments act in a coordinated and consistent manner.

Depending on the internal company structure and the nature and depth of your business relationships with Russia / Ukraine, the new sanctions could be directly or indirectly relevant for the purchasing, sales, export control, contract management, general compliance and legal departments.

The clearer the coordination and distribution of tasks when dealing with the challenges arising from the new Russia sanctions, the easier it should be to keep the risk of sanctions violations as low as possible.

Conduct a detailed screening of all business contacts in the light of the new sanctions regulation As detailed above, the new EU sanctions contain lists of people, companies and institutions, including financial institutions, with whom any transactions and business dealings are prohibited until further notice.

It is every individual company’s responsibility to verify immediately whether any of the listed individuals or entities are part of its business relationships.

Ideally, all business contacts from all relevant companies departments should be subject to an immediate screening.

It is best to use up-to-date and powerful screening software for this purpose.

Seek professional advice for any instances which are not clear beyond any doubt.

In this context, it must not be overlooked that indirect transactions with sanctioned companies or individuals are generally also prohibited.

Companies must therefore also clarify whether a given business partner is, for example, a group company of a listed parent company or is controlled by a listed natural person.

Stop any relevant exports, payments and pending contract negotiations If, based on a thorough screening, you cannot rule out with certainty that your Russia/Ukraine business will be affected by the new sanctions, you should temporarily stop export processes, payments and sign no new contracts, purchase orders or order confirmations.

Seek professional advice to fully assess the impact of sanctions on your business.

Keep in mind that violations of sanctions regimes can amount to criminal or administrative offenses.

Both companies and company personnel involved, from management to the export control department, can be subject to severe penalties in the event of violations.

Some companies may have protected themselves against the situation at hand by means of far-reaching sanction clauses in their commercial contracts.

Often, these clauses provide the right to immediately sever contractual ties if doing business would violate the new sanctions regime.

Companies are well-advised, however, to seek legal advice before actually invoking the relevant clauses, which in certain scenarios may be questionable as regards legal validity and enforceability.

In case the relevant contracts do not contain sanctions clauses, our recommendation is that companies seek legal advice early on how to defend themselves against potential threats of claims for damages from their business partners and to gain an informed understanding of what the actual risks are.

Final remarks For obvious reasons, the political and legal situation around the Ukraine crisis is currently extremely dynamic."

Noerr,EU Commission presents proposal for European supply chain directive,"Yesterday, the Commission presented a proposal announced long ago for a Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence that provides for expanded due diligence duties for companies in regard to supply chains.

Current applicable German law In June 2021, the German legislator passed the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – Supply Chain Act), which will enter into force on 1 January 2023 (see also New German Law on Duty of Care in Supply Chain Organization enters into force on 1 January 2023 ).

The Supply Chain Act initially applies to all industry sectors and to companies with 3,000 or more employees.

As of 1 January 2024, it will also apply to companies with 1,000 or more employees.

The prerequisite is that the company’s administrative centre, head office, headquarters, place of effective management, economic domicile or statutory registered office is located in Germany.

The Supply Chain Act also applies to branch offices of foreign companies that have reached or surpassed the abovementioned employee numbers.

Such companies are subject to due diligence duties to respect human rights and environment in global value chains.

Section 3(1) Supply Chain Act provides for a list of due diligence duties, which include establishing a risk management system, conducting regular risk assessments, submitting a policy statement on the company’s human rights strategy, taking preventive and mitigating steps and establishing a complaints procedure.

These due diligence duties apply primarily to the company’s own business operations and with respect to direct suppliers.

Failure to comply with these due diligence duties is punishable by considerable fines.

However, the Supply Chain Act does not provide for any civil law liability.

Proposal for a Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence At EU level, companies are already subject to sectoral due diligence duties in regard to their suppliers as relates to conflict minerals and the lumber industry.

For years, the Commission and the European Parliament have also been working towards passing a cross-sectoral supply chain law in the form of a directive that creates a level playing field for EU companies.

The intent is to prevent non-uniform competition conditions arising from differing national supply chain laws.

In addition to Germany, France has also passed a supply chain law; other countries are also planning their own laws.

In March 2021, the European Parliament passed an initiative resolution that sent requests and recommendations to the Commission regarding a corresponding proposal for a directive.

This proposal contained much that corresponded to the approach taken in the Supply Chain Act but also went beyond it to a large extent.

In particular, even small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were to be subject to the directive.

With this resolution, the European Parliament called upon the Commission to draw up a draft law.

In a formal sense, only the Commission has this right to make proposals.

However, the Commission’s draft was slow in coming and was postponed more than once.

The reasons for the delay included the ambitious plans of the EU Commissioner of Justice at the time, Didier Reynders, which encountered resistance from business.

The Commission has now presented an extensive proposal with more than 70 recitals and 32 articles.

Scope of applicability The proposal for an EU directive presented yesterday provides for a broader scope of applicability than that of the Supply Chain Act.

Specifically, all EU companies that have at least 500 employees and €150 million+ in net turnover worldwide (Group 1) are to be subject to the directive.

The new provisions are also to apply to other companies with more than 250 employees and a net turnover of €40 million worldwide and more that achieve at least 50% of their net turnover in defined high impact sectors (Group 2).

Such sectors include agriculture, textiles and minerals."
Noerr,EU Commission presents proposal for European supply chain directive,"Such sectors include agriculture, textiles and minerals.

The provisions do not apply to this second group of companies until two years after they enter into force for Group 1.

In addition, non-EU companies active in the EU with a turnover threshold aligned with Groups 1 and 2 generated in the EU are likewise to be subject to the directive.

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees are not directly affected by the direct area of applicability of the proposed directive.

The Commission estimates that around 13,000 companies in the EU and around 4,000 non-EU companies will be covered by the directive’s scope of applicability.

More due diligence duties The scope of the proposed directive is also to be broadened in that it is to apply not only to companies' own operations, but also to their subsidiaries and their entire value chains , i.e. their direct and indirect established business relationships .

Until now, the Supply Chain Act has in principle only provided for due diligence duties in a company’s own business operations and in relation to direct suppliers.

The proposal provides for companies’ due diligence duties to identify, prevent, end or mitigate adverse impacts of their activities on human rights and on the environment and be accountable for them.

As is the case with the Supply Chain Act, the specific measures to implement this due diligence duty are derived from the OECD “Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct” and correspond to a large extent to the list of measures in the Supply Chain Act.

Like the Supply Chain Act, the directive also provides for an annual review of their risk assessment and other measures.

Companies are also required to report on the matters covered by the directive and publish an annual statement on their websites.

Companies in Group 1 are also required to have a plan to ensure that their business model and strategy are compatible with the limiting of global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement.

The company’s management is to be responsible for compliance with the due diligence duties.

Bonus payments can also be made contingent on compliance with these duties.

Civil law liability planned Breaches of the due diligence duties in the supply chain are to possibly entail not only fines but also civil law liability .

Individuals who are injured by the business operations of a company are to receive the option of bringing an action for damages against a company before a Member State’s competent courts.

This civil law liability presupposes that the damage could have been identified and prevented or mitigated by means of suitable due diligence preventive measures.

However, in the relationship to indirect business associates, the company has the option of complying with its due diligence duties in the form of contractual assurances from a direct partner with whom they have an established business relationship that it will ensure compliance with the company’s code of conduct or prevention action plan.

Import prohibition planned in separate legal act The directive proposal does not include any mechanism to prohibit the import of products manufactured using forced labour.

However, in its “ Communication on decent work worldwide ” (COM(2022) 66 final) issued today, the Commission stated that it is preparing a new legislative initiative which will effectively prohibit the placing on the EU market of products made by forced labour.

The initiative will cover both domestic and imported products.

The new instrument will build on international standards and is to complement the Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence and existing horizontal and sectoral EU initiatives.

Such import prohibitions already exist in the USA and Canada.

Outlook The Commission’s proposal marks the first step in the EU legislative process.

The next step is its discussion in the European Parliament, which can be expected to become a controversial debate."
Noerr,EU Commission presents proposal for European supply chain directive,"The next step is its discussion in the European Parliament, which can be expected to become a controversial debate.

On the one hand, the Commission’s proposal falls short of the Parliament’s proposal from March 2021 in scope of applicability and due diligence duties.

Nevertheless, resistance against the planned expansion of these two aspects has arisen in business, especially from medium enterprises.

For this reason, it is to be expected that changes will be made in the course of the legislative process.

The approval of Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers is required to pass the directive.

Thus, a final decision regarding the European Supply Chain Directive is not to be expected before 2023 or 2024.

Because this is an EU directive that has no direct effect, the German legislator will have to transpose the requirements into the Supply Chain Act within an implementation period once the directive has been passed.

The directive proposal provides for an implementation period of two years .

However, until that occurs, the current provisions of the Supply Chain Act continue in effect."
Noerr,Ordinance for autonomous vehicles: completion of a national legal framework in sight,"On 23 February 2022, the German Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport (BMDV) launched the Ordinance on the Approval and Operation of Motor Vehicles with Autonomous Driving Functions in Specified Operating Areas (Autonomous Vehicles Approval and Operation Ordinance ( Autonome Fahrzeuge Genehmigungs- und Betriebs-Verordnung ), the “Ordinance”).

The Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs introduced the Ordinance in the wake of the 2021 amendments to the German Road Traffic Act ( Straßenverkehrsgesetz, StVG ), aiming primarily to complete the legal framework for motor vehicles with autonomous driving features in defined operating areas laid down in section 1d onwards of the Road Traffic Act.

The new rules are no longer intended just to enable autonomous driving features to be tested on the basis of technical exemptions; instead, they to allow them to be operated on a regular basis in defined operating areas.

Regulatory content relevant in practice The contents of the Ordinance are likely to be especially interesting to manufacturers and future providers of self-driving vehicles in defined operating areas, since the Ordinance addresses points that are particularly relevant in practice: approval and registration of autonomous vehicles in defined operating areas; detailed specifications on the (national) technical requirements for vehicles with autonomous driving functions in Germany and definitions of test and validation methods for checking compliance with the technical requirements during the approval procedure; structuring of the requirements for manufacturers, holders and technical supervisors already laid down in the amendments to the Road Traffic Act in 2021.

Approval of autonomous vehicles First of all, the manufacturer has to obtain a type approval for the autonomous vehicle, which must be applied for at the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), as set down in section 1e para. 

4 of the Road Traffic Act.

The requirements for this are now detailed in section 3 of the Ordinance.

In particular, section 3 para. 

2 of the Ordinance provides manufacturers with a list of rules for the national approval procedure regarding which declarations have to be made and which documents must be submitted to the Motor Transport Authority.

The scope of the Authority’s examinations is also defined in section 3 of the Ordinance.

Its subsection 4 states that the technical requirements of Annex I to the Ordinance must be complied with, among other things.

In this Annex I, the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs has drawn up a detailed list of requirements for motor vehicles with autonomous driving functions.

This completes the paradigm shift initiated by the 2021 amendments to the Road Traffic Act, according to which autonomous driving functions are to be based on national technical regulations and not international ones.

The introduction of highly or fully automated driving functions within the meaning of section 1a of the Road Traffic Act was subject to considerable delays because the international technical regulations, namely the UNECE regulations (which are referenced in the European harmonised approval procedure), could not be adapted quickly enough.

This meant that during the evaluation carried out in accordance with section 1c of the Road Traffic Act it was still stated in April 2021: “At present, no motor vehicles with automated driving functions in accordance with section 1a of the Road Traffic Act have been registered in Germany.”

(Bundestag document 19/28800, p. 3).

As a result, the intention of enabling highly or fully automated vehicles to be used in public road traffic in the near future pursued in the 2017 amendments to the of the Road Traffic Act missed the mark.

Due also to the lack of regulations at an international level, the technical requirements for autonomous driving functions in Germany have now been issued nationally in the form of an ordinance."
Noerr,Ordinance for autonomous vehicles: completion of a national legal framework in sight,"Due also to the lack of regulations at an international level, the technical requirements for autonomous driving functions in Germany have now been issued nationally in the form of an ordinance.

After decades of harmonisation of the approval procedure at the European level and standardisation of the technical regulations at the international level, this can be seen as a paradigm shift in the motor vehicle sector, at least with regard to self-driving vehicles used in defined operating areas.

This unique situation will be unfamiliar especially for OEMs outside Germany as soon as they start dealing with approvals for autonomous vehicles in Germany.

Approval of defined operating areas At the second stage, the operating range in which the autonomous vehicle may be used has to be approved.

The Ordinance also contains rules defining the requirements and procedure for this.

According to section 7 para. 1 of the Ordinance, the operating range is determined by the owner of the autonomous vehicle, the requirements for the application being detailed in section 8 of the Ordinance.

The decisive factor for approval by the competent authority is whether the operating range is suitable for operation of the specific vehicle (section 9 para. 

1 No. 2 in conjunction with para. 

2 of the Ordinance).

If both the type approval and the approval for the defined operating area have been obtained and appropriate motor vehicle liability insurance has been taken out, the autonomous vehicle can be registered.

Further details on the applicability of the Vehicle Registration Ordinance (FZV) are set out in section 11 of the Ordinance.

Details of requirements for manufacturers, holders and technical supervisors Both the manufacturer (section 12 of the Ordinance) and the holder (section 13 of the Ordinance) are subject to more extensive obligations.

Particular attention must be paid to the specific requirements for technical supervision (section 1d para. 

3 of the Road Traffic Act).

In this regard, the question has already been raised several times whether any requirements are placed on the qualifications of technical supervisors and what these are.

Section 14 of the Ordinance makes clear that the person appointed as a technical supervisor must be suitable for the tasks involved.

Suitability is determined on the basis of high requirements regarding qualifications, which has already attracted considerable criticism in advance.

Alongside other requirements, the person must have a technical degree or be a state-certified technician.

This makes running commercial operations involving autonomous systems considerably more difficult and certainly does not promote the new digital mobility services to the extent actually desired.

Outlook

The Ordinance now expands on key requirements that were deliberately left out of the amendments to the Road Traffic Act introduced in 2021.

In view of this, it does actually look like manufacturers and providers of mobility solutions may be able to use autonomous vehicles in defined operating areas in the near future.

Yet this will probably still not go beyond vehicle testing in traffic, one of the reasons being the high requirements in section 14 Ordinance.

At the time of the evaluation planned for the end of 2023 (section 1l of the Road Traffic Act) at the latest, it will have to be determined whether the existing rules in the Road Traffic Act harmonise with the more detailed requirements now provided in the Ordinance and offer a watertight legal basis at national level for operating autonomous vehicles (on a commercial basis) in defined operating areas on a regular basis."
Noerr,EU und US will impose severe Sanctions targeting Russia – German and EU based enterprises need to prepare immediately,"In the light of the political crisis related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the European Union and the United States will impose severe sanctions targeting Russia, its economy, in particular main Russian (state-owned) enterprises and high-ranking Russian individuals.

Against this background, every company engaged in Russia (be it only by selling goods or services to Russian customers)  may be forced in the near future to take immediate critical business decisions to ensure sanctions compliance.

In order to prepare for these and to identify potential risks as well as risk mitigation strategies, we have below listed some of the main issues that may cause problems for enterprises based in the European Union or Germany once sanctions are imposed: EU sanctions Any transactions such as payments, the supply of goods, works, or services with an EU nexus to Russian entities/individuals that are being sanctioned (either directly sanctioned or affiliates of such entities/individuals (collectively “ Sanctioned Russian Persons ”)) may be prohibited; the continuation of long term agreements (e.g. licence agreements leasing/lease agreements) with Sanctioned Russian Persons may be prohibited; financial transactions with Sanctioned Russian Persons, including merely using the services of banks designated as Sanctioned Russian Persons, may be prohibited; supplying to Russia, potentially also Russian-owned companies within the EU, certain items subject to an embargo list (“ Embargoed Items ”) in the emerging technologies area and beyond may be prohibited; German/EU-based enterprises will likely need to ensure that their Russian subsidiaries (“ Subsidiary ”) observe any prohibitions mentioned in the bullets above as well; any EU individual working in a management position at a Russian entity (e.g. in a Subsidiary) must refrain from any actions that would result in a breach of any prohibition mentioned in the first four bullets above.

US sanctions The US and the EU are currently aligning their sanctions policies, however, it is possible that US sanctions will exceed EU sanctions or have a somewhat different scope.

Even though US Sanctions– as the ones President Biden imposed last night on the Donetsk (“DNR”) and Luhansk (“LNR”) regions of Ukraine – do generally not apply directly to Germany or EU-based enterprises, it is likely that the US will also impose secondary sanctions.

As a consequence, from a US perspective the relevant US sanction will apply to companies worldwide, irrespective of whether a potential US nexus exists or not.

Thus, European companies are well advised to carry out a risk assessment also with regard to US sanctions.

Sanctions compliance and its conflict with contractual obligations / Sanctions risk profile determination Since compliance with sanctions may conflict with the contractual obligations to be fulfilled towards Sanctioned Russian Persons and since Russian courts generally do not recognise foreign sanctions as contractual rights or force majeure circumstances suspending the need to perform contractual obligations, it is strongly advisable for each company engaged in Russia – be it only by selling goods or services to Russian customers – to analyse and determine its sanction risks."
Noerr,EU und US will impose severe Sanctions targeting Russia – German and EU based enterprises need to prepare immediately,"In a first step, the following measures should be taken : Review customer/contractual partner and product base for potential sanctions applicability in particular for Sanctioned Russian Persons and Embargoed Items Analysis of corporate set-up, e.g.: Holding of shares in Russian Subsidiaries that may have contractual partners who are Sanctioned Russian Persons Non-Russian persons seconded/appointed to management boards or senior management positions in Russian legal entities Analysis of contractual status quo, e.g.: Direct contracts and indirect business relationships with Sanctioned Russian Persons and outstanding obligations thereunder Suspension or termination rights under such agreements, force majeure provisions, applicable law and dispute resolution clauses, limitation of liability, etc.

Outstanding (in particular due to be performed) short term and long term obligations Contracts relating to Embargoed Items Possibilities to substitute the relevant agreements with agreements with non Sanctioned Russian or non-Russian Persons Analysis of litigation and arbitration risks Our team, combining our high-end and highly regarded Export Control and Russian Law practices (lead by Bärbel Sachs and Björn Paulsen) is ready to support you in the analysis and determination of your sanctions risks and in particular in putting suitable and appropriate risk mitigation measures (short term, mid term, long term) in place."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: New guidelines on the right of access,"New guidelines from the European Data Protection Board on the right of access require companies to review internal processes and documentation on data protection in order to avoid fines and claims for damages due to insufficient access.

Strict requirements for the provision of access The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has recently published new guidelines on the right of access under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for public consultation.

In their new guidelines, the supervisory authorities formulate strict requirements for the provision of access under data protection law.

Above all, the guidelines reaffirm the strict line already taken by the majority of supervisory authorities, which requires companies to provide a copy of all personal data, even if this entails an enormous effort for the company concerned.

Selective and individually justified restrictions on such a copy are admissible only in exceptional cases.

In addition to names, addresses and contact details, the right of access covers a wide range of other data, such as medical findings, purchase histories, credit scores or activity logs.

Copies of data that are not comprehensible in themselves (such as code or “raw data”) also have to be explained to the person requesting access in a comprehensible manner.

In order to be in a position to properly provide information without delay and usually within one month at the latest, companies must proactively prepare for requests for information and, if necessary, create appropriate internal processes, according to the EDPB.

Private enforcement – Claims for damages by data subjects Breaches of the duty to provide access are subject to official measures and severe fines.

For example, according to its Activity Report for 2020 (available in German only), the Hesse Data Protection Authority has punished breaches of these duties with fines in the mid five-digit range.

The strict requirements of the supervisory authorities are also likely to further encourage the current trends in private enforcement in data protection law .

Due to the strict official requirements for the provision of access, it seems likely companies will be confronted with more and more claims for damages for breaches of the duty to provide access, including mass proceedings .

Recent court decisions indicate that Germany is increasingly becoming a claimant-friendly jurisdiction when it comes to alleged data protection breaches.

For example, Hamm Regional Labour Court ( Landesarbeitsgericht ) recently awarded non-material damages of €1,000 for breaches of the duty to provide access.

Dusseldorf Labour Court ( Arbeitsgericht ) even awarded non-material damages of €5,000 for late provision of access.

This trend is likely to encourage more and more people to also file claims for damages for breaches of the duty to provide access.

Reviewing internal processes and documentation on data protection in the company In light of the new EDPB guidelines, we recommend that businesses carefully review and, if necessary, adapt their internal processes and documentation for data protection.

In particular, in order to be prepared for access requests, companies are advised to check their guidelines for handling data protection requests and templates for providing access.

The EDPB is currently seeking feedback on its new guidelines in the public consultation process until 11 March 2022.

Whilst it cannot be ruled out that based on the feedback received the EDPB might still make certain changes to its guidelines, experience shows that such changes are likely to be mere clarifications rather than fundamental modifications.

We therefore recommend that companies already now observe the requirements formulated by the EDPB, especially since the published version of the guidelines reflects the joint position of the European supervisory authorities."
Noerr,European Data Protection Board: New guidelines on the right of access,"Data protection litigation Current developments also make it increasingly important for companies to deal with the challenges, opportunities and risks of data protection litigation at an early stage and in a strategic manner.

Data protection law represents both the focus and the crucial link to other areas of law, in particular the relevant procedural and litigation laws.

Seamless coordination of data protection and litigation expertise is essential when it comes to defending against mass actions under civil law.

Noerr,Hungary: New rules on shareholder contributions,"In the course of their day-to-day business, companies may experience capital shortfalls, forcing them to implement certain replenishment measures to protect the interests of their businesses and their creditors.

If it becomes clear to a company’s management that (i) the company is on the brink of insolvency, (ii) the company has stopped making payments, or (iii) its assets do not cover its debt, immediate actions are needed to avoid insolvency or even total bankruptcy.

In such event, it is crucial for the management to inform the shareholders immediately and to take steps to convene the main decision-making body of the company in order to initiate crisis management by identifying and examining possible solutions.

One of the major capital replenishment options used by Hungarian companies is additional contributions to the company (in Hungarian “ pótbefizetés ”) by the company’s shareholders.

Before the most recent amendment of the Hungarian Civil Code, additional payments were admissible only for limited liability companies, and it was only admissible to initiate them if the company’s articles of association included the option of such payments (and rules regarding such payments and their amount, frequency, schedule and re-payment).

According to the new rules of the Hungarian Civil Code effective from 1 January 2022, all companies (irrespective of legal form) except public companies limited by shares can receive additional payments from their shareholders.

An important change is that under the new rules, companies are not obliged to repay any residual amount of such payment not used to cover losses, but this requires a decision by the main decision-making body.

In case of limited liability companies and private companies limited by shares, additional payments for the shareholders’ own business quotas/shares do not have to be repaid.

In addition to the foregoing, for single-member limited liability companies and single-member private limited companies, such additional payments can be made even in the absence of detailed provisions in their constitutional documents.

The conditions for such additional payments may be established by the founder/sole member in a resolution."

Noerr,Romania: Anonymous whistleblowers?,"Following our opening article on the General Guidelines for protecting Whistleblowers , we are pleased to continue our whistleblowing compliance mini-series with yet another interesting topic: anonymous whistleblowers.

Do anonymous whistleblowers benefit from the same protection?

Should anonymous whistleblowing reports be investigated further?

Should anonymous whistleblowing reports be regulated as an option, and if so, what would be the consequences?

While trying to address these sensitive questions, we would like to start by mentioning that such are in fact triggered by the second whistleblowing draft law submitted by the Romanian legislator in December 2021.

The first Romanian whistleblowing draft law appeared to consider named whistleblowing reports only.

Nevertheless, this rather political option is based on the European Whistleblowing Directive (hereinafter “ EU Directive ”), which stipulates in its preamble that Member States are to decide whether legal entities in the private and public sectors and competent authorities are required to accept and follow up on anonymous reports of breaches which fall within the scope of the Directive.

However, before delving into more details, let’s start with the basics: Anonymous whistleblowers and anonymous whistleblowing reports Within the meaning of the Directive, anonymous whistleblowers are people who file a whistleblowing report, either internally or externally, or publicly disclose information about a breach, acquired in a work-related context, without providing their name.

According to the Directive, anonymous whistleblowers, should they be identified and suffer retaliation, will benefit from the same protection as known whistleblowers.

However, this protection does not necessarily entail an obligation to register and follow up on an anonymous whistleblowing report; such matters are left up to each Member State by the Directive.

In other words, the protection granted by the Directive covers everyone filing a whistleblowing report, regardless of whether they provide their name or not.

However, the specific obligations for entities that receive anonymous reports are to be specified by each Member State at its discretion.

Anonymous reports and whistleblowers in Romania Comparing the first and the second whistleblowing draft law submitted by the Romanian legislator, it is clear that Romania has had a change of heart with regard to this sensitive topic.

While both draft laws ensured that protection was to be granted to all whistleblowers (as set forth by the EU Directive), it was only the second one that left a door open for proper registration and investigation of anonymous whistleblowing reports.

The second whistleblowing draft law first mentions anonymous whistleblowing reports in Art. 2(2), which states that the law also applies to persons filing a report (internally or externally), including an anonymous report, or publicly divulging information on breaches, acquired during the recruitment process or during other preliminary negotiations, or for which the employment or working agreement has ended.

Another (clearer) provision is contained in Art.

6(2), which states that reports that do not include the whistleblower’s name, contact details or signature are to be examined and resolved in the same manner as reports that do provide those details.

Therefore, the logical conclusion is that anonymous whistleblowing reports must be registered and investigated just like any other reports.

Omitted information about a whistleblower’s name or contact details does not entitle a company to close the report.

Moreover, the second draft law sets out another option for whistleblowers who do not wish to disclose their names: counsel representation.

According to Art."
Noerr,Romania: Anonymous whistleblowers?,"Moreover, the second draft law sets out another option for whistleblowers who do not wish to disclose their names: counsel representation.

According to Art.

6(3), whistleblowing reports can be filed by a whistleblower’s lawyer, without the latter being obligated to state the whistleblower’s name, provided that the legal representation agreement concluded in this regard explicitly contains a corresponding provision.

And now, let’s take a closer look at the main consequences and explanations for the above: Regulations on mandatory registration and follow-up of anonymous reports are and should be a decision for each Member State, bearing in mind that the legal protection granted for anonymous reports clearly increases the chances of discovering compliance breaches early on; In fact, several statistics compiled and surveys conducted indicate that more than 50% of the whistleblowing reports filed through the internal reporting channels of a company are anonymous.

From a psychological perspective, it seems that anonymous reports put a greater focus on the issues themselves and the commitment of the company to fixing them, and not on the person who highlights the issues; As with any other right or legal option granted, potentially greater protection may be accompanied by a potential abuse of rights; The effectiveness of some whistleblowing reports is unclear if the whistleblower, for example, uses a one-time only email address that is deleted shortly afterwards; It is yet to be established how a private company can verify whether the report meets the admissibility criteria set forth by the law, i.e. if the whistleblower falls within one of the categories regulated by Art. 2 of the second Whistleblowing Bill (personal scope).While the above considerations highlight some issues that will only be raised once the Whistleblowing Draft Law is passed in Romania, we consider it worthwhile to brainstorm beforehand on the challenges the private sector will face."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"The format of a virtual annual general meeting is to be permanently established as an equivalent alternative to an in-person annual general meeting for German stock corporations  ( Aktiengesellschaften ), partnerships limited by shares ( Kommanditgesellschaften auf Aktien ) and European stock corporations ( Societas Europaea, SE).

On 9 February 2022, the Federal Ministry of Justice published a ministerial draft on the introduction of virtual general meetings for stock corporations .

Below we give you an overview of the key provisions of the draft and provide you with an initial assessment for practice.

Goals of the legislation At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the legislator, by necessity, for the first time offered the option of holding general meetings as purely virtual meetings, without the physical presence of shareholders at the meeting, via section 1(2) of the Act on Measures in Company, Cooperative, Association, Foundation and Housing Law to Combat the Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic dated 27 March 2020 (Federal Law Gazette vol.

I, pp.

569 and 570; last amended by Art.

15 of the Act of 10 September 2021 (Federal Law Gazette vol.

I, p. 4147)) (“ Covid-19 Act ”) .

However, this pandemic-related special rule, which has restricted the exercise of certain shareholder rights in comparison to the in-person or hybrid meeting previously stipulated in the German Stock Corporation Act, will therefore expire at the end of 31 August 2022.

See Corona crisis as a legal challenge for the General Meeting 2020-2022 .

Based on the largely positive practical experience during the Covid-19 pandemic, the virtual general meeting is now to be established as a permanent format, alongside in-person and hybrid meetings: The level of shareholders’ rights at a virtual general meeting is intended to be comparable to that of a general meeting in person.

In the virtual general meeting, it will therefore be possible to pass resolutions on all matters that can be the subject of an in-person general meeting, especially on important structural and corporate actions as well as measures under the German Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ).

The exercise of shareholder rights is to be moved to the period before the general meeting fully for some rights, and at least partially for other rights, since the informational and decision-making processes, including the casting of votes, increasingly take place before the general meeting, especially as far as institutional investors are concerned.

The aim is to make general meetings more appealing to (institutional) investors who cannot attend in person.

As a result, the procedure of the general meeting itself is to be streamlined .

The possible risks of digitalisation for companies are to be taken into account through changes to the right to challenge .

However, direct (and technically particularly vulnerable) two-way communication is only envisaged for shareholders’ speeches (not questions).

The new regulations apply to both listed and non-listed stock corporations.

Overview and comparison of refinements Virtual general meeting pursuant to section 1(2) Covid-19 Act Virtual general meeting pursuant to draft section 118a German Stock Corporation Act Decision-making authority Discretionary decision of the management board with the approval of the supervisory board Annual general meeting:

Provision or authorisation in the articles of association in favour of the management board for 5 years max.

Transitional provision for general meetings until 31/8/2023: Management board with the approval of the supervisory board Physical presence at meeting Mandatory: management board, chairperson of the meeting, notary Supervisory board on site or via audio and video calls Optional: Company proxy Auditor (when annual financial statements are adopted by the general meeting)"
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"Electronic participation of shareholders Not mandatory Exercise of voting rights By electronic communication: electronic participation or electronic postal voting Granting of proxy Countermotions and election proposals Countermotions and election proposals (which are to be made available) made before the general meeting will be deemed to have been made “at” the general meeting.

No right to propose motions during the general meeting without electronic participation Countermotions and election proposals are deemed to have been made from the time they are made accessible It must be possible to vote on the proposal from the time it is made accessible There is no right in principle to propose a motion at the general meeting, but the company may allow this in the invitation Requests for additions to the agenda In the absence of an express provision, such requests are treated analogously to the right to make countermotions in practice No express provision so far Possibly, fiction effect of published requests for additions (analogous to the right to make countermotions)

Procedural motions (“motions which are not countermotions”)

No right to propose motions during the general meeting without electronic participation Right to propose motions during the general meeting obligatory, even if no general electronic participation right is granted Right to information Questions to be submitted at the latest one day before the general meeting No right of enquiry No obligation to publish shareholder questions Questions to be submitted no later than four days before the general meeting Right of enquiry in the case of factual connection Obligation to publish shareholder questions in advance Report of the management board (Pre-)publication is voluntary Advance publication of the report or its main content is mandatory at least six days before the general meeting Shareholder statements and speaking rights Only on a voluntary basis Comments may be submitted by means of electronic communication Opportunity to speak at general meeting in the form of two-way direct connection and with prior registration four days before the general meeting List of participants Participants in the general meeting; in the case of a concealed proxy, only the company proxy Not: Shareholders watching audio and video transmission of the general meeting and (electronic) postal voters Participants in the general meeting All connected shareholders and shareholder representatives Right to object By electronic communication (shareholder portal, email) Further requirement: Exercise of the voting right By electronic communication (shareholder portal, email) Exercise of voting rights no longer a requirement Provision required in the articles of association (opt-in)

In future, the decision to hold a virtual annual general meeting will be placed in the hands of the shareholders.

This clarifies that by law the in-person meeting remains the basic form of the general meeting and that the virtual general meeting represents another option, in addition to the hybrid form.

In future, the purely virtual format will only be available to the company if it is expressly stipulated in its articles of association.

An exception exists only for general meetings convened up to and including 31 August 2023 .

During this transitional period, the management board may, with the consent of the supervisory board, once again decide based on the new legal requirements to hold the general meeting as a virtual meeting without this being stipulated in the articles of association.

This means that most companies still have time to pass the necessary amendment to the articles of association at their general meeting in 2023 without having to revert to an in-person meeting after the special regulation due to the pandemic has been abolished."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"The situation may be different for companies that plan to hold an (extraordinary) general meeting this year after 31 August 2022 if the new law has not yet entered into force by that time.

There are two ways of stipulating a virtual general meeting in the articles of association : Either the articles of association directly state that the meeting will in any case be held as a virtual general meeting, or they authorise the management board to make the decision in individual cases (draft section 118(1) s. 1 German Stock Corporation Act).

In both cases, the corresponding provision or authorisation in the articles of association must be limited to a maximum of five years and then renewed at the latest (draft section 118a(3) to (5) German Stock Corporation Act).

If it turns out in the further legislative process that such resolution to amend the articles of association continues to be subject to contestation, then companies will have to consider not putting a renewal on the agenda until the last year of the authorisation period as a precautionary measure.

Key requirements of the virtual general meeting Shareholders’ rights must be guaranteed at a virtual general meeting as follows (draft section 118a(1) s. 2 no. 1 to no.

8 German Stock Corporation Act): Video and audio transmission of the entire meeting: Shareholders must be able to follow the meeting in its entirety; the use of live streaming via the website or a shareholder portal or video conferencing services is permissible.

Exercise of voting rights by electronic communication (electronic participation or electronic postal voting) as well as granting of proxy: Written postal voting can also be made possible, but will probably be the exception in future given the advance of digitalisation and the associated additional costs.

Restricted submission of motions at the meeting : Shareholders must (only) be able to submit “motions that are not countermotions pursuant to section 126 German Stock Corporation Act” by way of electronic communication at the virtual general meeting.

However, shareholders do not necessarily have to be connected live via video communication to submit motions.

A text box in the shareholder portal or an email to the company can also serve this purpose.

This mainly concerns procedural motions, such as motions for the removal of the chairperson of the meeting or motions on agenda items.

Motions for the removal or postponement of an agenda item are mostly classified as countermotions and are therefore not covered.

It is unclear whether motions for the appointment of a special auditor must also be possible in the meeting or whether they can only be made in advance, like countermotions.

This should be clarified in the further legislative process (see also “Bringing forward countermotions and election proposals” below).

Granting a right to information pursuant to section 131 German Stock Corporation Act by electronic communication .

Pre-publication of the management board’s report or its main content no later than seven days before the meeting .

The management board’s report means the management board’s speech, containing in particular an explanation of the proposals pursuant to section 176(1) s. 2 German Stock Corporation Act.

In the case of listed companies, the report must be made available on the company’s website.

While the advance publication of the management board’s speech is already best practice for many listed companies, this provision will change previous practice at smaller non-listed companies.

Shareholders will be given the right to submit comments by electronic communication before the annual general meeting , which will then be made available to all other shareholders.

Shareholders must be given an opportunity to speak at the meeting by means of video communication.

It is possible to object to a resolution of the general meeting by means of electronic communication during the general meeting."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"It is possible to object to a resolution of the general meeting by means of electronic communication during the general meeting.

As for the technical implementation, the provision of a text box or an “objection button” in the shareholder portal or a special email address is recommended according to customary practice.

Presence at the location and electronic participation Even at the virtual general meeting, the shareholders must in principle be able to see the members of the management on a podium.

Both the members of the management board and the members of the supervisory board will therefore be obliged to physically attend the meeting (draft section 118(2) German Stock Corporation Act).

The same applies to the meeting chairperson and the notary (draft section 130(1a) German Stock Corporation Act).

The auditor must also physically attend the meeting, but only if the general meeting has to decide on the adoption of the annual financial statements or the approval of the consolidated financial statements, i.e. as a rule only for German partnerships limited by shares [KGaA] (section 286(1) s. 1 German Stock Corporation Act).

For the members of the supervisory board , however, the articles of association may provide for certain cases in the virtual general meeting in which they may participate by video and audio transmission (section 118(3) s. 2 German Stock Corporation Act).

However, this requires two-way transmission (a two-way direct connection) which allows the supervisory board member to follow the events in the meeting and to participate by speaking.

Since the ministerial draft emphasises the importance of the visibility of the management to the shareholders in the virtual format, too, it seems conceivable that in this case the members of the supervisory board linked by video and audio must be just as visible to the shareholders as the people on the podium, i.e. they must be (permanently) integrated into the video of the live transmission.

In this respect, it would be desirable for the explanatory memorandum to include a corresponding clarification and to deny this, since the role of the ordinary members of the supervisory board in the general meeting is in any case a regularly passive one.

The draft provides that proxies of the company may be present at the place of the meeting (draft section 118a(2) s. 2 German Stock Corporation Act).

It is not entirely clear from this provision whether this means that the company’s proxies will in future be able to cast the votes they represent even without being present at the meeting (in contrast to the usual practice to date) or whether this “optional” provision is merely intended to reflect the fact that the appointment of proxies is a voluntary service provided by the company and not an obligation.

Electronic participation of the shareholders (section 118(1) s. 2 German Stock Corporation Act) in the form of a two-way direct connection in real time during the entire meeting is still not a mandatory requirement of the virtual general meeting.

Rather, the two-way direct connection is only mandatory to give the shareholders the opportunity to speak.

The companies are free to provide for such electronic participation or to enable the exercise of further rights (besides the opportunity to speak) by means of two-way electronic communication.

Bringing forward countermotions and elections proposals Countermotions to resolutions proposed by the management as well as elections proposals by shareholders must be made at an in-person general meeting.

This applies even if the motions have already been sent and made available by the company at least 14 days before the general meeting (section 126 German Stock Corporation Act).

In a virtual general meeting, it is not possible for shareholders to submit motions without electronic participation rights during the general meeting."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"In a virtual general meeting, it is not possible for shareholders to submit motions without electronic participation rights during the general meeting.

For this reason, countermotions and election proposals submitted in the run-up to the general meeting and to be made accessible by the company pursuant to section 126 German Stock Corporation Act will be deemed to have been submitted at the time they are made available (draft section 126(4) German Stock Corporation Act).

This statutory “ fiction solution ” also differs in two respects from the currently applicable provision for virtual general meetings in section 1(2) s. 3 Covid-19 Act, which fictitiously assumes such a motion has been submitted “at the general meeting”, but only on the further condition that the applicant is duly legitimised and registered for the general meeting.

In future, the company must make it possible to vote on a countermotion or election proposal as soon as it is made available .

According to the explanatory memorandum of the ministerial draft, the countermotions must then (in any case) be integrated into the electronic voting system in the shareholder portal.

However, this already corresponds to the practice of many companies, which, as a precautionary measure, have voting boxes on voting and proxy forms as well as in the shareholder portal ready for any countermotions and election proposals.

With the legal fiction of the submission of the motion already at the time it was made available and not only “at the general meeting”, a vote on the motion seems to be mandatory and it is no longer possible for the applicant to withdraw their motion until the general meeting.

In addition, a vote on the motion appears to take place even if the applicant has not registered for the general meeting or could no longer prove their identity.

In this respect, the current provision in section 1(2) s. 3 Covid-19 Act would appear to be preferable and should therefore be the model for another revision of the provision in the further legislative process, in order not to completely decouple the right to file a motion from the filer’s participation or connection to the virtual general meeting in future.

There is no need to depart from this principle, which continues to apply unchanged to in-person meetings (see section 126(2) no.

6 German Stock Corporation Act).

On the other hand, in the virtual general meeting itself spontaneous countermotions are no longer possible , unless the company expressly allows this when convening the meeting.

Companies will have to carefully consider how to deal with this option on a case-by-case basis : Allowing spontaneous countermotions during the general meeting harbours the risk of unforeseeable imponderables for the course of the general meeting.

On the other hand, it preserves flexibility, for example to be able to react to factual developments in the 14 days prior to the general meeting if these make it necessary to adjust the content of the previously announced management proposal and/or countermotion.

Due to the uncertainties about the conditions in which a resolution proposed by the management and announced in the notice of the general meeting can be put to a vote in the general meeting in an amended form, the practice in these cases is often that a shareholder introduces an amended resolution proposal into the meeting via a countermotion.

Also in supervisory board elections it is conceivable that it only becomes apparent shortly before or during the general meeting that a proposed supervisory board member will not receive the necessary majority.

In this case, too, a new person can only be proposed as a candidate for election at short notice at the general meeting if the company has previously permitted this in the notice convening the meeting."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"The decision on allowing spontaneous countermotions at the meeting will in certain cases also depend on whether this reservation of the company’s right to grant permission also applies to motions to appoint a special auditor .

On the one hand, these are not “real” countermotions that contradict a management proposal, but rather factually supplementary motions that, under certain conditions, can also be made without announcement of an agenda item (e.g. presentation of the annual financial statements or approval of the actions of the management board or supervisory board).

This speaks in favour of formally qualifying them as “motions that are not countermotions pursuant to section 126 German Stock Corporation Act”, which shareholders should still be able to submit in the virtual general meeting in any case (draft section 118(1) s. 2 no.

3 German Stock Corporation Act).

However, the objective pursued of streamlining the meeting with regard to motions in the meeting and, in particular, enabling shareholders who frequently exercise their voting rights in the run-up to the general meeting to do so, clearly speaks in favour of also moving the special audit motions in principle to period before the general meeting, also in order to prevent “minorities turning into majorities” in the case of spontaneous motions in the meeting, due to the fact that a large proportion of the shareholders can no longer vote on them.

For practical reasons, the legislator should therefore clarify in a legally watertight manner how such special audit motions will be treated.

In any case, it appears permissible for companies to take a compromise approach by allowing countermotions in the convening notice only for selected agenda items.

Shareholders’ right to information and right of enquiry The shareholders’ right to information is also being modified, primarily with the aim of streamlining the general meeting and increasing the quality of the answers to questions.

The management board may stipulate that shareholders must submit their questions by electronic communication (shareholder portal, email) no later than four days before the general meeting (draft section 131(1a)

German Stock Corporation Act).

From a practical point of view, it is very welcome that, compared to the virtual general meeting according to the Covid-19 Act, this deadline is extended from one to four days before the day of the general meeting.

This gives the companies the necessary time to achieve a high quality of response.

The management board may limit the scope of questions and make the entitlement to submit questions dependent on the shareholders having duly registered for the general meeting (draft section 131(1b) German Stock Corporation Act).

This gives the management board the same means in advance as the chairperson of the meeting to ensure a reasonable time frame for the meeting.

The maximum number of questions per shareholder as well as a restriction on signs may be specified thereafter.

Another modification is that the company must make questions submitted in due time available to all shareholders before the meeting , in the case of listed companies via the company’s website (draft section 131(1c) German Stock Corporation Act).

According to the explanatory memorandum of the ministerial draft, the questions do not have to be published continuously without delay after receipt by the company, but it is sufficient if they are made available collectively on the website after expiry of the deadline.

Nevertheless, it should be added in the further legislative process that questions do not have to be made accessible if they contain obviously false or misleading information on key points or insults or if the management board would make itself liable to prosecution by making them accessible (analogously to section 126(2) s. 1"
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"no. 1 and 3 German Stock Corporation Act and corresponding to such a regulation for the publication of comments under draft section 130a(3) s. 3 German Stock Corporation Act).

If the management board decides to move the right to information to the period before the general meeting, the shareholders no longer have the right to information “at” the general meeting , but only the right of enquiry.

The right of shareholders to ask questions at the general meeting , which has already been granted voluntarily by some large listed companies in this and the previous general meeting season, becomes law in this respect (draft section 131(1d) German Stock Corporation Act).

Following the answers to the shareholders’ questions submitted in advance, the shareholders are to be granted a right to query the answers given by the management board (and probably also by the supervisory board) during the meeting.

These queries must be made by means of electronic communication .

The ministerial draft expressly emphasises that the queries do not have to take the form of a live video link.

They can also be permitted by means of a (re-enabled) text box in the shareholder portal or, for example, by email.

The right to ask follow-up questions is also limited by the fact that there must be a factual connection to the preliminary question and its answer by the management board .

In this respect, difficult questions of demarcation are likely to arise for the management and the back office, which the explanatory memorandum of the ministerial draft anticipates to the extent that this factual connection is to be assumed in case of doubt.

It is also noteworthy that all shareholders are entitled to ask follow-up questions and not only the shareholder who asked the actual preliminary question .

The chairperson of the meeting may, on the basis of an authorisation in the articles of association, impose reasonable time limits on the shareholder’s right to ask questions and determine further details (section 131(2) s. 2 German Stock Corporation Act).

In particular, they may limit the period of time during which questions may be asked or determine the number of permissible questions per shareholder.

The ministerial draft explicitly refers to the suggestion A.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code, which states that the meeting chairperson for ordinary general meetings should aim for a meeting to last four to six hours.

Submission of comments and opportunity to speak In order to make interaction between shareholders and management more similar to the format of the in-person meeting, and at the same time to move some of the process of providing information to the period before the general meeting, shareholders will in future be given the opportunity to submit comments before the general meeting and to speak at the general meeting (draft section 130a German Stock Corporation Act).

This is intended to establish a culture of debate in the virtual general meeting and to avoid the impression that the process of a virtual general meeting merely follows the management’s script.

At virtual general meetings to date, these opportunities have only been tested in very isolated cases and voluntarily at large listed companies, mainly because of the technical effort involved.

Submission of comments The company must make it possible for shareholders to submit comments on the agenda items by electronic communication before the virtual general meeting.

The electronic communication channel (e.g. text in the form of email or video messages) created by company for this purpose is at the discretion of the management board .

The scope of comments may also be appropriately limited, for example by a maximum number of characters or a time limit for video messages.

Comments must be submitted no later than 4 days before the general meeting ."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"Comments must be submitted no later than 4 days before the general meeting .

Comments submitted must be made available by the company to all shareholders , in the case of listed companies via the company’s website.

A statement does not have to be made accessible if the management board would thereby render itself liable to prosecution, if the statement is obviously false, misleading or insulting or if the shareholder indicates that he will not participate in the virtual general meeting and will not be represented.

According to the explanatory memorandum of the ministerial draft, comments only have to be made available in the language and format they were submitted in, e. speeches not in German would not have to be translated by the company for publication .

From an organisational point of view, this is understandable, as the companies would otherwise have to reserve translation capacity 4 days before the general meeting and timely publication before the general meeting would be considerably delayed again by translation work.

On the other hand, it is questionable with regard to the equal treatment of shareholders (section 53a German Stock Corporation Act) if statements were published in a foreign language that only some of the shareholders understand.

The working language of the general meeting is generally German, which is why in practice, speeches in English, for example, are usually only permitted if a translation (or at least a translated summary) is possible.

However, the proportion of foreign shareholders in German stock corporations has risen significantly.

In this respect, a regulation or clarification could be suggested in the further legislative process which, on the one hand, allows the companies to specify the language of the comments and, on the other hand, encourages listed companies with a typically international group of shareholders to accept comments in English and to translate them as text for publication.

Opportunity for shareholders to speak At the general meeting, shareholders must be given the opportunity to speak live via video using a two-way direct connection to the management and shareholders connected to the meeting .

A chat function on the shareholder portal is therefore not enough.

However, in the convening notice the company may reserve the right to check whether video communication works.

If video communication does not work or if the shareholder does not appear on the technical check date, the speech may not be allowed.

In that case, the shareholder could still submit their speech in text format as a written statement, if necessary.

The company may specify in the convening notice a reasonable total time for all shareholders to speak and a reasonable total number of possible speeches.

The chairperson of the meeting will decide on the order of the speeches.

However, the chairperson of the meeting may, as at a general meeting in person, further reasonably limit the total time on the basis of a corresponding authorisation in the articles of association or further reasonably limit the speaking time.

As for the implementation in practice, at least in the initial phase, the particular challenge will be to determine the appropriate scope and time frame for speeches in advance in the convocation.

While the chairperson of the meeting can base restrictive management measures on an advanced time (duration) of the general meeting in the overall view of the addressed questions and follow-up questions as well as the speeches, it is difficult to estimate in advance at the time of the convocation how much time remains for the shareholders’ speeches in addition to the answering of questions.

A conceivable option could be to stagger the appropriate framework for speeches in the convening notice and to make it dependent on a certain number of submitted shareholder questions (i.e. reduction of the share of speeches with increasing number of shareholder questions)."
Noerr,Virtual General Meetings will remain,"Shareholders only have the opportunity to speak at the general meeting if they have registered their speech at least four days before the general meeting .

This registration of the speech must in principle be made separately from the registration for the general meeting and will not replace the latter.

Rather, it may be restricted to duly registered shareholders.

If the number of registered speeches exceeds the number of speeches admitted by the company, the chronological order of receipt of the registration will determine whether the speech is allowed .

The remaining registered speeches do not have to be allowed.

It would therefore be good if the share capital represented by the speaker were also recognised as a further criterion for the selection of speeches.

Otherwise, there is a risk that speakers will rush to register their speeches, which could lead to shareholders and shareholders’ associations with a significant shareholding being too late in registering their speeches.

The companies would then in fact be forced to also accept speeches that exceed the permitted number.

In that case, the responsibility to reduce the total number of speeches to an appropriate level would only be moved to the chairperson of the general meeting.

Video communication must remain limited to the speech.

Shareholders are therefore not allowed to ask questions , make procedural motions or - if even permitted by the company during the general meeting- submit countermotions and election proposals via the live link.

Limitation on contestation due to technical faults

The companies that opt for a virtual meeting shall be protected from increased risks of contestation due to the technology to be used.

Therefore, contesting the general meeting resolutions can generally not be based on the violation of shareholders’ rights due to a technical fault , unless the company can be accused of wilful intent or gross negligence (draft section 243(3) s. 1

no. 1, s. 2 German Stock Corporation Act).

Conclusion Given the positive experiences with the virtual general meeting format during the pandemic, the ministerial draft is to be welcomed from a practical point of view.

It essentially creates a refined legal framework for the virtual format, which was to be expected after the discussions in academia and practice.

Nevertheless, in some places there is still room for improvement and clarification in the further legislative process.

In general, it would be welcome if the legislator went one step further by applying the intended move of essential informational and decision-making processes, including the associated shareholder rights, to the period before the general meeting in the same way for in-person and hybrid meetings.

Otherwise, it is to be expected that the virtual format, given its increased attractiveness for institutional investors and the quality of shareholder information, will replace the in-person meeting as the new default form of the general meeting and that in-person meetings will become less popular for this reason alone."
Noerr,No FDI clearance: takeover of Siltronic by GlobalWafers fails,"GlobalWafers Co Ltd, a Taiwanese company, and Munich-based Siltronic AG are worldwide leaders in silicon wafer manufacturing.

Wafers are a critical input product for semiconductor chips, which is an industry that has become notorious for its production shortage since 2020.

Reasons often cited include the COVID-19 pandemic as well as rising economic tensions between China and the USA.

At the end of 2020, still in the early stages of the crisis, GlobalWafers made a voluntary public takeover offer to Siltronic’s shareholders and filed an application for a clearance certificate pursuant to section 58(1) of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance ( Außenwirtschaftsverordnung – AWV) on 10 December 2020.

The impact of the global chip shortage increasingly revealed the significance of wafers for the automotive sector and products such as video game consoles, mobile phones, graphic cards, and others.

As a result, in the context of comprehensive legislative amendments to German foreign trade law (see our alerts here and here ), the scope of foreign direct investment (“FDI”) control was significantly expanded with regard to semiconductor manufacturers and other related businesses, with effect from 1 May 2021.

Although it did not have a direct legal effect on the Siltronic case, the policy and enforcement environment within which the case was assessed by the German government had clearly become more rigorous.

GlobalWafers and Siltronic are understood to have offered various remedies, including selling security-relevant assets, the possibility to rescind the contract under certain conditions, and/or granting the German government a golden share (i.e. the legal option of Germany to outvote other shareholders under specific circumstances).

By way of background, serious concerns relating to the German public order or security are often dealt with in what are known as “public law agreements”; with regard to the Siltronic deal, however, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (“Ministry”) did not enter into such an agreement before 31 January 2022.

Instead, it briefly stated that “it was not possible to complete all the necessary review steps as part of the investment review” by the end of the period.

Now, it is important to note that the Ministry cannot decide the time frame within which a decision must be made at its own discretion.

Instead, the limits are dictated by law: after an initial investigation of two months and a more in-depth examination of four months, the Ministry can extend the deadline by a maximum of four months if certain criteria are met.

Once the overall investigation period has expired, the clearance certificate is deemed to have been issued – which is exactly what GlobalWafers argued in December 2021.

But time limits have to be considered suspended in the case of contractual negotiations or if the Ministry (reasonably) demands additional information – which is what the Federal Government argued, in particular due to a request for information dated 10 December 2021 made after previous negotiations had been terminated.

This request concerned the approval decision with remedies from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation which could only be submitted on 26 January 2022, potentially ending the suspension of the Ministry’s deadline, but definitely not soon enough to expire prior to the long-stop-date.

It was crunch time.

GlobalWafers did seek a preliminary injunction stating that the clearance certificate should be deemed to have been issued.

But on 27 January 2022 and 31 January 2022, the Administrative Court ( Verwaltungsgericht ) of Berlin and the Higher Administrative Court ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) of Berlin-Brandenburg ruled in favour of the federal government (VG 4 L 111/22; OVG 1 S 10/22).

Thus, the clearance certificate applied for on 10 December 2020 proved to be the one missing piece necessary for closing the deal."
Noerr,No FDI clearance: takeover of Siltronic by GlobalWafers fails,"Thus, the clearance certificate applied for on 10 December 2020 proved to be the one missing piece necessary for closing the deal.

It remains unclear whether the takeover would have been cleared, but doubts clearly exist.

The mere duration of the FDI control procedure and the handling of the proceedings, to the extent that these are known, suggest that the federal government identified serious issues with the deal.

Siltronic is not the first deal to fail (see Aixton, KUKA, 50Hertz, Leifeld Metal Spinning, IMST, for example).

In fact, the global trend towards tighter FDI screening (see our alert here ) is evident.

In view of this, foreign investors in Germany, and in other jurisdictions, are well advised to carefully assess the applicability of the ever increasing scope of the national FDI regimes, timing and not the least costs.

An FDI risk assessment should be made at an appropriately early stage in the process.

While collapsing transactions are naturally catching public attention, it should not hide the fact that by far most deals (even evidently critical ones) can in our experience be brought to a satisfactory conclusion."
Noerr,New rules for collective redundancies?,"Companies undergoing a reorganisation or restructuring that involves collective redundancy are often vulnerable to mistakes due to the requirement by the German Federal Employment Agency (Agentur für Arbeit) that it be notified of the collective redundancy.

Despite the fact that a number of court decisions have specified and sharpened the requirements for proper notice of a collective redundancy, by far not all legal issues have been clarified.

Unfortunately, case law has repeatedly been good for a “surprise”, particularly regarding whether and under what prerequisites an error in the process of a collective redundancy notice invalidates the terminations.

The collective redundancy notice remains a “regular guest” of the courts.

Two recent examples of case law illustrate the latest developments.

1.

Background and applicable law Section 17 of the German Unfair Dismissal Act ( Kündigungsschutzgesetz ) requires employers to give the relevant Employment Agency advance notice of a collective redundancy when a certain number of employees are to be made redundant within the next 30 calendar days.

Redundancies in this sense are either notices of termination by the employer or consensual termination of employment contracts at the employer’s initiative.

The threshold for mandatory collective redundancy notice depends on the number of regular employees at a local business unit:

Size of local business unit Applicable threshold More than 20 and fewer than 60 employees Redundancy of more than five employees At least 60 and fewer than 500 employees Redundancy of 10% of regular employees or more than 25 employees At least 500 employees Redundancy of at least 30 employees If the local business unit at which the redundancies are to take place has an employee representative body (works council), the employer must conduct the established consultation procedure with the works council before notifying the relevant Employment Agency of the impending collective redundancy (section 17(2)

Unfair Dismissal Act).

As part of the consultation procedure, the employer must first provide the works council with a comprehensive written briefing.

The consultation procedure usually ends with a statement by the works council.

The employer must forward to the relevant Employment Agency a copy of its initial briefing of the works council (section 17(3) sentence 1 Unfair Dismissal Act) and the works council’s statement (section 17(3) sentence 2 Unfair Dismissal Act).

The copy of the briefing must be forwarded to the Employment Agency even before the actual collective redundancy notice, i.e. at the same time it is sent to the works council; however, the works council’s closing statement on the intended redundancies need only be enclosed with the actual collective redundancy notice.

Section 17(3) sentence 4 Unfair Dismissal Act requires that the employer must include the following information in any collective redundancy notice (“must information”): Name of the employer and type and address of the local business unit, Reasons for the planned redundancies, Number and occupation of the regular employees at the local business unit and those to be made redundant, Time period in which the redundancies are to take place, and the criteria to be used to select which employees are to be made redundant.

In addition, section 17(3) sentence 5 Unfair Dismissal Act provides that, in consultation with the works council, the collective redundancy notice should include information regarding the gender, age, occupation and nationality of the employees to be made redundant (“should information”).

Redundancies without (proper) collective redundancy notice are usually invalid for this reason alone."
Noerr,New rules for collective redundancies?,"Redundancies without (proper) collective redundancy notice are usually invalid for this reason alone.

The German provisions on collective redundancy notices found in section 17 Unfair Dismissal Act are based on European Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (“Collective Redundancy Directive”).

Caught between the requirements of the Collective Redundancy Directive and the German Unfair Dismissal Act, the details of the requirements for proper collective redundancy notices and the consequences of improperly issued collective redundancy notices still remain subject to final clarification.

This situation continues to entail significant risk for employers, as is illustrated by two cases regarding which recent decisions have been handed down: 2. Is “should information” mandatory?

Hesse Regional Labour Court ruled on a case (judgment of 25 June 2021 – 14 Sa 1225/20) in which the claimant contested a termination for business reasons as part of a collective redundancy scheme.

The employer had issued a collective redundancy notice in advance but did not provide the “should information” on the gender, age, occupation and nationality of the employees concerned.

The Employment Agency did not raise any objections to this.

Contrary to the overwhelmingly prevailing opinion at the time, both Frankfurt Labour Court and Hesse Regional Labour Court were of the opinion that the termination in question was invalid because the “should information” was missing.

The courts stated that this followed from an interpretation of section 17(3) sentence 5 Unfair Dismissal Act in conformity with the Collective Redundancy Directive, stating that the Collective Redundancy Directive demanded that all useful information must be included in the collective redundancy notice, making no distinction between “must” and “should information”, the information regarding gender, age, occupation and nationality was useful information because it enabled the competent authority to focus its reemployment assistance efforts more accurately and thus be better prepared for the redundancy of a larger number of employees, and that this corresponded to the purpose of a notice, and thus it was necessary in order to enhance the full effectiveness of the Collective Redundancy Directive to link the lack of information on gender, age, occupation and nationality to the consequence of invalidity of terminations issued without this information (principle of “ effet utile” ).

This decision is not yet final; the employee lodged an appeal on points of law with the German Federal Labour Court (2 AZR 424/21).

The Federal Labour Court has not yet handed down its decision.

3. Consequences of failing to forward the works council briefing to the Employment Agency In another case that concerns issuance of a proper collective redundancy notice, the claimant also challenged the termination of his employment.

The employer had issued a collective redundancy notice but, in contravention of section 17(3) sentence 1 Unfair Dismissal Act, failed to forward to the local employment agency in advance a copy of the briefing of the works council with which the consultation procedure according to section 17(2)

Unfair Dismissal Act begins.

Lower Saxony Regional Labour Court sided with the employer and pronounced the termination valid (judgment of 24 February 2021 – 17 Sa 890/20).

The court stated in particular that the fact that the Employment Agency did not receive a copy of the works council briefing in a timely manner does not result in the invalidity of the termination.

The court found that it was not recognisable that the forwarding obligation protects individual employees because at initiation of the consultation procedure it has not yet been determined who is affected by the termination.

On the contrary, according to the court, this is not to be discussed until during the consultation procedure."
Noerr,New rules for collective redundancies?,"On the contrary, according to the court, this is not to be discussed until during the consultation procedure.

The Employment Agency could thus precisely not adapt its reemployment assistance efforts to the content of the works council briefing, which was given at the very beginning of the consultation procedure.

The claimant (employer) lodged an appeal on points of law against this decision with the Federal Labour Court, which, in turn, decided on 27 January 2022 (6 AZR 155/21 (A)) to call upon the European Court of Justice due to the European law dimension of the legal issue in dispute to clarify whether the failure to forward the works council briefing to the Employment Agency in itself resulted in the invalidity of a termination ( press release in German ).

The proceedings before the German Federal Labour Court are suspended pending the decision by the European Court of Justice.

4. Conclusion and practical advice The decisions show that we will still have to wait for final clarification of the legal issues in connection with (supposed) errors to which employers are susceptible when giving notice of and implementing collective redundancies for which such notice is required.

What is important for company practice is that the forms and instructions provided by the Employment Agency on issuing collective redundancy notices cannot be relied upon .

In the annex to blank 34 of the form provided by the Employment Agency for issuing collective redundancy notices, in which the “should information” is to be provided, it is explicitly stated that the “information for the reemployment assistance services” is voluntary and can “also be submitted later”.

By contrast, according to the judgment of Hesse Regional Labour Court, employers cannot rely on this.

The court is of the opinion that the decisive factor is not the form provided by the Employment Agency, but solely whether the required information is actually provided.

The latter, according to the court, is based solely on European law, i.e. the Collective Redundancy Directive.

The court stated that reliability could at most be created by the European Court of Justice, but not by the forms provided by the Employment Agency.

In addition, a decision or information provided by the Employment Agency that the collective redundancy notice was properly issued is not binding on the labour courts.

Such decision or information is therefore not sufficient to limit or preclude the risks attendant on a collective redundancy notice.

It remains to be seen what position the Federal Labour Court will take on a lack of “should information”.

It is possible that the Federal Labour Court might again call upon the European Court of Justice to decide whether differentiation between “should” and “must information” is permissible under the Collective Redundancy Directive. 

In any case, until final clarification comes from the Federal Labour Court or possibly the European Court of Justice, as a precaution, collective redundancy notices should include all information, regardless of whether it falls under the category of “should” or “must information” under the law.

Likewise, until clarification by the European Court of Justice and the Federal Labour Court, in divergence from current standard practice, it is advisable to submit to the Employment Agency a copy of the briefing provided to the works council at the beginning of the consultation procedure and the works council’s statement at the legally established times for each.

On the whole, collective redundancies and the corresponding notices to the Employment Agency continue to be very susceptible to errors and should be well prepared in view of the related consequences, i.e. in particular the invalidation of all terminations made in the context of the collective redundancies."
Noerr,New rules for collective redundancies?,"This can also make it necessary to gather reliable data by requesting in advance any missing data from employees or adjusting or introducing processes for this purpose, particularly staff questionnaires.

Any applicable co-determination rights on the part of a works council must also be kept in mind (section 94 German Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz – BetrVG)."
Noerr,“M&A court” established in Dusseldorf,"Based on an ordinance enacted by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, a civil division for disputes involving corporate transactions (mergers and acquisitions) with a value in dispute exceeding EUR 500,000 and a civil division for appeals in these cases were established on 1 January 2022 at Dusseldorf Regional Court and Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court respectively.

Due to the excellent technical equipment of these judicial chambers, cases can be heard in English and documents submitted in English before experienced judges specialised in this complex field of law.

Video conferences and simultaneous interpretation during hearings are also possible.

However, German will remain the language An “M&A court”, as the Dusseldorf Regional Court will now become with the establishment of its 24th civil division, is so far unique in Germany.

Alexander Hirsch, partner and co-head of Mergers & Acquisitions: “This is a unique step so far for the ordinary courts in Germany.

In particular, the specialist expertise in deciding highly complex M&A transactions is crucial.

One aspect which led to this division of Dusseldorf Regional Court being established was the positive experience in the Netherlands with the Netherlands Commercial Court in Amsterdam.”

Oliver Sieg, partner and head of Liability & Insurance: “Efficient ordinary courts are a key factor for Germany as a business location.

This includes the new dedicated division for post-M&A disputes, especially if there is sufficient capacity to ensure the timely resolution of disputes.”"
Noerr,Romania: General guidelines on protecting whistleblowers,"Like many other European countries, Romania is struggling to implement the EU Whistleblowing Directive and accommodate this game-changing perspective on issues such as corporate fraud and non-compliant business environments.

In April 2021, Romania issued a first draft law, which was hotly debated and criticized for reasons including the imbalance between the obligations imposed on the private sector and the scope of the upcoming law.

We at Noerr Romania have been actively involved in arguing for, defending and protecting the interests of the private sector and were pleased to see some of our concerns addressed in the second draft law, issued by the Romanian legislator in December 2021.

Considering the many changes introduced by the second draft law, we would like to present a series of articles on important issues with the goal of walking companies through the main focus points of the whistleblowing law, which is expected to enter into force any day.

For our opening theme, we would like to shed some light on probably one of the most significant changes introduced by the second draft law: general guidelines for protecting whistleblowers.

The second whistleblowing draft law provides for a new Art. 4 dedicated to establishing the general principles and guidelines that will govern the protection of whistleblowers.

Soon after the publication of the first whistleblowing draft law, we continuously stressed the importance of underlying principles for the entire whistleblowing process, aimed at protecting companies from unnecessary costs and business impairment.

We can therefore only welcome the initiative of the Romanian legislator to correct some of the flaws that might have had a significant impact on the private sector.

In a nutshell, we anticipate the following: Whistleblowers will be obliged to submit accompanying proof According to Art. 4 b) of the second whistleblowing draft law, those who file a whistleblowing report are now obliged to support their accusations with documents or information.

Regardless of the fact that this newly introduced provision could have been greatly improved by specifying the nature of the documents or information which must be submitted along with a whistleblowing report, we consider the principle of responsibility introduced by the second whistleblowing draft law to be a definite improvement.

As a consequence, companies are now entitled (at least theoretically) to ignore/disregard any whistleblowing reports that contain mere information or accusations that are not accompanied by substantiating documents or explanatory information.

This could enable companies to reduce the costs associated with registering, analysing and managing incomplete/unjustified whistleblowing reports.

This is a very positive development.

Art. 4 e) regulates the principle of “balance”, according to which no one is entitled to use the provisions of the whistleblowing law to reduce the disciplinary or administrative penalty for his/her own (more) serious misconduct.

This newly introduced principle was necessary in order to protect the interests of private companies, which are unfortunately faced on occasion with “whistleblowing reports” that are, in fact, blackmail attempts.

By this we mean (as also stressed in our previous communications) situations in which an employee is, for example, under investigation for misconduct, and attempts to avoid an imminent penalty or dismissal by pointing the finger at other potential wrongdoings in the company.

However noble the intention of the Romanian legislator, we cannot help but wonder why the principle of “balance” is applicable only when an employee is trying to reduce a penalty for a more serious misconduct.

A critical analysis of the wording used by the legislator shows that it is still possible to hide behind the provisions of the whistleblowing law in order to avoid a penalty for a misconduct that is just as serious as the reported misconduct."
Noerr,Romania: General guidelines on protecting whistleblowers,"Moreover, breaking such a principle should theoretically result in appropriate penalties or repercussions; however, this is not the case.

It will be the task of the National Integrity Agency ( Agentia Nationala de Integritate – ANI), as the supervising authority, to determine what rights and obligations companies have when faced with such a whistleblowing case.

Good faith Another principle introduced by Art. 4 regulates the protection of whistleblowers who had reasonable grounds to believe that the information they reported was true at the moment of the report and in line with the scope of the whistleblowing law.

Two main conclusions can be drawn from the “good faith principle”: Whistleblowers need reasonable grounds to believe that the information they report is true.

As with the other principles detailed above, this one also aims at protecting companies from unreasonable or vexatious reports, which are extremely costly and time-consuming.

Moreover, although not expressly stated, we believe that whistleblowers should have to prove that such reasonable grounds existed.

As a consequence, whistleblowers are encouraged to take a more serious and responsible approach, while being obliged to first determine the exact scope of the law, and also analyse if the information to be reported is well founded or not; The whistleblowing law will not protect whistleblowers who lack solid grounds for their reports.

We have continuously stated that such an amendment of the whistleblowing draft law is required, since the initial version of the draft law allowed for uncontrolled subjectivism on the part of the whistleblower, without filtering out unreasonable or vexatious reports in any way.

As with any draft law, and especially one that will bring about significant changes in business dealings, even the second whistleblowing draft law could have been improved.

However, we are ultimately pleased to see that the concerns of the private sector are being addressed to a certain extent and that the Romanian legislator is also trying to balance the obligations that the upcoming whistleblowing law imposes on the private sector with the main goal of this law."
Noerr,Admissibility under trade mark law of parallel imports of pharmaceuticals,"Opinions of the Advocate General before the ECJ: In January 2022, the highly anticipated Opinions of the Advocate General were issued in two different proceedings referred for a preliminary ruling regarding the admissibility under trade mark law of parallel imports of pharmaceuticals: Opinion of the Advocate General dated 13 January 2022 on the parallel preliminary ruling proceedings in case numbers C-253/20 and C-254/20 , and Opinion of the Advocate General dated 21 February 2022 on the parallel preliminary ruling proceedings in case numbers C-147/20, C-204/20 and C-224/20.

We would like to take this opportunity to report on these two proceedings and each Opinion of the Advocate General in this article and a subsequent one.

This first article addresses the joint preliminary ruling proceedings in case numbers and C-254/20 .

Facts In the preliminary ruling proceedings in case numbers C-253/20 and C-254/20 , two companies of the pharmaceutical group Novartis proceeds against the Belgian parallel importers Impexeco NV and PI Pharma NV.

The pharmaceutical company Novartis sells original pharmaceuticals and, via its group company Sandoz, generic pharmaceuticals that are chemically identical to their reference products.

Both, the original products and the generics are manufactured at the same location and under the responsibility of the same company, but under different licenses and marketed via different distribution channels.

The preliminary ruling proceedings deal with the generic pharmaceuticals “Letrozol Sandoz” and “Methylphenidat Sandoz”.

Parallel importers have been purchasing these generic products and selling them in Belgium under the trade marks of the original products, i.e. “Femara” and “Rilatine”.

When selling the product “Letrozol-Sandoz” under the brand name “Femara” in Belgium, they have been able to charge around 30 times the price they paid to purchase the product “Letrozol Sandoz” in the United Kingdom.

Novartis opposed this use of its trade marks and brought actions before the Belgian courts against the parallel importers for trade mark infringements.

(Trade mark) law issues Many previous court cases have dealt with the question of the circumstances under which it is admissible for a third party to sell pharmaceuticals imported from another EU Member State under the original trade mark.

The essence of the problem always lies in the appropriate balance of interests between the rights of the trade mark owner and the principle of unrestricted distribution of pharmaceuticals within the EU:

According to trade mark law, an owner’s trade mark right is deemed “exhausted” if the trade mark – e.g. of a product – has been placed on the market by the owner or with the owner’s consent .

Once a trade mark has been exhausted, the owner can no longer claim its trade mark right.

This principle of exhaustion is intended to prevent such occurrences as a restriction of free movement of goods caused by a trade mark owner claiming its trade mark right and interfering in continued marketing under the trade mark and erecting artificial trade barriers or allocating markets.

However, section 24(2) of the German Trade Mark Act (Markengesetz) and Article 15 of the EU Trade Mark Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 provide for an exception according to which the trade mark is not deemed exhausted if the owner opposes the distribution for legitimate reasons , in particular if the condition of the goods has been changed or impaired after having been placed on the market.

In turn, this exception would, result in a right on the part of the trade mark owner to oppose any repackaging or relabelling of its original product that is required by pharmaceutical law, thus using trade mark law to effectively prevent parallel imports."
Noerr,Admissibility under trade mark law of parallel imports of pharmaceuticals,"For this reason, in its landmark decisions dated 23 May 1978 and 11 July 1996, the ECJ established criteria under which repackaging a pharmaceutical is admissible under trade mark law (criteria established in the Bristol Meyer Squibb case: “ BMS Criteria ”).

These criteria provide that repackaging and/or relabelling is admissible if it is established that reliance on trade mark rights by the owner in order to oppose the marketing of repackaged products under that trade mark would contribute to the artificial partitioning of the markets between Member States; the repackaging cannot affect the original condition of the product inside the packaging, the importer gives notice to the trade mark owner before the repackaged product is put on sale, and the new packaging clearly states who repackaged the product and indicates the name of the manufacturer.

The court ruled that artificial partitioning according to the first criteria is always given “...where the owner has put an identical pharmaceutical product on the market in several Member States in various forms of packaging, and the repackaging carried out by the importer is necessary in order to market the product in the Member State of importation ...“ (ECJ, judgment dated 11 July 1996 – cases C–427/93, C–429/93 and C–436/93, published in NJW 1997, 1627 onwards)

In the preliminary ruling proceedings at issue here, it was disputed whether (1) a trade mark on an original product can be exhausted at all if a generic product has been placed on the market (under another trade mark) and (2) if so, whether the admissibility under trade mark law of the continued marketing of the generic product must then be examined according to the BMS criteria.

Opinion of the Advocate General (1) Exhaustion of the trade mark of the original product Because the case at hand does not deal with the use of the trade mark of the generic product that was actually marketed but rather with the trade mark of the original product, which was actually not marketed by the importer, the parties intensively disputed whether the trade mark of the original product could be considered exhausted at all.

The Advocate General answered this question by referring to the previous case law of the ECJ stating that exhaustion can occur if identical goods are marketed by the same owner or with its consent in other Member States under the trade mark.

According to the Advocate General, it is not automatically given that such “identical goods” exist if generic products and their reference pharmaceutical products are of equal quality from a therapeutic viewpoint.

Under certain circumstances, it is, however, conceivable that pharmaceutical products and generic product could be “the same product” that is merely marketed under different regulatory systems.

The Advocate General pointed out that this was possible in particular if they were manufactured by the same company or an affiliate of that company.

However, whether the objective identity is actually given must be decided by the national courts on a case-by-case basis.

(2) Applicability of the BMS criteria According to the Advocate General, if the conclusion has been reached that the owner’s trade mark rights have been exhausted, the question of whether the owner can nevertheless oppose the use of the mark for legitimate reasons must be answered on the basis of the BMS criteria already established by European courts, including whether the use of the trade mark for placing the product on the market was “ objectively necessary ”.

According to the case law of the ECJ, the prerequisite for such necessity is fulfilled if regulations or practices in the import Member State prevent the marketing of the product in question in its original packaging.

In contrast, this prerequisite is not fulfilled if the parallel importer’s sole purpose in repackaging the product is to gain an economic advantage."
Noerr,Admissibility under trade mark law of parallel imports of pharmaceuticals,"In contrast, this prerequisite is not fulfilled if the parallel importer’s sole purpose in repackaging the product is to gain an economic advantage.

Whether such necessity existed in the cases referred for a preliminary ruling has to be determined by the national courts on a case-by-case basis.

Conclusion It remains to be seen whether, as is often the case, the ECJ concurs with the Opinion of the Advocate General and in particular his position that the reference product and the generic product can be “identical products” under certain circumstances.

However, from a purely practical viewpoint, even if the ECJ agrees with the Advocate General’s line of argument, as the Advocate General himself states, this does not mean that the parallel importer automatically has more freedom to act.

This is because the BMS criteria apply even here, according to the Advocate General.

The “objective necessity” of using the original trade mark to ensure actual access to the market of the import Member State will in practice virtually never be given.

This is true as a Member State cannot generally refuse to grant a permit for the parallel import of a generic product if a permit for entry onto the market was granted for the reference product in this Member State.

The only exception to this is if such refusal is justified on health protection grounds.

The resulting conclusion is that a parallel importer usually has the right to market a generic product under its own trade mark.

It is not necessary in such a case even from a purely legal standpoint to replace the generic product’s trade mark by the trade mark of the reference product in order to place it on the market, regardless of whether the generic product marketed in parallel is also licenced in the import Member State.

It is all the more unnecessary to use the trade mark in order to be able to charge a higher price.

Although the Opinion of the Advocate General and in particular certain statements regarding exhaustion and identity of the products will be contradicted by trade mark owners, it ultimately does follow from the Opinion that, despite the fact that exhaustion may be assumed to be given, the further marketing under the original trade mark is to be evaluated according to the BMS criteria and is thus not automatically possible for parallel importers."
Noerr,Hungary: New consumer protection rules on digital content and digital services,"The new European consumer protection rules for digital content and services, set out in EU Directives 2019/770 and 2019/771, were implemented in Hungary in due time – in contrast to some CEE countries where they have yet to be implemented.

Most of the provisions of these directives came into force on 1 January 2022.

Hungarian implementation The Hungarian legislator passed a new law – Government Decree No. 373/2021 – which consists primarily of the provisions of the EU directives (770/2019 and 771/2019/EU).

However, some provisions amend existing laws, and existing consumer protection regulations continue to apply.

Accordingly, all of the following laws apply to providing digital services or digital content and require careful consideration: Government Decree no. 373/2021 (“ Government Decree ”); Act CLV of 1997 on consumer protection; Government Decree no. 151/2003; Government Decree no.

45/2014; provisions of Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code regarding terms and conditions and warranty;

provisions of Act CVIII of 2001 on E-Commerce.

Below we highlight some of the changes: Digital content and digital services as legal terms The new regulations introduced the terms of: digital content (in Hungarian “ digitális tartalom ”) and digital services (in Hungarian “ digitális szolgáltatás ”), which include video and audio files, digital games, e-books, software, hosting services and social media, and “goods with digital elements” (in Hungarian “ digitális elemeket tartalmzó áru ”), for example smart TVs with streaming subscriptions and cars with navigation systems.

Stricter warranty provisions The new law includes important changes to conformity requirements.

It is no longer sufficient for digital content and digital services to conform to the contractually agreed description, quantity and quality.

Now, compliance with “objective conformity requirements” is necessary, which means that digital content and services must be fit for the purposes for which digital content or digital services of the same type would normally be used; and must possess the qualities and performance features, including in relation to functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security, that are normal for digital content or digital services of the same type and which the consumer may reasonably expect.

This means that providers of digital content and services must monitor their competitors’ products.

In addition, it will be much more difficult for providers to prove conformity in court proceedings and for judges to define the objective standard for conformity.

It is also a significant change that any lack of conformity detected by a consumer within one year, instead of six months, as of the date of performance is to be deemed to have existed at the time of performance.

This also means that, during this one-year period, the burden of proof is placed on the provider.

Information obligation A provider must inform its consumers of updates that are necessary to maintain the conformity of the goods and services with which it provides them.

Consumers must be given clear and comprehensive information regarding any modifications made to the digital content or digital service in order to maintain conformity during the time set out in the contract.

Payment with personal data The new provisions explicitly state that the stricter warranty provisions and information obligations apply even if – in lieu of payment – the consumer gives the provider personal data which can also be also used for purposes other than performing the contract.

This constitutes recognition of the concept of payment with personal data.

However, the new provisions leave some questions as to whether the information regarding the 14-day rescission right is applicable to contracts in which a consumer “pays” with personal data."
Noerr,A pay-out of dividends to shareholders after the profit was carried forward can be contested in insolvency proceedings,"Contesting a debtor’s transactions in insolvency proceedings is the key tool for the insolvency administrator to increase the debtor’s estate for the benefit of its creditors.

The interpretation of the rules of insolvency claw back in the German Insolvency Code ( Insolvenzordnung ) is therefore of great practical importance especially, but not only, for shareholders, as shown by the ruling of Germany’s Federal Court of Justice on 22 July 2021 (IX ZR 195/20) discussed here.

Interpretation of “Legal acts economically corresponding to a shareholder loan” Payments made to shareholders to redeem shareholder loans or restitution claims resulting from legal acts corresponding economically to a loan have a high risk of being contested by the insolvency administrator.

Payments the debtor made in the year before filing for commencement of insolvency proceedings to satisfy such claims can be contested in any event (section 135(1) no. 2 German Insolvency Code).

The same applies to collateral security provided to secure such claims in the last ten years before filing for insolvency (section 135(1) no.

1 German Insolvency Code).

It is often unclear what legal acts “correspond economically” to such a loan.

Especially if profits are paid out to shareholders which were not generated in the immediately preceding financial year, it remained unclear for some time whether those provisionally retained profits were the equivalent of a shareholder loan.

Schleswig Higher Regional Court (ruling of 8 February 2017 – 9 U 84/16) found that the rules protecting a company’s share capital under sections 30 and 31 German Limited Companies Act ( Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung ) prevented the corresponding application of the insolvency claw back rules regarding shareholder loans in the case of equity dividends.

In 2013, Koblenz Higher Regional Court argued in favour of a classification as a claim equivalent to a loan (ruling of 15 October 2013 – 3 U 635/13) and thus argued that repayments could be subject to insolvency claw back based on section 135 German Insolvency Code.

Federal Court of Justice creates legal clarity on distribution of retained profits In the ruling discussed here, the Federal Court of Justice sided with Koblenz Higher Regional Court.

In the case at hand, the sole shareholder of the debtor company decided in 2009 to carry forward the profit made in the financial year 2008 to new account.

A few months later, the shareholder made the amending shareholder resolution to distribute part of that profit and had the amount paid out to him.

When insolvency proceedings were initiated shortly afterwards, the company’s insolvency administrator requested the shareholder to repay the distributed profits.

The insolvency administrator now prevailed before the Federal Court of Justice, as in the lower court instances.

Profit carried forward is a “funding decision for the benefit of the company”

In the opinion of the Ninth Division of the Federal Court of Justice, a shareholder makes a funding decision for the benefit of the company when adopting a resolution not to distribute profits but to carry it forward to new account.

As in case of a loan, the company is given a capital value for temporary use, which the sole shareholder can have distributed anytime via an amending resolution, the Court said.

If this pay out scenario were not subject to claw back, the Court said, section 39(1) sentence 1 no. 5 and section 135(1) no.

2 German Insolvency Code could be circumvented by choosing a legal structure.

In accounting terms carrying forward profits is company equity, whereas a shareholder loan is debt capital.

However, section 39(1) sentence 1 no. 5 and section 135(1) no. 

2 German Insolvency Code are not limited to debt capital."
Noerr,A pay-out of dividends to shareholders after the profit was carried forward can be contested in insolvency proceedings,"However, section 39(1) sentence 1 no. 5 and section 135(1) no. 

2 German Insolvency Code are not limited to debt capital.

Rather, what is decisive is that the shareholders procure or leave their company a sum of money which, without their actions, would not otherwise be available as part of the company’s assets and so the company obtains additional funds.

The Court noted that this was also the case for a legal or de facto deferral of the shareholder’s claim against the company.

No claw back in the case of “forced deferral” However, the retention of dividends is not comparable to a shareholder loan if that retention is based on forced deferral.

Although not relevant to the case at hand, the Federal Court of Justice gives the example of major losses occurring after the balance sheet date, but before a resolution is passed on how to treat the company’s profits.

The shareholder is prevented by the capital retention rules from distributing the profits if the necessary assets to retain the ordinary share capital would otherwise be exhausted (section 30(1) sentence 1 German Limited Liability Companies Act).

In such a case, the shareholder does not voluntarily decide to retain the profit.

Classification and assessment of the ruling Consistent continuation of previous Federal Court of Justice case law The ruling is no surprise.

It continues the consistently creditor-friendly interpretation of claw back criteria in the case law of the highest German civil court.

The Court’s comments on capital retention make it clear that carrying forward profits is only equivalent to a shareholder loan if, at the time of the resolution, there was not yet any capital impairment, in other words, if the shareholders are free to distribute or retain profit.

The ruling appears to be transferrable to releasing and distributing voluntarily created profit reserves as well.

The Federal Court of Justice does not go into detail on the situation in which a shareholder cannot control the appropriation of profits alone.

If minority shareholders have voted against the retention, there are good arguments to suggest that they have not made a funding decision for the benefit of the company and that a subsequent distribution to them cannot be clawed back under section 135(1) no. 2 German Insolvency Code.

Consequences for the funding practice In light of this ruling, from an insolvency law perspective the retention of profits has no clear advantage compared to distribution and subsequent issuing of a shareholder loan.

That is at least true for shareholders who control the decision on retention and thus make a funding decision.

However, subject to tax considerations, distribution and a subsequent loan to the company as needed will be preferable as this offers more flexibility.

One advantage of the loan in terms of insolvency claw back law could arise in certain cases where the loan agreement is subject to a law other than German law, i.e. a law which is less claw back-friendly.

Thus, in certain circumstances, and provided that the choice-of-law clause in the loan agreement does not constitute a circumvention, Article 16 European Insolvency Regulation and section 339 German Insolvency Code open up the defence for shareholders against a claw back claim that the repayment would not be subject to claw back or otherwise challengeable under the applicable foreign law, unlike under German insolvency law.

Impact on M&A transactions The decision of the Federal Court of Justice also affects shareholder loans in connection with M&A transactions.

If the seller has granted a shareholder loan to the subsidiary to be sold in the past, the seller will be keen to minimise his claw back risk concerning the shareholder loan and any repayment made to the buyer after closing.

This risk has existed in principle since the decision of the Federal Court of Justice of 21 February 2013 (IX ZR 32/12)."
Noerr,A pay-out of dividends to shareholders after the profit was carried forward can be contested in insolvency proceedings,"This risk has existed in principle since the decision of the Federal Court of Justice of 21 February 2013 (IX ZR 32/12).

In the past, one of the options discussed to minimise the seller’s risk was for the selling shareholder to contribute the loan repayment claim to the company’s free capital reserve.

However, it must now be assumed that under the conditions set out by the Federal Court of Justice this also constitutes a financing decision for the benefit of the company and that the contribution to the free capital reserve corresponds economically to the shareholder loan granted by the seller.

Accordingly, releasing and distributing the reserve later might be subject to claw back not only against the receiving buyer but also against the seller.

In order to avoid the risk from the seller’s point of view, other recognised options regarding recommendable transaction structures would need to be considered.

Depending on the circumstances at hand, one solution might be to dissolve and distribute the contribution immediately after it has been made, so that there is no financing on the part of the shareholder.

However, this must be examined in each individual case.

In doing so, it must also be taken into account that distributions made during the ongoing financial year may have certain tax drawbacks.

Noerr,Update: Pension funds – New opportunities for partial turnarounds since 1 January 2022,"In a press release on 21 January 2022, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) announced that the pension fund for tax professionals, Deutsche Steuerberater-Versicherung – Pensionskasse des steuerberatenden Berufs VVaG, had lost its licence to operate an insurance business.

This comes around one year after two other pension funds, Kölner Pensionskasse VVaG and Pensionskasse der Caritas VVaG, lost their licences.

Situation in pension funds and supervisory measures by BaFin Low interest rates are putting pension funds ( Pensionskassen ) under huge pressure, as we previously reported .

Today, some pension funds are often no longer able to meet high guarantee commitments made in the past.

A considerable number of pension funds are therefore subject to enhanced supervision, according to the BaFin communiqué.

BaFin’s supervision toolkit has a broad range of tools, from ordering more frequent reporting by occupational pension funds requesting a turnaround and funding plan ordering benefits to be reduced in existing pension plans or even ordering the closure of certain insurance schemes to revoking the fund’s licence to operate an insurance business.

That means the pension fund can continue to handle its existing insurance policies, but cannot conclude any more new business.

Of course, this may greatly reduce pension funds’ room for manoeuvre in a potential turnaround scenario.

Risk and possible courses of action for pension funds The pension fund for tax consulting professionals had its licence to operate an insurance business revoked because it could no longer fulfil the minimum capital requirements.

BaFin did not consider the turnaround and financing plan presented to be sufficient.

If a pension fund runs into financial difficulties, it is not only BaFin that has tools available; the funds themselves can proactively anticipate any supervisory measures that BaFin might take.

A pension fund can generally counteract negative financial trends with the following measures: Amending insurance terms in accordance with the statutes (section 197 German Insurance Companies Supervision Act (VAG))

Reducing benefits in accordance with the statutes (section 179 German Insurance Companies Supervision Act) Adapting the (general and special) T&C or adjusting premiums (sections 163 and 164 German Insurance Policy Act (VVG))

Levying extra charges or additional contributions Transferring portfolios As of 1 January 2022 there is also the option of partial turnaround of a pension fund.

The legislator has acknowledged the precarious situation of many pension funds due to the current low interest rates.

It has created the option in the form of section 234(7) German Insurance Companies Supervision Act to turn around a pension fund supported by several companies, even if the turnaround plan is only supported by some of the member companies.

Partial turnaround of the fund Specifically, section 234(7) German Insurance Companies Supervision Act allows insurers to adjust statutory rules even for existing insurance policies in order to create the basis for a partial turnaround of the pension fund.

This type of partial turnaround is to be facilitated if: i. the actuarial reserve has to be increased because the basis for calculation needs to be adjusted due to an unpredictable, not merely temporary change in circumstances and ii. insurance claims from the implementation of occupational pensions which an employer is still responsible for under section 1(1) s. 3 German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG), (a) account for a share of at least 75% of the actuarial reserve to be increased and (b) at least two thirds of that share is attributable to insurance claims for which employers or third parties have agreed to provide the pension fund with the necessary funding so it can fully fund the increase in the actuarial reserve, at least for those insurance claims."
Noerr,Update: Pension funds – New opportunities for partial turnarounds since 1 January 2022,"In other words, a partial turnaround can be facilitated if unpredictable and not merely temporary events require an increase in the actuarial reserve and at least two thirds of the entire actuarial reserve is attributable to the companies supporting the turnaround.

In the event of impending financial difficulties, pension fund executives should review early on the various options for turnaround, and now especially partial turnaround, to avoid disadvantages for the pension fund itself as well as the associated member companies.

Risk and possible courses of action for employers Revoking a pension funds licence to operate an insurance business means for employers that they can no longer register their employees with the relevant pension fund.

Employers then have to revise their existing pension schemes and in future run the occupational pension via a different pension fund operator.

If certain pension fund operators are specified in a collective agreement or company agreement, then these rules ought to be adapted together with the relevant negotiation partners.

Employers should find out about the current situation of the pension fund they use and participate within their statutory rights in order to be informed in good time and not be surprised by a pension fund’s financial difficulties.

If benefits are to be reduced, employers are generally required to make up the shortfall for their beneficiary employees under section 1(1) s. 3 German Occupational Pensions Act.

That means employers have to make up for any benefit cuts by pension funds out of their own pocket, even if employers have always correctly transferred the premiums.

Due to the burdensome duty to make up the shortfall (actuarial analyses, creating a reserve, potentially adjusting indices and possible legal disputes with pension beneficiaries) and the resulting impact on employers’ assets, turning around a pension fund can be preferable for employers too.

Alternatively, employers can of course also consider reorganising their pension schemes to avoid or reduce financial drawbacks.

Reason enough for businesses to take a closer look at their existing occupational pension schemes."
Noerr,Private enforcement in data privacy law,"With court cases and judgements on claims for non-material damages under data privacy law on the rise, companies have never before run such a high risk of facing civil actions from persons affected by data privacy breaches.

This trend is being exacerbated by media reports raising public awareness of possible data privacy breaches.

Recently, for example, there were reports of a security loophole at an interface service provider [in German] , which apparently led to the data of 700,000 customers of online retailers being made freely available on the internet.

The legal and actual developments make it likely that in the future companies will face more and more claims for damages, including even class actions.

Private enforcement is increasingly supplementing public enforcement of data privacy law by data protection supervisory authorities, giving it even more weight as a compliance issue.

Context Under Article 82(1) GDPR, any person who has suffered non-material damage as a result of an infringement of data privacy has the right to claim damages.

The highest German courts have not yet decided when non-material damages exist and what amount of compensation is due.

Since EU law is the basis for the claim, it must be interpreted in line with EU law.

The case law on other non-material claims for damages in German law is therefore not directly transferrable.

After the GDPR came into force, unresolved legal issues and the traditionally restrictive attitude of German courts to non-material damage meant that claims for damages for data privacy breaches were rarely enforced in the past.

Change of course in the case law However, in early 2021, Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court overrode certain arguments used by courts to easily reject claims for damages for data privacy breaches.

Subsequently, the decisions handed down by German courts have become increasingly claimant-friendly.

Rulings awarding sums of damages of up to €5,000 per claim have encouraged more and more people to seek damages following data privacy breaches.

To clarify unresolved legal issues about “non-material damage” within the meaning of Article 82 GDPR, several questions submitted by German courts are pending at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) (see examples here and here ).

The expected clarifying decisions by the CJEU have the potential to kick off a mass filing of claims for damages for data privacy breaches.

Private enforcement in data privacy – Hot topic for an increasingly professionalised claimant industry Legal services providers have also caught wind of a lucrative new business model.

Data privacy breaches often affect a large number of people equally.

Since courts are now already awarding four-figure sums to individuals for fairly minor infringements, the players in an increasingly professionalised claimant industry hope to be able to file very large collective claims for damages.

Legal services providers hope to build on their experience in other class actions such as cartel damages, the diesel emissions issue or the “cancellation argument” in consumer loan agreements.

They are currently trying to litigate individual cases and obtain decisions in their favour from the highest German courts.

The new class action models make the risk to companies even greater.

Current case law in Germany at a glance Given the large number of court cases, it’s not easy to maintain a full overview of the various positions taken by the courts.

Even so, there are certain lines and factions in court practice that are increasingly becoming apparent on the following key topics.

Recent decisions on the merits of claims Many recent decisions by German courts show a very broad understanding of damage eligible for compensation.

For example, discrimination, identity theft or fraud , reputational damage or loss of control over personal data have been recognised as non-material damage."
Noerr,Private enforcement in data privacy law,"For example, discrimination, identity theft or fraud , reputational damage or loss of control over personal data have been recognised as non-material damage.

The courts have ruled that liability for minor losses is not excluded.

If the CJEU confirms this broad concept, many data privacy breaches would give rise to non-material claims for damages.

When there is a data leak, for example, those affected may feel uneasy, anxious or insecure, even without any actual misuse of the data by third parties.

Companies might then potentially face mass actions for damages.

Recent decisions on the amount of compensation As far as calculating the amount of compensation is concerned, the courts broadly agree that such compensation has to be complete and effective .

The courts that also refer to a necessary deterrent function arrive at fairly high sums of compensation.

It remains to be seen whether this approach ultimately prevails.

We believe that there are solid arguments to be raised against this approach.

After all, in data privacy law, penalties under public law exist alongside private enforcement via claims for damages under civil law.

The public-law fines already serve to punish companies for unlawful conduct.

So the purpose of the civil-law claim can only be to compensate for damage that has actually occurred.

Conclusion Given the recent developments set out above, it is increasingly important for companies to acknowledge and face the challenges, opportunities and threats of data protection litigation, early on and strategically.

The focus here must be on data privacy law, which at the same time serves as the interface to other areas, especially the relevant procedural and litigation laws.

In defending against civil-law class actions, it is also essential to seamlessly combine data privacy and litigation expertise.

With our outstanding experience in handling mass proceedings, our seasoned teams of recognised data privacy and litigation experts can support you on this path."
Noerr,Romania: Reintroduction of technical unemployment allowance,"The Romanian Government Emergency Ordinance no.

2/2022 on the establishment of social protection measures for employees and other professional categories in the context of the prohibition, suspension or limitation of economic activities caused by the epidemiological situation generated by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as well as amending and supplementing certain normative acts (“ GEO 2/2022 ”) was published in the Official Gazette no.

61 on 20 January 2022.

According to the provisions of GEO 2/2022, the possibility of granting of the “ technical unemployment allowance ” is reinstated, starting on 20 January 2022 and until 31 March 2022, for periods during which employment contracts are temporarily suspended at the employer’s initiative according to Article 52(1)(c) of the Romanian Labour Code as a result of the effects of the coronavirus.

I. Value of the technical unemployment allowance The allowances to which employees are entitled are to be set at 75% of their base salary corresponding to the position held by them and are funded by the unemployment insurance budget, but may not to exceed 75% of the average gross salary provided by the Law no. 318/2021 on the social insurance budget for the year 2022 (approximately RON 4,571).

The allowance is granted and calculated according to the number of days on which the company’s activities were suspended, but no later than 31 March 2022.

II.

Beneficiaries of the technical unemployment allowance The following categories of employees benefit from this state support: employees of employers who had their activities temporarily reduced or interrupted due to the implementation of measures specific for risk impact during the current state of alert, and employees of employers who had their activities suspended due to an epidemiological investigation carried out by the county public health directorates, except for employees who are on medical leave and receive the relevant allowance.

Employees of the following employers will not receive the technical unemployment allowance: public institutions and authorities, and employers who are in bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation proceedings on the date when a request for granting of these amounts is made, or who have their activities suspended or upon whom restrictions are imposed for reasons other than those generated by the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

III.

Conclusion GEO 2/2022 establishes the possibility for employers to pay both the technical unemployment allowance and the allowance for Kurzarbeit.

These measures can be granted either for different employees at the same time of the month or for the same employees but for different periods of the month."
Noerr,Identification of shortcomings in the battle against money laundering by the Council of Europe,"Last week, the Council of Europe published a monitoring report on the implementation of the obligation in Article 10 of the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism of 16 May 2005 ( 1680a53db0 (coe.int) ) in the various signatory states (“Report”).

According to Article 10 of Council of Europe Convention No 198 ( CETS 198 - Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism (coe.int) ) (“Convention”), signatory states are required to ensure the accountability of legal entities when acts of money laundering have been committed by or for the benefit of their executive bodies or officers.

According to the findings of the report, although 35 of the 36 states have adopted regulations on the liability of legal entities, only 17 have fully complied with the obligation under Article 10 of the Convention.

Germany is one of the states which has not fully implemented the Convention.

Although German law does not permit the criminal punishment of legal entities, fines can be imposed on legal entities and partnerships under section 30 of the German Regulatory Offences Act ( Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz ) if executive bodies, employees or supervisors in a managerial function have committed criminal offences or regulatory offences.

In addition, section 130 of the German Regulatory Offences Act provides that members of the management bodies of legal entities and managing directors of partnerships may be punished if they have failed to prevent or significantly impede the commission of criminal offences or regulatory offences by employees or for the benefit of the company through proper organisation and supervision.

However, the Council of Europe doubts whether these provisions fully meet the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention.

The Report particularly criticises that whether and which sanctions are imposed on legal entities and partnerships is at the discretion of the prosecution authorities and that there are no guidelines on the use of such discretion.

This shortcoming in the application of section 30 of the German Regulatory Offences Act was also recognised by the legislators some time ago.

The German Corporate Sanctions Bill (“ Verbandssanktionsgesetz ”), which was not passed in the last legislative period, therefore provided for the introduction of the principle of legality and thus a compulsory investigation.

Companies in the credit, finance and insurance industries as well as certain non-financial companies have to maintain comprehensive money laundering compliance systems.

In Germany, unlike in other EU members states, even traders in goods are subject to obligations under money laundering law.

In order to comply with these, at least a “pared-down” money laundering compliance system is required.

This is also the case if traders in goods have implemented a ban on accepting or making cash payments of €10,000 or more.

If managing directors recognise that a required money laundering compliance system is missing or has shortcomings and they either remain inactive or do not take appropriate steps to remedy the shortcomings, this constitutes grounds for an accusation of wilful conduct, according to a ruling by the Frankfurt am Main Higher Regional Court, and can thus not only be grounds for imposing a corporate fine, but can also lead to civil liability of the managing directors.

Companies would therefore do well to regularly check the suitability of their money laundering compliance systems and adjust them if necessary.

It remains to be seen whether companies will in future also need to comply with the requirements for combating money laundering by the introduction of the principle of legality for breaches of the law attributable to companies in the context of money laundering prevention."
Noerr,Identification of shortcomings in the battle against money laundering by the Council of Europe,"In any case, the proponents of the German Corporate Sanctions Bill are likely to refer to the Report as evidence of the need to tighten sanctions law for companies."
Noerr,Consultation on the EU Listing Act,"On 19 November 2021, the European Commission launched two rounds of consultation on the EU Listing Act , which is to be enacted in the third quarter of this year.

The aim of the consultations is to gather information on regulatory obstacles to company listing in the EU.

The EU Listing Act is intended to facilitate access to the capital markets, especially for SMEs.

I. Background to the EU Listing Act The background to the planned EU Listing Act is that the Commission believes European capital markets still have room for improvement, especially compared to other international markets.

EU companies make less use of capital markets for debt and equity financing than companies in other leading economies, according to the Commission.

This has a negative impact on economic growth and macroeconomic resilience in the EU.

One key task of the Capital Markets Union is therefore to ensure that EU companies have access to capital market-based sources of finance at every stage of their development, including stock exchange listing in particular.

The benefits of listing include less dependence on bank financing, more diversity of investors, easier access to additional equity and debt capital (through secondary issuing), and a higher public profile and wider reputation.

A more balanced financing structure between traditional bank financing and capital market financing can make the real economy more resilient.

Access to capital market-based finance is therefore particularly important to support the recovery and help build a sustainable economy following the pandemic.

However, many companies, especially SMEs, currently have no access to the capital markets, which limits their choice of alternative financing options, the Commission said.

This makes them dependent on traditional sources of finance, which are limited especially in times of crisis.

Prior to the consultations, the Commission identified three main problem areas that will be examined in more detail during the consultations: 1.

Post-listing obligations and costs According to the Commission, many companies, especially SMEs, do not consider an EU listing affordable and are reluctant to go public due to the associated post-listing obligations and costs.

This limits the range of financing options for companies, especially SMEs, that wish to expand and grow.

The Commission also pointed out that the increasing emergence of alternative forms of IPO, such as the use of special purpose acquisition companies (“ SPACs ”), which could represent an interesting financing opportunity for scale-up and start-up companies, could therefore also be interpreted as a response to the challenges typically faced by issuers in the European capital markets.

Although IPOs via SPACs are still less common in the EU than in some other jurisdictions, the EU needs to consider whether the existing rules for companies/investors are appropriate to promote the opportunities SPACs could offer and provide adequate safeguards in this context.

2. Regulatory flexibility Regulatory flexibility is also insufficient, the Commission said.

For example, company owners do not have the option of retaining control over their company after an IPO by issuing shares with multiple voting rights.

In addition, there is a lack of clarity in the relevant legislation regarding dual listing.

Such regulatory restrictions and uncertainties discourage some companies from using European capital markets and thus affect the attractiveness of the EU as a target destination for IPOs, also in a global context.

3.

Stock analysis and liquidity According to the Commission, SME securities are normally characterised by low liquidity, as these companies are perceived as unattractive by investors, especially institutional investors.

The limited liquidity can be explained by a number of factors, such as the lack of available stock analysis, especially for SMEs."
Noerr,Consultation on the EU Listing Act,"The limited liquidity can be explained by a number of factors, such as the lack of available stock analysis, especially for SMEs.

In addition, institutional investors may fear risk to their reputation if they invest in companies listed on multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), including SME growth markets, as there are no minimum corporate governance requirements for issuers at these trading venues.

II.

Aims of the EU Listing Act The EU Listing Act is intended to address the above problems.

According to the Commission, the main aim of the EU Listing Act is to ensure unhindered capital market access for all companies in the EU, in particular for SMEs, i.e. companies that employ fewer than 250 people and have a turnover of no more than €50 million and/or total assets of no more than €43 million.

It is therefore worth reviewing whether the rules for a stock exchange listing could be further simplified, how access to the capital markets can be improved for companies in the EU and how the primary and secondary markets work in the EU.

In addition, the Technical Expert Stakeholder Group (TESG), already set up by the Commission in October 2020, should monitor the functioning and success of SME growth markets, the Commission added.

Ultimately, the EU Listing Act thus aims to enable issuers within the EU to access and use the capital markets by simplifying and easing the requirements for listing and ongoing listing, partly by reducing costs and increasing legal certainty for issuers; removing regulatory restrictions; and increasing the visibility of SMEs to investors and improving their attractiveness to give them the opportunity to finance their business, to grow and to create jobs.

At the same time, it also aims to ensure a high level of investor protection and market integrity.

The Commission wishes to achieve these aims by making targeted amendments to the existing provisions in several EU legal acts (e.g. Prospectus Regulation, Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), MiFID II and Listing Directive), e.g. by simplifying (i) the documentation obligations for an IPO, (ii) the conditions for deferring the disclosure of inside information and (iii) the market testing rules; and introducing new provisions, e.g. on shares with multiple voting rights and simplified corporate governance standards for SMEs.

III.

Possible content of the EU Listing Act A glance at the two ongoing rounds of consultation already provides an idea of the sources of law the Commission thinks need to be reformed: The open public consultation includes seven general questions on the functioning of the EU regulatory framework, in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the existing regulatory framework and on the factors responsible for the lack of attractiveness of European capital markets.

The targeted technical consultation includes over 100 additional questions on technical topics and is aimed at capital market practitioners, competent authorities and academics.

It addresses, above all, possible changes to the Prospectus Regulation, the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), MiFID II, company law and the Listing Directive.

The aim is to identify the most burdensome requirements and discuss how these could be reduced without compromising market integrity and the general transparency regime.

In the context of the targeted technical consultation, the following legal sources and topics are addressed in particular: Prospectus Regulation:"
Noerr,Consultation on the EU Listing Act,"In the context of the targeted technical consultation, the following legal sources and topics are addressed in particular: Prospectus Regulation:

Possible simplifications of prospectus drafting (especially content requirements, exemptions, format and language), secondary issuing, liability regime, review and approval of the prospectus, uniform registration form; Market Abuse Regulation: Scope of application, definition of inside information and clarification of plans for deferral of disclosure of inside information, facilitations for issuers of debt securities, managers’ own dealings, insider lists, simplifications for market testing, penalties, liquidity agreements, transparency of investment recommendations; MiFID II: Registering MTFs as an SME growth market, dual listing, stock analysis of SMEs; Transparency Directive: Simplification of the rules on regular publication and publication of investments; SPAC: Suitability of the current legal framework for SPACs and creation of special rules; Listing Directive: definitions, conditions for listing, competent authorities; Company law: Multiple voting rights and corporate governance standards for SMEs.

It is notable that the Commission also raises questions about the “gold-plating” of EU legal acts by the Member States, i.e. the over-fulfilment of minimum harmonising EU legal acts by the EU Member States by means of stricter regulations.

This could indicate that the Commission might also envisage a stronger full harmonisation of European capital markets law to avoid stricter national regulations as well as divergences in the rules between the various EU Member States.

III.

Procedure and status of the legislative process The Commission’s consultation process will run until 11 February 2022, after which the results of the consultations will be summarised in a report and further details will be decided on.

An initial proposal for the EU Listing Act is currently planned for September 2022.

We will keep you informed about the outcome of the consultations and the further legislative process for the EU Listing Act."
Noerr,Hungary: Sanctions against the European Parliament for data transfers that violated “Schrems II”,"The European Data Protection Supervisor (“ EDPS ”) has issued a decision after a complaint was filed against the European Parliament (“ Parliament ”) due to unlawful data transfer to the US, a deceptive cookie banner and unclear data protection notices.

The Parliament entrusted a service provider to set up a website regarding Covid testing.

This website used Stripe and Google Analytics cookies to gather data which are considered as personal data.

The cookies were transferred to the US, since both companies are located in the US.

The EDPS emphasized in its decision that “ data transfers to the US can only take place if they are framed by effective supplementary measures in order to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection for the personal data transferred ”.

Since the Parliament did not provide any documentation or evidence regarding an equivalent level of protection, the EDPS came to the conclusion that the requirements placed on data transfer to the US were not met.

The EDPS confirmed the violation of data protection laws on the grounds indicated in the complaint.

Accordingly, the EDPS issued a reprimand and ordered the Parliament to comply with the relevant laws."
Noerr,Romania: New Covid measures adopted by the Romanian government,"A new Government Decision no. 34/2022 on the extension of the “state of alert” ( stare de alertă ) was published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, no.

34 on 6 January 2022.

Through the above decision, the Government has extended the state of alert for another 30 days, starting with on 8 January 2022 and adopted new protective measures.

These measures will impact the labour market, especially with regard to the reorganisation of employers’ activities, and impose new obligations on employers.

I. Teleworking and working from home The above Government Decision expressly provides that employers have to arrange for at least 50% of employees to work from home or do teleworking, where the specific nature of their activities allows it, under the conditions set out in the Labour Code.

Furthermore, if the activities cannot be carried out from home or by teleworking, i.e. if the above obligation cannot be met from an objective perspective, employers with more than 50 employees have to organise their working hours on a flexitime basis, with staggered hours starting at 7.30 am and 10.00 am or divided into groups/shifts.

II.

Private office buildings Starting on 8 January 2022, economic operators functioning in private office buildings where 50 or more persons work simultaneously are to no longer allow access to visitors/clients, unless they: prove that they have been vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 10 days have passed since the full vaccination scheme was completed; present a negative result for a RT-PCR test performed in the last 72 hours; present a negative result for an antigen test performed in the last 48 hours; or are between the 15th and 180th day since an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed.

III.

Employers have to consider the degree of vaccination at the workplace A new rule has been introduced by Government Decision no.

34/2022 stating that  workplace activities must be organised in compliance with the legal provisions issued by the competent authorities designed to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (as is currently the case), although employers are also now obliged to determine: the degree of vaccination attested by the certificate of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus presented by employees for which 10 days have passed since completion of the full vaccination scheme; how many employees are between the 15th and the 180th day after confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and who hold and present to the employer a certificate issued by their GP ( medicul de familie ).

During the state of alert, employers have to review the organisation of employees’ workplaces in order to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

This means that employers could, for example, take social distancing measures or, if this is not possible, increase the frequency of tests for employees.

Furthermore, it is advisable for employers to introduce new internal procedures in order to comply with the requirements provided for in Annex 3 to Government Decision no. 34/2022.

IV.

Further recommendations Government Decision no.

34/2022 establishes a general obligation for employers to organise the workplace also based on/considering the degree of vaccination of employees at the workplace, without specifying in which way this organisation is to take place.

In other words, employers are obliged to be aware of the degree of vaccination or prior infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have to consider these aspects when organising and planning their activities.

Given the rather general character of the above provisions, employers are encouraged to assess their workplace on a case-by-case basis, while trying to identify and document what protection measures ultimately ensure compliance with the latest legal requirements."
Noerr,The new German Telecommunications Act: How does customer protection change?,"A fully modernised Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG ) has come into force on 1 December 2021.

It implements the requirements of the European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972).

The new TKG contains numerous changes and new features, especially on customer protection – some of which are unusual (e.g. regulations on flat-rate compensation by providers), but support the full harmonisation of customer protection throughout the EU under telecommunications law, as intended by the EU legislator.

Main new regulations for customer protection In the following, we provide an overview of significant changes in the field of telecommunications customer protection.

New requirements to provide information when entering into contracts From now on, telecommunications providers are required to give residential customers (i.e. “consumers”) specific information on their rights under telecommunications law before consumers submit their declaration to enter into the contract (Sec. 55 (1) and (2) TKG).

In addition, before submitting their contract declaration, consumers must be provided with a clear and easily understandable summary of the service contract (Sec. 54 (3) TKG).

The European Commission has developed a template for this purpose (see here ).

After receiving the summary, consumers must approve the contract in writing to make it valid (Sec. 54 (3) sentences 4 and 5 TKG).

The aim is to protect consumers especially from entering into contracts too hastily over the phone.

Contract term, renewal and amendment Despite suggestions to do so, the legislator has not restricted the initial contract term, meaning that the term can still be up to 24 months.

However, the new TKG requires telecommunications providers from now on to also offer consumers a contract with a term of 12 months (Sec. 56 (1) sentences 1 and 2 TKG).

In addition, the new Act makes it harder for providers to automatically renew contracts and easier for consumers to cancel them.

Telecommunications providers have to inform end users in good time and comprehensively before a contract is tacitly renewed (Sec. 56 (3) sentence 2 TKG).

End users may now cancel contracts that have been tacitly renewed after the minimum term at any time with one month’s notice (Sec. 56 (3) sentence 1 TKG).

This means that automatic renewals laid down in the T&Cs, which only allow for cancellation of the contract after one year, are invalid.

Also, end users can cancel contracts without notice and at no cost if telecommunications providers change them unilaterally (Sec. 57 (1) sentence 1 TKG).

Contract amendments have to be communicated to end users at least one month in advance and a maximum of two months before the intended amendments come into effect.

Faults and flat-rate compensation The new TKG is also intended to create new regulatory incentives to expand network capacity: telecommunications providers now have to document all fault reports for consumers without undue delay (Sec. 

58 (2) sentence 1 TKG).

If the fault is not cleared within two calendar days of receiving the fault report, consumers can request flat-rate compensation for each day of complete downtime, starting from the following day, unless consumers are responsible for the fault or there is a case of force majeure.

The compensation on the third and fourth day is EUR 5 or 10%, and from the fifth day, EUR 10 or 20% of the monthly service fee (Sec. 58 (3) sentences 1 and 2 TKG).

Reduction or cancellation in case of slow internet access Consumers may now reduce the monthly fee or cancel the contract without notice if there is a significant, continuous or regularly recurring divergence in speed between the actual and contractually agreed performance (Sec. 57 (4) sentence 1 TKG).

The German regulator (Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA ) has defined specifically when such a divergence can be assumed (General Administrative Order No 99/2021 1; available in German here )."
Noerr,The new German Telecommunications Act: How does customer protection change?,"The German regulator (Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA ) has defined specifically when such a divergence can be assumed (General Administrative Order No 99/2021 1; available in German here ).

Since 13 December 2021, end users have been able to use a special tool provided by BNetzA to check their internet speed (see here , in German).

Missed customer service or installation appointments The new TKG also requires telecommunications providers to document agreements on customer service and installation appointments for consumers without delay in each case (Sec. 58 (2) sentence 1 TKG).

If providers miss one or more scheduled appointments, consumers can request compensation for each missed appointment of EUR 10 or 20% of the monthly service fee, unless the consumer is responsible for the missed appointment (Sec. 58 (4) TKG).

The aim of the legislation is to improve customer service in general.

Change of provider, moving house and flat-rate compensation While the new TKG essentially retains the requirement that former providers must ensure that end users’ service is not disrupted when they switch providers (Sec. 59 (2) sentence 1 TKG), in this case, too, the legislator now uses a flat-rate compensation: If a connection is interrupted for more than one working day, end users can demand compensation from former providers.

This amounts to EUR 10 for each additional working day of downtime or 20% of the monthly fee unless consumers are responsible for the delay (Sec. 59 (4) sentence 1 TKG).

When switching providers, end users are also entitled to flat-rate compensation if the former or new provider misses customer service or installation appointments (Sec. 59 (4) sentence 2 TKG).

Consumers’ rights on moving houses also remain unchanged.

If consumers move houses and want to continue their contract, providers have to provide the contractual service without changing the terms or content of the contract if they can provide their services at the new location (Sec. 

60 (1) sentence 1 TKG).

Otherwise, consumers can cancel the contract with one month’s notice (Sec. 60 (2) sentence 1 TKG).

Here again, the new TKG introduces flat-rate compensation if telecommunications service at the consumer’s new home is not activated on time (Sec. 60 (3) sentence 2 TKG).

Internet connection blocked for late payment If consumers are at least EUR 100 (previously EUR 75) in default with payment, providers can block their internet access after a written warning (Sec. 61 (4) sentences 1 and 2 TKG).

The same applies when there is reasonable suspicion of misuse (Sec. 61 (5) TKG).

The block must be limited to services affected by payment default or misuse (Sec. 61 (6) sentence 1 TKG) and may only be maintained for the duration of the reason for blocking (Sec. 61 (7) TKG).

In certain circumstances, providers still have to deliver a minimum level of broadband internet access services despite the block (Sec. 61 (6) sentence 2 TKG).

Conclusion The new TKG creates new regulatory requirements and changes existing requirements.

The amendments specifically strengthen the rights of end users and consumers in the field of customer protection, especially by introducing easier rights of cancellation and price reduction, stricter obligations to provide information and rights to flat-rate compensation.

The legislator has also transferred some especially practice-relevant aspects to the regulator for further specification.

All providers of telecommunications services (e.g. via OTT, satellite, landline, or mobile) are required to check what action they need to take to implement the new statutory requirements."
Noerr,Crypto Asset Transfer Regulation: Increasing regulation of crypto assets,"Not only is the crypto and blockchain sector developing dynamically, but the related regulations are as well: On 1 October 2021, the German Crypto Asset Transfer Regulation ( Kryptowertetransferverordnung – ” CATR “) issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance came into force.

The regulation intends to improve the traceability of the transfer of crypto assets .

To date, crypto assets could be transferred largely anonymously.

The legislator therefore assumes these transfers involve an increased risk of money laundering, terrorism funding and other criminal activities.

Context Regulating crypto assets has become the focus of both the German and European legislators.

Since the beginning of 2020 the provision of “crypto custody services” requires a German banking licence.

On the European level, the Commission submitted several legislative measure to combat money laundering , including a proposal for the revision of the European Wire Transfer Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/847 – “ WTR ”) in order to trace the transfer of crypto assets.

However, the European legislative plans are still in relatively early stages of implementation.

The CATR will therefore apply in Germany transitionally until revisions of the WTR come into force.

The CATR establishes duties of care for credit and financial services institutions which carry out crypto asset transfers.

The provisions of the regulation apply exclusively to German credit and financial services institutions as well as German branches and branch offices of foreign institutions.

Main obligations for financial institutions Central to the CATR is the term of “crypto asset service providers”.

As the definition of this term is quite extensive the regulation concerns all (banking) companies that enable trading in crypto assets in the broader sense.

The set of obligations these crypto asset service providers must fulfil depends on the extent financial institutions are involved in the transfer of crypto assets.

The regulation differentiates between transfers which involve crypto asset service providers on both sides and transfers that do not.

Crypto asset service providers involved on both sides If only crypto asset service providers act for both the payer and the beneficiary, key regulations of the WTR will apply mutatis mutandis .

The application of the WTR in Germany is extended to the transfer of crypto assets.

When transferring crypto assets, the payer’s crypto asset service provider must now in particular supply the beneficiary’s crypto asset service provider with details of the payer and beneficiary of the transfer – including the name, account number, address and number of an official ID document of the payer and the name and account number of the beneficiary; and verify the accuracy of the information on the payer on the basis of documents, data or information before carrying out a crypto asset transfer.

The beneficiary’s crypto asset service provider , on the other hand, must in particular establish effective procedures both to identify the absence of information on the payer or beneficiary and to verify the information; establish effective risk-based procedures to assess whether to carry out, reject or suspend a transaction and what follow-up action to take; and report suspicious transactions to the competent supervisory authority on certain conditions.

Non-exclusive involvement of crypto asset service providers If a transaction does not exclusively involve crypto asset service providers, for example because the transfer is from or to an unhosted wallet, the credit or financial services institution involved in the transaction must identify the risk of misuse of the transaction for the purposes of money laundering or terrorism funding; assess this risk; and take corresponding “ risk-appropriate measures ”.

This also includes ensuring compliance with (financial) sanctions and embargoes."
Noerr,Crypto Asset Transfer Regulation: Increasing regulation of crypto assets,"This also includes ensuring compliance with (financial) sanctions and embargoes.

Because these measures are intended in particular to ensure the traceability of the transfer, financial services institutions must collect, store and verify the name and address of the person involved in the transaction on the other side.

Transitional arrangement Given the rapid introduction of the CATR, crypto asset service providers have been able to obtain a suspension of the obligations for up to 12 months for reasons they are not responsible for (e.g. lack of technical standards for data transfer) by notifying the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht – “ BaFin ”) as the competent supervisory authority.

This required a notification to BaFin by 30 November 2021, which then had to be substantiated by 31 December 2021.

However, if the crypto asset service provider only begins its crypto asset activities after the CATR came into force (1 October 2021), such notification and substantiation only have to take place when the activity begins .

Companies can fill out the form provided by BaFin on its website since 23 November 2021 and send it to the dedicated email address (kryptowtv@bafin.de).

The substantiation must state the reason for the impediment, its likely duration (12 months maximum) and the measures that will be taken to eliminate it.

Providers must also indicate what measures will be used to control the risk in the meantime (such as the use of blockchain analysis tools).

Outlook

In introducing the CATR, the German legislator has made great strides in further regulating crypto assets, although corresponding legislative procedures are still underway at EU level.

In doing so, the legislator has only responded to a small extent to the criticism widely voiced during the legislative process (see for example the statement by Bitkom , which especially fears major competitive disadvantages for German service providers and fragmentation of the EU market).

While criminals will likely still be able to remain anonymous when transferring crypto assets despite the new rules, the CATR significantly tightens the regulatory burden for financial institutions which offer crypto asset transfers for their clients.

The CATR will no longer apply once the WTR also covers crypto asset transfers in addition to money transfers.

While this is to be expected given the ongoing legislative process, it could still take about two years due to the involvement of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.

Firstly, companies concerned with the transfer of crypto assets should develop the necessary mechanisms and control procedures in order to comply with the legal obligations.

Secondly, they should keep a close eye on the highly dynamic regulatory environment in the crypto and blockchain sector.

This applies, for example, to the European legislative procedures on the Regulation on Markets in Crypto assets (MiCA) and the Regulation on a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology .

Further, the new German government’s coalition agreement advocates both for a common European regulation of crypto and blockchain technologies and also the use of such technologies."
Noerr,Czech Republic: A look back at important court decisions in 2021,"We would like to present to you a summary of the most important court decisions regarding employment law handed down in 2021.

1.

Equal pay for equal work must be guaranteed (regardless of whether in Prague or in Olomouc)

The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic confirmed that it is inadmissible to pay different wages to employees performing the same work for the same employer but in different regions.

Specifically, the dispute concerned the fact that a driver for the Czech Post in Olomouc was paid less than a driver performing an equivalent job in Prague.

The Czech Post argued that the difference in wages between employees with equivalent jobs is due to factors that include higher costs of living.

Since costs of living are higher in Prague, a driver in Prague should have a higher wage, according to the Czech Post.

The Constitutional Court stated that such reasoning is inadmissible and the remuneration for equal work of equal value must be equal regardless of workplace.

(Decision of the Constitutional Court, dated 31 August 2021, file No. I. ÚS 2820/20) 2.

Employers may validly withdraw from a non-compete clause without stipulating any reason The Constitutional Court concluded that an employer may withdraw from an agreed non-compete clause even without stipulating any reason if this possibility was agreed between the parties.

Such practice was inadmissible until the issuance of this decision.

An employer and an employee concluded a non-compete clause.

The employee was obliged to refrain from certain gainful activity for six months following the termination of his employment and was entitled to half of his remuneration for such restriction.

The employee resigned.

The employer withdrew from the non-compete clause several days before the expiry of the termination notice period without stipulating any reason.

Until the issuance of this decision, such withdrawal was ineffective.

The Constitutional Court reconsidered this practice and stated that it is possible for an employer to validly withdraw from a non-compete clause in this manner depending on the particular circumstances of the relevant case.

However, the withdrawal should not be arbitrary or constitute an abuse of the employer's rights against the employee (e.g. withdrawal just before the end of the employment relationship, even though the employer could have done so at any earlier time).

(Decision of the Constitutional Court, dated 21 May 2021, file No. II ÚS 1889/19) 3.

Only employers are liable for damage caused by employees The Supreme Court of the Czech Republic decided that employers have sole liability for damage caused by employees while performing their work.

However, this applies only if the employees have not acted excessively while performing their work.

In the given case, the employee, acting on the instructions of his employer, unlawfully dismantled and removed a customer’s kitchen equipment.

This conduct caused damage to the customer.

The customer sued both the employer and the employee.

The Supreme Court has held that if the employee does not deviate from the limits of the employer's instructions in performing his work (i.e. if the employee does not act excessively), he cannot be obliged to compensate the plaintiff for damage.

In such a case, only the employer is obliged to pay damages.

(Decision of the Supreme Court, dated 26 October 2021, file No. 25 Cdo 1029/2021) 4.

When to reimburse employees for stand-by time The Constitutional Court stated that if an employee remains at the employer's disposal during a break (for a meal or rest break) (e.g. he is always ready to work as a firefighter at the airport), then such breaks must be paid."
Noerr,Czech Republic: A look back at important court decisions in 2021,"In addition, the CJEU decided in another case that stand-by time during which an employee performs other self-employed professional work with the consent of his employer, but must often be ready to work within ten minutes if called, does not constitute “working time” and thus does not require remuneration.

The CJEU further stated that the possibility to engage in other gainful activity during stand-by time is an important indicator that the terms of the stand-by time do not impose significant restrictions on the employee that have a very significant impact on the way in which the employee manages his time.

ÚS 1854/20)

In closing: This is just a short summary of a selection of the most important employment case law from 2021.

If you are interested in other topics, we would be happy to talk about them as well.

Some of the topics that are still being addressed in the current situation include regulations regarding working from home, determination of annual leave, flex time accounts, compulsory vaccination of employees, obligation of statutory board members to act with due care."
Noerr,Czech Republic: New investment incentives rules aim to support technological start-ups,"The government of the Czech Republic has approved a new decree concerning investment incentives.

The new rules should bring significant changes not only for large investors, but also for small and medium-sized technology companies, which will now also be able to access direct financial support.

The new rules will take effect as of 1 January 2022.

The Czech Republic has become an economy that is highly oriented towards industry, but with low added value.

In the 1990s, the Czech government supported the model of maximizing the workforce, when the state attracted manufacturing companies to the Czech Republic which were intended to employ as many people as possible.

However, this model has become inefficient against the backdrop of the modern economy.

Therefore, the Czech government aims to provide subsidies to domestic and foreign companies which may create operations with a high added value for the Czech economy.

Possibility of obtaining direct payments The amendments introduce substantial changes to the area of investment incentives, which aim to motivate and increase the efficiency of how investment incentives are used both in the field of advanced technologies and in deprived regions of the Czech Republic.

One significant change is the extension of the possibility of obtaining direct financial support for strategic investment actions, which has proven to be a very effective motivational tool for investors to actually implement their project.

According to the amendments, an investor will be able to receive up to 20% of its investment costs (with no limit on the total amount), if it invests in the Karlovy Vary, Ústí nad Labem or Moravian-Silesian regions.

In other regions, the incentive-to-cost ratio of the project remains at 10% and the total value of incentive is capped at CZK 1.5 billion (approximately EUR 60 million).

In order to obtain such a direct subsidy, the investor will have to create at least 250 new jobs and invest at least CZK 2 billion in total (approximately EUR 80 million), from which at least half has to be spent on the acquisition of machinery.

This means that in the relevant regions, if the investor invests at least CZK 2 billion in total and creates at least 250 new jobs, the state will directly reimburse the investor up to 20% of its costs, without any limit on this payment.

Advanced technology support However, the above-mentioned conditions for investment incentives in the form of direct payments (i.e. a minimum number of new jobs and minimum value for a total investment) will not apply to privileged technological industries.

The government will support investments in the manufacturing of products of strategic importance for the protection of life and health (e.g. respirators, surgical instruments and defibrillators) as well as investments focusing on selected branches of the manufacturing industry involving a high level of technological complexity.

This includes the production of pharmaceutical products and preparations, the production of computers, electronic and optical instruments and equipment, aircraft production and their engines, spacecraft and related equipment that are carried out by high added value activities (e.g. advanced materials technology, nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology, biotechnology, photonics, microelectronics, nanoelectronics and artificial intelligence technology).

In the best-case scenario, the technological industries mentioned above may obtain an investment incentive in the form of a direct payment amounting up to 20% (with no limit on the total amount of such direct payments), without the obligation regarding the total amount of investment and new jobs.

This change will provide substantial support to medium and small technological start-ups which are not able to invest a huge amount of money and employ many workers."
Noerr,Czech Republic: New investment incentives rules aim to support technological start-ups,"This change will provide substantial support to medium and small technological start-ups which are not able to invest a huge amount of money and employ many workers.

Such start-ups may, however, carry out research and development and in this way create a modern economy with high added value in the Czech Republic.

Transformation of the Czech economy The Czech Republic needs to take steps to become a modern high added value economy.

But the new rules regarding investment incentives are not the only opportunity for investors to modernize their operations.

The Czech Republic has approved a National Recovery Plan setting out plans for reforms and investments, which intends to use funds under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The National Recovery Plan will allocate billions to digitalization, sustainable energy and safe transport, decarbonization, clean mobility, science and preventative healthcare.

The National Recovery Plan will take effect as of 2022.

The Czech Republic is on the verge of major changes in the structure of its economy."
Noerr,Competition Outlook 2022,"In this year’s Competition Outlook, Noerr’s Antitrust & Competition practice group has summarised the most important antitrust and competition, merger control and State aid developments in Europe and Germany in 2021 for you under the maxim “Learn from the past and plan for the future”.

We also take a close look at which developments companies should make sure they prepare for in 2022, especially against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our focus is on the key topics we expect to play a pivotal role in the above legal fields and in the area of investment controls.

Our outlook for 2022 shows that antitrust and competition law will not be left untouched by the major issues of the present and future.

How will the ongoing pandemic continue to impact our new reality?

What will green and digital transformation look like, how much regulation will be needed and what role will be played by the topic of sustainability?

How is the new coalition government planning to promote “fair competition”?

Although we have not left the COVID-19 pandemic behind us yet, competition authorities can be expected to carry out even stricter and more frequent investigations, once again making companies’ compliance programmes a top priority.

While merger control relief for failing companies is still not to be expected, at EU level changes can be expected in sales and distribution-related antitrust law due to the upcoming recasting of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and the implications of the crackdown on unfair practices in the Digital Markets Act.

Besides this, despite and even because of the COVID-19 pandemic there are clear indications that the topic of State aid will move higher up the agenda.

Likewise, the recent moves to tighten the legal framework mean that investment controls and the accompanying notification requirements will become increasingly significant.

Some of the issues covered in our review of the year 2021 include the classification of narrow best-price clauses by the German Federal Court of Justice under antitrust and competition law and their consequences in everyday practice, Google’s defeat in the dispute regarding Google Shopping, the increased risk of sanctions due to “gun-jumping”, the significance of the SIEC test in merger control, and the strengthening of cartel victims’ rights in cartel damages actions, including agreements on liquidated damages.

Noerr,Anticorruption - The year 2021 in review,"In the year 2021, legislative politics in Germany were deeply impacted by the ""mask affair"", in which substantial commission payments were made to elected representatives for influence over federal ministries' procurement decisions on purchasing protective equipment.

This led to legislative amendments that dealt with bribery and corruption of elected representatives.

Courts of higher and highest instance also handed down decisions that will have a significant impact on legal compliance in practice.

Gifts, Donations and Sponsoring In a judgment dated May 18, 2001 (1 StR 144/20), the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof – Federal Court of Justice) confirmed its previous legal precedent that, in general, donations to promote the arts and science, charitable or social purposes and even sports are permissible.

The Federal Court of Justice ruled that it does not constitute a breach of duty punishable under Sec. 

266 German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch – Criminal Code) for breach of trust if such donations are made for advertising purposes, to increase the company's name recognition or to improve its reputation, and the contribution is given with proper motivation, is related to the company's business purpose, is appropriate as regards the company's revenue and financial situation and is accompanied by internal transparency.

The court stated that this applies even if the economic benefit for the company cannot be precisely determined.

While these principles apply without restriction to contributions to outside recipients, the Federal Court of Justice emphasized the duty to protect the company's assets in the context of internal contributions to management and/or supervisory board members.

Gifts and other contributions that are not linked to a benefit for the company's financial situation are only permissible, according to the Federal Court of Justice, if they are of low value and are given for customary reasons of politeness and decorum.

Luxurious gifts within the company's management are never permissible, according to the Federal Court of Justice.

Bribery and Corruption of Parliamentary Representatives In connection with the ""mask affair"", the Munich Higher Regional Court (decision dated November 17, 2021 – 8 St 3/21, 8 St 4/21) was faced with the question of whether commission payments to federal and/or state parliamentary representatives for brokering mask procurement transactions with government agencies fall under the bribery prohibition found in Sec. 

108e Criminal Code

because they constitute activities conducted ""in exercise of their mandates""

.

Citing the history of the legislation, the court decided that this legal provision only covers acts or omissions that have some connection to parliament.

It stated that this referred to all activities that are linked to parliamentary decisions, processes or similar.

This was said to include only acts that serve the exercise of the mandate in parliament itself, in parliamentary committees or groups and within a party in parliament.

Conversely, the court stated that the German bribery prohibition does not cover contributions for matters not connected to a parliamentary representative’s mandate, such as side occupations, or if the authority of the mandate or the parliamentary representative’s contacts are exploited to influence a process outside of parliament, particularly to influence decisions by ministries, authorities or other government offices.

Although not only the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of January 27, 1999 but also the UN Convention Against Corruption of October 31, 2003 recommend criminalizing such conduct, German legislators expressly decided against including such broad criminalization in the wording of Sec.

108e Criminal Code."
Noerr,Anticorruption - The year 2021 in review,"108e Criminal Code.

In reaction to the ""mask affair"", the Members of the Bundestag Act (Abgeordnetengesetz) was amended to prohibit accepting money or contributions of monetary value for activities directly connected to the mandate.

This includes paid representation of third-party interests before the Bundestag or Federal Government or for paid advisory work in connection with exercise of the mandate and expands notification obligations related to side occupations.

In addition, the situation covered by Sec. 108e Criminal Code was changed from a misdemeanor to a felony and the penalty was significantly increased.

Instead of imprisonment of up to five years or a fine, the new penalty is imprisonment of one to ten years, or, in less serious cases, imprisonment of six months to five years.

This precludes the possibility of a summary penalty (Strafbefehl), in which a court pronounces a penalty for a misdemeanor without a trial, thus avoiding the related public attention.

In addition, investigative authorities now have more investigative powers, including undercover investigators.

Corruption of Public Officials In connection with the ""Regensburg Donation Affair"" the Federal Court of Justice elaborated on the criminal liability associated with contributions to a candidate for political office.

It stated that the provisions of Sec.

331 Criminal Code and the following sections regarding bribing a public official require that the bribed individual already held the office when the illicit agreement was reached (the same applies to bribery of a parliamentary representative under Sec.

108e Criminal Code).

Arrangements with the goal that a candidate for political office who does not yet hold an office would act according to the wishes of the contributor after winning the office are not punishable.

Despite this unequal treatment of an officeholder and a non-incumbent candidate for office, the Federal Court of Justice stated that the position of officeholder requires a certain self-restraint.

For officeholders, any and every contribution for fulfilling duties, i.e. for any act or omission that belongs to the officeholder's duties, is punishable.

According to the Federal Court of Justice, it is immaterial whether the internal allocation of duties makes the officeholder directly responsible for the expected act.

The Federal Court of Justice states that it is adequate if the act is included in the officeholder's general area of duties.

It is of the opinion that these principles on bribery of public officials are to be applied even if an officeholder runs for another office at the same public entity or employer.

Thus, according to the Federal Court of Justice, contributions in relation to future offices are punishable if the candidates' present areas of responsibility in their current positions are comparable to that of the offices for which they are running but not punishable if the areas of responsibility are completely different.

Bribery and Corruption in Business Dealings

The Federal Court of Justice's decision dated February 2, 2021 (2 StR 155/20) dealt with the criminal liability of an interim manager with human resources responsibility in a company that had commissioned a recruiting firm in which he himself had acquired a substantial interest.

The Federal Court of Justice stated that criminal prosecution of the interim manager for breach of trust comes into consideration for two reasons: for commissioning a service provider despite the fact that recruitment was one of his own responsibilities as interim manager, and for ignoring any less expensive offers from other service providers."
Noerr,Anticorruption - The year 2021 in review,"In addition, the Federal Court of Justice found that acquiring the interest constituted possible criminal liability for corruption in business dealings if he acquired the interest only in order to commission the service provider with orders from the company for which he was responsible because he would directly and personally profit from commissioning the service provider.

Under Sec. 299(2) No. 1 Criminal Code, it constitutes a punishable offense, i.e. corruption in business dealings, to offer, promise or give employees or agents of a company an advantage for the purpose of tortious preferential treatment in sourcing goods or services.

In contrast, contributions to individuals or company owners are not punishable.

According to a decision handed down by the Federal Court of Justice on July 28, 2021 (1 StR 506/20), a company owner is to be defined as that individual to whom the company belongs or who can reach fundamental decisions for the company.

Thus, the court considers a company owner to be a sole proprietor, the sole shareholder-managing director of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung – GmbH) or the general partner of a limited partnership (GmbH & Co. KG).

The company owner of a corporation is to be the entirety of all stockholders.

Because the lower court had not determined whether all stockholders had been in agreement with the contribution to the management board, sentencing was suspended pending further clarification of the facts of the matter.

With this decision, the Federal Court of Justice diverged from the previous overwhelming majority opinion that the consent of the employer or principal was irrelevant and could not preclude criminal liability because Sec. 

299 Criminal Code was primarily intended to protect the interests of competitors.

However, it is impossible to predict whether this means that in the future impunity is to be assumed in all cases in which the principal has given express prior consent.

It is likewise unclarified what prerequisites are to be placed on such consent from principals.

Deducting Corruptive Contributions as Business Expenses Prohibited

According to Sec. 4(5), first sentence, No. 10, first sentence German Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz – EStG), contributions that fit the legislative description of a crime cannot be deducted from taxes as business expenses.

The German Federal Fiscal Court (Bundesfinanzhof) clarified in its judgment dated April 15, 2021 - IV R 25/18 that the tax authority has the burden of proof that a prohibition of deducting a business expense is applicable.

It also ruled that it was not sufficient for a deduction prohibition if only the objective elements of a crime of corruption are given.

On the contrary, the mens rea elements of the crime also had to be fulfilled.

Thus, according to the court, the tax authority was also obligated to demonstrate the mens rea elements of the crime, which, in the case of corruption crimes, entails in particular intent.

Surrendering Bribes According to established case law, employees or agents that accept a bribe have an obligation to their employer or principal to surrender the bribe.

In its judgment dated February 25, 2021 (8 AZR 171/19) the German Federal Employment Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) ruled that bribed employees have a personal repayment obligation even if the bribe was paid not to them but rather to a third party acting as a front man.

The court also declared that, although an employer must usually prove that the employee has received something, if the employee cannot give a reasonable explanation as to why payment was made to a third party, when assessing the evidence, the trial judge would probably assume that the third party had been a front man."
Noerr,Global Trend Towards Tighter FDI Screening Continues,"Many developed countries, including Germany and the European Union, have tightened their policies on inward foreign direct investments (""FDI"").

This is not only our experience as FDI practitioners but also confirmed in a recent OECD report .

The report covers 62 economies in the period between 16 October 2020 and 15 October 2021.

It finds an all-time high of policy changes in the area of investment-related measures (with the exception of 2009, when governments responded to the global financial crisis of 2008/2009).

The Covid-19 pandemic is singled out as an important factor explaining the increase of relevant policy making at the beginning of 2020.

Focus of policy making: Essential security interests The report confirms a high sensitivity towards threats associated with inward foreign investment.

According to the report, most policy attention in this area is concentrated on acquisition- and ownership-related policies, in particular investment screening mechanisms to safeguard essential security interests: Twelve countries brought into effect new acquisition- and ownership-related policies (Australia, P.R. China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom);

At least ten countries introduced reforms to their existing mechanisms (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russian Federation, Spain);

Several other countries are considering the introduction of such policies (incl.

Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Estonia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine).

Circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a spike in policy changes in early and mid-2020.

Since December 2020, however, governments have no longer referred to the specific conditions of the pandemic when introducing new mechanisms or changes to existing ones.

In addition, the report finds signs that the outward flows of capital, technology or know how towards countries which are not considered allies may increasingly be addressed by policy makers with the intention to safeguard essential security interests.

Likewise, there is more attention towards the security implications of international research cooperation and research funding.

Germany:

Multiple recent policy changes Germany serves as an example for multiple changes in its FDI screening provisions within a short period of time:

On 10 July 2020, the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act (""AWG"") was amended with a view to implement requirements of the European Union FDI Screening Regulation . 

One of the most significant changes was the introduction of a standstill obligation for foreign investments that are subject to a mandatory notification requirement.

On 29 October 2020, the 16th amendment to the German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance (""AWV"") came into effect.

The amendment further implemented the requirements of the EU FDI Screening Regulation.

Finally, on 1 May of 2021, the 17th amendment to the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance came into force.

It significantly expanded the list of sectors and activities covered by mandatory notification requirements, and it introduced additional notification triggers for acquisitions by foreign investors in certain sectors (the lowest trigger is a shareholding of 10% of the voting rights in a domestic company).

In particular, the amendment confirmed the need for an additional notification and government approval if the foreign investor's shareholding meets or exceeds a higher threshold (20%, 25%, 40%, 50% or 75%).

Noerr’s comments: Investors need to pay attention The OECD report highlights once more the importance of FDI screening procedures for cross-border M&A transactions.

Foreign investors need to pay close attention towards the policies in force, especially when their target companies have assets or operations in several countries.

Multi-jurisdictional filings are increasingly a common feature in M&A processes."
Noerr,Global Trend Towards Tighter FDI Screening Continues,"Multi-jurisdictional filings are increasingly a common feature in M&A processes.

As a result, buyers and sellers in M&A transactions need to make the necessary assessments, include appropriate terms in their transaction agreements to account for such filings, build in the required timeline for obtaining regulatory approvals and any applicable standstill obligations in their overall transaction timing.

As policies in this area change frequently, extra care is needed to stay in line with applicable laws and regulations."
Noerr,Romania: Amendments to the sponsorship tax credit procedure starting in 2022,"Law no. 322/2021 published in the Romanian Official Gazette on 30 December 2021 has brought changes to the procedure for claiming tax credit for sponsorship expenses starting with 1 January 2022, as follows: Starting with FY22 (or FY22/23 as applicable), taxpayers may claim tax credit for their sponsorship expenses only if the amount of said tax credit, following the deduction of the amounts of the corresponding tax credit carried forward from previous years, is positive.

The corresponding tax credit which is not used up against payable profit or against payable micro-company tax, as applicable, is to be carried forward no later than 2028 only if it relates to sponsorships performed before 1 January 2022, according to the regulations in force at the date of the sponsorship.

If the value of the tax credit for sponsorship expenses, less the amounts carried forward from previous years, as the case may be, has not been fully used up, taxpayers may redirect the profit tax, up to the amount thus calculated, for sponsorships, within a maximum of six months from submitting their annual profit tax return.

The rule above applies mutatis mutandis to taxpayers that are subject to the micro-company tax regime.

Additional instructions are expected from the President of ANAF to clarify the application of the above rules.

More details will follow."
Noerr,Occupational health and safety compliance – An underrated liability risk for companies,"Occupational health and safety tends to be relegated to the sidelines at many companies, probably not least because public occupational health and safety authorities are conducting fewer inspections.

The European SLIC Report 2017 more or less openly pointed out the unwanted failure of public occupational health and safety supervision in Germany in terms of legal policy.

The human resources of the supervisory authorities in the federal states responsible are no longer sufficient to ensure a reasonable frequency of inspections, especially active visits to business establishments.

Also, the workforce structure is too old, meaning that over the next few years a huge loss of knowledge is likely as staff retire.

The SLIC Report 2017 is also highly critical of the poor use of digital information and recording channels as well as the downward trend in penalties for breaches of occupational health and safety.

The government has recently responded to the overly low number of inspections and, almost unnoticed, introduced major changes to the German Occupational Health and Safety Act ( Arbeitsschutzgesetz – ArbSchG) via the German Occupational Health and Safety Monitoring Act 2021.

Introduction of a minimum inspection frequency The competent authorities for occupational health and safety must ensure by 2026 that at least 5 per cent of establishments in the federal state are inspected each calendar year.

This will lead to a substantial increase in business inspections, but more human resources must first be recruited.

Direct transmission to statutory accident insurers

In addition, from 1 January 2023, the occupational health and safety authorities must send the results of the business inspections carried out directly to the relevant statutory accident insurer (employers’ liability insurance association) in electronic form.

The data to be transmitted includes an assessment of the organisation of occupational health and safety , including training, and an evaluation of the risk assessments prescribed by statute , including identifying risks, defining actions, and monitoring the implementation and documentation of actions.

Inspections by the occupational health and safety authorities The occupational health and safety authorities are not only able to intervene when there is a specific risk to employees, but they also have comprehensive rights to monitor compliance with occupational health and safety regulations.

The occupational health and safety authorities will check in particular whether the employer has carried out the risk assessment prescribed in section 5(1) of the German Occupational Health and Safety Act.

The obligation to carry out a risk assessment exists not only in that Act, but also in numerous German regulations such as the Biological Substances Regulation ( Biostoffverordnung – BioStoffV), the Workplace Regulation ( Arbeitsstättenverordnung – ArbStättV) and the Industrial Safety Regulation ( Betriebssicherheitsverordnung – BetrSichV).

Surprisingly often, this legal obligation is not taken seriously, yet non-compliance with the Industrial Safety Regulation, for example, leads to chronic breaches of the law.

For instance, under the Industrial Safety Regulation, employers are not allowed to use technically work equipment, whether hammers or production lines; and a CE mark of course does not release the employer from the obligation to carry out a risk assessment.

Consequences for companies If shortcomings are identified by the relevant occupational health and safety authority and not resolved by the company within the deadline set, a fine of EUR 30,000 can be imposed.

The Industrial Safety Regulation, for instance, goes even further, with a fine already being payable if a risk assessment has not been conducted, regardless of whether the occupational health and safety authority previously ordered a risk assessment to be done."
Noerr,Occupational health and safety compliance – An underrated liability risk for companies,"In the case of especially serious breaches, the person responsible at the employer will be criminally liable.

However, non-compliance with occupational health and safety law is much more serious in the case of workplace accidents leading to serious injury or death: both the investigating public prosecutors (supported by specialists from the occupational health and safety authorities) and the employers’ liability insurance associations, which are the accident and pension insurers, will investigate the precise causes of the accident.

Internal company processes such as correct training in accordance with occupational health and safety law or the existence of a factually correct risk assessment are usually the first documents that have to be submitted, in our experience.

Since any claims to recourse by the injured person pass by law to the employers’ liability insurance associations, actions for damages by the recourse departments of the employers’ liability insurance associations are also on the cards.

What can companies do?

To minimise the legal liability risks, companies should perform an occupational health and safety audit to assess whether all occupational health and safety regulations are complied with.

The following compliance aspects in particular should be taken into account:

Has a risk assessment been conducted and documented?

If so, has it been updated?

Have all measures been taken to avoid or at least to minimise possible risks to employees?

Have the employees been given training in health and safety?

Have the above processes been properly documented?

Are temporary staff covered by the German Temporary Agency Workers Act ( Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz – AÜG) adequately integrated into all these occupational health and safety processes?

Conclusion Occupational health and safety compliance will become more important over the next few years, not only due to more inspections being carried out.

New issues of occupational health and safety will emerge through more flexible working in many areas (such as remote working) and the use of fundamentally new technologies (such as artificial intelligence)."
