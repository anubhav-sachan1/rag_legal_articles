ADVANT Beiten,DRAFT BILL FOR THE MODERNISATION OF ARBITRATION LAW,"Today, the Federal Ministry of Justice presented the Draft Bill on the Modernization of the German Arbitration Law .

The objective of the reform is to strengthen Germany's attractiveness as a place for arbitration.

The Federal Minister of Justice, Dr. Marco Buschmann, explains: ""We want to improve the conditions for dispute resolution made in Germany – in the interest of our companies and in the interest of our excellent lawyers.

We have put together a package of measures to achieve this.

The legislative plans for the introduction of Commercial Courts and the strengthening of negotiations via video in the civil justice are already well advanced.

The modernization of the arbitration law is another important measure.

Private arbitral tribunals are very popular in commercial transactions.

Many companies value Germany as a place for arbitration.

With our reform we want to make Germany as a place of arbitration even more attractive.

Our recipe: less formalism, more openness for digital solutions.""

Before presenting the bill, the Federal Ministry of Justice had identified possible reforms for examination and public consultation in April 2023.

For a more detailed discussion see our blog: Reform of German Arbitration Law: Initial Key Point | Advant Beiten (advant-beiten.com) .

According to the draft bill, the following proposals, among others, are to be implemented into the German Arbitration Law in the 10th book of the German Code of Civil Procedure: Arbitration agreements shall be valid even if parties have not agreed on them in writing or any other form.

Commercial business may even impliedly conclude arbitration agreements; Arbitral awards shall be published more easily.

If no party expresses an objection against such a publication, the consent is to be assumed (opt-out rule); As a matter of clarification, the current practice of virtual hearings in arbitration proceedings shall be included into the German Arbitration Law; Arbitral awards shall be feasible only as electronical documents; An arbitral tribunal shall explicitly be allowed to include dissenting opinions in the arbitral award; State court proceedings in conjunction to arbitration proceedings, which were originally allocated to the Higher Regional Court, can be allocated to Commercial Courts by the respective federal state; In state court proceedings for the challenging or enforcement of an arbitral award, arbitral awards in the English must not be translated into German anymore.

This also applies to submissions and other documents from arbitration proceedings.

We will keep you up to date on the Draft Bill and the upcoming discussions.

ADVANT Beiten,"Once in the commercial register, always in the commercial register?","Once submitted for registration in the commercial register, documents cannot be redacted or deleted.

Publication of the register prevents this.

However, since 23 December 2022, documents in the commercial register can be exchanged under certain circumstances.

JUDGMENT OF THE HIGHER REGIONAL COURT (OLG) OF NAUMBURG OF 11 JANUARY 2023 IN CASE NO. 5 WX 14/22

Since 1 August 2022, anyone can view the commercial register for free under www.handelsregister.de.

The commercial register has always been open to the public, but users previously had to pay a fee to download documents.

Now everything is available for free at just a click.

This has minimized the hurdles to viewing the register.

Free access applies to all entries in the Commercial, Cooperative Society, Partnership and Associations Registers.

It covers all documents submitted to the Commercial Register for registration, regardless of whether the documents were provided to fulfil mandatory legal provisions or went beyond these requirements.

Often, such documents contain sensitive information, which was provided by mistake together with the application for registration in the commercial register, without consideration or sufficient (legal) knowledge of the consequences.

Typical examples are the private addresses of shareholders or directors, death certificates, or unredacted minutes of shareholder meetings, which provide much more than the mandatory information for notification.

Until now, there has been no legal basis for changing a document or deleting or redacting sensitive information once it has been submitted to the commercial register.

Documents placed in the register folder could not be changed or substituted to preserve the verity of the register.

Since 23 December 2022, the Commercial Registries Regulation (Handelsregisterverordnung) has contained a new rule, providing a legal basis for the exchange of documents once they have been placed in the register folder.

If an original document contains information, which is not mandatory, it is now possible to exchange this document with one that omits the additional, non-mandatory information.

Upon receiving an application from a notary, the register court will act.

The court will note the date of the submission of the original document and the fact that the documents have been exchanged on the new document.

This ensures it is obvious that the exchanged document replaced an original document.

It remains unclear whether whole documents can be deleted, where they contain only non-mandatory information.

However, the new provision does not allow for changes in the form of redaction or deletion to the document.

The OLG Naumburg recently dealt with the issue of deleting or redacting sensitive information from the commercial register.

Background of the case The founding shareholders and directors sought the redaction of their signatures on the certificate of incorporation, the application for registration in the commercial registry, the list of shareholders, and the minutes of the resolution appoint the directors – without success.

The OLG Naumburg rejected the application.

In its reasoning, OLG Naumburg held that the applicants could not base their request for deletion on either data protection provisions or fundamental rights.

Correctly: to preserve the truth of the register, documents placed in the commercial register folder generally cannot be changed.

It is not the role of the court holding the register to later interfere with documents once they have been released.

The application for redaction of the signatures can also not be based on the newly introduced § 9 (7) of the Commercial Register Regulation.

The applicants have not requested the exchange of any documents falling under the provision, but have instead requested changes to the original documents.

Comments and practical tip

It is now possible to exchange documents containing information that is sensitive and does not require disclosure."
ADVANT Beiten,"Once in the commercial register, always in the commercial register?","Comments and practical tip

It is now possible to exchange documents containing information that is sensitive and does not require disclosure.

However, the court holding the register will not act on its own motion.

Affected parties must be active.

If you wish to see sensitive information deleted from documents that can be viewed in the commercial register, you should check whether the information requires disclosure.

Where and to the extent that this is not the case, you can consider an exchange of documents.

It is not yet clear whether the new provision allows whole documents to be removed from the accessible documents in the commercial register where the document does not contain any information necessary for legal transactions.

Whether there is an enforceable claim to an exchange of documents based on fundamental rights is also disputed.

The courts have not yet decided this issue.

The OLG Naumburg refused to answer this question, leaving it open as it was not relevant to its judgment.

It therefore remains to be seen how the register courts will position themselves on this issue.

In any case, you should contact the relevant register court to discuss the possibility of a document exchange.

Conclusion: forewarned is forearmed.

In the future, when you are drafting documents to be submitted to the commercial register for registration, you should check the information in the documents and limit it to that which is strictly necessary.

Where mistakes were made in the past, you should contact the commercial register and apply to have any problematic documents exchanged.

ADVANT Beiten,Recent and Future Developments in Arbitration,"The year 2024 has only just started but we already have some developments in arbitration, which are worth mentioning.

Some arbitration institutes have amended their arbitration rules, some changed their fees and others have introduced new platforms.

The next months will, furthermore, bring some interesting changes in legislation.

We are looking forward to the year 2024 as it holds the potential to have a big impact on arbitration, especially in our home jurisdiction, Germany.

In the following we highlight some of the most notable developments.

Reform of the German arbitration law (10 th Book of the Code of Civil Procedure)

The German Federal Minister of Justice, Dr Marco Buschmann published key points on a reform of German arbitration law in April 2023.

We summarized the key points in our blog article of 19 April 2023 ( Reform of German Arbitration Law:

Initial Key Point | Advant Beiten (advant-beiten.com) ).

Since then the Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer ( Statement No 21 ) and the German Arbitration Institute (DIS) ( Statement on the key points ) submitted statements to these key points in May 2023.

If the Federal Ministry of Justice pursues the plan to reform the German arbitration law, there will be a first draft bill in 2024.

We are looking forward to such a draft bill and to see what the suggested reforms will be.

Tribunal Secretary Platform of ASA and Jus Connect

The Swiss Arbitration Association has announced that it will unveil a platform together with Jus Connect ( ASA's Announcement ).

The platform shall facilitate contact between arbitrators and individuals who are open to act as tribunal secretary.

Furthermore, there will be templates and a database for tribunal secretaries.

The database and the search for suitable individual shall be open to the entire arbitration community.

We welcome this initiative and hope to see more diversity and inclusion in the field of arbitration by making tribunal secretaries more visible.

New Arbitration Act in the UK London's role as an arbitration hub lost some importance due to the Brexit.

UK Government tries to restrengthen the importance by overhauling the Arbitration Act 1996.

The new act shall simplify the procedure, reduce costs and delays, protect arbitrators from unreasonable lawsuits against them and support the use of emergency arbitration.

Currently the draft bill is still in process of the UK's legislation, but the new arbitration act will most probably become effective in 2024.

The current status of the process can be followed on the website of the UK Parliament .

Higher Fees for Arbitrators in SCC Arbitration Proceedings

The SCC Arbitration Institute has introduced higher fees for arbitrators starting from 1 January 2024.

Since the last increase dates back to 2017, the SCC decided to adjust the fees for arbitrators between 5 and 15%.

The updated fees can be found on the SCC website .

Already in 2023, the SCC has introduced new arbitration rules .

These rules can now be accessed in more languages.

For example, a translation into German is available since the middle of 2023.

New SHIAC Arbitration Rules

On 1 January 2024 the new arbitration rules of the SHIAC became effective.

These new arbitration rules will benefit the growing demand of arbitration on the Chinese and global market.

They include several special rules, inter alia , for online arbitration, aviation, and data.

These rules shall increase the procedural options of parties, such as options for consolidation, third-party inclusion, interim measures, and emergency arbitration.

A brief summary of the new arbitration rules can be found on the website of the SHIAC.

New CIETAC Arbitration Rules On 1 January, the new arbitration rules of CIETAC became effective.

These revised arbitration rules are a further step to modern arbitration rules and applying the international standard to its rules."
ADVANT Beiten,Recent and Future Developments in Arbitration,"These revised arbitration rules are a further step to modern arbitration rules and applying the international standard to its rules.

Notable among others are the new competence of tribunals to decide on their own jurisdiction, the possibility of early dismissal, a provision on third-party funding and provisions on ad hoc arbitration.

The latter is most notable since ad hoc arbitration proceedings are not acknowledged by the Chinese arbitration law but might be in future.

These aforementioned topics are not meant to be conclusive but to be a brief highlighting of current changes and developments.

We are looking forward to seeing the new arbitration rules in action.

Especially for the German arbitration landscape, it could be an interesting year that may have an influence on German arbitration proceedings for the next years.

Hopefully, any of the developments will lead to a more diverse and more practicable toolbox for the resolution of domestic and cross-country disputes.

ADVANT Beiten,The AI Act - The Agreement and What It Means,"As Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, put it: This is a historic moment.

On 8 December 2023, after a three-day-marathon of negotiating, the European regulation efforts were awarded with a preliminary political agreement on the first comprehensive European act on artificial intelligence: the AI Act.

It is not, as from time to time even the EU itself claims, the first regulation on AI worldwide.

With an executive order in the United States and an Act on Automated Decision-Making in China, corresponding regulations already exist in other parts of the world.

The AI Act aims to ensure that only AI systems which are both safe and respect the fundamental rights and values of the EU are brought onto the European market and are used in the EU.

Still, even though an agreement has been reached, the outcome of the negotiations was announced although there is not yet a consolidated text to present.

The political agreement will be put into a final text over the coming months.

To this end, a number of technical negotiation meetings have been scheduled until the end of February.

As some of the information currently available varies widely , we will have to wait until the final text will be published in the first quarter of 2024.

The overview below presents the most significant known regulations.

Definition of an AI System

The new AI Act will include an amended definition of AI systems compared to the European Parliament's last proposals, which is close to the OECD's definition.

The OECD's definition is as follows: “ An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.

Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment .”

This definition is particularly criticised because it is extremely broad and therefore even includes simple auto-correction or Excel functions, for example.

In this respect, the final wording of the Act including its recitals which, as we know, may often be used to fine-tune certain terms must be awaited.

Risk-based Approach The Regulation, which is based on a proposal by the EU Commission in April 2021 and is part of the EU's digital strategy, follows a risk-based approach.

It categorises AI systems into different groups depending on the risk they pose: from minimal risk to high-risk and even banned AI systems.

According to this approach, six principles apply to all AI systems.

AI systems should (1) enable human agency and oversight, (2) be technically robust and safe, (3) comply with privacy and data protection regulations, (4) be transparent, (5) ensure diversity, non-discrimination and fairness and (6) ensure social and environmental well-being.

Banned AI Systems AI systems involving an unacceptable risk will be banned in the EU.

These include, for example, systems using manipulative techniques, systems that exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities, social scoring and databases based on mass facial recognition.

Until the very end there was an intense debate as to whether AI for facial recognition should be permitted or not.

While individual countries, such as France, supported the use of AI for facial recognition, arguing that it could be used to ensure security around major events such as the 2024 Olympic Games, most remained sceptic.

Despite a tough battle over several days of negotiations, a complete ban on real-time biometric identification could not be achieved against the massive resistance of the member states.

After lengthy discussions, the bans involving the recognition of emotions and remote biometric identification were adjusted.

The ban on AI systems for emotion recognition now only applies in the workplace and in education."
ADVANT Beiten,The AI Act - The Agreement and What It Means,"The ban on AI systems for emotion recognition now only applies in the workplace and in education.

It will however still be permissible to use such systems for medical or safety reasons, for example to monitor pilot fatigue.

The regulations on remote biometric identification have also been amended.

Both 'real time' and 'post' identification will remain banned.

Exceptions are expected for the prosecution of criminal offences in clearly defined cases.

The AI Act also includes a catalogue of protective measures to prevent potential misuse.

High-risk Systems A large part of AI systems will be categorised as high-risk AI systems.

These are, for example, AI based medical devices or autonomous vehicles.

In general, education, critical infrastructure, migration, asylum, or border controls are considered critical high-risk areas.

High-risk AI systems will have to comply with a number of requirements and obligations to be approved in the EU.

For example, conformity assessments must be carried out and a quality and risk-mitigation system must be integrated.

High-risk AI systems will also have to be registered in the corresponding EU database.

The requirement to carry out an impact assessment for fundamental rights remains unchanged, although this will now only apply to public organisations and private bodies that provide essential public services, such as hospitals or banks.

Further changes have been made to the responsibilities and the roles of the various players.

Further, a filter system has been introduced.

An AI system can lose its classification as a high-risk system if it fulfils one of a total of four conditions, for example if it (1) is intended to monitor or improve a human activity or (2) is only used to recognise decision-making patterns or deviations from previous decision-making patterns, (3) is only used to carry out preparatory tasks for a human activity relevant for critical applications or (4) is only intended to carry out procedural tasks.

AI Systems with Limited Risk Specific transparency obligations will apply to AI systems with limited risk.

These will, above all, include the information that a certain content has been generated by AI.

The aim is to ensure that users can make informed decisions about further use.

Generative AI Also in the field of generative AI there will be some changes, unsurprisingly, as these provisions were the most controversial.

While the European Parliament ‑ not least in view of ChatGPT - supported a regulation of generative AI systems, the Commission had recently been of the opinion that these AI systems did not require a regulation.

It was instead sufficient if manufacturers submit to voluntary commitments.

These AI systems are now called 'general purpose AI' instead of 'foundation models'.

The definition of general purpose AI was amended so that it now only includes large generative AI systems.

“‘General purpose AI model’ means an AI model, including when trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale, that is capable to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is released on the market.”

Developers of general purpose AI models will have to comply with certain minimum requirements, such as creating technical documentation, providing information for downstream providers and providing information about training and testing procedures.

They must also comply with copyright regulations and the products generated must be labelled with a watermark.

Large AI systems posing systemic risks, so-called 'systemic risk AI' or top tier models that exceed a certain computing power (1025 FLOPs) during training, must fulfil additional obligations.

These include, for example, setting up a risk-mitigation system and maintaining an appropriate level of cyber security.

Details of this have not yet been finalised."
ADVANT Beiten,The AI Act - The Agreement and What It Means,"These include, for example, setting up a risk-mitigation system and maintaining an appropriate level of cyber security.

Details of this have not yet been finalised.

Still, it is assumed that OpenAI's GPT4 and Google's Gemini will be considered to be systems with systemic risk.

Models of the European developers Aleph Alpha and Mistral on the other hand will most likely not be categorised as AI models with systemic risk based on their computing power.

Honi soit qui mal y pense.

Linking transparency requirements to computing power is heavily criticised, as the capability alone says little about the risks of an AI system.

In order to be able to make adjustments as technology develops, the Commission will be able to adjust the current threshold and also define additional criteria.

Open Source Models

The previous proposal also excluded models based on open source licences from the AI Act.

According to the recent agreement, only those open source generative purpose AI systems that are categorised as systemic risk AI systems are to fall within the scope of the AI Act.

They are also not exempt from the requirements for high-risk AI systems.

This is to be welcomed, as the mere fact that an AI model is based on open source licences or not says little about the risk it poses.

Copyright Requirements According to the regulation, AI developers will have to disseminate a copyright policy and a detailed summary of the content they have used to train their generative purpose AI models.

This transparency requirement is intended to let authors determine whether their work has been used.

It has not been specified yet what exactly 'detailed' means.

If the information provided so far is to be believed, the text and data mining limitation for generative AI is explicitly recognised.

This had been controversial.

The background: Interference with copyright exploitation rights is only permitted if the rights are exempted by limitation provisions.

The limitations for text and data mining, i.e. the automated analytical technique of works to obtain information about patterns, trends and correlations, are relevant for the multiplication which happens in the training of AI.

According to the text and data mining limitation, the reservations of rights holders in particular must be observed.

Penalties The penalties under the AI Act have been amended again, but remain differentiated in proportion to the seriousness of the irregularity.

For example, a breach of the ban on certain systems and non-compliance with data requirements may be penalised with up to 7% of the company's global annual turnover or EUR 35 million.

Enforcement and Authorities An AI Office is (already) being set up in the European Commission to enforce the regulation of generative purpose AI systems.

All other AI systems will be monitored by the competent national authorities.

In order to ensure the uniform application of legislation, they will meet regularly in a European Committee on Artificial Intelligence.

Right to Lodge a Complaint Another new addition is the possibility for natural and legal persons to lodge a complaint with the competent national authority about non-compliance with the requirements of the AI Act.

Entry into Force of the AI Act In principle, the majority of the AI Act's catalogue of obligations will apply 24 months after its entry into force.

However, the current draft of the AI Act provides for certain obligations to apply earlier.

For example, the ban on certain systems will take effect just six months after the Act comes into force, which means it is expected to apply as early as over the course of 2024.

The requirements for generative purpose AI systems will apply just 12 months after the AI Act comes into force.

It is therefore highly advisable to review the provisions of the AI Act at an early stage, not least in view of the fact that the conversion of any systems may well take some time."
ADVANT Beiten,The AI Act - The Agreement and What It Means,"It is therefore highly advisable to review the provisions of the AI Act at an early stage, not least in view of the fact that the conversion of any systems may well take some time.

Next Steps As mentioned at the beginning of this post, the AI Act is not yet final - and it may still be a while.

Although the recently announced political agreement on the key points has been reached, the technical aspects of the legal text still have to be negotiated in detail over the next few weeks.

It may take a while for the bits and pieces to be divided and negotiated, with a lot of the details being figured out later.

Finally, the EU bodies must then approve the final text of the regulation.

As it is a regulation, it applies directly in all Member States and does not need to be transposed into national law.

Conclusion With the AI Act, the EU intends to keep what it calls an 'extremely delicate balance' between boosting innovation and uptake of AI in Europe on the one hand and respecting the fundamental rights of EU citizens on the other.

However, the final document which contains more than 250 pages comes across as a bureaucratic nightmare, imposing high documentation requirements on many companies.

Due to the vagueness of many regulations, there will be a range of grey areas that could lead to uncertainties and, in the worst case, to considerations as to whether the use of AI should initially be avoided against this background until a uniform application practice of the competent authorities emerges.

Nonetheless, the EU's attempt to address this major contemporary issue and to take account of dynamic developments by continuously adapting the provisions, as explicitly envisaged, is to be welcomed in principle.

ADVANT Beiten,The Year of the DSA – Twelve quick bites of wisdom on the EU’s Digital Services Act,"The EU Digital Services Act („DSA“) will enter into full force on 17 February 2024.

If you don’t already know what that means, you should at least be aware of the following:

1.

Framework The DSA creates a general legal framework for online intermediary services in the EU – that includes hosting services and online platforms.

This framework is to be further specified by more specific provisions such as in the proposed Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse (CSAM Regulation).

2.

Timeline The DSA is fully applicable as of 17 February 2024.

Non-compliance may result in fines of up to six percent of the group’s annual turnover.

3.

Intermediary services Only services offered as an intermediary service fall under the DSA (which on the one hand entails liability privileges, but on the other hand obliges the service providers to follow new due diligence obligations).

Intermediary services include hosting services and online platforms.

4.

Liability privileges The DSA retains the liability privileges for intermediary services introduced by its predecessor, the e-Commerce Directive.

Intermediary services do not have a general monitoring obligation for third-party content under the DSA.

(But the DSA does not overrule the ECJ case-law on liability for copyright infringements.)

5.

Assessment The due diligence obligations depend on the type of intermediary service that is offered.

The DSA distinguishes between “mere conduit”, “caching”, and “hosting” services.

Online platforms are a new subcategory of hosting services with plenty of additional obligations.

6. Point of Contact Intermediary services have to designate a point of contact for matters about DSA compliance and make its contact information easily accessible.

7.

Terms and Conditions The DSA imposes minimum specifications in general terms and conditions as to how the intermediary service provider moderates third-party content.

The provisions must be transparent and easy to understand.

Graphic elements such as icons can be used in addition to design user-friendly provisions.

8.

Transparency reports Providers of intermediary services must publish transparency reports at least once a year.

The report must contain information on any content moderation as defined in the DSA during the relevant period.

9. Notice and Action Mechanism If you provide a hosting service, you are obliged to implement a notice and action mechanism for illegal content.

No such information is necessarily required for content that is (only) against your terms, but not illegal.

Users affected by restrictions must receive a clear and specific statement of reasons.

10.

No targeted advertising of minors based on profiling The Digital Services Act prohibits online platforms the targeted advertising of minors based on profiling.

In addition, it bans targeted advertising based on profiling using special categories of personal data, such as sexual orientation or religion.

11. Know your business customer Marketplaces allowing consumers to buy online must obtain certain information to trace the trader and verify such information.

The platform must be designed in a way that traders can comply with their information obligations (e.g., the extensive list of obligations in the Consumer Rights Directive).

12.

Specific obligations for very large online services Online platforms with more than 45 million monthly active users within the European Union can (and likely will) be designated by the Commission as a very large online platform (VLOP).

So far, the following services have been designated as VLOPS: Alibaba AliExpress, Amazon Store, Apple AppStore, Booking.com, Facebook, Google Play, Google Maps, Google Shopping, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Pornhub, Snapchat, Stripchat, TikTok, Twitter, Wikipedia, XVideos, Youtube, Zalando).

Amazon and Zalando have taken legal action against this designation."

ADVANT Beiten,European Supply Chain Act close to finalization,"Historic breakthrough in the trilogue negotiations on the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD): On 14 December 2023, the negotiators from the Parliament and Council reached an initially informal agreement on the content of the upcoming European supply chain law, as reported in a press release from the Parliament: Corporate due diligence rules agreed to safeguard human rights and environment | News | European Parliament (europa.eu) The agreement reached now needs to be formally confirmed by the Parliament and the Council.

Only then will there be final certainty about the content of the new directive.

Once it comes into force, the CSDDD will then have to be transposed into national law by the EU member states.

For Germany, this will in all likelihood take place via corresponding amendments to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which already came into force on 1 January 2023 (for more details, see our respective flyer The German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains_ADVANT Beiten.pdf (advant-beiten.com) ).

Addressees of the new EU regulation shall be: (i) EU companies and parent companies over 500 employees and a worldwide turnover higher than 150 million euro.

(ii) EU companies with over 250 employees and with a turnover of more than 40 million euro if at least 20 million are generated in one of the following sectors: manufacture and wholesale trade of textiles, clothing and footwear, agriculture including forestry and fisheries, manufacture of food and trade of raw agricultural materials, extraction and wholesale trade of mineral resources or manufacture of related products and construction.

(iii) Non-EU companies and parent companies with equivalent turnover in the EU.

The companies concerned will have to introduce a human rights risk management .

In addition, companies, including the financial sector, must adopt a plan to ensure that their business model is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C .

As with the LkSG, fulfilment of the CSDDD requirements will in future be monitored by a national supervisory authority in each EU member state.

The supervisory authorities can initiate investigations and impose sanctions on companies that violate the regulations.

This includes naming and shaming and the imposition of fines of up to 5% of global net turnover .

In addition, compliance with due diligence obligations is to be included as part of the award criteria for public contracts and concessions.

Finally, the CSDDD - in contrast to the LkSG - will apparently also contain explicit provisions on companies being liable for breaches of their due diligence obligations and victims having the right to compensation.

Further details will emerge from the correspondingly revised regulatory drafts.

Dr Daniel Walden Dr André Depping"
ADVANT Beiten,Corporate transactions – Why you need to take increased caution in transactions involving medical devices,"The Medical Devices Regulation (“MDR”) affects transactions in the medical product sector in various ways.

The special features of medical products law must be considered when selecting the transaction form and during due diligence investigations.

Over the past few years, numerous M&A transactions have involved medical products law.

Various small and medium-sized companies active in the sector have merged to take advantage of economies of scale and synergy effects.

Digitalisation has also seen the establishment of many start-ups on the market, hailing new technologies in the medical sector.

German companies especially are among the absolute world leaders and are desired by many foreign investors.

Transaction structure Where the target is involved in the manufacture or distribution of medical products, transaction structure will be key.

As the existence and issue of product certifications directly affect the value of a company, all certifications must be properly transferred to the acquirer.

This raises the question of whether a share or asset deal would better capture these characteristics.

The answer to this question is not straightforward and will depend on the case.

Share deal Generally, a share deal will be less complicated than an asset deal for transactions involving medical products.

The inherent rights and obligations will transfer with the shares in the target company.

This can be a significant advantage considering regulatory requirements.

As the value of a medical product primarily depends on whether it has the relevant legal authorisations – such as a CE label – it is particularly important for acquirers that these authorisations transfer to the new owner.

In contrast to an asset deal, the target retains its legal identity in a share deal.

The manufacturer does not change, so the CE label and any other approvals and licenses remain unchanged.

The transfer is not without conditions but requires both the company and its internal organisational structure, e.g. the existing quality management system and the distribution of responsibilities with respect to product monitoring within the target company, to remain unchanged after the transfer.

If processes or the organisational structure change, recertification will often be required.

If the acquirer renames the company, it will necessitate recertification and an amendment to the label as it will change the name of the manufacturer.

Another advantage of a share deal is that all relationships, internal and external, remain unaffected.

However, contacts can contain a change of control clause which gives a third party the right to unilaterally terminate the contract in the case of changes to the ownership structure.

You should therefore examine contracts with third parties more closely, particularly where subsidies have been granted.

Asset deal An asset deal will be more complicated than a share deal in many cases involving medical products.

It requires individual assets to be carved out of the company and transferred to the acquirer.

As authorisations are tied to the manufacturer as a company, any changes to the organisational structure will make renaming necessary.

Only Class I medical products are excluded from this rule; a company can certify such products itself.

A time-consuming certification process can only be avoided by transferring individual sites without any changes.

As such a transfer will not trigger a need to reassess the existing documents, it will be sufficient to inform the relevant authority.

However, the acquirer will also be required to relabel the product accordingly.

In exceptional cases, tax aspects will justify the additional costs and effort of an asset deal.

Due diligence In the preliminary stages of a transaction, the potential acquirer should carefully examine and analyse the target for its economic, legal, tax and financial standing (so-called due diligence)."
ADVANT Beiten,Corporate transactions – Why you need to take increased caution in transactions involving medical devices,"Due diligence is particularly important in highly regulated markets such as medical products.

Due diligence should show the extent to which the target complies with the strict requirements of the medical device regulation and reveal any potential liability risks for the acquirer.

This must identify which regulatory provisions apply to the product manufactured or distributed.

Marginal differences between medical devices law and similar areas such as pharmaceutical law can make the classification difficult.

If the MDR applies, the classification of the target will play a decisive role.

Depending on whether the company is active as a manufacturer, importer, or in some other role, particular legal obligations may be triggered, such as documentation requirements, or monitoring or inspection obligations.

For this reason, acquirers must carefully examine whether the regulatory requirements for the certification have been fulfilled and whether they will continue to be fulfilled in the future.

The sale and purchase agreement should adequately represent any risks identified during due diligence, such as with guarantees or warranties, waivers, or a reduction in the purchase price.

Given the strict requirements of the MDR, it can also be advisable to make certain requirements a condition precedent.

Outlook and comments Updates to medical devices law have exacerbated the existing difficulties of corporate acquisitions in this field.

Manufacturers must consistently ensure that their products fulfil the regulatory requirements.

Outside of the EU, it can be even more complicated, costly and time-consuming to transfer authorisations and licences.

If you are considering selling or acquiring a target active in this sector, you should involve specialists in the early stages to advise on the tax aspects of the transaction structure, keep an eye on the regulatory provisions, and reduce the risks of liability.

ADVANT Beiten,Control of subsidies: Challenges for companies in the EU Internal Market,"In 2023, the EU adopted a new set of rules aimed at preventing subsidies from third countries from distorting competition on the internal market.

The new notification requirements and powers granted to the Commission pose various challenges for companies.

Background Competition is an indispensable element of the European internal market.

Various control instruments help maintain and protect competition in the EU, such as rules on the conduct of undertakings on the market, the merger of undertakings, and the award of public procurement contracts within the EU Member States.

Until this year, there was no way to control and prevent the distorting effects of subsidies from third countries (i.e., states that are not members of the EU) on competition in the internal market.

The EU reacted and closed this gap with the adoption of two Regulations.

These are Regulation (EU) 2022/2560 on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market (which we will refer to as the FSR) and the related Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1441 on detailed arrangements for the conduct of proceedings (Implementing Regulation).

The two regulations establish a system designed to prevent the distorting effects of subsidies from third countries on competition in the internal market in all economic activities.

These new rules are particularly important for mergers between undertakings and the participation in public procurement proceedings.

The implementing Regulation recently entered into force and establishes detailed procedural rules.

This article explains those new procedural rules and what companies must now do.

Overview of the procedures The new control procedures have multiple phases.

Once a merger or participation in a public procurement procedure has been notified to the Commission, the Commission will perform a preliminary investigation.

Where it has information on alleged foreign subsidies distorting competition, the Commission can conduct a preliminary investigation ex officio in relation to any economic activity.

When the Commission reaches the preliminary conclusion that there is a subsidy that is distorting the internal market, it will open an in-depth investigation.

At the end of this phase, the Commission will adopt its final decision on whether the subsidy distorts competition.

The Commission can impose redressive measures on the undertakings involved to prevent the distortion of competition.

The undertakings may also offer the Commission commitments appropriate to fully remedy the distortive effects of the subsidy on competition.

What rules apply now to undertakings?

These new controls mean that some undertakings will face new obligations.

The notification obligations are especially important for companies because failure to comply can result in fines of up to 10% of the aggregate turnover in the previous financial year.

However, requests for information from the Commission, on-site inspections, and the protection of the confidential interests of parties are also relevant.

A) MOST SIGNIFICANT:

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS The new controls introduce notification requirements similar to those for other controls on competition.

Given the significant fines for failing to comply with the obligation (up to 10% of the aggregate turnover in the previous financial year) and the significant efforts required to provide information, companies should be aware of the new obligations.

I) NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR MERGERS Concentrations must be notified under the new system when - one of the merging undertakings, the acquired undertaking or the joint venture generates an aggregate turnover in the Union of at least EUR 500 million, and - the undertakings concerned were granted combined financial contributions of at least EUR 50 million from third countries in the three years preceding the concentration."
ADVANT Beiten,Control of subsidies: Challenges for companies in the EU Internal Market,"Where these conditions are fulfilled, the concentration must be notified by completing and submitting the form set out in the Implementing Regulation.

Various information must be provided, including on the concentration and the parties.

Providing the information about the financial contributions will take the most effort.

The FSR identifies three types of contributions or subsidies, each of which requires differing information to be provided to the Commission.

The highest level of information is required where the subsidies granted in the three years before the concentration amount to at least EUR 1 million and, by nature, fall under one of the critical categories listed in the FSR (grant to an ailing undertaking, an unlimited guarantee for debts and liabilities, export credits that do not conform to OECD Arrangements, or contributions that facilitate the concentration).

Detailed information and relevant supporting documents must be submitted for every subsidy (e.g. on the amount, origin, an exact description, and the possible conditions), which means increased effort for companies.

The requirements are less strict where the subsidies granted over the previous three years amount to at least EUR 1 million but where the nature of these contributions is not one of the critical types listed in the FSR.

Such contributions must be listed in the table in the form, sorted by applicant and country.

There are some exceptions even for contributions which fall within this group (e.g. general deferments or tax exemptions, tax deductions to avoid double taxation, or the acquisition of goods or services in the proper course of business).

; Where contributions amount to less than EUR 1 million, they will be exempt from the obligation to provide information.

However, the Commission can still demand information on all contributions, including those under EUR 1 million.

II) NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO PROCUREMENT PROCEEDINGS Companies may also have notification obligations where they wish to participate in procurement proceedings fall under EU procurement law in accordance with the 4 Part of the German Competition Act ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen ), except for the award of contracts in defence and security.

This is because competition in a public procurement proceeding can be affected when a foreign subsidy allows one of the bidders to submit an unduly advantageous tender.

In procurement procedures which fulfil the thresholds outlined below, undertakings that have received foreign financial contributions over the three years preceding the participation in the tender will need to notify the Commission of these contributions (so-called “notification”).

Where the estimated value of the public procurement contract exceeds certain thresholds, but the undertaking has not received any notifiable foreign financial contribution in the last three years, the undertaking must provide the Commission with limited information and make a declaration that any foreign contributions received in the last three years are not notifiable (so-called “declaration”).

Foreign contributions do not require notification where the aggregate amount received over the past three years is less than EUR 200,000 (so-called “de minimis aid”).

The relevant thresholds are exceeded where: a) the estimated value of the public procurement agreement is at least EUR 250 million (net), and b) the undertakings involved in the tender (including the main contractor and main suppliers) were granted aggregate foreign contributions in the three years prior to notification of at least EUR 4 million per third country.

Where the procurement is divided into lots, the foreign subsidy will require notification if the estimated value of the procurement exceeds the threshold of EUR 250 million (net) and the lots for which the tenderer applies have an aggregate value of at least EUR 135 million (net)."
ADVANT Beiten,Control of subsidies: Challenges for companies in the EU Internal Market,"Here, the foreign contribution must also amount to at least EUR 4 million.

In public procurement procedures, companies submit notifications or declarations of subsidies together with the tender or request to participate to the contracting authority and not to the Commission directly.

The contracting authority must state in the contract notice that the obligation to notify or declare foreign subsidies applies and must forward any documents it receives to the Commission.

Companies should use the “FS-PP” (“Public Procurement”) standard form set out in the Implementing Regulation for the notification.

This specifies which information must be provided and includes: a) A short description of the public procurement procedure, b) Information about the notifiers (undertakings), c) Information on the foreign financial contributions, d) Where necessary, an explanation of why the offer is not an unduly advantageous tender, e) Where necessary, information on the possible positive effect of the foreign subsidies, f) A list of supporting documentation, and g)

A signed declaration that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.

If the parties are only submitting a declaration and not a notification, they must provide information on the procurement proceedings and the undertaking(s), as well as the signed declaration about the correctness of the information provided.

If an undertaking would need to make unreasonable efforts to obtain some of the information required by the FS-PP, it can ask the Commission to dispense with the obligation to provide that information.

For public procurement procedures, the Commission shall complete its preliminary investigation at the latest 20 working days after it receives a notification, after which it can, where necessary, initiate an in-depth investigation.

Upon receipt of a declaration, the Commission can initiate an investigation ex officio.

During the preliminary investigation and any in-depth investigation, the public procurement procedure can continue.

However, the contracting authority cannot award the procurement contract.

If the Commission concludes during either the preliminary or the in-depth investigation that there is no foreign financial contribution that would distort competition, it shall adopt a no-objection decision for the award of the procurement contract.

If, instead, the Commission concludes that there is a contribution that distorts competition, it may adopt a decision with commitments which fully and effectively remedy the distortion, or – where commitments are not considered – a decision prohibiting the award of the public procurement contract to the undertaking in question.

III) NEED FOR ACTION As explained above, companies may be subject to the obligation to provide information about financial contributions received from third countries.

The three-year time limit means that the period covered by this obligation is not negligible.

To avoid the need to make significant efforts to prepare the relevant information in a short time period in the future, as well as the related high costs, companies should identify the necessary information on contributions they have received, keep that information readily available and establish a system that continually records and saves the information on all future contributions, ready to use when needed.

The Commission also has the power to initiate a preliminary investigation ex officio.

This can not only affect companies planning a merger or planning to participate in a public procurement procedure.

All companies should therefore prepare.

The Commission also encourages companies to contact it in advance to gauge how much work is required in the case.

There is also the possibility that the Commission will, upon request, exclude certain information so that the parties need not submit it.

B) OTHER NEW RULES

The Implementing Regulation provides time limits for various actions throughout the procedure."
ADVANT Beiten,Control of subsidies: Challenges for companies in the EU Internal Market,"B) OTHER NEW RULES

The Implementing Regulation provides time limits for various actions throughout the procedure.

These range from five to 65 days, and, in some cases, the Commission has some flexibility when setting time limits.

In some instances, marking information as confidential will avoid dissemination.

However, companies may have to justify the claim of confidentiality.

If the Commission deems such information not to be confidential, it will inform the parties and may make the information public.

After the conclusion of an in-depth investigation, the undertakings may be required to report to the Commission on compliance with the commitments, contributions received, and participation in other public procurement procedures for a period.

Summary The Implementing Regulation introduces new obligations and challenges for companies.

Perhaps the most important of these is the obligation to notify concentrations and the participation in public procurement procedures.

This is because of the possible fines for failure to comply and the significant amount of effort involved in meeting these obligations.

We therefore recommend that you identify any relevant information about past contributions and keep it handy, and establish a system for recording such information for the future.

ADVANT Beiten,"EU Data Act: Action required for Connected Products, Related Services and Cloud Computing","You would like to hear from us personally about the new obligations under the Data Act ?

Then register for our webinar: Registration On 27 November 2023, the EU Council adopted the Data Act, which was the final requirement after the the text had been adopted by the European Parliament on 9 November 2023.

Following the formal adoption by the Council, the new regulation will be published in the EU’s official journal in the coming weeks and will enter into force 20 days after this publication.

The Data Act - an EU regulation and as such directly applicable in all EU member states - provides for harmonized rules for ""fair access to and use of data"".

Unlike the GDPR it is not limited to personal data.

The aim is to make this data commercially usable.

It is clear already that the Act will go well beyond regulating the „Internet of Things“ (IoT).

It relates in particular to ""connected products"" and cloud services.

Below we provide an initial overview.

Data Sharing: Far-reaching obligations are imposed on data holders, in particular provision and access obligations in relation to user data.

Data from connected products or related services may have to be shared with the user or a third party (data recipient).

This is intended to strengthen the rights of users in relation to the data holder.

It is also intended to encourage new players to invest in the data economy.

Connected products and related services must be designed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Act (""access by design"").

Moreover, the Act requires data holders to make data from connected products or related services accessible free of charge and, where applicable, continuously in realtime.

To date, many connected products and related services have not been designed with this in mind, which is why the Data Act and its obligations must be considered from the very beginning of product development in future.

Vice versa, data holders are no longer allowed to freely share non-personal data with other players - for advertising purposes, for instance.

In this respect, the right to share data is generally restricted to the extent necessary to fulfil the user contract.

Any further sharing of non-personal data may in future require a data licence agreement.

This is also likely to affect existing data records.

With a few exceptions , small and certain medium-sized enterprises are exempt from the obligation to share data (less than 50 employees or EUR 10 million annual turnover).

UNFAIR CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES:

The provisions on unfair contractual terms (Chapter IV) are meant to prevent the abuse of contractual imbalances.

The law introduces a ban on unilaterally imposed unfair terms in B2B contracts and is based on the law on general terms and conditions.

In addition to a general clause, the Data Act also contains (non-exhaustive) examples of unfair terms.

These include, for instance, provisions that limit liability for the quality of the data provided.

Furthermore, exclusive rights of use to data that are imposed unilaterally can be problematic.

To support this, the European Commission is to publish model contract clauses that companies can use use for orientation.

DATA FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR:

In emergencies, such as natural catastrophes, public sector bodies must be provided with data that is required to deal with the emergency.

REGULATING DATA PROCESSING SERVICES,

ESPECIALLY CLOUD SERVICES:

The Data Act is intended to facilitate switching between similar ""data processing services"" (Chapter VI).

The generic term ""data processing services"" includes, inter alia, Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS).

These provisions are intended to break up the EU cloud market and facilitate the portability of data between cloud providers.

The regulations are very detailed and primarily cover technical and organisational measures, but also contractual details."
ADVANT Beiten,"EU Data Act: Action required for Connected Products, Related Services and Cloud Computing","The regulations are very detailed and primarily cover technical and organisational measures, but also contractual details.

For instance, a maximum limit for cancellation periods is provided for.

Furthermore, interfaces must be created for data transfer when exporting data between different cloud service providers.

In addition to these very detailed requirements in individual cases, however, there is also a seemingly endless ban on obstacles to switching (""In particular, providers of data processing services may not impose any pre-commercial, commercial, technical, contractual or organizational obstacles and must remove such obstacles"").

Exceptions apply to ""custom-built“ data processing services.

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER AND INTEROPERABILITY:

International data transfer is also specifically regulated to prevent unlawful access to non-personal data by foreign state authorities (Chapter VII).

However, the requirements are not identical to the provisions of the GDPR on data transfers to third countries.

Additionally, regulations on interoperability are provided for (Chapter VIII).

Late Changes to Definitions The law-making process for the Act started in early 2022.

There were still significant changes in the legislative process, even in provisions such as the definitions of ""connected product"" and ""related services"".

These are, however, fundamental to the area of application of the Act, specifically for determining who is considered a ""data holder"" and is thus affected by numerous obligations.

The European Commission’s initial draft still excluded devices such as PCs, Smartphones, and game consoles.

In the text which has been adopted now, they are no longer excluded.

The definition of the term ""connected product"" now reads as follows: ‘connected product’ means an item that obtains, generates or collects data concerning its use or environment and that is able to communicate product data via an electronic communications service, physical connection or on-device access, and whose primary function is not the storing, processing or transmission of data on behalf of any party other than the user; ‘related service’ means a digital service, other than an electronic communications service, including software, which is connected with the product at the time of the purchase, rent or lease in such a way that its absence would prevent the connected product from performing one or more of its functions, or which is subsequently connected to the product by the manufacturer or a third party to add to, update or adapt the functions of the connected product; Trade Secrets still little protected The obligation to share data may even extend to trade secrets, although there have also been some changes in the course of the legislative process.

It is striking to see that the protection of trade secrets appears to be weaker than under the GDPR.

In principle, the protection of trade secrets comprises a multi-level mechanism: the relevant data must first be identified as a trade secret by the data holder or trade secret holder.

The parties involved in the data transfer must then agree on contractual, technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the trade secrets to be transferred.

Model contractual terms will also be available for this purpose in future.

Once protective measures have been agreed, trade secrets must also be disclosed.

It remains unclear how a data holder should enforce these protective measures in practice vis-à-vis the recipients of the data, i.e. typically their own users or authorized third parties.

Basically, the disclosure of trade secrets can only be suspended if no agreement can be reached on the protective measures to be taken or if these are insufficiently implemented by the recipient of the data.

However, the latter will often be accompanied by the compromising of trade secrets."
ADVANT Beiten,"EU Data Act: Action required for Connected Products, Related Services and Cloud Computing","However, the latter will often be accompanied by the compromising of trade secrets.

Any decision to suspend the transfer of data must be justified by the data holder and reported to the competent authority.

The data holder may also refuse to disclose trade secrets ex ante in individual cases under exceptional circumstances if he can prove that the disclosure of the trade secret is very likely to cause him serious harm - in this case, too, the data holder must inform not only the user of the refusal, but also the competent national authority.

The threshold for the right to refuse (""highly likely to suffer serious economic damage"") has been somewhat weakened as of late, but is still very high.

This is regrettable from the perspective of the data holder or trade secret holder, as this ex ante right could in many cases be the most effective way of preventing the disclosure of trade secrets from the outset.

What about the GDPR?

Unlike the GDPR, the Data Act applies to both non-personal data and personal data.

The GDPR primarily serves to protect natural persons and creates a legal basis for the processing of personal data.

The Data Act, in contrast, primarily aims to realize the free movement of data.

The Data Act does not affect the GDPR, i.e. in cases where a connected product or a related service is used and personal data is also generated, both laws apply in parallel.

In particular, the Data Act is not intended to reduce the protection offered by the GDPR for personal data and therefore cannot serve as a legal basis for data processing under the GDPR.

In practice, this will probably cause more difficulties than it seems at first glance, especially if a connected product or a related service collects personal and non-personal data - in this case, the latter may have to be passed on, but the former may not (as far as persons other than the user are concerned) or not easily: In any case, the question then arises as to whether a legal basis within the meaning of the GDPR would allow a transfer.

This may create difficult situations for data holders in the future.

They must now decide more conclusively than before which data is actually personal data: Disclosure may not be mandatory for this data, but it is for data without a personal reference.

This is not made any easier by the fact that data from connected products will often have a ""relative"" personal reference - and the question of relative personal reference is currently before the ECJ.

There may also be discussions on the question of whether owners of trade secrets can rely on the fact that the GDPR appears to weigh their interests more heavily than the Data Act.

Timeline Following the adoption by the Council and the publication in the official journal, the Data Act will be directly applicable in all EU member states after a transitional period of 20 months, without the need for member state implementation of the regulations.

The so-called ""access by design"" obligation, i.e. the requirement to design (new) connected products and related services, only applies after a further 12 months.

Apart from this ""access by design"" obligation, however, the Data Act not only affects new connected products and related services, but also - at least in principle - those already on the market.

This means that owners of existing data records or existing data silos could potentially also be subject to the new rules, in particular the data provision obligations and the restrictions on data use (such as the requirement of a data licence agreement).

For such potential data holders in particular, the period of 20 months could be quite short to adequately prepare for the obligations of the Data Act.

ADVANT Beiten,It is high time to prepare for the European CO₂ Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),"The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) 1 has entered into force on 17 May 2023 and has been implemented gradually since October this year.

The CBMA requires importers of iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and chemicals (although for now only hydrogen is listed as chemical), as well as certain upstream and downstream products, to purchase CBAM certificates and to pay the difference between the CO₂ levy paid in the country of production and the levy due under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Furthermore, producers in third countries are obliged to provide information on their emissions.

Hence, it is high time to prepare for this.

Importers of products listed in Annex I of the CBAM Regulation will be required, during the transitional period from October 2023, to determine and calculate the direct and indirect emissions generated during the production of the imported goods, to report quarterly on direct and indirect CO₂ emissions in the country of origin and the carbon price paid in the third country (CBAM report), to register as a so-called CBAM declarant, being authorised to import products subject to CBAM from January 2026 and to acquire the necessary CBAM certificates.

The companies must submit their first reports by the end of January 2024.

In detail: CBAM and the European Green Deal

Four years ago, in 2019, the European Union as a pioneer in the fight against the climate crisis, set itself the goal of achieving CO₂ neutrality by 2050, delivering on the commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The European Green Deal is the overarching strategy implemented by more than fifteen new laws or changes to existing legislation, the so-called 'Fit for 55' package.

The goal is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

The 'Fit for 55' package 2 establishes the CBAM together with changes to the current EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

The CBAM should equalize the carbon price between domestic and foreign products.

In accordance with the applicable legislative procedure, the European Commission put forward a draft which was discussed by the European Parliament (EP) and the 27 Member States in the Council.

The draft was welcomed by the EP's Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee (ENVI) but the EP rejected the proposal as not ambitious enough.

It took several months to find a compromise.

Historical and legal context The EU has an Emissions Trading System (ETS) 3 for more than fifteen years and CBAM is designed to function in parallel with this system, complementing it for imported goods.

The ETS puts a cap on the amount of greenhouse gases companies are allowed to emit.

Within the cap it is possible to buy emission allowances that can be traded with.

Some of the allowances are auctioned, however, the rest of the allowances are given for free by the European Commission to certain sectors at risk of carbon leakage.

Carbon leakage refers to the problem of companies relocating their production offshore, to countries with fewer environmental protection.

CBAM addresses this issue, so that EU efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not undermined by production shifts causing increased emissions in non-European countries or by importing more CO₂-intensive products.

Even without counting the emissions caused by imports, the EU accounts for around 8 % of global carbon dioxide emissions.

It would be counterproductive and against the objective of the Paris Agreement to decrease emissions in the EU while importing more carbon-intensive products from non-EU countries.

How the CBAM works Under the CBAM, carbon pricing is done through the instrument of CBAM certificates, similar to ETS allowances.

""CBAM certificate"" means a certificate in elec-tronic format corresponding to one ton of embedded emissions in goods."
ADVANT Beiten,It is high time to prepare for the European CO₂ Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),"""CBAM certificate"" means a certificate in elec-tronic format corresponding to one ton of embedded emissions in goods.

Importers of certain energy-intensive goods must buy CBAM certificates to be allowed to import those goods into the EU.

The required number of CBAM certificates corresponds to the total embedded emissions of the imported goods.

If a company has already paid a CO₂ price for its emissions in the country of origin, Article 9 of the Regulation provides for the possibility of offsetting against the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered.

According to Art. 2 of the Regulation, third countries can also apply for an exemption from the CBAM if they have an equivalent carbon pricing mechanism or if there is a link with EU emissions trading system.

Imports of goods from these third countries are then outside the scope of the Regulation.

This already applies to goods originating in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

Such a linkage could also be considered in the future between the EU and the UK.

Following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the UK has introduced its own emissions trading scheme.

Currently, the UK and the EU are thinking about linking their emission trading schemes.

Indeed, a final decision has not yet been made.

Under the ETS free emission allowances are to be phased out for some EU producers and the product scope of the ETS and CBAM shall converge.

First, the allocation of free ETS allowances will be phased out from 2026 and completely discontinued from 2034.

In addition, the scope of the ETS will also be extended to aviation and shipping from 2024, and to road transport and buildings from 2027.

For the aviation sector, no more free certificates will be made available from 2026.

Moreover, a shortage of allowances is planned to increase the prices for emission allowances according to the principles of the market mechanism.

CBAM transition phase The CBAM Regulation is applicable since 1 October 2023.

Articles 32 et seq. of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 provide for a gradual introduction.

Under EU law, the legal basis of the CBAM is Article 192 para.

1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), which allows the Union to act to achieve the environmental and climate objectives specified in Article 191 para.

1 TFEU.

CBAM started with importer reporting obligations in October 2023.

Companies must now request access to the CBAM Transition Registry to submit quarterly reports.

Under a European implementing regulation adopted in August 4 , companies must report for the first time by the end of January 2024.

Failure to do so will result in penalties between €10 and €50 for each ton of unreported emissions.

The actual penalty will be determined pursuant to Art.

16 para.

3 of the Implementing Regulation

and can increase if the duration of non-reporting exceeds six months.

The information required in the report includes, in particular, the quantity of goods imported in tons, the total amount of direct and indirect CO₂ emissions per ton of each type of goods, and the CO₂ price paid for the imported goods in the country of origin, if any.

The submitted report can be modified until two months after the end of the relevant reporting quarter.

For the first two reporting periods, a modification is possible until 31 July 2024.

In principle, the reporting obligation rests on the importer within the EU of the CBAM goods.

However, the importer can transfer the reporting obligation to an indirect customs representative (e.g., the transport company) with consent.

Furthermore, the reporting obligation applies directly to the indirect customs representative when the importer is located outside the EU.

CBAM fully effective starting 2026

Once CBAM is fully effective starting 1 January 2026, both EU and non-EU companies importing goods into the EU subject to CBAM will be required to apply for the status of authorised CBAM declarant and purchase CBAM certificates."
ADVANT Beiten,It is high time to prepare for the European CO₂ Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),"The price of CBAM certificates is calculated based on the weekly average auction price of EU-ETS allowances, expressed in €/ton of carbon dioxide emitted.

If an EU importer can prove that it has already been paid a carbon price during the production of the imported good, the importer will only have to pay the difference between the amount paid and the price of a CBAM-certificate.

Economic consequences and legal issues As regards the economic consequences in the EU, the emissions-intensive industry considers that the lack of relief of the ETS burden for exports with the simultaneous expiry of the free allocation of certificates leads to imbalance and the increased risk of relocation of industries.

While EU-based manufacturers of emission-intensive raw materials would be protected from imports originating in countries with lower carbon dioxide prices, the export of emission-intensive raw materials from the Union would hardly be economically viable, as the production costs would no longer be competitive in international comparison without free allocation of allowances.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of August 2022 has raised additional concerns about a new subsidy race as well as a debate about the competitiveness of the European Union.

With respect to political considerations, several countries have already voiced their concerns, ranging from CBAM violating trade agreements to decrying it as blatant protectionism.

Brazil, South Africa, India and China have stressed the negative implications for developing countries.

In particular, many concerns have been voiced about the compatibility of CBAM with international law.

However, a CBAM compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is not per se impossible and could be justified on environmental grounds.

It could qualify as a border adjustable internal measure under GATT Article III or, if found to be discriminatory, could be justified under the general exceptions of GATT Article XX, relating to the conservation of ex-haustible natural resources (GATT Article XX(g)) or necessity to protect human, animal or plant life or health (GATT Article XX (b)).

Upcoming steps To fulfil the reporting obligations, companies must first check and identify whether and which imported goods are subject to CBAM.

Decisive are the CN codes of the respective goods listed in Annex I of the Regulation, and further guidance is given with sectoral factsheets.

5 In a second step, importers must obtain all CBAM-related information from their suppliers.

The Taxation and Customs Union Directorate-General (TAXUD) published guidance documents for importers in the EU and their suppliers outside the EU, together with templates.

6

The contractual transfer of the reporting obligation to an indirect customs representative and the related contractual hedging of risks (e.g., in relation to late or inaccurate reporting) must be considered.

If there is an own reporting obligation, access to the CBAM Transitional Registry must be requested.

The quarterly reports must then be completed and submitted no later than one month after the end of the quarter in question, first time at the end of January 2024.

If the required information is not yet available, the respective importer may use default values made available and published by European Commission for the transitional period until 31 July 2024."

ADVANT Beiten,Placing information in a virtual data room - BGH concretizes obliga-tions to disclose information for sellers in the context of a buyer's due diligence,"In its judgment of September 15, 2023 (File No. V ZR 77/22), the Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) concretized the obligations to disclose information of a commercial real estate seller in connection with the provision of a virtual data room.

A seller who grants the buyer access to a virtual data room with documents and information on the object of purchase only fulfils its obligation of disclosing information if and to the extent that it can have a legitimate expectation based on the circumstances that the buyer would gain knowledge of a circumstance subject to disclosure by inspecting the data room.

The decision is likely to have relevance beyond the individual case for the question of the extent to which documents which are placed in a virtual data room at short notice as part of an asset or share deal in M&A or other transactions are suitable for satisfying any disclosure obligations on the part of the seller.

Facts of the case The plaintiff buyer withdrew from a purchase contract for several commercial real estate properties and demanded damages from the defendant seller because the latter had concealed certain facts in the course of the contract negotiations in disregard of its duty to inform the buyer.

At the time the contract was concluded, the properties were subject to a considerable financial risk regarding impending special cost allocations.

During the contract negotiations, the seller had granted the buyer access to a virtual data room in which it had placed documents relating to the purchase object.

However, it was not until the last working day before the day of notarization that it posted a collection of further documents that allowed conclusions to be drawn as to the aforementioned risk.

The Regional Court had dismissed the action in the first instance.

The appeal was unsuccessful.

In response to the plaintiff's appeal, the Federal Court of Justice has now essentially reversed the judgment and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal for a new decision.

The Federal Court of Justice states in this regard, among other things: According to the established case law of the FCJ, in contract negotiations each contracting party has the duty to inform the other party of circumstances that could frustrate the purpose of the contract and are therefore of material importance to the other party's decision, provided that the other party may reasonably expect the information in good faith, considering the prevailing public perception.

This also applies to the financial risks mentioned here, whereas the seller's duty to provide information had not been fulfilled or had ceased to apply despite the buyer's performance of due diligence by the fact that it had placed the aforementioned documents in the virtual data room shortly before the day of the notarisation without further reference.

The question as to whether a seller, by setting up a physical or virtual data room, satisfies its duty to give information to the subsequent buyer about a circumstance which is subject to disclosure and which is available as information in the data room cannot be answered in general terms and regardless of the circumstances of the individual case.

The mere fact that the seller sets up a data room and allows the prospective buyer to access the data does not always allow the conclusion that the buyer will also take note of a circumstance that had to be disclosed, given the diversity of processes in practice.

Only if the expectation was justified in the individual case that the buyer will perceive certain information provided by the seller in the data room and consider it in his purchase decision, separate disclosure by the seller was dispensable.

Whether the seller may have this expectation depends on the circumstances of the individual case, for example, on how the data room and access to it is structured and organized, as well as on the nature of the information to be disclosed and the document in which it is contained."
ADVANT Beiten,Placing information in a virtual data room - BGH concretizes obliga-tions to disclose information for sellers in the context of a buyer's due diligence,"If, for instance, a circumstance is involved which - recognisable to the seller - is of very considerable importance to the buyer, maybe because it could frustrate the purpose of the contract or cause very considerable economic damage to the buyer, and if the circumstance is not instantly recognisable from the data provided, but is known to the seller and can be easily disclosed, then the buyer can regularly expect a separate indication.

In this case, the seller may not wait knowingly to see whether the buyer determines the information that is difficult to recognize from the data provided but must communicate this despite the Due Diligence.

Whether the circumstance was instantly recognisable from the data provided or not could also depend on the type of document and in which position within the document the information was available.

In addition, it is also relevant whether the seller may expect the buyer to look through the documents specifically for this information or rather with a view to general information.

In the specific case, the seller could not have had the legitimate expectation that the buyer would take note of the information contained in the most recently posted documents before the contract was concluded.

It can be gathered from the grounds of the judgment that the BGH bases this primarily on the fact that the documents were only posted so shortly before the date of notarization.

Apart from that, the BGH also seems to consider how easy or difficult it was to find the critical information in the posted documents.

However, it is not clear from the judgement whether these two aspects correlate, for instance, in the sense that early posting cures lack of clarity or clarity cures short-term posting, cannot be inferred from the judgment.

Sellers should thus ensure that information which is of particular relevance to the buyer's decision is sufficiently accessible and included in the data room in good time before the contract is concluded.

In case of doubt, a separate explicit (and documented) reference is recommended.

ADVANT Beiten,Guidelines for the Effective Agreement of Non-Compete Clauses,"Non-compete clauses are aN integral part of sale and purchase Agreements, cooperation agreements, AND EXECUtiVE and employment contracts.

This article outlines the contractual possibilities, the Legal limits, and what to do where there is a breach of contract.

What are non-compete clauses?

There are different types of contractual non-compete arrangements.

Non-compete clauses prohibit directors, board members, and employees from working for a direct competitor while employed or from competing with the company/employer in another form without the company’s consent.

In cooperative agreements, non-compete clauses prohibit the parties from using the other party’s know-how or customer information to compete with them.

Non-solicitation agreements ensure that neither party poaches employees from the other party.

In certain circumstances, such contractual non-compete clauses can form collateral agreements to supply or cooperation agreements, contracts for the sale and purchase of a company, and outsourcing agreements.

Statutory non-compete provisions also exist.

Section 88 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) prevents members of the management board from competing with the company without the consent of the supervisory board.

For directors of limited liability companies, this rule is not enshrined in statute but derives from their fiduciary duty, i.e., their obligation of loyalty towards the company due to their position on the management board of the company.

This principle also applies with some differences to certain shareholders (e.g., personally liable partners of a general partnership (OHG) and limited partnership (KG), or majority shareholders of a limited liability company (GmbH)).

However, such statutory non-compete provisions end with the termination of the board or shareholder position.

Once their activities for the company cease, managers, members of the board, and employees are generally free to change companies, compete against the company, and even poach customers or employees.

Companies may therefore wish to prevent managers and strategically important employees from working for the competition or competing with the company after the end of their employment (so-called post-contractual non-compete clause).

Such contractual clauses may be broader in scope for directors than employees.

Conditions for effective contractual non-compete clauses Non-compete clauses must be clear and self-evident.

The object and scope must be clearly defined.

The primary object and purpose of a non-compete clause should be the protection of the legitimate interests of the benefitting company.

Such clauses are permissible provided the freedom to carry out professional activities and the freedom to compete are not unduly impaired.

In addition, the non-compete clause must be limited in object, duration, and geographic scope.

The case law has developed guidelines for the objective and geographical limits of post-contractual, non-compete clauses.

Geographically, a non-compete clause must be limited to the company’s field of activity.

Where a company is only active in a region, the non-compete clause may only apply to this region.

Where the company is active throughout Germany or Europe-wide, the geographic scope will be correspondingly broader.

On duration: any non-compete clause may only apply for two years after the end of the employment relationship.

If agreements with employees exceed these limits, the objective and/or geographic application and/or duration will be reduced to preserve validity, i.e., the maximum permissible scope will be considered valid.

However, post-contractual non-compete clauses for directors and managers and non-compete clauses between companies will be invalid where they exceed the objective or geographical limits.

Where a non-compete clause only exceeds the permissible duration, it may be reduced to the maximum permissible duration to preserve validity."
ADVANT Beiten,Guidelines for the Effective Agreement of Non-Compete Clauses,"Where a non-compete clause only exceeds the permissible duration, it may be reduced to the maximum permissible duration to preserve validity.

The limits of post-contractual non-compete clauses While activity-based, non-compete clauses prevent managers or employees from performing certain activities, company-based non-compete clauses prevent them from working for (certain) competing companies, suppliers or customers.

The limits of activity and company-based non-compete clauses are fluid.

However, a prohibition against working for a competitor in all respects is probably invalid because, in most cases, it would result in an inadmissible occupational ban.

When managing directors leave a company, there is a danger that they will entice customers away from the company.

Therefore, instead of prohibiting the director from performing certain activities, they will be prohibited from using the company’s customer base.

Such agreements are permissible when they are limited to customers with whom the company had business relations within the last three years.

Companies may not issue a blanket prohibition preventing an outgoing director from investing capital in a competitor.

However, a company may agree on a non-compete clause with majority shareholders, who can exercise influence over the management and operative business of the company.

Is compensation necessary?

To compensate an (ex-)employee for the limitations imposed by a post-contractual non-compete clause, the law provides that the company shall pay the employee financial compensation (see § 74 (2) of the Commercial Code (HGB)).

Compensation should be equivalent to at least 50% of the most recent contractual remuneration per month.

If the employment agreement contains a two-year, post-contractual non-compete clause and the employee earned EUR 5,000/month in the month before their employment was terminated, the employer must pay the employee compensation of at least EUR 2,500 per month for two years.

Different rules apply to directors.

Where a post-contractual clause only prevents customer poaching, the company will not need to pay the (ex-)director compensation.

For further reaching post-contractual restraints, compensation will need to be paid as, without it, the non-compete clause will be invalid.

Possible courses of action in the case of a breach of the non-compete clause If a director breaches the non-compete obligation arising from their fiduciary duty, the company will have several courses of action.

First, the company can demand that the director cease and desist the actions in breach.

In addition, the company can choose whether to seek damages from the director or the restitution of proceeds (skimmed profits).

The latter has the advantage that the company does not need to prove that it would have achieved the same profits.

Securing contractual non-compete clauses with contractual penalties has proven useful in practice.

This has the advantage for the company that the amount of the damages and income made by the director as a result of the breach are not in dispute.

If a breach of the non-compete clause is shown, the contractual penalty will be due for payment.

In addition, contractual penalties – in contrast to damages claims – are payable regardless of fault, as a rule, which means there is no need to provide proof of a culpable breach of the non-compete provision.

Non-compete clauses between companies in cooperation and supply agreements and sale and purchase agreements Non-compete clauses between companies restrict competition and are subject to antitrust law.

However, they are still permissible under certain conditions.

Non-compete clauses are permissible and valid as collateral agreements when and to the extent they are necessary, for example, to protect a contractual partner from the other partner’s disloyal use of know-how or customer information."
ADVANT Beiten,Guidelines for the Effective Agreement of Non-Compete Clauses,"The decisive question is whether the non-compete obligation is so intrinsic that the cooperation stands and falls with the non-compete clause, i.e., would the parties have agreed to cooperate without the contractually agreed protections against poaching customers and engaging in mutual competition?

If the non-compete clause forbids all competing activities, it will be invalid.

It is possible, for example, to prevent the contractual partners from using the other partner’s know-how or customer data to engage in competition, providing the prohibition is limited objectively and geographically, and by duration.

Contracts for the sale and purchase of companies often prohibit the seller from competing with the target business.

Non-compete clauses must be limited to those goods (including improved versions and successor models) and services, which form the target’s business purpose.

When drafting non-compete clauses, parties can refer to the definition of competitor in § 4 (1) No. 4 of the Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG), i.e., the direct competitor, to clarify which activities are considered direct competition and are prohibited.

Geographically, non-compete clauses should be limited to the area in which the target offered its goods or services for sale and/or to the region in which the target invested before the sale.

The agreement should also include a contractual penalty to penalise breaches of the non-compete clause.

The deterrent effect of the penalty will encourage compliance.

What applies to non-solicitation clauses for employees?

Agreements between companies which prevent solicitation or hiring of employees who work for the other party can only be effective when: the conduct of the poaching company is unethical under the Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG).

This includes soliciting employees to deliberately hinder or damage competitors.

the prohibition against solicitation is not the main purpose of the agreement but merely a collateral clause, which meets the needs of a special relationship of trust between the parties or one party’s need for protection.

This will be the case for the sale of a company: the purchaser will have a legitimate interest in preventing the seller from poaching skilled workers immediately after the transaction, reducing the company’s value.

Generally, a non-solicitation provision may have a maximum post-contractual duration of two years.

In practice, however, non-solicitation clauses offer only limited protection because it is difficult to prove whether an employee was poached or changed employers of their own volition.

Conclusion The assessment of whether and to what extent non-compete clauses are permissible always involves a complex balancing of interests.

The company’s (legitimate) interests in a non-compete clause must be weighed against the personal interests of the other party in the free exercise of their profession and the general interest in the freedom of competition.

The case law provides key principles and guidelines for practice.

It is particularly important to note that the object and the scope of any non-compete clause must be clearly defined, and the objective and geographic reach and duration of the prohibition must fall within certain limits.

What this means in a specific case will depend on various factors.

You should therefore take caution when formulating and drafting contractual non-compete clauses and seek legal advice on this issue.

ADVANT Beiten,20th Amendment to the Foreign Trade and payments Regulation: What’s New?,"On 4 October 2023, the Twentieth Regulation to Amend the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation (Verordnung zur Änderung der Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) was published in the German Federal Gazette.

Digitalisation

The amendments make it possible for administrative acts under the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation ( Außenwritschaftsverordnung, AWV ) to be issued in electronic form.

Applications, notifications, information, files, reports, and other documents will also be able to be submitted via an administrative portal.

The amendments bring the AWV into line with the Act to Promote Electronic Administration and Improve Online Access to Administrative Services ( Gesetze zur Förderung der elektronischen Verwaltung und zur Verbesserung des Onlinezugangs zu Verwaltungsdienstleistungen ).

All documents required for the investment review under §§ 14a, 15 and 23 of the AWV (including documents on the acquisition of a domestic company and information for the Central Customs Office, the German Federal Bank, or the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA)) should be submitted via the administrative portal.

While the electronic procedure is preferred, in limited cases it will still be possible to submit documents in conventional paper form.

Remember the pitfalls: uploading information or an application into the administrative portal will not trigger the prescribed periods (initiation) under § 14a of the AWG; instead, the point of time specified in § 3 (4) of the AWV (new version) will apply.

Accordingly, information or an application submitted via the administrative portal will only be considered submitted once the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) has imported the submitted documents in entirety and without any issues from the administrative portal to the Ministry’s IT system.

Once this has occurred, the Ministry will confirm the submission of the documents and inform the purchaser if the documents are incomplete or corrupted, where possible.

The suspension of time periods under § 14a (6) of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (AWG) is also tied to the import of the relevant documents.

Arms control The Amendment also introduces new restrictive measures against states like Russia, Somalia and Haiti, bringing the AWV into line with various resolutions of the Council of the European Union (CFSP).

The amended Regulation also included the agreed 2022 amendments to the Wassenaar Arrangement for Conventional Arms.

The list of military goods of the European Union previously included these changes.

New authorisation requirements for PMI rigid foam technologies A further amendment introduces an authorisation requirement for the export of development and production technologies for polymethacrylimide (PMI) rigid foam.

This introduction supplements Annex I of the Dual Use Regulation.

The characteristics of the PMI rigid foam mean it can be used in modern military applications, particularly in the aerospace industry, which justifies the authorisation requirement.

According to the draft bill, the Federal Government is going to work to ensure that these technologies are included in the Wassenaar Arrangement for Conventional Arms in order to create a level playing field for all companies affected.

Summary and outlook The new 20th Regulation Amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation simplifies the administrative procedures in foreign trade through digital procedures.

In the future, a new administrative portal will allow all documents to be submitted online.

The amendments also introduce the possibility for administrative acts to be enacted electronically in the future.

2023

I Nr. 272 vom 12.10.2023 ].

The core part is the new Consumer Rights Enforcement Act (VDuG).

Organizations can now initiate actions for redress.

We already reported on the legislative procedure in our blog.

The law brings some innovations for consumers.

We reported on these in our blog post in July [ [ The new collective action lawsuit - Consumer Rights Enforcement Act has been passed in the Bundestag | Advant Beiten (advant-beiten.com) ].

Overview of the most relevant features: Qualified consumer organizations can bring similar claims of consumers against a company by means of an action for redress.

Qualified entities from EU member states can also bring cross-border actions for redress before German courts.

Companies with less than ten employees and an annual turnover below EUR 2 million may join an action for redress in the same way as consumers.

In order to bring an action for redress at least 50 consumers have to be potentially affected.

Consumers must register their claims in a register.

With the action for redress consumer organizations can directly sue for payment to consumers.

The court can furthermore determine a collective total amount for all claims raised.

Within the framework of an implementation procedure, a court-appointed trustee fulfils the claims of the concerned consumers out of this amount.

The new action for redress can significantly relieve the courts' workload in the coming years.

This is to be welcomed.

It will also make it easier for consumers to pursue their claims.

Whether organizations and consumers will accept the action for redress as a new option for legal protection will be seen in the course of the next few years.

ADVANT Beiten,Cabling of Solar and Wind Parks – Groundbreaking new draft legislation to expedite grid connection!,"On 16 August 2023, the Federal Government approved a revision of the Renewable Energy Act which shall force land owners to tolerate the usage of their land for the erection of the cable lines connecting renewable energy projects to the anticipated grid connection point (new Section 11a Renewable Energy Act).

The obligation shall apply to both private and public land owners.

In turn, the respective land owner shall be entitled to a compensation equal to 5 per cent of the market value of the area used for the cabling.

The obligation to tolerate shall be subject to the following two exceptions: it shall not apply (i) if this would unreasonably impair the use of the respective property or (ii) the respective property serves national and alliance defense, including the fulfillment of international obligations.

The new law is expected to significantly facilitate the timely connection of renewable energy projects to the public grid.

The burdensome task of seeking the land owners consent would be, in principle, not required any more.

Further, the new legislation shall obligate land owners to tolerate the crossing and overturning of their land plots for the erection of wind turbines and the upgrading of their land plots for the crossing by the trucks shipping the wind turbines (new Section 11b Renewable Energy Act).

The new legislation is part of the so-called Solarpaket 1 which is anticipated to be resolved by the Federal Parliament in autumn.

The afore-described obligation to tolerate cabling is expected to become a highly controversial point during the hearings as farmers oppose to the new law.

Please find below an convenient translation of the new draft law.

Right to lay cable lines (1) The owner and the beneficial owner of a property shall tolerate on their property the laying, erection, maintenance, repair, protection and operation of electric lines as well as control and communication lines (lines) and other facilities for the connection of plants for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources to the interconnection point pursuant to section 8 (1) to (3) as well as direct lines within the meaning of section 3 number 12 of the Energy Industry Act.

The operator of the line and third parties commissioned by them shall be entitled to enter and drive onto the property for this purpose.

The obligation to tolerate shall not apply insofar as this would unreasonably impair the use of the property or the property serves national and alliance defense, including the fulfillment of international obligations.

As a rule, the operator may only use those private plots of land that are required to establish the most economically advantageous connection.

The line and other facilities shall not become essential parts of the land within the meaning of Section 94(1) of the Civil Code.

(2) Due to the owner tolerating the use of the land plot in accordance with paragraph 1, the operator shall pay to the owner a one-time payment of 5 per cent of the market value of the protected of the market value of the protected strip area used.

Claims for damages on the part of the owner of the land and of the right-of-use shall remain unaffected.

The operator is obligated to keep the damage incurred by the property owner and the right-of-use owner as low as possible.

After laying the line, the operator shall hand over to the owner of the property and the right-of-use owner an as-built plan showing the course of the line and the protective strips on the property.

(3) The owner of the property and the person entitled to use the property shall refrain from all measures that endanger or impair the existence or operation of the line or other facilities.

The owner of the property may demand the relocation of the line if the position at the previous location is no longer reasonable for them.

The operator shall bear the costs of the relocation."

ADVANT Beiten,Interim relief from an incorrect list of shareholders after a resolution,"The rule of effective legal protection requires that a shareholder must be able to obtain interim relief for the registration of an (almost certainly) incorrect list of shareholders even after the adoption of a resolution.

It would otherwise not be possible to obtain effective legal protection solely due to the chronological sequence of events.

JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL OF BERLIN OF 17 MAY 2023 IN CASE NO.

23

U 14/23 Facts of the case At a meeting of shareholders, to which the majority shareholder concerned was not properly invited, the remaining shareholders adopted a resolution to withdraw the shares of the majority shareholder.

In a subsequent shareholder meeting, it was decided the remaining shareholdings should be increased.

Following these shareholder meetings, the company submitted a new list of shareholders to the register court: it only listed the remaining shareholders.

According to § 16 (1) of the Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG), the entry of the new shareholder list in the commercial register effectively executes the resolution of shareholders because only the shareholder list in the commercial register acts as a (de facto) appointment of shareholders who can exercise certain rights (legitimisation effect).

The District Court of Berlin (Landgericht) granted the requested interim relief and required the respondent company to continue to treat the (excluded) majority shareholder as a shareholder.

Further, the company was required to generate a shareholder list which showed the status quo without the withdrawal of shares and to submit this list to the register court.

The District Court of Berlin (judgment of 21 December 2022 in Case No. 96 O 30/22) and the Court of Appeal (Kammergericht, KG, judgment of 17 May 2023 in Case No. 23 U 14/23) confirmed the interim measures.

Background Considering the duration of proceedings for an action for annulment or positive declarative, interim measures can have enormous significance, especially for defective resolutions.

Without the option of granting an interim injunction, particularly after the adoption of a resolution (such as on a dismissal), the challenged resolution would have to be treated as effective, at least for a preliminary period.

On average, many years pass before a judgment on the organisation will be effective.

Nevertheless, the interim injunction will not mean that the resolution is declared void, it will just suspend the implementation of the resolution.

Fundamentally, the interim injunction should only preliminarily review the shareholder list.

To the extent that the company attempts to deliberately undermine the shareholder’s possible legal protections by immediately submitting a new shareholder list to the responsible register court, there will be, in exceptional cases, a claim for the register of the corrected shareholder list, which shows the status quo without the (suspected unlawful) resolution, in addition to the ban on the submission of a changed shareholder list.

This claim for abatement or removal is the extension of preventative injunctive relief against the registration of a newly configured shareholder list.

In this respect, the interim relief is more wide-reaching than the registration of an appeal.

An appeal against registration in the commercial register will only protect against the bona fide acquisition of shares under § 16 (3) of the GmbHG, but not against the treatment as a non-shareholder.

If the respondent is ordered to continue to treat the applicant as a shareholder and to submit a corrected shareholder list, the former shareholder list will effectively continue to apply until the final judgment of the Court."
ADVANT Beiten,Interim relief from an incorrect list of shareholders after a resolution,"According to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the registration of the shareholder list with the ousted shareholder will constitute the necessary grounds for the grant of an interim injunction under §§ 935 and 940 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO).

The fact that the shareholder can no longer exercise their shareholder rights due to the deletion constitutes a significant disadvantage that must be averted, within the meaning of § 940 of the ZPO.

The remaining shareholders could otherwise use the duration of the main proceedings to generate advantages for themselves due to the legitimation effect of § 16 (1) of the GmbHG and to restructure the company as they see fit.

All resolutions adopted while the judgment in the main proceeding is pending would remain effective even if the shareholder wins.

Resolutions amending the articles of association or the corporate structure, adopted under the changed power structures, can either no longer be reversed or can only be reversed with disproportionate effort from the majority shareholder.

Where the requirements are met, the shareholder may be entitled to damages from their fellow shareholders.

In the case of unlawful removal from the company and the immediate submission of a new shareholder list to the register court, such a claim could arise under § 826 of the Civil Code (BGB).

Use of a formal legal position conveyed by the newly registered shareholder list should be viewed as damage inflicted in a manner offending common decency (see Judgment of the Federal Court of Justice (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGH) of 6 December 2022 in Case No. II

ZR 187/21).

Comments The judgment of the Court of Appeal represents a change to the jurisprudence of the higher courts on the question of interim protection against shareholder resolutions.

A shareholder, who fears that they might be removed from the company, can apply for an interim injunction in the run-up to the shareholder meeting.

Where a shareholder meeting already took place, resulting in the (unlawful) removal of the shareholder, the shareholder can seek an interim injunction against the entry of the new shareholder list in the commercial register.

Moreover, under the new case law of the Court of Appeal, the company may be ordered to submit a corrected shareholder list to the register court for registration in the commercial register.

ADVANT Beiten,Federal Government of Germany approved on the establishment of Commercial Courts,"On 16 August 2023, the German Federal Government passed the draft of the „Justizstandorts-Stärkungsgesetz“ regarding the establishment of commercial courts and English as language of the proceedings submitted by Federal Minister of Justice Dr Buschmann [ BMJ - Press Releases ].

We have already reported on the first key points (see our blog post of 7 February 2023) and the draft bill (see our blog post of 27 April 2023).

Compared to the draft bill, the draft of the Federal Government contains the following changes: Disputes in the area of intellectual property, copyright and under the Act against unfair competition (Gesetz gegen unlauteren Wettbewerb) shall not be brought before a commercial court (Sec. 119b (1) s. 2 GVG (new)).

If a third party is involved in the legal dispute, it shall no longer be possible to change the language of the proceedings from English to German.

The third party may request for an interpreter (Sec. 184a (4) GVG (new)).

A third party may also be included in the proceedings by means of a legal document in English.

The third party may object the service of this document within two weeks only if he or she does not understand English (Sec. 616 (1) ZPO (new)).

In addition to enforceable court decisions, it shall now be possible to translate settlement agreements pursuant to Sec.

794 (1) No. 1 ZPO into German.

A translation shall only be made upon the request of a party (Sec. 617 (1), (2) ZPO (new)).

It should also be possible to refer a legal dispute to a commercial court if the jurisdiction of a commercial court is only established by a counterclaim or an extension of the statement of claim (Sec. 620 (2) ZPO (new)).

The commercial court at first instance shall agree with the parties as early as possible in an organisation meeting on the organisation and conduct of the proceedings.

These agreements are to gain in greater significance through the application of Sec.

224, 296 and 356 ZPO (Sec.

621 sentence 2 ZPO (new)).

Among other things, the limit of EUR 1 million for the amount in dispute, which was already provided in the draft bill, and the possibility for the Federal Court of Justice to continue the proceedings in German at its own discretion have been retained.

Thus, the Federal Government's draft retains two provisions that could reduce the attractiveness of the commercial courts.

It remains to be seen whether further proposed amendments will be incorporated into the bill in the upcoming parliamentary process in the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) and Federal Council (Bundesrat).

In contrast, the Court held that companies can generally seek recourse for cartel damages claims.

Damages from cartel fines and cartel damages claims If hardcore cartel infringements lead to fining procedures, companies can face significant fines of up to ten percent of the worldwide group turnover.

Fines in the hundreds of millions or even billions are therefore almost commonplace.

Once fining procedures conclude, further danger looms.

Companies that have suffered damage as a result of the infringement can claim compensation for that damage.

Cartel damages claims do not have any upper limit, the participants in the cartel are joint and severally liable, and interest applies from the time the damage first occurred.

In practice, cartel damages claims often significantly exceed the fines imposed.

Recourse from board members and managing directors who participated in the cartel?

In such cases, companies regularly face the question of whether they can – or even must - seek recourse personally from board members or managing directors that participated in the cartel infringement or breached their supervisory duties for the damages caused by the fines against the company or even for cartel damages claims.

In line with the “ARAG Garmenbeck” case, the supervisory board of a stock corporation must independently examine whether cartel damages claims against the company can be enforced against directors.

If the supervisory board concludes that the company has enforceable damages claims, the board must pursue these claims unless there are strong reasons in the interests of the company not to do so.

Indeed, the personal assets of board members will often not be sufficient to offset the damages caused.

However, D&O insurance and the D&O insurer can reduce any liability gap.

For a claim against managing directors and board members and, indirectly, against their D&O insurers to be successful, the board must be personally liable for any antitrust fines imposed on and cartel damages claims awarded against their company.

This is a matter of some debate in Germany, and the highest courts have not yet decided the issue.

The courts of first instance have had differing views on this issue: the District Courts in Düsseldorf (railway track cartel), Saarbrucken (sanitary cartel) and Düsseldorf (stainless steel) objected to directors being personally liable for antitrust fines against companies.

Meanwhile, in an indicative ruling ( Hinweisbeschluss ), the District Court in Dortmund (railway track cartel) took a different view.

Judgment of the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf of 27 July 2023 In its judgment of 27 July 2023, the Higher Regional Court ( Oberlandesgericht, OLG ) in Düsseldorf confirmed the lower court judgment and – like the District Court in Düsseldorf – held that recourse could not be sought for antitrust fines against companies.

Essentially, a company must pay any fine against it to fulfil the fine's preventative purpose.

If companies could pass fines on to managing directors and board members, companies could escape their legal responsibility for cartel infringements in the form of fines.

The OLG Düsseldorf also rejected the possibility for companies to seek recourse for their fact-finding and defence costs due to the close practical link these costs had to the fines on the company.

In contrast, the Court confirmed that managing directors and board members could be found personally liable for damages caused to the company by compensation payments to parties injured by the cartel."
ADVANT Beiten,Liability of board members and managing directors for antitrust infringements –NO recourse for fines but possible recourse for cartel damages claims,"In contrast, the Court confirmed that managing directors and board members could be found personally liable for damages caused to the company by compensation payments to parties injured by the cartel.

The OLG Düsseldorf has allowed the appeal, paving the way for the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof, BGH ) to clarify this controversial issue of law.

Comments and practical tip

The judgment of the OLG Düsseldorf is persuasive only in certain aspects.

If members of company organs were to be found personal liable, it would contradict the preventative purpose of fining companies under antitrust law and is therefore ruled out.

In contrast, the position of the OLG Düsseldorf on the ability to seek recourse from directors and board members for damages suffered by a company for compensation paid for cartel damages is not convincing.

The Court overlooks the special nature of cartel damages claims law - influenced by EU law.

In enacting § 33a of the Act Against Restraints of Competition (GWB), German legislators created an “effective system of civil law sanctions” with “significant deterrent effect,” also to implement EU antitrust law.

Subsequently, the BGH recognised the preventative purpose of cartel damages claims and even held that this purpose takes priority over compensation considerations (rail train cartel IV).

Accordingly, cartel damages claims and antitrust fines must have the same treatment: both serve preventative purposes.

This preventative purpose would not be served if the fine and/or settlement could be shifted to a managing director or board member.

The practical importance of this legal question is significant.

Directly at stake is the obligation to assess whether recourse can be sought from board members and, where the chances of success are favourable, to pursue these claims.

Indirectly, it affects not “only” whether such risks can be insured, but also the possibility to grant amnesty to board members in order to ensure their cooperation within the framework of the leniency programme.

This is particularly important under antitrust law and in practice.

It also affects the possible binding effect of the fining decision in regress litigation and the relationship between recourse claims and direct claims against board members for fines under administrative law (§§ 9 and 130 of the Act on Regulatory Offences, OWiG ) or compensation (§ 826 Civil Code, BGB).

Moreover, the question of whether recourse can be sought from board members for fines against companies arises not only in antitrust law but also, for example, under data protection law, the Act on Due Diligence in the Supply Chain and capital markets law.

Regardless of how the BGH finally answers this question: managing directors and board members will avoid liability risks if they comply with their compliance obligations and can provide evidence of this – often years later – through careful documentation.

If a director or officer has not breached their duties, the company will have no grounds to seek recourse from them, even if the BGH affirms that companies can generally seek recourse for fines and compensation payments.

ADVANT Beiten,Dismissal of a supervisory board member for serious grounds related to conduct,"The conduct of a supervisory board member can form serious grounds for dismissal, even when that conduct is not directly related to their position on the supervisory board.

Supervisory board members can be removed for good cause even when they are accused of misconduct not directly connected to their activities on the supervisory board.

In its judgment of 1 March 2022, the Higher Regional Court (OLG) in Karlsruhe clearly confirmed this principle and established practical standards for the dismissal of supervisory board members for good cause, which go beyond those in the case in question.

Facts of the case In the case before the OLG Karlsruhe, the supervisory board of a large SE requested that the court remove one of its members for good cause.

The supervisory board member in question was also an employee of the company and had served as the union representative on the supervisory board since 2019.

At the same time, he was chairman of the works council.

A whistleblower report contained a suspicion that a colleague of the supervisory board member, who was also a member of the works council, often cut work without applying for leave over several years.

As part of the internal investigation into these suspicions, the supervisory board member manipulated emails and documents in which the accused colleague (supposedly) sent his apology for not being at works council meetings because he was on “leave”.

The supervisory board member later admitted this conduct to the supervisory board and justified his manipulation with the argument that he wanted to help his colleague.

The company terminated the employment relationship of the supervisory board member extraordinarily.

In addition, the supervisory board applied to the registry court to have the supervisory board member removed from office for good cause under Art. 9 (1) (c) ii) of the SE Regulation (SE-Verordnung) and § 103 (3) first sentence of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

The register court granted the application and removed the supervisory board member from office for good cause.

The supervisory board member appealed to the OLG Karlsruhe.

The judgment The Higher Regional Court in Karlsruhe confirmed the judgment of the register court and affirmed that there was good cause on the part of the supervisory board member.

There will be good cause on the part of the supervisory board member when, based on the circumstances of the case and upon the carrying out of a balancing of interests, it would be unreasonable for the supervisory board member to remain on the board until the end of his term of office.

This will be the case especially when the functioning of the supervisory board would be considerably impaired, or it could be expected to cause other damage to the company.

Above all, the question is what significance the reasons used in this specific case for the dismissal have for the interests of the company in a functioning supervisory board.

It should be noted that the supervisory board exercises its mandate in the interests of the company, and the interests of supervisory board members must, therefore, take a back seat to company interests.

In addition, there will not only be good cause when the supervisory board member breaches his duties on the board.

It is sufficient for dismissal for good cause – regardless of whether the conduct was in the exercise of his board duties or otherwise – if and to the extent that the conduct of the supervisory board member has specific adverse effects (i) for the course of business or (ii) on the reputation of the company or (iii) that would jeopardise the trust and cooperation within the supervisory board.

This would also apply to purely private misconduct.

For good cause based on conduct, there must only be an apparent connection to the work of the supervisory board.

The connection between the work of the supervisory board and the conduct constituting good cause will suffice if the conduct affects the company."
ADVANT Beiten,Dismissal of a supervisory board member for serious grounds related to conduct,"The connection between the work of the supervisory board and the conduct constituting good cause will suffice if the conduct affects the company.

This will be the case, for example, when the conduct threatens to damage the reputation of the company.

It is also sufficient if one could conclude from the misconduct that the supervisory board member is not suited to serve on the board and/or there is at least an actual connection between the misconduct and the activities of the supervisory board.

Even a conflict of duties (the supervisory board member was also the chairman of the works council) neither eliminates the breach of duty as such nor means the conduct is less serious and no longer constitutes good cause.

It is not possible to split the conduct of a person.

Measured against this standard, the supervisory board member destroyed the company's trust in his personal integrity and reliability and proved that he is unsuited to exercise the company’s interests in the functioning supervision of the board as a supervisory board member.

Consequently, there was good cause in this case.

Comments In its judgment, the OLG Karlsruhe provided clear standards for the dismissal from office as a supervisory board member for good cause by the register court.

The judgment provides an important guide for practice.

In particular, the Court determined with welcome clarity that misconduct outside of the actions of the board and even purely private misconduct can constitute good cause for the dismissal of a supervisory board member.

At the same time, the OLG Karlsruhe made it clear that not just any misstep outside of the activities of the board would suffice for good cause.

Misconduct must affect the company, which can hold true in particular where the misconduct would damage the reputation of the company.

This includes the interests of the company in the personal integrity of the members of the supervisory board.

Supervisory board members should be aware that, in their exposed position, they primarily serve the interests of the company.

In this respect, there is no clear split between the sphere of their activities for the supervisory board and other activities for the company (such as a member of the works council) and, in some cases, even conduct in the private sphere.

Accordingly, misconduct outside of the activities of the supervisory board can constitute good cause for dismissal.

ADVANT Beiten,The applicability of the UN CISG on the arbitration agreement,"Judgments of the Federal Court of Justice of 26 November 2020 in case No.

I ZR 245/19 and the Court of Cassation of 28 September 2022 in Case

No.  20-20.260 Both the material validity of an arbitration agreement and the effective integration in the contract of an arbitration clause contained in general terms and conditions can comply with the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

Where the parties select a governing law in a contract, it will not necessarily also apply to the arbitration clause.

Background The judgment of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) of 26 November 2020 on whether and to what extent the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) applied to arbitration agreements caused significant legal uncertainty.

The Court looked closely at the formal requirements for the effective agreement of an arbitration clause and the conditions for integrating the General Terms and Conditions (CTGs) into the contract under the CISG.

In this respect, the BGH confirmed its previous jurisprudence that, under the CISG, the CTGs must be sent or otherwise made available to the other party for them to be considered a component of the contract.

In contrast to German law, the mere possibility to obtain the CTGs, such as by clicking on a link on the seller’s homepage, is insufficient.

This is particularly important when the CTGs contain an arbitration clause.

The BGH leaves the question of whether and to what extent the governing law selected by the parties in a contract also determines the law applicable to the arbitration clause (so-called arbitration statute).

The French Cour de cassation answered this question in its judgment of 28 September 2022 and assessed the effectiveness of the arbitration clause – contrary to the English court that was also involved in the same case – based on French substantive law.

1.

The German perspective: Judgment of the BGH of 26 November 2020 in Case No.

I ZR 245/19

Brief facts of the case The BGH was asked to decide on an objection to the application of an arbitration agreement under § 1032 (1) of the Civil Process Code (Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO).

Under this provision, the defendant has until the start of the oral proceedings before the state court to file a plea that the claim is inadmissible and the court does not have jurisdiction because an arbitration agreement determines that the dispute must be decided by a court of arbitration.

Two companies located in Germany and the Netherlands had a dispute about compensation claims arising with respect to a sale and purchase agreement for goods.

The contract was formed from orders from the purchaser and a document entitled “Contract of Sale” (Verkaufskontrakt), in which the seller, a spice trader located in the Netherlands, confirmed the order.

The confirmation letter noted that all sales and contracts were subject to the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Delivery.

However, the purchaser was not sent these GTCs.

The terms of the Dutch Association of Spice Trade (“NVS-Bedingungen”) were also not enclosed.

The NVS Bedingungen contained a choice of law clause that subjected the contract to Dutch law, without application of the UN CISG, as well as an arbitration clause in favour of an arbitration court of the Dutch association in Amsterdam.

The District Court (Landgericht) issued a default judgment in written pre-trial proceedings, which the defendant appealed.

In the appeal, the defendant raised the arbitration agreement.

The Court dismissed the claim as inadmissible because it held arbitration clause in the NVS Bedingungen effectively formed part of the contract.

The claimant appealed.

The Court of Appeal held that the plea that an arbitration agreement existed was groundless so that the claim before the District Court was admissible.

It referred the case back to the District Court."
ADVANT Beiten,The applicability of the UN CISG on the arbitration agreement,"It referred the case back to the District Court.

On further appeal to the BGH, admitted by the Appeal Court, the defendant sought to preserve the judgment of the District Court dismissing the claim.

The BGH confirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

The defendant’s second appeal was unsuccessful.

The judgement of the BGH of 26 November 2020 in case no.

I ZR 245/19

The BGH held that the action before the District Court was admissible.

In accordance with § 1032 (1) of the ZPO, the defendant could not rely on the arbitration agreement because the arbitration agreement was not effectively agreed.

Under § 1025 (2) of the ZPO, § 1032 of the ZPO is also applicable where the place of arbitration is in another country, in this case, the Netherlands.

Raising the plea that an arbitration provision applied before the start of the oral hearing The plea that the court did not have jurisdiction because of an arbitration agreement was raised before the start of the oral hearing.

Through the objection to the default judgment, the proceedings reverted to the status before the defendant’s default.

The plea that an arbitration agreement applied, first raised in the statement of opposition (Einspruchsschrift), was thus not delayed under § 1032 (1) of the ZPO and not precluded.

The objection does not have to be raised within the deadline for the statement of defence.

Form requirements for an arbitration agreement Under Art.

II (1) of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Arbitration Convention), any arbitration agreement must be in writing.

In accordance with Art. II (2) of the New York Arbitration Convention, this includes an arbitration clause in a contract signed by both parties or an exchange of letters between the parties.

A unilateral declaration, such as the confirmation letter signed by just one party in this case, is not sufficient.

Under the most-favoured-nation principle (see Art.

VII (1) of the New York Arbitration Convention), an arbitration agreement can also be effective when the national or substantive law selected by national conflict of law rules applies fewer demands and is, therefore, more favourable.

This was not the case here.

The form requirements for an arbitration agreement under § 1031 of the ZPO are also not fulfilled.

Under § 1031 (2) and (3) of the ZPO, a reference to a document containing an arbitration clause shall suffice (here: the NVS-Bedingungen).

This does not apply here because the arbitration clause was not effectively included in the contract.

The conditions for effectively making an arbitration clause in the GTCs part of the contract The BGH held that the question of whether the arbitration clause was effectively part of the contract must be assessed under the UN CISG.

As both Germany and the Netherlands are signatories to the CISG, the parties to the contract for the supply of goods have their registered office in a contracting state.

Therefore, the UN CISG applies pursuant to Art. 1 (1) (a) of the CISG.

Accordingly, for GTCs – here the arbitration clause – to effectively form part of a contract they must be provided to the other party or otherwise made accessible.

This was not the case here.

The arbitration clause, therefore, was not an integral part of the contract.

2.

The French perspective: the judgment of the Cour de cassation of 28 September 2022 in Case No. 20-20.260 Brief facts of the case In 2001, a Lebanese company, Kabab-Ji concluded a Master Franchise Agreement with a Kuwaiti company, Al-Homaizi Foodstuff Co (AHFC).

The agreement licenced the use of the “Kabab-Ji” brand in Kuwait and provided for the agreement of individual contracts for each point of sale over ten years.

The agreement expired in 2011 and the parties did not extend it.

During the term of the agreement, AHFC was restructured and a holding company, Kout Food Group (KFG) was established."
ADVANT Beiten,The applicability of the UN CISG on the arbitration agreement,"The agreement expired in 2011 and the parties did not extend it.

During the term of the agreement, AHFC was restructured and a holding company, Kout Food Group (KFG) was established.

The franchisor, Kabab-Ji approved the restructuring in 2004, expressly agreeing that the restructuring would not otherwise affect the conditions agreed in the contracts between the parties.

The Master Franchise Agreement contained a governing law clause selecting English law, as well as an arbitration clause selecting the rules of arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), located in Paris.

However, the agreement did not contain a clear choice of law provision concerning the law applicable to the arbitration agreement.

In 2015, the franchisor commenced arbitration proceedings against KFG, the successor of the original contracting party.

It alleged that the Kuwaiti master franchisee had not performed its contractual obligations and used the acquired know-how without authorisation to develop its own restaurants.

An arbitration award from 2017 sentenced KFG to pay compensation to the franchisor, Kabab-Ji.

While Kabab-Ji (unsuccessfully) commenced proceedings before the English courts to enforce the arbitration award

, KFG filed an action for annulment of the arbitration award in France.

KFG appealed the judgment of the Paris appeal court (Cour d’appel de Paris), which confirmed the arbitration award, to the Cour de cassation.

In particular, KFG accused the Appellate Court court of not using English law to assess the effectiveness and applicability of the arbitration clause, despite the governing law clause in the contract between Kabab-Ji and AHFC.

Judgement of the cour de cassation of 28 September 2022 in case no. 20-20.260 The Cour de cassation confirmed its jurisprudence on the law applicable to arbitration clauses.

Accordingly, an arbitration clause should be considered independently from the rest of the agreement.

The effectiveness of such a clause primarily depends on the common will of the parties.

The governing law clause contained in the agreement does not offer any cause to also apply the governing law clause to the arbitration clause.

If the parties do not agree on a specific choice of law clause, under French international private law, any conflict of law connection is not considered; instead the material provisions developed under international arbitration law apply.

These material provisions grant the arbitration courts broad powers.

This includes the possibility to extend the arbitration clause (extension d’une convention d’arbitrage).

Accordingly, an arbitration agreement can apply to a legal dispute between parties, which have not signed the agreement.

This requires the parties to have taken part in the contractual negotiations, to have influenced them, or for there to be some other way that their agreement to the arbitration agreement can be determined.

The arbitration court, therefore, had the right – based on this material provision – to assume jurisdiction.

3. Comment Arbitration awards are internationally recognised and enforceable under the New York Arbitration Convention.

Arbitration clauses are therefore often used in international supply agreements to avoid the hurdles of recognition and the enforcement of awards before state courts in countries outside the European Union, where the rules are not uniform.

For the arbitration clause to be effective and fulfil its function in the case of a dispute, a few things must be kept in mind when using GTCs.

Where the UN CISG applies, strict requirements apply to the inclusion of GTCs in agreements: the GTCs must actually be sent to the foreign contracting partner.

A reference to the ability to view the CTGs online via a link on the homepage of the vendor may be sufficient under German law but is not sufficient under the CISG."
ADVANT Beiten,The applicability of the UN CISG on the arbitration agreement,"A reference to the ability to view the CTGs online via a link on the homepage of the vendor may be sufficient under German law but is not sufficient under the CISG.

In addition, the CTGs must either be in the common language of the contract and negotiations between the parties, or they must be in the native language of the recipient.

If a German purchaser corresponds with a French vendor in French, for example, CTGs in English will not fulfil these requirements.

English is not recognised as the universal contract language everyone must master.

Neither the CTGs nor any arbitration clause they contain has effectively been made part of the contract.

The law applicable to the arbitration clause requires a separate connection, i.e., it will be determined separately.

The law applicable to the rest of the contract does not necessarily apply.

In the past, the BGH also applied the law selected in the governing law clause to the arbitration agreement; the BGH expressly left this decision open in the current case.

In the Kabab-Ji case, the Court de cassation held that the arbitration agreement is generally not covered by the law applicable to the rest of the agreement in line with the governing law clause.

The English court took a different view and refused to enforce the French arbitration award.

In cases of doubt, therefore, international agreements should contain an arbitration agreement that expressly states which law applies to the arbitration agreement.

ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution - A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.4): Anti-Suit Injunctions in EU after Brexit,"In the recent published parts of our ""Brexit-Series"" we focussed on the consequences of Brexit on Civil Disputes ( Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 ).

Our last part of the so-called ""Brexit-Saga"" highlighted a recent decision of the Regional Court of Berlin regarding corporate law classification of a UK corporation with an administrative seat in Germany and the procedural acknowledgement of such post Brexit ( Vol. 3 ).

Last but not least, this part emphasises the effects of anti-suit injunctions in the European Union after Brexit.

What to do if you want to prevent your counterparty from starting or continuing legal proceedings in a foreign country?

There might be good use for an anti-suit injunction.

These injunctions could become even more relevant after Brexit.

In the following we will briefly explain the fundamentals of these injunctions and show what is happening in the UK after Brexit.

Recent developments in France and Germany show that there could be also some new measures against these injunctions.

In any event, an anti-suit injunction should always be considered in a cross-border dispute: On the one hand as a measure to prevent proceedings outside the chosen jurisdiction for proceedings and on the other hand regarding the consequences and defence against a potential anti-suit injunction.

Anti-suit injunctions are by no means new.

The concept of anti-suit injunctions has a long history, dating back to the period from the Norman Conquest (1066) to the reign of Henry III (1261-1272), which witnessed the inception and growth of the common law administered by the King's Justices.

Inter alia , the Court of Chancery granted commonly injunctions to refrain proceedings before the Courts of Common Law.

Injunctions have been issued to both, parties and counsels.

What is an anti-suit injunction?

In a nutshell, an anti-suit injunction is a judicial order that restrains one party from initiating or continuing a lawsuit in another court or jurisdiction.

This action is typically taken against the applicant in an ongoing lawsuit and the primary aim of it is to prevent the party from initiating parallel or continuing concurrent proceedings in one or several different jurisdiction(s).

In the common law countries, in particular, anti-suit injunctions are widespread.

They are often used to prevent so-called ‘forum shopping’, where a party deliberately chooses a jurisdiction that seems more favourable to its position.

Considering pre-Brexit, the recast Brussels I Regulation prohibited intra-EU anti-suit injunctions.

Specifically, English courts were unable to grant such injunctions if another EU Member State had jurisdiction over the dispute.

However, Brexit has revived the issue of anti-suit injunctions in English courts concerning disputes already before EU Member State courts.

Anti-suit injunctions can be particularly helpful in situations where a party is attempting to initiate or continue proceedings in a foreign court that could potentially affect the jurisdiction and sovereignty of other courts.

This could jeopardize the right to effective legal protection.

For instance, a party might seek an anti-suit injunction to prevent the other party from disregarding an arbitration agreement by turning to a state court in a foreign country.

In such cases an English court could also order an anti-suit injunction.

In general, anti-suit injunctions are used to protect the choice of arbitration or choice of jurisdiction clauses.

Anti-suit injunctions in the EU - before Brexit Before Brexit it was quite clear that - even regarding the UK - an anti-suit injunction regarding another EU-member state was not admissible.

The legal basis for an anti-suit injunction in the UK was and is Sec.

37 (1) Supreme Court Act 1981.

This provision remained unchanged since its introduction.

The competence to issue injunctions in general and anti-suit injunctions, in particular, is also acknowledged for arbitral tribunals under Sec."
ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution - A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.4): Anti-Suit Injunctions in EU after Brexit,"The competence to issue injunctions in general and anti-suit injunctions, in particular, is also acknowledged for arbitral tribunals under Sec.

44 (1), (2) (e) Arbitration Act 1996.

Under the Brussels Regime both, an anti-suit injunction to support a jurisdiction or an arbitration clause was not admissible.

The European Court of Justice decided in 2004

( C-159/02 Turner v Grovit

[2004] ECR I-3565 ) that "" the Convention is to be interpreted as precluding the grant of an injunction whereby a court of a Contracting State prohibits a party to proceedings pending before it from commencing or continuing legal proceedings before a court of another Contracting State, even where that party is acting in bad faith with a view to frustrating the existing proceedings .""

This consequence was based on the principle of mutual trust between the courts of EU-members states laid down in the Brussels I Regulation.

The European Court of Justice, furthermore, outlined in 2009 ( Case 185/07 Allianz v West Tankers

[2009] ECR I-00663 ) that the same rationale applies regarding anti-suit injunctions which were directed to support arbitration clauses.

Such an anti-suit injunction undermines the effectiveness of the general regime in the Brussels I Regulation.

Since 31 December 2020 this rationale does not apply anymore.

The return of the anti-suit injunction?

-

First decision after Brexit For the post Brexit times the opinions diverged as to whether the UK will revert again to the anti-suit injunctions.

Two recent judgments show what will be the standard now.

The decision of the UK not to implement the Brussels I Regulation recast and the respective EU case law into domestic law gave already an indication.

In general, the EU legislation in the form of the English language version was brought under certain premises into domestic law pursuant Sec.

3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 .

Even EU case law could be included in the transfer into domestic law.

However, the UK decided to exclude the Regulation (EU)

No 1215/2012, i.e. the (recast) Brussels Regulation in Regulation 89 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 .

Hence, the mutual trust between EU-Member states regarding courts and jurisdiction could no longer be applied to the UK decisions.

The UK decided to bring the courts of EU-Member states down to the same level of trust like any other foreign court.

The consequence of this decision can be illustrated with the judgments Ebury Partners Belgium SA/NV v Technical Touch BV & Anor [2022] EWHC 2927 (Comm) of 18 November 2022 and QBE Europe SA/NV and another v

Generali España de Seguros y Reaseguros

[2022] EWHC 2062 (Comm) of 1 August 2022.

While Ebury v Technical Touch concerns jurisdiction agreements in (i) the terms and conditions and (ii) a personal guarantee and indemnity in favour of the English courts between two Belgian companies, QBE v. Generali relates to a dispute resolution clause with reference to arbitration in London.

The initial proceedings in Ebury v Technical Touch started in Belgium concerning the validity of the agreements between the parties.

The respondent of the Belgium proceedings brought the issue to England and asked for an anti-suit injunction.

In essence the reasoning for the request was a potential breach of the jurisdiction agreement in favour of the English courts.

The court considered, inter alia , the probability of the incorporation of an agreement on jurisdiction in the contract.

The legal situation concerning QBE v. Generali was a little more complicated as the anti-suit injunction related to an insurance contract.

The proceedings in Spain were directed between the insurance company of harmed and the at-fault party.

Under Spanish law a decision in such proceedings may be directly enforced against the insurer."
ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution - A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.4): Anti-Suit Injunctions in EU after Brexit,"The proceedings in Spain were directed between the insurance company of harmed and the at-fault party.

Under Spanish law a decision in such proceedings may be directly enforced against the insurer.

As the insurance contract included the arbitration clause and the proceedings in Spain concerned a quasi-contractual relationship, since the respondent's insurer was not actually a party to the underlying policy that contained the arbitration agreement.

Nevertheless, the court granted an anti-suit injunction in favour of the arbitration clause.

Both judgments referred to the key principles for granting anti-suit injunctions ( QBE v. Generali , para 10; Ebury v Technical Touch , para 20).

Following these principles, "" the injunction applicant must establish with a ""high degree of probability"" that there is an arbitration or jurisdiction agreement which governs the dispute in question "".

The injunction will be granted if the defendant has not presented "" strong reasons to refuse the relief "".

The defendant bears the burden of proof for these strong reasons.

Regarding the ""high degree of probability"" component, in the case Ebury v Technical Touch it was enough "" to demonstrate that the jurisdiction clause contained in standard terms was incorporated into the agreement between the parties "" ( Ebury v Technical Touch, para 23).

Meanwhile, in the case QBE v. Generali , there was direct arbitration agreement between parties, however according to English law, the court follows a similar approach as it would in a regular contractual arbitration agreement.

Thus, in the second case, abovementioned component was satisfied, because defendant was seeking to advance claims, that essentially amounted to an attempt to enforce contractual rights within the insurance policy ( QBE v. Generali , para 16).

These two judgments set out what can be expected in future regarding anti-suit injunctions concerning proceedings in EU-Member states.

Moreover, parties based in EU Member States should consider the potential consequences of initiating legal proceedings in EU Member State courts when they have entered into contracts that include an exclusive jurisdiction clause favouring the courts of England and Wales, or an English law arbitration clause.

How to defend against anti-suit injunctions?

-

The era of anti-suit injunctions?

Anti-suit injunctions from the UK or any other country outside the EU can be an impediment for proceedings in courts of EU-Member states.

A new and competitive approach could be anti-anti-suit injunctions.

These injunctions are directed against the party that requests for an anti-suit injunction in another jurisdiction.

An anti-anti-suit injunction orders the applicant of the anti-suit injunction to refrain from commencing anti-suit injunction proceedings.

Anti-anti suit injunctions have been granted in France and Germany in specific circumstances.

A judgment of March 2020 by the Court of Appeal of Paris granted an anti-anti-suit injunction concerning the application for an anti-suit injunction in the US.

Two recent German decisions had also relations to US proceedings for anti-suit injunctions.

The anti-anti-suit injunctions were awarded by the Higher Regional Court of Hamm on 2 May 2023 and by the Higher Regional Court of Munich on 12 December 2019.

The Higher Regional Court of Munich decided in a overall patent related dispute between Continental and Nokia ( judgment of 12 December 2019 – 6 U 5042/19 ; English summary here ).

The Higher Regional Court of Hamm decided in relation to enforcement proceedings of an investment arbitration award ( judgment of 2 May 2023 – 9 W 15/23 ).

The party seeking for an anti-suit injunction in the US tried to prevent the other party from claiming before the Regional Court of Essen.

The proceedings in Essen were directed at prohibiting an enforcement of the arbitration award outside Europe."
ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution - A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.4): Anti-Suit Injunctions in EU after Brexit,"The proceedings in Essen were directed at prohibiting an enforcement of the arbitration award outside Europe.

The legal basis for the authority to render anti-anti-suit injunctions derives from substantive law and not, as in the UK, from a procedural principle.

The right that might be violated by the party seeking for an anti-suit injunction is the entitlement to justice (Justizgewährleistungsanspruch).

This fundamental right is laid down in Art. 19 (4) of the German Constitution.

Even though the German courts are not capable to render anti-suit injunctions concerning proceedings in EU-Member states, the substantive law gives the parties the opportunity to prevent anti-suit injunctions in non-EU jurisdictions with requests for anti-anti-suit injunctions.

What's next?

- Case by case decision The essence of the German judgments is that it is possible to successfully apply for anti-anti-suit injunctions in Germany.

An anti-anti-suit injunction can be a direct answer to the opposing party's attempt to obtain an anti-suit injunction abroad.

Whether this approach will be successful or what other measures could also be used, has to be determined on a case by case basis.

Brexit and the recent decisions of UK courts make it likely that anti-suit injunctions and the question of how to respond will be more relevant in the future.

This highly complicated assessment of the right measures has to be done by the parties in short notice.

The breach of an anti-suit injunction or anti-anti-suit injunction could be quite expensive due to potential orders for a fine against the party.

The breach of an injunction in Germany can be fined with up to EUR 250,000.00 for each breach.

Other countries might have even higher fines.

ADVANT Beiten,Free rein for data transfers to the U.S.?,"On Monday, July 10, 2023, the European Commission published the long-awaited adequacy decision for data transfers from the EU to the US.

It remains an open question whether this will resolve the more than two years of uncertainty surrounding cooperation with U.S. companies.

The ECJ ruling of July 16, 2020 and its impact The European Court of Justice (ECJ) had ruled in the so-called ""Schrems II"" judgment in July 2020 that the so-called EU-US Privacy Shield, which until then had served in practice as the most important mechanism for data transfers to the U.S., was ineffective (we reported in our Privacy Ticker July 2020 ).

Since then, there has been major uncertainty as to whether and under what conditions data transfers to the U.S. were still legally possible.

The ruling thus had significant implications for transatlantic data exchange.

This applied above all, but not only, to the use of popular online services such as Google and Facebook.

The ECJ had argued that data privacy standards in the U.S. were inadequate, in particular due to the excessive powers of the U.S. intelligence services, and that European citizens were not adequately protected against government surveillance and misuse of data.

The ECJ also criticized the lack of effective legal protection for EU citizens in the U.S. with regard to their data protection rights.

Alternative safeguards for data transfers, such as the conclusion of standard contractual clauses (""SCCs"") or even obtaining consent for data transfers to third countries, especially the U.S., remained highly controversial and always carried a certain risk of not being able to hold up under judicial review or of incurring a substantial fine from a data protection authority.

The EU-US Data Privacy Framework as a solution After the EU Commission and the U.S. government announced in March 2022 that they had agreed in principle on a legal framework for transatlantic data transfers, the EU Commission has finally issued the long-awaited adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (""Data Privacy Framework"").

In doing so, it is responding to the ECJ's objections in the ""Schrems II"" ruling and once again certifies that the U.S. has an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the GDPR, but this time under certain conditions.

Similar to the former ""Privacy Shield"", the Data Privacy Framework is based on a system of certification.

US organizations and companies can commit to compliance with the so-called EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles, which are based on the principles of the GDPR, as well as other principles issued by the US Department of Commerce.

The U.S. Department of Commerce will also publish a list on the Internet, similar to the former ""Privacy Shield"", listing the organizations and companies certified under the Data Privacy Framework.

In order to certify (or recertify on an annual basis) under the Data Privacy Framework, organizations and companies must publicly commit to compliance with the above principles, make their privacy policies available, and fully implement them.

As part of their certification application, they must submit various other information to the U.S. Department of Com-merce.

These include their organization, a description of the purposes for which personal data is processed, the personal data covered by the certification, and the chosen method of review, the relevant independent complaint mechanism, and finally the relevant enforcement authority.

Organizations and businesses can only receive and process personal data based on the Data Privacy Framework from the time they are added to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Data Privacy Framework list."
ADVANT Beiten,Free rein for data transfers to the U.S.?,"To ensure legal certainty and to avoid organiza-tions or companies falsely claiming to be certified, when they first become certified, they may not publicly reference their compliance with the Principles or their certification until the U.S. Department of Commerce has determined that the relevant certification application is complete and the organization or company has been added to the list.

To continue to rely on the Data Privacy Framework as a transfer mechanism, annual recertification must be conducted.

What do companies in the EU need to be aware of?

Unfortunately, the mere existence of the adequacy decision or the Data Privacy Framework does not yet mean that companies located in the EU or the EEA can now directly base their data transfers on it.

This is because the respective US company to which the data is to be transferred must first be certified and published in the Data Privacy Framework list.

This is likely to take some time, as the US companies must first implement the principles and comply with the requirements described above.

When the time comes, the privacy policies of the companies transferring data may have to be adapted, as they are likely to rely on mechanisms other than the adequacy decision with regard to data transfers to the U.S. so far.

However, the privacy policy must always mention the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission in the case of data transfers to third countries (Art. 13 (1) (f) GDPR).

Conclusion and prospects The EU Commission's adequacy decision for the time being ends a long period of legal uncertainty for the transfer of personal data to the US.

Provided that the conditions de-scribed above are met, the decision is likely to lead to significant simplifications in the legal assessment and implementation of lawful U.S. data transfers in practice.

However, the Data Privacy Framework has also immediately received harsh criticism because it allegedly deviates too little from the Privacy Shield, which has already failed before the ECJ, and therefore does not offer any real protection for the personal data of EU citizens in the US.

So, it remains to be seen how long this agreement will last this time.

For the time being, however, many companies based in the EU or EEA that regularly want or need to transfer data to the U.S. can breathe a sigh of relief until the next ECJ ruling on this topic.

ADVANT Beiten,The new collective action lawsuit - Consumer Rights Enforcement Act has been passed in the Bundestag,""" Potius sero, quam numquam .""

(Titus Livius, ab urbe condita)

On 25th of June 2023, the deadline for implementation of the EU Directive on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers expired.

On 7th of July 2023, the last session day before the summer recess, the German Bundestag adopted the draft law on Consumer Rights Enforcement Act with the votes of the government factions, against the votes of the CDU/CSU and AFD, while the faction Die Linke abstained from voting.

In our blog, we have already reported on the preliminary draft ( blog post of February 17, 2023 ), the government's draft ( blog post of March 31, 2023 ), and the hearing in the Legal Affairs Committee ( blog post of May 11, 2023 ).

The Consumer Rights Enforcement Act introduces a new form of collective action, the action for redress by qualified entities, and incorporates the provisions of the model declaratory action from the Code of Civil Procedure.

The Federal Government expects that the action for redress will provide relief to citizens, the economy, and particularly the courts.

The aim is to replace 22,500 individual actions by 15 actions for redress.

""Who Can Sue and How?"" - Qualified Entities and Actions for Redress An action for redress is a lawsuit filed by qualified entities on behalf of a multitude of consumers against companies in civil law disputes.

Small companies with fewer than ten employees and an annual turnover or balance sheet total below EUR 2 million shall be considered to be consumers under the scope of this act.

Qualified consumer organizations and entities registered in the corresponding European Union register shall have the right to initiate actions for redress.

Qualified consumer organizations must (i) not derive more than 5% of their funding from companies and (ii) be listed in the register pursuant to Sec.

4 of the Act on Injunctive Relief (Unterlassungsklagegesetz).

The qualified entities, along with the register for representative actions, must publish about actions for redress and inform consumers about how they can participate.

An injunctive measure shall only be admissible if it is comprehensibly demonstrated that claims from at least 50 consumers may be affected.

The Consumer Rights Enforcement Act restricts the financing of an action for redress by third parties.

The financing must be independent of the success of the action and the company sued.

It must be disclosed to the court at the time of filing, along with the agreements made.

An action for redress can be directed either towards providing payment or performance to the affected consumers or towards the payment of a collective sum.

The claims asserted by the consumers must be substantially similar.

Substantially similar facts and issues of fact and law that are relevant to the decision are decisive.

Consumers must register their claims in the register for representative actions.

Registration is even possible up to three weeks after the conclusion of the oral hearing.

The Higher Regional Court at the registered seat of the company concerned is competent for any action for redress.

An appeal on points of law is provided for by law without the need for admission in the judgment.

""What does a litigation procedure end with?"" - Judgment, Redress Judgment on Liability, Settlement and Final Redress Judgment As a rule, an action for redress shall end with a judgment, settlement or final redress judgment.

Prior to a final redress judgment, a redress judgment on liability is issued.

A redress judgment on liability shall be issued if an action for redress is substantiated on the merits and not directed towards providing payment to a consumer.

A redress judgment on liability shall contain specific requirements for consumer eligibility and the proof of eligibility to be provided for this purpose."
ADVANT Beiten,The new collective action lawsuit - Consumer Rights Enforcement Act has been passed in the Bundestag,"A redress judgment on liability shall contain specific requirements for consumer eligibility and the proof of eligibility to be provided for this purpose.

If a collective sum is awarded, the judgment must include either the amount per eligible consumer or the method for determining the individual amounts due.

If a redress judgment on liability is initially rendered, the parties may be requested by the court to submit written settlement proposals.

If no settlement is reached, the procedure concludes with a final redress judgment.

""How do consumers obtain their money?"" -

The Implementation Procedure The action for redress is followed by the implementation procedure.

If the collective total amount determined is insufficient, it can be increased on request.

The competent court for the action for redress shall remain competent for the implementation proceedings.

A trustee is appointed to implement the judgment.

In the process, an implementation fund is set up into which the determined amounts are to be paid.

The trustee fulfills legitimate consumer claims from this implementation fund.

Only consumers who have validly registered their claims with the register for representative actions may participate in the implementation procedure.

The trustee examines the claims of participating consumers and determines their eligibility based on the specific requirements and evidence established in the judgment.

Consumers or companies can file an objection against the trustee's decision.

The final decision on the objection is made by the court.

The implementation procedure concludes with the trustee's final report, which is reviewed by the court.

The termination of the implementation procedure is determined by a court decision.

In individual cases where a consumer's claim has not been positively considered in the implementation procedure, the option of subsequent individual litigation against the company remains available.

""Unnecessary or innovative?"" - Outlook into the Future

The German government hopes that the action for redress and the Consumer Rights Enforcement Act will make it easier for consumers to assert their claims.

This is expected to significantly alleviate the burden on the judiciary.

The jurisdiction of the Higher Regional Courts, applying the rules for firstinstance proceedings before the Regional Courts, effectively limits the admissible legal remedies to appeals on point of law.

In all cases, at the very least, appeals are permitted.

However, there is no further legal remedy for decisions by the Higher Regional Court on objection in the implementation procedure.

In particular, the latest amendments in the Committee on Legal Affairs will influence the dynamic picture of the action for redress in the future.

Qualified entities need only to demonstrate that 50 consumers may be affected and need not to elaborate on actual affectedness.

Small companies, like consumers, can participate as affected parties in representative actions and actions for redress.

The ability to register for the representative action even after the oral hearing will influence consumer behavior.

The coming years will show whether the new representative action will be accepted by practitioners and whether the Consumer Rights Enforcement Act will achieve the anticipated effects.

ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution - A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.3): Possible Liability Trap for Shareholders of UK Corporations,"In the last part of our ""Brexit-Series"" we highlighted the consequences of Brexit on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments as well as arbitral awards in the European Union and the United Kingdom (Blog) .

Building upon this, the third part of our ""Brexit-Saga"" focuses on a recent decision of the Regional Court of Berlin (Landgericht Berlin, 28.11.2022 - 101 O 57/22) regarding corporate law classification of a UK corporation with an administrative seat in Germany and the procedural acknowledgement of such post Brexit.

We are aware that there may be differences regarding the corporate law within the three UK jurisdictions (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), but as these do not impact the following sections, we will refer to UK corporations in the following to simplify the presentation.

According to the Regional Court of Berlin, a corporation in the UK, for instance.

a private company limited by shares (Ltd.) or a public company limited by shares (PLC), which still has its administrative seat in Germany, is subject to the German ""seat theory"".

Its substantive legal consequence is the classification as a private partnership company / sole trader and thus the personal liability of the shareholders.

Therefore, the shareholders of the UK corporation may be sued directly or a judicial title (like a judgment) already obtained against the UK corporation can be transferred to the shareholder(s) of the UK cooperation without the need for further evidence to enforce the judicial title against the shareholder(s).

Application of the Seat Theory to UK companies Under German international company law, the so-called ""seat theory"" applies: the applicable company law is determined by the actual administrative seat of a company.

In Germany, an exception is made to the ""seat theory"" for reasons of European law.

The European Court of Justice had ruled in several cases that the application of the seat theory to companies from EU member states that follow the incorporation theory violates the freedom of establishment.

In the UK, the incorporation theory applies: Following the incorporation theory the applicable company law is solely determined by the law in which the company was incorporated.

Therefore, during the UK's membership in the EU, the Limited and PLC were recognised in Germany as a corporation with the corresponding English law limitation of liability even if it had its registered office in Germany.

After the end of the transitional period on 31 December 2020, the legal form of the Limited.

and PLC as such no longer exists in Germany.

However, these company forms are not a legal nullity in Germany.

Rather, they will be treated as a legally responsible company - depending on its form under German company law, for instance as a OHG, GbR (variants of private partnership companies with direct liability) or sole trader (if there is only one shareholder).

The Limited or PLC therefore will carry on a ""double life"" as under UK law registered company and as a private partnership company or sole trader under German Law.

In the case decided by the Regional Court of Berlin, the Limited consisted of only one shareholder, thus, from a German law perspective, it continued to exist as a sole trader company.

This also results in the personal liability of the shareholder.

The Regional Court of Berlin came to this conclusion by applying and confirming the ""seat theory"".

The aforementioned case law of the European Court of Justice on the application of the incorporation theory does not apply to third countries, which – post Brexit – also affects now the United Kingdom.

The application of the incorporation theory is also not regulated under any state treaty.

In particular, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK does not establish a freedom of establishment as granted in the EU."
ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution - A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.3): Possible Liability Trap for Shareholders of UK Corporations,"In particular, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK does not establish a freedom of establishment as granted in the EU.

The protection of legitimate expectations does not hinder the application of the seat theory either, since a conversion of the Limited into a recognised legal form was possible during the transition period and since no confidence in the perpetual existence could arise anyway due to the withdrawal clause of Art.

50 TEU.

Although there are isolated dissenting opinions in the literature on this issue, at present the aforementioned application of the seat theory in relation to UK corporations should be still applicable.

Material Legal Consequence of the Seat Theory Consequently, a UK corporation that still holds its administrative seat in Germany, will now be treated as a sole trader or private partnership company (GbR or OHG) in Germany.

Therefore, a direct liability of the shareholders is possible in Germany.

There may be a considerable liability risk here that one may not have in mind.

It is highly recommended to deal with this if the constellation of a UK corporation and an actual administrative seat in Germany exists.

This is clearly illustrated by the example of the insolvency administrator of Air Berlin PLC who is suing Clearstream Banking AG as registered shareholder of Air Berlin PLC in the shareholders' register for approximately EUR 500 million in front of the Regional Court of Frankfurt.

A decision in this matter has not yet been made, but this again clearly shows the explosive nature of this complex of issues.

Procedural Implications Since the shareholders could be personally liable for the company's debts in Germany, they can also be sued directly before a German court for fulfilment of the respective debt.

If a title has already been obtained before the end of the transitional period, i.e. before 31 December 2020, as in the case of the Regional Court of Berlin, the conversion into a private partnership company/sole trader is not seen as a genuine legal succession pursuant to sec.

727 of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

The foreign company is converted ex lege according to the modified ""seat theory"".

As a consequence, a legal succession clause is issued for the enforcement order without further proof, which can then be enforced against the shareholder.

The non-application of sec.

727 of the German Code of Civil Procedure thus simplifies the enforcement procedure against the shareholder, making the whole topic even more important.

To be continued.

ADVANT Beiten,Dealing with product liability risks in M&A transactions,"Product liability risks can become a significant financial burden in M&A transactions.

A comprehensive understanding of these risks and an appropriate risk assessment are essential.

This post examines how to deal with product liability risks within the framework of M&A transactions.

1.

What are the risks under the Product Liability Directive?

1.1 Draft Product Liability Directive On 28 September 2022, the European Commission published a proposal for a new product liability directive (Product Liability Directive).

The proposal foresees stricter rules for manufacturers, quasi-manufacturers, importers, authorised representatives, fulfilment providers, retailers, and operators of online marketplaces in the EEA.

You can find a detailed introduction to the Directive in a post by André Depping and Katharina Pöhls.

1.2 Wider scope The new Directive will extend the personal and material scope of the current Directive and apply the thumbscrews much more tightly for entrepreneurs.

Under the current Directive, only manufacturers, quasi-manufacturers, and importers active in the EEA are strictly liable for defective products.

The new draft extends the potential defendants to include authorised representatives of the manufacturer, fulfilment providers, retailers, and, under certain conditions, even operators of online marketplaces.

Companies that substantially modify a product will also be liable when the modified product is defective and causes damage.

In this case, the statute of limitations will restart.

The proposal expands the scope of products covered by the Directive to include software and digital production files, such as data for 3D printers.

It will also include products integrated into another product (such as navigation systems).

1.3 Defectiveness and digital components In addition, products will be considered defective when they fall short of the safety standards the public expects.

That is why product safety law standards will be taken into account when determining whether a product is defective.

Increasingly, the focus is on cybersecurity.

As a result, software may need updating where possible.

1.4 Start of the Statue of Limitations The proposal also changes the start of the statute of limitations under product liability law.

In the future, placing the product on the market will not alone be decisive; the possibility to control the product after it is placed on the market will also be considered.

This meshes with the relevant monitoring and maintenance obligations.

The M&A process must give special consideration to this change to the statute of limitations particularly when performing due diligence.

1.5 Relaxing the burden of proof and discovery Further, the burden of proof is extended to help claimants with presumptions when there is an obvious defect in the product under normal use.

In addition, there is an obligation to provide any evidence the claimant needs to assert their claims, such as construction documents or documentation about the monitoring of the product placed on the market.

1.6 Extension of the type of compensatable damage Further, an important aspect of the draft is the expanded definition of damage, which now includes the loss and corruption of data and removes the thresholds for maximum liability and excess.

Liability for digital products will continue to apply where the software was defective when it was placed on the market and can later be remedied by a software update.

2.

Which protective instruments are there?

Product liability can play a significant role, especially in the automotive, food, and consumer goods industries due to the high level of damages and the effect on the company’s reputation.

The risk is extremely industry-specific and depends on both product and location.

The increasing impact of the Product Liability Directive on the digital sector should not be underestimated either."
ADVANT Beiten,Dealing with product liability risks in M&A transactions,"The risk is extremely industry-specific and depends on both product and location.

The increasing impact of the Product Liability Directive on the digital sector should not be underestimated either.

The following outlines the options available in M&A transactions to protect against claims under product liability law.

2.1 Provisions in the sale and purchase agreement (or share purchase agreement)

The vendor’s representations and warranties (“guarantees”) are a central element of the sale and purchase agreement and are often the focus of negotiations.

The interests here are essentially clear: while the vendor would prefer to provide as few guarantees as possible, the purchaser has an interest in obtaining as many guarantees for as many aspects as possible from the vendor so that the purchaser can turn to the vendor for any undisclosed risks.

As product liability can present a significant risk for companies – depending on the sector –vendors normally provide guarantees for claims under product liability law in the contract.

However, guarantees usually protect against unknown risks, while specific indemnities distribute known risks.

Any circumstances relevant to the guarantees the vendor discloses to the purchaser prior to the conclusion of the contract are typically excluded from the warranty.

A far-reaching product liability guarantee, which ensures the economic risks for all products produced and distributed up to closing remain with the vendor, would protect the vendor against such risks under product liability law.

Variations are also conceivable, where the vendor only guarantees that there are no further product liability cases other than those known and disclosed.

In so doing, the risk of dormant product liability claims would transfer to the purchaser.

This is then a variation of a limited product liability guarantee.

To the extent that the parties negotiate a product liability guarantee, it is advisable to agree to a longer limitation period for product liability because such cases generally only arise after a delay.

The target company’s reserves for product liability cases must also be considered.

The amount of any reserves influences more than the purchase price; where the built-up reserves are appropriate, the vendor may not assume a guarantee in product liability cases.

Where specific indemnities are provided, the question is to what extent they cover product liability claims.

Specific indemnities generally only release the vendor where the parties are aware of all the risks of the target company, but there are uncertainties concerning the claims arising and the amount of any claims.

Normally, the vendor will indemnify the purchaser against all tax claims and environmental damage.

In contrast, such indemnification rarely – in fact, almost never – applies to product liability.

Finally, a due diligence assessment of the target company can help identify existing or imminent product liability risks.

The results of the assessment form the basis of product liability representations and warranties and/or indemnities in the sale and purchase agreement.

While it is not always possible to predict the extent of product liability from the technical assessment of the products produced or placed on the market, legal due diligence of customer agreements can help better assess the product liability risks.

Primarily, the assessor identifies the contracts with the most important customers and analyses the relevant contractual clauses.

The following aspects are of particular importance: Is the description of the product or service sufficiently specific to avoid uncertainty in cases of breach of contract?

Do customer contracts contain a limitation of liability?

Have any clauses limiting liability been effectively agreed and would they withstand judicial scrutiny in the case of dispute?

Has the target company assumed strict liability product guarantees and, if so, for what period?"
ADVANT Beiten,Dealing with product liability risks in M&A transactions,"Has the target company assumed strict liability product guarantees and, if so, for what period?

Does the contract cover serial damage?

Special attention should be paid to the general terms and conditions of the target company, as their effectiveness is subject to strict legal requirements.

If the target company has concluded numerous consumer contracts, the hurdles for any limitations of liability in the general terms and conditions to be effective are particularly high.

With respect to the extension of the scope of personal use, the Product Liability Directive will also need to be assessed to see whether any significant adverse differences between the risks of liability borne by the target company and possible third-party claims exist.

2.2 Minimisation of liabilty through an asset deal If the due diligence assessment reveals significant product liability risks facing the target company, an asset deal could be an alternative way to transfer the company.

In this case, not the shares but the assets of the target company are transferred (e.g., the ownership in immovable and moveable property of the fixed and current assets).

The contractual relationships do not automatically transfer.

This can be an advantage where there are potentially serious risks under product liability law for the purchaser.

2.3 Product liability insurance If the vendor is not willing to provide any guarantees, the purchaser can take over the product liability insurance of the target company or conclude new product liability insurance to ensure sufficient protection.

To minimise claims for product liability, companies can take out appropriate insurance policies to cover product liability and the costs of product recalls.

The product liability model provides insurance protection for damage, caused in particular by products manufactured or supplied by the policyholder.

This covers claims under the product liability law and damages for manufacturer liability under tort law.

Product liability insurance is an extension of business liability insurance and has been available since 1970.

It is constantly adapted to market circumstances (1987, 2000, 2002, and 2008).

These adjustments were necessary to account for developments in jurisprudence related to product liability and the modernisation of tort law.

It remains to be seen whether product liability insurance will be adjusted again to account for the changes introduced by the Product Liability Directive.

Product liability insurance builds on the Insurance Contract Act (§ 102 of the VVG) and covers both damages to persons and property and consequential loss (unechte Vermögensschäden).

The product liability model is just a separate insurance model, which is why the general conditions of third-party liability insurance (AHB) might apply where there are insurance law issues.

Accordingly, in addition to the special provisions for product liability insurance, the special rules on exclusions in the AHB should be considered as they could affect product liability insurance.

The production programmes and activities covered by insurance protection should be recorded in as much detail as possible in the insurance policy.

This helps both the policyholder and the insurer because it will be clear which production risks the insurer assumes.

The detailed description should leave enough room for developments in the operational activities of the policyholder.

As regards guarantees and insurance, it is important to ensure an existing warranty does not diminish the purchaser’s interest in sufficient insurance protection for the target company.

However, the guarantee in the sale and purchase agreement is subsidiary to existing insurance protection.

As a rule, the vendor normally provides a guarantee for the existence of the insurance policy disclosed during the due diligence investigation.

It is therefore customary to list policies in detail in an annexe to the sale and purchase agreement."
ADVANT Beiten,Dealing with product liability risks in M&A transactions,"It is therefore customary to list policies in detail in an annexe to the sale and purchase agreement.

In addition, the vendor should guarantee the policies offer the level of protection customary in the sector, the premiums have been paid, there are no (unobserved) conditions which could jeopardise the insurance protection, and no other conditions which could cause the insurance protection to lapse.

In the case of group structures, the target company will generally not be insured directly but under an umbrella insurance policy that applies to various companies within the group.

Where this is the case, the purchaser should pay special attention to whether the group insurance (subject to short transitional periods) ends with closing and ensure appropriate follow-on insurance is concluded.

2.4 W&W insurance 2.4.1

What is warranty and indemnity insurance?

In certain circumstances, W&I Insurances (Warranty and Indemnity) can provide a remedy in the case of claims under product liability law in M&A transactions.

This insurance provides cover for the parties involved in the transaction for unknown risks because of the past activities of the target company.

In an M&A transaction, the vendor will provide certain guarantees with respect to the target company.

These guarantees give the purchaser information about the status of the company and the possible liability risks.

To secure both parties and accelerate the M&A process, it can make sense to conclude W&I insurance.

The purchaser profits from the additional protection and having a solvent opposing party, while the vendor may be able to obtain a higher sale price for the target without assuming liability.

Generally, the W&I insurance policy is adjusted to suit the transaction.

The premium will depend on the size and complexity of the deal.

So-called purchaser insurance is now popular.

For the purchaser, guarantees should cover major risks.

As W&I insurance works on the basis of the balance sheet on the effective date, forward-looking warranties (such as specific target turnover) are exempted.

In addition, liability in the case of purchaser knowledge of disclosed circumstances, penalties and fines, pension obligations, environmental damage, and tax matters are excluded as a standard.

In practice, most W&I insurance also excludes damages from product liability on a “deal-specific” basis (considering the specifics of the sector and product).

Take particular note of the definition of “product liability” in the insurance policy.

Often, insurers will define “product liability case” as broadly as possible to exclude their liability in such cases.

The definitions of product and product liability in the new Directive reflect such a dynamic definition, which is also used as a basis for insurance policies.

This can sometimes disadvantage the policyholder if they are not vigilant.

2.4.2.

W&I insurance and product liability As explained above, W&I insurance often does not cover product liability.

This is due to the nature of W&I insurance and the fact that purchasers often perform no or insufficient technical due diligence.

A strategic investor will carry out such an assessment to conclude an appropriate, tailored W&I policy with the insurer in their own interests, based on the information gained.

Nonetheless, W&I insurance can offer an additional safeguard against product liability law claims.

One possibility lies in taking out “top-up cover” as part of the W&I insurance.

In this case, the top-up cover will be connected to an existing product liability insurance and increase the sum insured under that basis insurance.

This will account for a possible breach of warranty resulting in an insurance claim under product liability insurance with damage exceeding the sum insured under the product liability insurance.

W&I insurance will cover that amount of the claim which exceeds the sum insured under product liability insurance."
ADVANT Beiten,Dealing with product liability risks in M&A transactions,"W&I insurance will cover that amount of the claim which exceeds the sum insured under product liability insurance.

2.4.3 Litigation buyout insurance Another way to insure against product liability risks in an M&A transaction is litigation buyout insurance.

This allows the parties to distribute risks from potential or ongoing legal disputes.

The risks can relate to the outcome of a dispute or the sum of damages and compensation awarded, and to known legal disputes or a “package” of possible legal disputes or demands.

Legal costs, including lawyers’ fees, can also be insured.

It is also possible to take up appeal hedges, which allow the policy-holding purchaser to insure the advantages of a favourable judgment against the possible annulment on appeal when, at the time of the deal, the judgment has only been rendered at first instance.

3.

Summary The risks of a claim under product liability law will significantly increase with the implementation of the new Product Liability Directive.

There are various ways to protect against such risks in an M&A process.

In addition to thorough legal and technical due diligence, which should form the basis for a transaction with a high-risk target company, the purchaser can also ask for guarantees or take out product liability insurance.

W&I insurance, with top-up cover or litigation buyout insurance, can be a sensible addition to the insurance suite.

ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution – A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.2): Enforcement of judgments and arbitral awards,"In the first part of our ""Brexit-Series"" we highlighted the influence of Brexit on the Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.

This second part focuses on the consequences of Brexit on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments as well arbitral awards in the European Union and the United Kingdom.

Recognition and Enforcement of State Court Judgments after the Transitional Period At the end of the transitional period on 31 December 2020, the final ""hard"" Brexit occurred.

The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom does not include any regime for civil procedure law.

This has far-reaching consequences for parties in civil proceedings.

Once a decision has been rendered, the prevailing party must follow the route of enforcement, unless the losing party voluntarily performs.

This phase is particularly critical in a cross-border context as a title can be worthless if it cannot be enforced where there are sufficient assets of the losing party.

Pre-Brexit the rules on recognition and enforcement of judgments from the United Kingdom in Germany and vice versa were regulated by EU's Brussels Ia Regulation on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments (EU No. 1215/2012).

According to Art.

36 of the ""Brussels Ia Regulation"" a judgment rendered in a Member State shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.

Since the Brussels Ia Regulation does no longer apply post-Brexit and after the transitional period, a direct procedure for the recognition and enforcement of judgments is not regulated anymore.

The United Kingdom could not accede the Lugano Convention, as the European Commission blocked its accession.

It is in particular unclear whether the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters dated 27 September 1968 (the ""1968 Brussels Convention"") will revive.

This Convention has largely been superseded by the Brussels Ia Regulation by the European Union; therefore, it is unclear whether courts may apply this Convention.

This question seems to be more of an academic approach, as there are no court decisions rendered regarding the application of this Convention The same situation applies for the Anglo-German Treaty on Legal Relations of 20 March 1928.

The 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (""Hague Convention"") is applicable as the United Kingdom acceded this Convention in 2021.

The Hague Convention provides regulations regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments given by a court in an exclusive choice of court agreement.

However, as this Convention only applies to exclusive choice of court agreements, it does not cover the recognition or enforcement of rendered judgments based on non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses.

In the absence of any international agreement, national governing law on civil procedure is applicable.

For instance, in Germany, judgments rendered in the UK will require an extra proceeding according to Sections 328, 722 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Clearly there is no specific agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments, therefore national procedural law must be applied.

This is a huge challenge for cross-border civil proceedings, as it makes the recognition and enforcement of judgments more complex, costly and time-consuming.

Consequently, when entering a British-German commercial contract, it should be considered to agree on an exclusive choice of court clause in order to make the Hague Convention applicable.

This will secure a direct enforceability of judgments between the companies.

Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards"
ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution – A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol.2): Enforcement of judgments and arbitral awards,"This will secure a direct enforceability of judgments between the companies.

Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards

The paradox of the cross-border recognition and enforcement of national court judgments post-Brexit makes the conclusion of an arbitration agreement the more attractive: The enforcement of international arbitral awards is well regulated by international conventions.

More than 170 States have agreed to recognize and enforce arbitral awards issued in other contracting states in accordance with the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958.

The United Kingdom has been a member since 1975 and Germany even longer, namely since 1961.

The Brexit left the legal situation regarding the enforcement of arbitral awards untouched.

In the United Kingdom, the relevant regulations for the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards are regulated in Sec.

99 et seqq.

Arbitration Act 1996.

The text of the New York Convention is adopted as the basis of these rules.

The reasons to refuse the recognition and enforcement of a so called ""New York Convention award"" can be found in Sec. 103 Arbitration Act 1996.

These reasons are very similar to the reasons in Art.

V. of the New York Convention.

The recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award can be refused, inter alia, if the dispute is not governed by the arbitration clause or if there was a procedural issue with the composition of the arbitral tribunal.

The Arbitration Act 1996 does also not include a general révision au fond.

Sec. 103 Arbitration Act 1996 foresees merely a refusal if the award violates public policy.

Under German law, the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards is covered by Sec. 1060 to 1061 of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

According to Sec. 1061 ZPO, foreign awards can be recognized.

These regulations also refer to the recognition and enforcement of the New Yorker Convention.

The standards for recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards are, therefore, comparable to those in the United Kingdom.

In contrast to the enforcement of judgments of state courts, the situation regarding recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards remains unchanged.

The continuous member status to the New York Convention results in an unchanged initial situation regarding the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the United Kingdom and Germany.

In the future, the procedural conditions for recognition and enforcement procedures in Germany might improve.

According to the recently published first cornerstones for the reform of German arbitration law (see our Blog of 19 April 2023 )

commercial courts shall get the competence for these proceedings (see our Blog of 27 April 2023 thereto).

There, proceedings can be continued in English if the language of the arbitration proceedings was English too.

ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution – A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol. 1),"Don't look back in anger - that's how the British band Oasis sang their way into continental European hearts through the 1990s.

In the meantime, the Brexit happened.

The United Kingdom left the European Union on the 30th of January 2020.

But does Oasis' recommended life wisdom also apply without exception to the legal consequences of Brexit?

Two years have passed and many questions regarding civil disputes are still unresolved.

A reason to take a closer look at current British-German/EU developments and on practical strategies parties may consider when entering cross-border civil disputes.

In our series of blog posts, we examine constellations in civil disputes that are increasingly arising in practice in connection with Brexit and German Law.

In our first article, we explain the influence of the Brexit on the choice of law and jurisdiction.

The second article deals with the enforceability of German or British titles while the third deals with a case recently decided by the Regional Court of Berlin concerning a limited company with its administrative seat in Germany.

Our last article sets out the consequences of Brexit in litigation or arbitration proceedings regarding anti-suit injunctions.

Commercial contracts usually contain governing law and jurisdiction clauses.

Before Brexit, a well-structured legal framework governing cross-border disputes between the United Kingdom and the European Union including Germany existed.

Since the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, the general European rules on the choice of law and jurisdiction no longer apply.

What is the applicable position now?

Choice of Law Generally, Brexit does not have an impact on governing law clauses irrespective whether they are governed by German law and point to the UK or whether they are governed by English, Northern-Irish or Scots law and point to Germany.

A choice of law clause is a term of a contract in which the parties to the contract specify that any dispute arising under the contract (including the interpretation of the contractual terms) shall be determined in accordance with the law of a particular jurisdiction.

In general, the parties are free in their choice of law, but also bound by their choice.

Before Brexit, the rules regarding the choice of law were set out in the Rome I Regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (593/2008) and the Rome II Regulation on the law applicable on non-contractual obligations (864/2007).

Post-Brexit, the United Kingdom has transferred these ""Rome-regulations"" into British law.

As it relates to the applicable law provisions, it follows that EU member states must generally respect such provisions regard-less of whether the law chosen is that of an EU member state or of a ""third country"", like England and Wales.

Consequently, there is no big difference towards pre-Brexit times.

The parties may govern their contracts under their preferential law.

Brexit should, therefore, not have any influence for the parties from choosing either English or German law.

The only possible negative impact of Brexit could be that the case law of the European Court of Justice will be no longer applicable.

British courts may interpret case law on a different approach.

However, as the ""Rome-Regulations"" are still applicable, British courts will probably continue interpreting the case law by reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice.

Choice of Jurisdiction The situation regarding the forum selection clauses is different.

Pre-Brexit, the courts applied the EU's Brussels Ia Regulation on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments (EU No. 1215/2012).

Post-Brexit, the courts determine their own jurisdiction according to the law of their own jurisdiction, so called ""lex fori""."
ADVANT Beiten,Brexit and Its Effects on Dispute Resolution – A How-to Guide on Civil Disputes Post-Brexit (Vol. 1),"Post-Brexit, the courts determine their own jurisdiction according to the law of their own jurisdiction, so called ""lex fori"".

English courts determine their jurisdiction from the perspective of the laws of England & Wales, the EU Member States, as Germany, from their perspective of national applicable law.

This carries the risk of conflict in the choice of jurisdiction and parallel proceedings on both sides of the Channel:

A party sued in Germany and domiciled in the UK is no longer prevented from bringing the dispute already pending before an English court.

But let's start from the very beginning: A forum selection or choice of jurisdiction clause regulates in which country's court the civil dispute should be resolved and settled.

If the contract contains a choice of jurisdiction clause, the contractual situation is clear.

The parties are bound by the chosen place of jurisdiction.

If the chosen place of jurisdiction is in England, the parties must litigate the civil dispute in England.

But what happens if the British party also wants to take legal action in Germany despite of a jurisdiction clause pointing to the English courts?

Or how should the court handle the opposite case, if a German party wants to take legal action in England despite a German choice of jurisdiction clause?

As already mentioned, since the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, the general European rules on civil procedure law no longer apply.

The only remaining option is the applicability of international conventions: As of 21 January 2021, the United Kingdom has acceded to the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (""Hague Convention"").

The Hague Convention applies in international cases only to exclusive choice of court agreements in civil or commercial matters.

If the jurisdiction clause is exclusive, the court of the contracting state designated in this exclusive choice of court agreement shall have jurisdiction to decide a dispute to which the agreement applies, Art. 5 (1) of the Hague Convention.

For instance, if a jurisdiction clause between German and British parties gives exclusive jurisdiction to German courts, the German courts must hear the case.

The British court shall suspend or dismiss proceedings to which an exclusive choice of court agreement applies.

Other international conventions are not apparent.

An attractive alternative would have been the Lugano Convention, which has the same background as the EU Brussels regulations.

Contracting states, are in addition to the EU also Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.

However, in summer 2021 the European Commission blocked the accession of the UK to the Lugano Convention.

It is also uncertain whether the Anglo-German Treaty on Legal Relations of 20 March 1928 applies.

This agreement has been superseded by the EU's Brussels Ia Regulation on Jurisdic-tion and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments.

It is disputed whether this Treaty and others are revived due to the Brexit.

In any case, it is apparent that none of these agreements would help over any exclusive English or German jurisdiction clause.

ADVANT Beiten,European Parliament in support of plans for an European Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,"On June 1, 2023 the European Parliament resolved by large majority vote to adopt its position for the upcoming negotiations with regard to the proposed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

In this respect, it has expressed its support for tightening up many aspects of the EU Commission's proposal for a Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence submitted on February 23, 2022 (see our blog post at that time).

Core topic: Human rights and environmenal supply chain due diligence The proposed directive includes in particular human rights and environmental due diligence duties for companies, which are similar to the due diligence duties regulated in the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (see our flyer on this Act).

The core elements of these duties are the identification, prevention, mitigation or termination of current or potential negative human rights and environmental impacts in the company's own operations, in its subsidiaries and in the value chain of the company.

Extended scope of application for EU and non EU companies According to the resolution of the European Parliament, the due diligence obligations shall apply to all companies based in the EU with more than 250 employees and a global turnover of more than 40 million euros, as well as to parent companies with more than 500 employees and a global turnover of more than 150 million euros.

This is a considerable extension compared to the proposal of the EU Commission, according to which the first-mentioned thresholds would only apply to companies operating in certain high-risk sectors.

For the remaining companies, those thresholds would apply which, according to the resolution of the European Parliament, should apply consolidated to ultimate parent companies.

The proposal of the EU Commission does not provide for any attribution within a group of companies.

Second, similar to the EU Commission's proposal, the due diligence requirements should also apply to non-EU companies with a global turnover of more than 150 million euros but only if at least 40 million euros are generated in the EU.

The CSDDD would therefore contribute significantly to a ""level playing field"" from the perspective of German-based companies.

This is because the German Supply Chain Act is applicable only to companies domiciled in Germany or with a branch office in Germany but not to other foreign companies.

However, considerably more companies would also affected in Germany due to the CSDDD, as up to now the aforementioned companies are directly affected by the German Supply Chain Act only if they have more than 3,000 employees in Germany (or from January 1, 2024 more than 1,000 employees in Germany).

Further topic: Sustainability and Climate Change In addition, companies shall in future develop and implement a plan to ensure that their business model and strategy is aligned with the objectives of the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of the global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement and the objective of climate neutrality until 2050.

For directors of companies with more than 1,000 employees, meeting the plan's targets shall have an impact on variable compensation.

Assessment and next steps The Council already decided on its negotiating position in November 2022, contrary to the Parliament calling for some easing compared to the EU Commission's proposal.

Now that the European Parliament has defined its negotiating position, the way is clear for the trilogue negotiations to begin.

It is still not possible to predict with certainty what the content of the CSDDD will ultimately be.

This particularly applies to the topics of sanctions and liability.

Even before and even more so after the publication of the EU Commission's proposal, there were fierce political discussions about the regulatory project."
ADVANT Beiten,European Parliament in support of plans for an European Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,"Even before and even more so after the publication of the EU Commission's proposal, there were fierce political discussions about the regulatory project.

Even on the day before the European Parliament passed its resolution, attempts were made to stop the negotiated compromise.

It can therefore be expected that the political discussion about the regulatory project will continue.

In all likelihood, however, the companies affected will have an implementation period of several years in some cases.

However, it does not imply that no further measures are necessary for the time being.

The CSDDD is not a stand-alone measure.

Rather, it is one of several steps that the EU Commission had already planned in its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance in 2018.

Other steps such as the EU Taxonomy and, above all, the new sustainability reporting have already been implemented or only need to be transposed into national law.

For example, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into force at the beginning of 2023, will lead to a considerable widening of the range of companies subject to the new sustainability reporting.

In Germany alone, around 15,000 companies will be affected in the future, and in total more than 50,000 companies, including non-EU companies (for more details, see our blog post on the new sustainability reporting ).

For more information on the European Parliament's decision on the CSDDD (with altogether 381 (!) amendment proposals), reference is made to the Parliament's press release and the documents linked therein.

ADVANT Beiten,Tightening of management liability: BGH expands the scope of protection under the board and employment relationships for limited partnerships,"Under the settled case law of the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH), the protection inherent in the board and employment relationship with the director of a general partner GmbH of a GmbH & Co. KG and any liability under § 43 (3) of the Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG) extends to the limited partnership.

With its judgment of 14 March 2023 (in Case No. II ZR 162/21), the BGH extends this jurisprudence to the liability of the director of a limited liability company (GmbH), which is the managing limited partner of a public limited partnership.

Facts of the case The claimant was the insolvency administrator of a GmbH & Co.

KG (the “debtor”).

The articles of association of the debtor provided that only the limited partner, U-GmbH, managed the business.

The defendant was a director of U-GmbH. U-GmbH was also the managing partner of other investment companies.

The debtor raised funds for a stock company (AG) and made these funds available as loans for real estate investments.

The loan agreement provided comprehensive collateral as security.

The claimant sought recourse from the director for an amount of EUR 200,000 because of payments made to the insolvent stock company.

The defendant did not play a part in the transfer.

Judgment of the BGH Like the lower courts, the Second Senate of the BGH affirmed the debtor’s claim for damages against the director of the GmbH under § 43 (2) of the GmbHG.

Under § 43 (2) GmbHG, the scope of protection of the board and employment relationship between the limited partner GmbH and its directors extends to the KG in the case of negligent management.

Managing the business of the limited partnership does not need to be the sole or central task of the GmbH. BGH affirms contract with protective effect to benefit the KG

The Senate affirmed the requirements of a contract with protective effect to benefit a third party: Under the articles of association, the KG will experience the services of the director when the limited partner GmbH manages the KG.

Failures of the directors of the GmbH will always negatively affect the KG.

There is a legitimate interest in including a third party – here the KG.

A director of the managing GmbH exercises their duties in the interests of the GmbH & Co. KG.

There is a good faith need to protect the KG.

A breach of the director’s duties when managing the business of the KG will be particularly detrimental to the KG.

The KG does not generally have a right to instruct the director.

The rights to revoke the power of attorney and object to directors are not contrary to the need for protection.

The interests of the KG in being included under the scope of protection is apparent to the GmbH and the extension of the protection is reasonable for the GmbH.

This applies even where U-GmbH also managed other funds so that the management of the GmbH & Co.

KG was not its sole or material task.

The latter issue remained open until now.

The BGH followed the judgments of the higher regional courts and the prevailing view in the literature: the fact that directors manage multiple companies does not change their duties.

A KG must be able to trust that the director will discharge their duties with care and diligence, regardless of the number of other companies it manages.

Liability, regardless of the internal division of responsibilities The defendant is also liable when, in line with the internal division of responsibilities, the director was not primarily responsible for managing the debtor.

While responsibilities may be divided up, directors will nevertheless remain jointly responsible.

In any case, directors will have a supervisory duty.

They must follow up on any irregularities or negative developments in areas that are not their direct responsibility.

There is no objective reason to limit the protective effect for the KG."
ADVANT Beiten,Tightening of management liability: BGH expands the scope of protection under the board and employment relationships for limited partnerships,"They must follow up on any irregularities or negative developments in areas that are not their direct responsibility.

There is no objective reason to limit the protective effect for the KG.

The Senate confirmed that the defendant had breached her duty of supervision as she did not prevent the transfers.

A report found that the AG had not made enough security available and that only a certain percentage of the investor monies were invested in real estate.

If the director had exercised her duties diligently, she would have noticed the maladministration of the core business of the debtor.

Summary The landmark BGH judgment tightens director liability by extending the scope of the protection inherent in the board and employment relationships of the director.

Under the jurisprudence of the BGH, this protection and, accordingly, the liability of directors under § 43 (2) of the GmbHG applies to the limited partner GmbH of a GmbH & Co. KG and extends to the limited partnership.

The BGH clarified that the board and employment relationships of a director of a managing limited partner-GmbH lead to protection for the benefit of the limited partnership.

The director is therefore also liable to the limited partnership for breaches of their duties under § 43 (2) of the GmbHG.

ADVANT Beiten,First German Cannabis Bill – Half Baked? – Implications for social clubs and commerce,"The German health minister Mr. Lauterbach has presented - as announced - a first draft of a law that is to further open the cannabis market.

The government is still discussing the bill internally; the bill therefore may still change.

Nevertheless, the draft hints what the future legal landscape in Germany might look like with regard to cannabis.

The bill regulates only the 1st pillar of the 2-pillar-model envisaged by the health ministry (in this context refer to our blog post of 13 April 2023 ).

Thus, the draft includes, in particular, provisions regarding the protection of minors, home cultivation and the planned non-profit associations.

The bill aims to contribute to an improved protection of children and minors as well as to improved health protection, to strengthen education on cannabis and prevention and to curb the black market.

In addition to the protection of minors, non-profit associations are the central issue of the bill.

According to the bill, the so-called cultivation associations are allowed to have a maximum of 500 members and it is not allowed to be a member in more than one cultivation association.

According to the bill, only the cultivation associations will be allowed to distribute cannabis for non-medical personal use to members only and at cost price.

Distribution and cultivation are subject to strict regulations.

First, you have to obtain a permit to cultivate and distribute.

Second, cultivation associations can’t sell to third parties and are restricted to selling cannabis on the internet.

Third, even the type of packaging (neutral packaging or unwrapped) and the information on the package leaflets will probably be regultated.

Since the 2nd pillar envisages model regions for the legal sale of cannabis, changes in the legal provisions are likely to occur at least in the long run.

Insofar, the final bill remains to be seen as well as a draft for the implementation of the 2nd pillar.

The way for trading cannabis seeds is already paved in the present draft; importing cannabis seeds would be permitted for cultivation associations and home cultivation.

Pursuant to the draft, cultivation associations are only allowed to finance themselves through membership fees.

So far, there are no information on how the associations would have to be structured, membership fees, termination options and monitoring.

This, in turn, can open up some creative space for the creation of cultivation associations and subsequent investments.

The draft bill also provides extensive provisions regarding cannabis for medical purposes.

Cannabis for medical purposes may only be distributed in pharmacies.

Importing and exporting cannabis from cultivation for medical purposes should be permissible.

Insofar, the possibilities for import, export and transit are open for cannabis for medical purposes.

The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) will be responsible for granting permissions.

Likewise, the control of cultivation and cross-border traffic of cannabis for medical purposes is to be subject to the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.

However, the bill also shows that the legislator attaches great importance to the protection of minors and the prevention of addiction.

Accordingly, extensive documentation and reporting obligations are imposed on the cultivation associations.

In particular, cultivation associations are to annually submit to the respective authorities comprehensive information on the quantities of cannabis and propagating material produced, dispensed and destroyed by the cultivation association in the previous year.

Furthermore, the relevant authorities are to be given extensive powers to monitor the cultivation associations."
ADVANT Beiten,First German Cannabis Bill – Half Baked? – Implications for social clubs and commerce,"Furthermore, the relevant authorities are to be given extensive powers to monitor the cultivation associations.

As the above comments show, the current draft bill provides strict regulations for the planned cultivation associations and overall, for the legal cultivation and distribution of cannabis.

In this respect, founding such association must be well planned and prepared in detail in order to be able to overcome the high legal obstacles of the cannabis law.

In this regard, and in the context of cross-border trade in seeds as well as trade in medicinal cannabis, careful consideration of the extensive legal framework that the Cannabis Act will provide, and thus in-depth legal advice, is required.

It remains to be seen in how far the draft bill will change due to the internal coordination with the other ministries and after consultation with the associations to be appropriately involved in the subject matter.

ADVANT Beiten,Incompetence does not protect against liability - on director liability due to incapability,"The director of a limited liability company (GmbH) does not have to be able to do everything and can delegate tasks.

However, the director must choose any delegee carefully and supervise their work.

They cannot rely on their own incompetence to avoid personal liability.

The Federal Fiscal Court (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) confirmed this in a recent judgment.

Judgment of the Federal Fiscal Court of 15 November 2022 in Case No. VII R 23/19 Facts of the case Since it was founded in 2002, the claimant had been the sole director of A-GmbH and held 90% of the shares.

His grandson held the remaining 10% of shares in the company and took over its management on 23 April 2012.

Meanwhile, the claimant’s son was an authorised officer (Prokurist) of the company and effectively acted as the executive director.

Between 19 March 2007 and 11 July 2011, the GmbH reduced its VAT, corporate tax, and business tax by not submitting certain tax declarations and providing incorrect information in others.

These were based on a system of fake invoices and accounting entries without receipts.

On 19 March 2014, a liability assessment was issued against the claimant, his son, and his grandson for the tax liabilities of the GmbH.

The claimant filed a protest, and on 30 January 2015 the tax authority reduced the amount of the liability.

It also rejected the legal remedy sought as unfounded.

The process The claimant applied to the Regional Fiscal Court in Münster to have the liability assessment in the form of the objection ruling of 30 May 2015 nullified.

He challenged both the basis of the claim and the amount of the liability.

The Fiscal Court rejected the application.

Judgment of the Federal Fiscal Court of 15 November 2022 The Federal Fiscal Court unanimously dismissed the appeal as unfounded without hearing any further oral arguments in accordance with § 126a of the Code of Procedures of the Fiscal Courts (Finanzgerichtsordnung, FCO).

The liability assessment did not infringe the claimant’s rights.

The managing director of a limited liability company shall be liable in accordance with §§ 69 first sentence and 34 (1) of the Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) in combination with § 35 (1) first sentence on the Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG) when the GmbH receives tax rebates or refunds without any legal grounds because the director wilfully or through gross negligence breached the duties imposed on them resulting in the liability arising from the tax debtor-creditor relationship of the company not being determined or not being determined in time.

The Federal Fiscal Court held that these conditions were fulfilled.

Following the jurisprudence of the Federal Fiscal Court, the objective breach of duty indicated culpability within the meaning of § 69 first sentence of the Fiscal Code.

The claimant tried to release himself from liability by claiming his son actually managed the business of the GmbH and his advanced age and knowledge and abilities meant he was not in a position to reproduce the business transactions in the company software.

He claimed that he therefore no fault could be attributed to him.

The Federal Fiscal Court countered this line of argument.

Failure to appropriately supervise First, the BFH held that the claimant failed to appropriately supervise.

A director can transfer responsibility for dealing with tax matters of the GmbH to another person.

However, he may not blindly rely on this person, but must carefully select them and continue to monitor their work.

Under the case law of the BFH, failure to appropriately supervise establishes a grossly negligent breach of duties within the meaning of § 69 of the Fiscal Code."
ADVANT Beiten,Incompetence does not protect against liability - on director liability due to incapability,"Under the case law of the BFH, failure to appropriately supervise establishes a grossly negligent breach of duties within the meaning of § 69 of the Fiscal Code.

More stringent requirements must apply to supervisory measures, the less the director is able to form a judgment based on the facts and depending on whether the person(s) delegated with dealing with the tax matters of the company provides the necessary guarantees that they will deal with these matters reliably.

The BFH also did not accept the claimant’s argument, that a managing director acting with due diligence would not have identified the fake invoices and accounting entries without receipts, which the son had entered in the accounts, without any further investigation and knowledge.

In the Court’s view, the claimant could have easily ascertained that 34 entries were made without receipts had he looked in the accounts.

Further, the claimant sanctioned the de facto management by his son and allowed him to do what he did without sufficiently supervising him.

Incompetence is not an excuse In particular, the BFH countered the claimant’s argument that, due to his knowledge and abilities and in particular his advanced age, he was not able to follow the business transactions in the company software.

If a director has the lack of skills and knowledge that the claimant described, they should not manage a GmbH at all.

If they are no longer able to perform their duties, the director must resign.

Practical significance The judgments show that neither the delegation of duties nor incompetence can exonerate a director from their (tax) liability.

These principles apply to more than just the personal liability of directors for the tax liabilities of the company.

The legal situation of the internal relationship between the company and the director is similar.

Every director must exercise their duties with the care of a prudent businessman.

If the director intentionally breaches their duties, they must make good any arising damage to the company, § 43 (2) of the GmbHG.

The standards for diligence will depend on the specific relationship of each company, as well as their size and activities.

Neither the extent of the director’s duties nor the question of liability depends on the personal qualities, age, or experience of the director.

This does not mean that a director must know and be able to do everything.

Certain aspects of management may be delegated to lower levels of the company or third parties.

The duty to keep orderly accounts, which was the subject of this judgment, is something that the director must “ensure” under § 41 of the GmbHG.

They are not required to perform the work themselves, but the responsibility for the proper discharge of the duty remains with them.

If they delegate the accounting role to employees or an external tax advisor, the director has the duty to select this person with care, and to carefully instruct them and monitor their work.

In addition, they must always be able to access accounting documents and take corrective action where necessary.

A director can seek expert advice on specific legal or even tax questions and thus be released from liability.

If a director follows the advice they receive and still breaches their duties, they will not be acting culpably when the mandated (tax) advisor is independent and professionally qualified, the director provided the advisor with the correct and full facts and the director performs their own plausibility control of the advice received.

At its core, the judgment confirms that where a director is personally incapable of performing their duties, they should not take up the position of director or should resign.

However, this needs some clarification.

Directors have responsibility for the company management, but do not have to perform every task personally.

If they delegate a task, they must select the delegee with care and instruct and supervise them."
ADVANT Beiten,Incompetence does not protect against liability - on director liability due to incapability,"If they delegate a task, they must select the delegee with care and instruct and supervise them.

If the director is unable to fulfil these selection and supervision duties, they should refrain from taking up a position as director given the strict standards of officer liability.

ADVANT Beiten,Draft Bill Commercial Courts: Booster for Civil Proceedings or a half-baked Idea?,"The number of incoming cases at German civil courts has been declining for years [ BMJ | Pressemitteilungen | Rückgang der Eingangszahlen bei den Zivilgerichten: Forschungsbericht an das Bundesjustizministerium übergeben ].

On 25 April 2023, the Federal Ministry of Justice presented a draft bill [ BMJ | Aktuelle Gesetzgebungsverfahren | Gesetz zur Stärkung des Justizstandortes Deutschland durch Einführung von Commercial Courts und der Gerichtssprache Englisch in der Zivilgerichtsbarkeit ], which is intended to counteract the declining case numbers by establishing so-called Commercial Chambers and Courts and allowing proceedings to be conducted in English.

However, the draft bill appears to be more of a cost-efficient way of implementing the requirements of the coalition agreement than actually increasing the competitiveness of the German civil court system.

But let us wait for the coming drafts and discussions in parliament.

Our blog already reported on the first key points of the Commercial Courts in February [ Globalisation of court proceedings through so-called commercial courts | Advant Beiten (advant-beiten.com) ].

According to the draft bill, the following proposals, among others, are to be implemented: The federal states will be authorised to set up senates at the higher regional courts or highest regional courts, which will have jurisdiction for civil law disputes between entrepreneurs exceeding an amount in dispute of EUR 1 million.

The parties may expressly or tacitly agree on the jurisdiction of these commercial courts.

The federal states are per-mitted to bundle jurisdiction of the commercial court in one court and thus save resources across the federal states.

The federal states may provide for English as the language of proceedings at the commercial chambers of the regional courts and the commercial courts.

This is intended to facilitate proceedings before these courts: Translations of English-language documents are no longer required.

However, the courts are free to call in an interpreter at any stage of the proceedings.

In the revision proceedings, it is then up to the Federal Court of Justice whether the proceedings are continued in German or English.

At the request of a party, information classified as confidential under section 2 No. 1 of the Act on the Protection of Trade Secrets shall be protected.

The involvement of third parties, e.g. by way of a notice of dispute, can quickly negate the advantage of English-language proceedings: The third party can object to the language of the proceedings within two weeks after the written pleading involving the third party.

The Commercial Courts should explicitly hold procedural conferences, so-called case management conferences or CMCs.

CMCs have been common practice in arbitration proceedings for years in order to structure and actively manage arbitral proceedings.

Also reproduced from arbitration practice is the possibility of producing live verbatim transcripts.

Commercial Courts have certain parallels to arbitration without really being more attractive.

The great advantage of arbitration is not so much the choice of any language but rather the expertise of the arbitrators: the parties can determine the arbitrator they consider most suitable.

Commercial Courts are a first step towards modernising German civil procedure.

However, they do not solve its fundamental problems.

The current draft bill already contains some points that reduce the attractiveness of these courts.

One example is that the amount in dispute must exceed EUR 1 million.

However, the complexity and internationality of proceedings are rarely related to the amount in dispute.

ADVANT Beiten,Reform of German Arbitration Law: Initial Key Point,"""German law is already arbitration-friendly, but good things can always be made better.""

With these words, Dr Marco Buschmann German Federal Minister of Justice comments the initial key points of the reform of German arbitration law.

These key points [ Eckpunkte_Schiedsverfahrensrecht.pdf (bmj.de) ] are intended to make Germany more attractive and competitive both as a place for arbitration and as a place for state court proceedings: The form-free conclusion of arbitration agreements between commercial business partners is intended to eliminate possible legal uncertainties that arise when arbitration agreements are concluded orally or in electronic form only.

No changes are planned for arbitration agreements with consumers.

In multi-party arbitration proceedings mechanisms for the appointment of arbitrators are to be introduced, which are to guarantee a clear and legally certain procedure, especially if multiple parties on one side of the proceedings disagree.

The practice of conducting arbitration hearings by video conference, which is already in place today, is to be codified.

Furthermore, arbitral awards shall be published with the consent of the parties.

Thereby, arbitral awards may contribute to the further development of the law.

Transparency would be increased.

While it was previously merely possible to set aside positive decisions on the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals pursuant Sec. 1040 (3) sentence 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), in future this would also be possible for negative decisions.

There is to be a further simplification for English-language arbitration proceedings and documents in English.

In future, these will no longer have to be translated for proceedings before state courts that are conducted in conjunction with arbitration proceedings.

This will significantly reduce the duration and expense of enforcement and annulment proceedings.

This should also affect assistance of state courts in taking of evidence pursuant Sec. 1050 ZPO.

To the extent the federal authorities have set up commercial courts, these shall be responsible for setting aside and declaring arbitral awards enforceable.

(Regarding commercial courts see also the blog post of 7 February 2023: Globalisation of court proceedings through so-called commercial courts | Advant Beiten (advant-beiten.com) ).

In addition to these projects, further measures are to be taken to accelerate both proceedings and the enforcement of decisions.

In particular, it should be easier to enforce arbitral decisions regarding interim relief.

This even applies if the place of arbitration is abroad.

The German Federal Ministry of Justice also provides an outlook on which other projects it will work on in the near future.

The relevant keywords are emergency arbitrators, dissenting opinions, the concentration of jurisdiction across federal borders in Germany and the allocation of the assistance by state courts to the Higher Regional Courts.

Since it has been 25 years since the last reform of arbitration law, the project is to be supported without further ado.

It remains to be seen which of the BMJ's proposals will make it into the draft law.

As experience with institutional arbitration has shown, the proposed opt-in provision for the publication of arbitral awards is unlikely to achieve the desired goal.

We will keep you up to date on this.

ADVANT Beiten,Licensed Stores vs. Social Clubs – Germany up in smoke?,"An overview of the key points for the new cannabis law In the coalition agreement of 2021, the coalition parties agreed on the introduction of controlled sale of cannabis for consumption to adults in licensed shops.

The decisive factors here should be to control the quality, to prevent the transfer of contaminated substances, to guarantee the best possible protection of minors and health protection of consumers as well as to curb the black market.

The 1st Key Issues Paper of the German Federal Government regarding this matter was presented in October 2022 but was met with significant concerns in light of European law and international law from various sides.

The Bavarian State government, for instance, commissioned a legal opinion regarding the compatibility of cannabis legalization with European and international law.

The legal opinion by Prof. Bernhard Wegener of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg was presented in March 2023 and found that the intended legislation of cannabis contradicted international and European law requirements, in particular, the relevant UN conventions on drug control.

There have recently also been opposite views in European jurisprudence.

A legal study by the University of Nijmegen which was published in a specialist article, for example, has found that under certain circumstances the introduction of a government-controlled national license system for cannabis for consumption by a EU member state is possible under European and international law.

Yet, the specialist article by the University of Nijmegen also views the UN conventions on drug control as a high - but not insurmountable - obstacle for the legalization of cannabis.

The question regarding the compatibility with European and international law has certainly played a significant part in the fact that the draft bill planned for March 2023 has not yet been presented.

Instead of a draft bill, Mr. Lauterbach, the German Federal Health Minister, recently declared that the key issues presented in October 2022 had been revised.

The revised key issues have now been presented by the Federal Ministry of Health.

According to the revised key issues, now a so-called 2-pillar-model (""club cultivation & regional model/CARe"") is planned.

Accordingly, there initially will be no unrestricted sale in licensed stores, as originally intended, at least not nationwide.

This is supposed to be put into practice as a 2nd pillar for the time being only in model regions (districts/cities in several federal states according to the opt-in approach) for a project duration of 5 years under scientific supervision.

Thereafter, companies will be enabled to produce, distribute and sell cannabis for consumption to adults in a licensed and state-controlled framework under the application of a geographical limit.

However, this offers the first opportunity to enter a legal cannabis market in Germany.

ADVANT Beiten will be happy to support you with our expertise in this regard.

The 1st pillar, in contrast, provides, in addition to a limited penalty-free cultivation of cannabis, that non-profit associations (up to 500 members) are allowed to grow cannabis for consumption collectively under a narrow, clearly defined legal framework and distribute it to their members for their own final consumption.

The nature, structure, financing, etc. of this association will still have to be discussed and will require legal review and, in the future, legal support for the process of establishing such associations.

ADVANT Beiten offers the necessary knowledge to accompany this process.

The cannabis may only be distributed to members and not to third parties.

Additionally, penalty-free possession for own consumption of up to 25 grammes is supposed to be possible.

However, it is open whether these intended regulations will actually lead to a curbing of the black market.

Here, the draft bill remains to be waited for."
ADVANT Beiten,Licensed Stores vs. Social Clubs – Germany up in smoke?,"However, it is open whether these intended regulations will actually lead to a curbing of the black market.

Here, the draft bill remains to be waited for.

The revised Key Issues Paper further provides with regard to the concerns under European and international law that the proposed regulations regarding the 1st pillar should be formed in such a way that no notification requirement and no requirement of consent by the Federal Council (Bundesrat) is triggered.

However, it is still assumed that there will be a notification requirement for the proposed regulations regarding the 2nd pillar.

In addition to the questions of European and international law, the consequences of legalization under criminal law will also be discussed.

The German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht, BVerfG) could soon make a decisive contribution in this matter.

The BVerfG announced that it will decide on various judges' submissions on criminal law provisions in the German Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz, BtMG) which concern the cannabis ban until early summer 2023.

In this respect, the BVerfG could even pre-empt politics and legislation and, thus, bring new momentum into the matter, perhaps even opposing the revised key issues paper.

Not only politics and jurisprudence have been eagerly awaiting the draft bill, but also the business community.

Medium-sized companies and start-ups see new business opportunities in the legalization of cannabis, but of course also companies from countries where the legalization of cannabis is already more advanced.

Initial considerations assumed a turnover of 1.2 to 2.3 billion euros per year that could be generated due to legalization.

From the point of view of the Federal Republic of Germany, this alone would have had the side effect of an estimated EUR 350 million in additional tax revenue just from the sales tax on legal sales.

Here, it remains to be seen how the key issues will be legally implemented and finally how the ""project"" model regions will develop.

Nevertheless, Germany will open a new cannabis market soon, creating new opportunities for companies to enter another cannabis market, for the production and sale of cannabis, to establish new companies or to acquire existing companies.

In all of this, ADVANT Beiten has a competent team to provide legal support and assistance in the implementation of these new opportunities.

A first draft bill for the 1st pillar of the 2-pillar-model is to be presented before the end of April, and then the draft bill for the 2nd pillar.

As many details are still unclear, anyone wishing to enter this market should seek advice early on.

ADVANT Beiten,Special risks to look for during due diligence procedures on a company in the logistics sector,"Introduction Numerous challenges confronting the transport and logistics sector directly affect M&A deals in this global industry.

An expected recession reducing global transport volumes, staff shortages, burdens on the supply chain, the residual effects of the pandemic, and increasing energy and raw material prices have all caused severe difficulties for the sector.

In addition to these obvious risks affecting the market in general, several less present sector-specific topics require special consideration prior to any transaction due to their economic impact.

This article looks at four such issues: the legal uncertainty surrounding the limit of financial liability for transport (see point 2); impending fines for the violation of cabotage provisions (see point 3); the effects of Part I of the EU mobility package on the transport industry (see point 4); and the risks of liability from commissioning freight forwarding (see point 5).

Legal (un)certainty with respect to limits of liability for cross-border multimodal transport, including transport by sea A special feature of the liability regime under transport law is that the carrier is generally liable for damage to goods under their responsibility, irrespective of fault.

As a trade-off, financial liability is limited.

Limits of liability differ depending on the mode of transport (e.g., truck, ship, aircraft).

When a contract of carriage provides for various modes of transport (e.g., road transport and shipment by sea), the limit of liability that applies to the stage in which the damage occurred will be the applicable limit of liability for the whole carriage.

But which law applies when the stage is unknown?

Overlap of the contents of the regulation Where a freight forwarding contract involves various modes of transport, including transport by sea, the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the German Freight Forwarders’ Standard Terms and Conditions 2017 ( Allgemeine Deutsche Spediteurbedingungen 2017, ADSp 2017 ) provides that, when the place of damage is unknown, the freight forwarder shall be liable for 2 instead of 8.33 special drawing rights (SDR) per kilogramme of freight (approx.

2.50/kg).

In other words, where the place the damage occurred is unknown, the limit of liability under maritime law shall apply.

If the freight was forwarded across borders, carriage by various forms of transport, including transport by sea, can also be subsumed under the first sentence of section 23.2, second case, of the ADSp 2017.

According to this provision, in the case of cross-border transport, the freight forwarder’s liability will be limited to the maximum statutory liability.

Where the place of damage is unknown in cross-border freight forwarding via various forms of transport, liability is limited to 8.33 SDR per kilogramme (approx.

EUR 10.00/kg) under § 452 of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB ) in combination with § 431 (1) of the HGB.

The first sentence of section 23.2, second case, of the ADSp 2017 concerns cross-border freight forwarding and applies to both unimodal (= one form of transport, e.g., truck) and multimodal transport (e.g., truck and ship).

In the case of multimodal transport including transport by sea, the rule in the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the ADSp 2017 overlaps, which, in contrast to § 431 (1) of the HGB, establishes a maximum liability equivalent to two special drawing rights, without any distinction between cross-border and other modes of transport.

For legal scholars, there is a question of some dispute whether, in the case of an overlap where the place of the damage is unknown, the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the ADSp 2017 applies as a special rule because freight forwarding including transport by sea will generally be cross-border, or whether the first sentence of section 23.2 second case of the ADSp 2017 applies to all cross-border freight forwarding, which would almost quadruple the amount of liability."
ADVANT Beiten,Special risks to look for during due diligence procedures on a company in the logistics sector,"Perhaps for the first time, the Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht, OLG) in Stuttgart addressed this question in August 2021.

Reversing the logistics-friendly decision of the Regional Court of Ulm at first instance, the OLG held that the ADSp 2017 are general terms and conditions for the logistics sector.

Accordingly, any doubts about the interpretation of ADSp 2017 should be resolved to the detriment of the user (§ 305c (2) of the German Civil Code, BGB)-

The first sentence of section 23.1.2 of ADSp 2017 must, therefore, be understood as only applying to domestic freight forwarding using multiple forms of transport, including sea transport.

Based on this judgment, the liability of logistics companies for cross-border freight forwarding using multiple forms of transport, including sea transport, quadrupled from approx.

EUR 2.50/kg to approx.

EUR 10.00/kg.

Federal Court of Justice clarifies position On 27 October 2022, the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof, BGH ) handed down its highly anticipated judgment on the appeal (Case No.

I ZR 139/21); it was published at the beginning of March 2023.

The BGH annulled the judgment of the OLG Stuttgart and sent it back for retrial.

In the Court’s view, where the place of the damage is unknown, the maximum liability limit for cross-border freight forwarding with multiple modes of transport, including sea transport, is two special drawing rights per kilogramme in accordance with the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the ADSp 2017.

In such cases, the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the ADSp 2017 is lex specialis compared to the first sentence of section 23.2, case 2 of ADSp 2017 (Judgment of the BGH of 27 October 2022 in Case No.

I ZR 139/21 – juris Ls.).

The preamble of ADSp 2017 recommended that the participating economic actors – freight forwarders on the one hand and shippers from trade and industry on the other - apply these standard terms and conditions from 1 January 2017.

This is the relevant public that determines the interpretation of the provisions (at margin no. 38).

This group would not accept that rule established in the first sentence of section 23.2, case 2 of ADSp 2017 constitutes a reverse exception to the rule established in the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of ADSp 2017, further restricting the scope of a rule to only domestic freight transport when that rule is already significantly reduced to multiple forms of transport including sea transport with an unknown place of the damage (at margin no. 42).

An interpretation, which would see the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the ADSp 2017 apply only to transport which was domestic and not cross-border and which included sea transport and where the place of damage was unknown, is a theoretically conceivable but practically implausible interpretation that cannot be seriously considered.

Such an interpretation would render the rule set out in the first sentence of section 23.1.2 of the ADSp substantially pointless because the provision would have almost no practical application considering the minor importance of domestic transport by sea (at margin no. 43).

Impact of the BGH judgment on the limit of liability In its judgment, the BGH sent a clear signal concerning the interpretation of the ADSp 2017.

At the same time, it referred the case back to the OLG Stuttgart, so the issue is still not entirely resolved.

When performing a due diligence analysis on a logistics company that is frequently involved in cross-border freight forwarding, including sea transport, you should assume a liability risk of 8.33 SDR per kilogramme for any calculations.

Potential fines from breaches of cabotage provisions When performing due diligence on an internationally operating logistics company, pay special attention to any infringements of public law provisions on road haulage.

Potentially, six-figure fines can be imposed."
ADVANT Beiten,Special risks to look for during due diligence procedures on a company in the logistics sector,"Potentially, six-figure fines can be imposed.

Breach of cabotage provisions Fines for infringements of cabotage provisions are a typical risk.

Under road haulage law, cabotage is the transport of goods using vehicles and combinations of vehicles with a total weight of more than 3,5 tonnes where the loading and delivery sites are in the same state and the haulier does not have a registered office or branch in that state; in other words, domestic transport by foreign companies.

Under the first sentence of Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EC) 1072/2009, once the haulier has conducted an incoming cross-border carriage from another EU Member State or a third country and delivered the goods in the host Member State (e.g., to Germany), the haulier can undertake up to three further domestic/cabotage operations with the same vehicle within 7 days (small cabotage).

Only once the vehicle has conducted another cross-border carriage can the haulier conduct three further cabotage operations within Germany.

Article 8 (2) of Regulation 1072/2009 provides that companies with EU licences can carry out cabotage operations not only in the host Member State following incoming international carriage (the country that the goods are unloaded after crossing the border), but also in other Member States, as long as any cabotage operation within a Member State is concluded within three days of the unladen entry into the territory of that Member State (large cabotage).

The haulier must be able to provide clear evidence for the cross-border carriage of goods to the host Member State and for every subsequent cabotage operation under Article 8 (3) of Regulation 1072/2009.

In addition, for cross-border transport, the haulier must have a Community licence, as well as a driver’s attestation if the driver is a national of a third country (Article 3 of Regulation 1072/2009).

Legal consequence: administrative offence with fines The infringements of the cabotage provisions of Regulation 1072/2009 is an administrative offence under § 19 of the Road Haulage Act ( Güterkraftverkehrsgesetz, GüKG ), and fines of up to EUR 200,000 can be imposed.

We therefore recommend performing an in-depth analysis of this issue as part of the due diligence procedure.

Effect of the new EU mobility package on the transport industry When analysing a logistics company as part of a due diligence investigation, the not yet fully foreseeable effects of Part I of the EU mobility package on the transport and logistics sector should be taken into account.

On 8 July 2020, the European Parliament discussed Part I of the package and a majority voted in favour of the reforms it contains.

These include rules for the posting of workers for professional drivers, access to the market and the profession, as well as social legislation.

Many of the new rules have only applied since February 2022 making it impossible at present to accurately assess the effects on the transport and logistics sector.

These practical uncertainties should influence prices for the transaction.

Specific rules on the posting of workers for the road transport sector Since 2 February 2022, minimum wage rules have applied under Directive (EU) 2020/1057 of the European Parliament and the Council of 15 July 2020 laying down specific rules with respect to Directive 96/71/EC and Directive 2014/67/EU for posting drivers in the road transport sector.

Article 1 (1) of Directive (EU) 2020/1057 in connection with Article 2 (1) of Directive 96/71/EC provides that every employee shall be considered “posted” when they perform their work in another EU Member State for a limited period.

The European directives apply to all drivers employed by companies located in the European Union.

Bilateral journeys, i.e., the transport of goods from the home state to another Member State or a third country, and transit journeys fall outside the scope of the Directives."
ADVANT Beiten,Special risks to look for during due diligence procedures on a company in the logistics sector,"Bilateral journeys, i.e., the transport of goods from the home state to another Member State or a third country, and transit journeys fall outside the scope of the Directives.

However, Article 1 (7) of Directive 2020/1057 expressly provides that drivers performing cabotage operations shall be considered posted (see under 3).

Companies posting drivers within the meaning of the Directive must provide the relevant authority of the host countries with a posting notification containing the identity of the logistics company and details of the Community licence, the contact details for the transport manager, information about the driver (name, address, drivers’ licence number, etc.)

and the number plate of the vehicle.

In addition, the company must ensure that it complies with the statutory terms and conditions of employment in the host country.

This includes driving and rest periods, as well as minimum wage and overtime rates.

If international logistics companies regularly carry out cabotage operations, the obligation to pay the minimum wage applicable in the relevant host state for the duration of the posting can constitute a significant cost factor.

, Minimum wages within the European Union range from EUR 2.41/hour (Bulgaria) to EUR 13.80/hour (Luxembourg).

Although it does not have any statutory minimum wage provisions, since 1 January 2021, Denmark has required drivers carrying out cabotage operations in Denmark to receive the minimum wage agreed under the relevant Danish collective wage agreement; currently, this is EUR 22.15/ hour.

Licence obligations for cross-border transport with vehicles with a maximum admissible weight of more than 2.5 tonnes Since 21 May 2022, when performing the due diligence on a logistics company that is not primarily involved in transport, you should verify whether the company is carrying out “smaller cross-border operations” using small transporters.

Be aware also of companies that have not needed a road haulage licence or a Community licence until now because they only transport goods with a vehicle, the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3,5 tonnes (passenger car).

In Germany, only the commercial transport of goods for a fee with vehicles with a permissible laden mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes (trucks) requires authorisation, §§ 1 and 3 of the Road Haulage Act.

Since 21 May 2022, companies require a Community licence when they carry out cross-border haulage with motor vehicles with a permissible laden mass exceeding 2,5 tonnes, Article 1 (4) (aa) of Regulation (EC) 1071/2009.

Companies that did not previously require a Community licence because they carried out cross-border road haulage using solely transporters below the 3,5-tonne limit might now need to apply for a Community licence under Part I of the new EU mobility package.

Failure to do so can result in fines of up to EUR 20,000 (§ 19 (2) No. 1 and (7) of the Road Haulage Act).

Prohibition against spending weekly rest periods in the vehicle Since 21 February 2022, transport companies have had to contend with a widely discussed new rule which – at least in Germany – is not pragmatically workable.

When performing due diligence on a logistics company, consider the percentage of vehicles operating long-distance haulage which don’t return to the place of business over the weekend.

Significant costs could be incurred for these vehicles and the drivers in the future.

Under Article 1 (6) (c) of Regulation (EU) 2020/1054, drivers may not take regular weekly rest periods (normally from Friday to Sunday evening) in a vehicle.

Instead, drivers must take their rest in suitable gender-friendly accommodations with adequate sleeping and sanitary facilities.

Employers bear the costs of this accommodation."
ADVANT Beiten,Special risks to look for during due diligence procedures on a company in the logistics sector,"Instead, drivers must take their rest in suitable gender-friendly accommodations with adequate sleeping and sanitary facilities.

Employers bear the costs of this accommodation.

According to § 8a (1) second sentence of the Act on Driving Personnel of Trucks and Trams ( Gesetz über das Fahrpersonal von Kraftfahrzeugen und Straßenbahnen, FPersG ), companies shall have responsibility for ensuring that the regular weekly rest periods are respected when these are spent in the vehicle or at a location without suitable sleeping facilities.

Fines of up to EUR 30,000 can be imposed for infringements.

This rule does not clarify what is meant by “suitable sleeping facilities”.

Do companies have to book a hotel or rent a holiday house for their drivers?

Is a youth hostel or container sufficient?

Transport law experts often discuss whether this lack of clarity is sufficient for the provision to be considered unconstitutional because it infringes the requirement of certainty (Article 103 (2) of the Basic Law, Grundgesetz, GG).

Irrespective of the costs and possible fines, the new rules pose significant practical problems for logistics companies: few accommodation facilities have parking spaces for trucks.

Drivers, therefore, need to be transferred from rest areas to their accommodation.

Who will guard the truck and cargo during this time?

Insufficient numbers of car parks with attendants in Germany mean the issue of “truck tarp slicers” (thieves) will become more acute as trucks remained parked on weekends.

Companies face the dilemma of either complying with the transfer rule and risking the loss of the unguarded cargo, or risking fines of up to EUR 30,000, which must be recorded in the central commercial register and can jeopardise the company’s trustworthiness.

Liability for commissioning freight forwarding Beware of freight forwarding: another special risk for logistics companies.

A freight forwarding contract ( Lohnfuhrvertrag ) involves a “manned” transport, such as a truck, being made available for use for any desired cargo and journey on instruction by the principal (here: the target).

Freight forwarding contracts can take the form of service agreements, works agreements, leasing agreements or mixed contracts.

If the contractor is otherwise obliged to ensure successful transport, the contractor will become a freight forwarder.

The question of how a freight forwarding agreement should be classified from a legal perspective and what the legal consequences of this classification are for a freight forwarder, which uses its personnel to carry out transport for other companies, should be considered on a case-by-case basis (BGH, RdTW 2016, 215 at Margin No. 10).

The risk with this approach arises when logistics companies work as principals for freight forwarders.

Freight forwarders will only be liable vis-à-vis the principal, irrespective of negligence, when the freight forwarding agreement is classified as a contract of carriage within the meaning of § 407 of the HGB.

Where this is not the case, the freight forwarder will only be liable if they commit a wrongful act.

When making drivers available, this can be limited to any fault when selecting an agent (culpa in eligendo) (OLG Nuremberg, RdTW 2015, 300 at Margin No. 22 and 23).

In contrast, the principal will be liable vis-a-vis its customer, regardless of liability under the freight forwarding agreement.

Summary Transport and logistics companies are subject to a range of special regulations that don’t apply to other companies, particularly with respect to strict liability for goods under their care.

This liability and several special public laws that only apply to road haulage and can result in the imposition of fines if infringed make it worth taking a closer look at issues beyond the typical risks of a corporate acquisition when performing a due diligence analysis on a transport and logistics company."

ADVANT Beiten,PV and Wind Energy: New legislative Promotions expected to be enacted in July 2023!,"In order to achieve Germany’s ambitious renewables expansion targets (i.e. 80% by 2030), the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Ministry) is gearing up its efforts to promote the production of energy from PV and Wind (onshore) resources.

In March 2023, the Ministry invited representatives of the respective stakeholders to specific summits (PV and Wind) .

The Ministry presented its preliminary expansion strategy and kicked off a public consultation.

The responses to such consultation shall be used to finalize the Ministry’s strategy for PV and Wind this April.

The outcome will be presented on two further summits scheduled for April/May 2023.

In parallel, legal acts implementing the new strategy into the current legislative framework will be drawn up by the Ministry's legal department.

Time is of essence, as the entire legislative package shall be resolved by the Federal Parliament prior to the Parliament’s summer vacations (i.e. first week of July 2023).

The two consultation papers issued by the Ministry identify the following fields of action: PV: Stronger expansion of open space PV (in particular by easing zoning law)

[1] Granting reliefs for roof top PV (e.g. for small installations and buildings in undeveloped outskirts)

[2] Simplifying PV installations for tenants ("" Mieterstrom ""; e.g. by extending reliefs for own consumption)

Granting reliefs for balcony PV installations (e.g. by reducing registration requirements)

Accelerating grid access of PV installations (e.g. by imposing obligations on the DSOs to tolerate access)

Enhancing public acceptance (e.g. by promoting residential power associations)

Harmonizing energy law and tax law (e.g. by granting tax privileges for smaller PV installations)

ADVANT Beiten,Forewarned is forearmed – Dealing with product liability and the increased risks arising from the new EU Product Liability Directive,"Product liability poses a significant risk for companies, even today.

The new EU Product Liability Directive – currently still a draft - will increase this risk.

This article will help you identify the risks and look at what you can do to safeguard against liability.

The central tenet of the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz, ProdHaftG) is found in § 1 (1).

According to this provision, manufacturers must provide compensation for a defective product when that product causes the death of or injury to a person or damage to private property.

This strict liability rule does not differentiate based on whether or not the manufacturer was responsible for the defect.

The possibilities to reduce this liability are few.

Manufacturers can only release themselves from this strict liability when one of the circumstances established in the law for the exclusion of liability applies.

Strict liability means product liability is a significant risk for companies.

On 28 September 2022, the European Commission released a draft for a new EU product liability directive, which could significantly increase this risk for companies.

The new EU directive reflects the increasing number of digital products on the market.

Accordingly, the scope is expanded in several ways.

For example, the directive clarifies that software is a “product” under European product liability law.

Until now, this has been subject to dispute.

The scope of liability for personal use has also been expanded.

In the future, companies will face product liability risks where they would not have previously.

The elimination of both the limits of liability and the excess increases this risk.

You must identify imminent risks and take action to safeguard against them in the best way possible.

Any safeguard should have multiple levels: when drafting contracts, you should include appropriate specifications and rights of control, and allocate liability.

Careful design and documented production and quality controls are essential.

Above all, companies should ensure they are adequately insured and regularly review their insurance coverage, making adjustments where necessary.

Who is the producer under the Product Safety Act?

To assess the risks, it is important to identify the producer under the Product Safety Act.

The term “producer” is defined more widely in the Act than one would assume from the way the term is used in everyday language.

The manufacturer of the product, but also the manufacturer of any component part built into the product are both considered producers under the Act.

In the future, under product safety law, a company will even be liable as a producer if they make “substantial modifications” to a product.

European importers will also be liable as if they were a producer, even if they only put their logo or brand on the imported product (so-called quasi-manufacturer).

In this respect, quasi-manufacturers need to consider whether they should put their trademark or brand on a third-party product.

Manufacturers, importers, and quasi-manufacturers should ensure that, where they acquire (part)products from a supplier, their contracts contain appropriate limitations of liability and quality assurance obligations.

Where the parties agree to an assumption of costs in the case of liability, the supplier should also be required to provide proof of appropriate insurance.

If numerous parties are liable to pay compensation for the same damage, e.g., manufacturer and importer, they shall have joint and several liability.

The injured party can choose to seek damages from the party they prefer and will generally choose the party best placed economically.

The party from which the injured party seeks damages can, in turn, demand compensation from the other responsible party(ies).

In the case of international supply chains, importers can have difficulty enforcing claims against foreign manufacturers."
ADVANT Beiten,Forewarned is forearmed – Dealing with product liability and the increased risks arising from the new EU Product Liability Directive,"In the case of international supply chains, importers can have difficulty enforcing claims against foreign manufacturers.

A distributor can even be held liable if the manufacturer can’t be identified, or the distributor fails to provide the name of the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s supplier within one month of an incident.

In order to be able to provide this information in an emergency, a distributor should maintain a list of the relevant information about the manufacturer or importer.

Above all, they should not distribute any products without knowing the identity of the manufacturer.

In the future, in addition to the manufacturer, quasi-manufacturer and importer, the manufacturer’s authorised representative and fulfilment service providers within the meaning of product safety law will be liable for defective products in the same manner as the manufacturer.

This means economic actors, which were previously not confronted with such direct or indirect liability, must now also prepare for significant product liability risks.

It remains to be seen whether the authorised representative model established under product liability law has a future in its current form if the new rules are adopted.

Definition of product A product is a moveable that is placed on the market.

Medicines expressly fall outside the scope of the directive.

If moveables, such as construction materials, are integrated into a building, they will continue to be a product under the directive.

Increasing digitalisation has also impacted product liability law.

In the future, European product liability law will not only apply to moveables but will also expressly apply to digital manufacturing files and software.

The term software includes artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

This change significantly increases the scope of product liability law.

When is a product “defective”?

A product is defective within the meaning of the Product Liability Act when it doesn’t provide the safety an average customer would expect, justifiably considering all circumstances.

This will not change in the future, although new aspects, such as cybersecurity, will be added.

In contrast to the definition of “defective” under commercial warranty law, the safety aspect is the sole element for a product to be “defective” under product liability law.

The proper legal safety standard for a product depends on the seriousness of the risk, i.e., the likelihood that damage will occur, as well as the expected extent of damage, the status of the legal asset concerned, and the intensity of the damage.

If the product is designed to be used by different groups of users, the safety standard must be based on the weakest user group.

The price of the product can also influence safety expectations.

However, even cheap products must comply with basic safety.

The product must be safe to use in any manner that can be reasonably expected: this includes the proper use, as well as any predictable or usual incorrect use.

For example, children will put toys in their mouths.

When conducting product monitoring, manufacturers should therefore watch for any incorrect use of their product.

Normally, the manufacturer will not be liable for improper use, where that use is considered reckless in the circumstances.

Whether a product is defective under the Product Liability Act must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and will often only become clear after an expert has prepared a report for the insurer or as part of legal proceedings.

In many cases, this will involve independent proceedings for the taking of evidence.

Generally, a distinction is made between the following three categories of defects: Production defect: The product differs from the standard specifications for the product series.

The manufacturer will almost always be liable for production defects.

They will even be liable for “outliers” which are very unlikely to occur due to elaborate quality control measures."
ADVANT Beiten,Forewarned is forearmed – Dealing with product liability and the increased risks arising from the new EU Product Liability Directive,"The manufacturer will almost always be liable for production defects.

They will even be liable for “outliers” which are very unlikely to occur due to elaborate quality control measures.

In any case, full control of all products supplied, with careful documentation, can be enough in some cases to prove there was no production defect when the product was placed on the market.

Construction defect: In the case of a construction defect, the question is whether, when the product was placed on the market, an alternative construction would have prevented the damage from occurring.

From a construction perspective, therefore, the generally accepted rules of technology should be determined, observed, and documented.

Where necessary, any construction changes in later series should also be assessed to limit the identified product risk or implement new technology standards.

Generally, a cost/use analysis can be conducted as part of this assessment.

Instruction defect: An instruction defect occurs when the consumer is not or not sufficiently informed about the method of use and related dangers.

This requires an analysis of the potential hazards of a product.

The manufacturer should therefore provide clear and appropriate instructions for use.

In some cases, it may be necessary to place warnings (pictograms) on the product.

Product packaging should also be carefully planned as the manufacturer can be liable for any misuse of the packaging.

The same applies to advertisements about the product.

Where serious risks are later discovered, manufacturers must subsequently warn users about the product risks in an appropriate manner.

In any case, manufacturers are generally not required to provide warnings when the product is clearly or generally known to be dangerous, such as alcohol, tobacco, and sweets (for the risk of diabetes), unless specific laws require such warnings.

The tendency in the US legal system to provide warnings for everything has so far had little influence on the European liability system.

Time of assessment At present, the decisive point in time for the evaluation of whether the safety expectations were fulfilled is when the product was placed on the market.

A product placed on the market without defects will not subsequently be defective.

However, new safety standards can establish additional information and recall obligations.

In the future, placing on the market will not be the only decisive time.

The manufacturer will also be liable when they can control the product after it has been placed on the market (e.g., through software updates).

Easing the burden of proof for injured parties Generally, injured parties must prove the defect, the damage, and the causal link.

They will benefit from an easing of the burden of proof: for example, prima facie evidence of the typical course of events, including life experience, will be deemed to be true.

In the future, the burden of proof for injured parties will be further eased.

The necessary causal link between the product defect and the damage will be assumed in favour of the injured party where the damage arose because of an “obvious malfunction of the product under normal conditions of use.”

In addition, companies will be forced to provide the injured party with copies of any evidence (e.g., construction documents, documented findings from product monitoring) the company has in their possession which the other party needs to establish their claim.

If the manufacturer fails to (completely) comply with this requirement, they could lose a lawsuit because the defective nature of the product will then be assumed under statute.

A “disclosure of documents” inspired by the Anglo-American model, would be an innovation for German civil procedure law.

Exculpatory evidence The manufacturer must prove all circumstances that could exclude their liability."
ADVANT Beiten,Forewarned is forearmed – Dealing with product liability and the increased risks arising from the new EU Product Liability Directive,"Exculpatory evidence The manufacturer must prove all circumstances that could exclude their liability.

The Product Liability Act provides various scenarios in which a manufacturer would not be liable, despite the defect, if they can prove the relevant facts: the manufacturer did not manufacture or distribute the product for sale to make money or within the framework of professional activity.

The manufacturer, importer or quasi-manufacturer did not willingly put the product into circulation; instead, an unauthorised third party did so.

The product is only defective because of an unforeseen change to the established state-of-the-art technology after the product was placed on the market.

The defect was not yet recognisable, despite the state-of-the-art science and technology when the product was put in circulation.

The product is only defective because it was produced in accordance with mandatory legal requirements.

If a supplier supplied a defective component and the defect only occurred during the production of the end product, the supplier of the component part shall not be liable for the damage.

These already very narrow exclusions of liability will be even narrower in the future.

For example, the fact a defect is not recognisable when the product is placed in circulation will no longer exclude manufacturer liability if a software or security update could have remedied the defect.

The tech industry will not be the only industry that will have to consider whether it can afford to cease security updates for older products after just a few years.

Extent of liability and insurance The damages companies must pay in product liability cases can quickly run to several tens of millions of euros.

If a product causes injury to numerous individuals, the maximum total amount of damages is EUR 85 million.

There is no maximum limit for property damage, but the injured party must pay up to EUR 500 in excess.

Under the new EU directive, national legislators may no longer establish maximum limits for damages or self-participation for injured parties.

The obligation to indemnify cannot be contractually excluded or limited in advance.

A waiver or limitation of the obligation to indemnify can only be agreed upon with the injured party after the damage has occurred.

Claims under the Product Liability Act become time-barred three years after the injured party should have become aware of the damage, the defect in the product, and the identity of the party liable to pay damages.

The claim expires ten years after the product which caused the damage was put into circulation unless measures that stop the limitation period were introduced.

Overall, despite all precautions, there is still a high long-term risk of claims under product liability law, especially for dangerous products.

Such claims can even threaten the continued existence of the company.

This risk will be even greater in the future.

It is therefore vital your contracts shield you as much as possible from these risks.

In addition, you must closely monitor both production and the products sold and carefully document all control measures.

Even with the best preventative measures in place, it is not always possible to avoid product liability.

Sufficient insurance against this risk is, therefore, essential.

Every company that could be liable should therefore regularly assess whether the insured sum and the subject of its product or business liability insurance correspond to the existing product liability risks.

As soon as you become aware of a possible liability case, you should inform the insurer or the insurance agent and agree on the next steps.

It also makes sense to obtain legal advice at this early stage – insurers will often bear these costs with their approval - as this prevents mistakes which are difficult to rectify or cannot be rectified later.

ADVANT Beiten,Virtual general Meetings of members of an Association,"On 9 February 2023, the German Bundestag adopted a change to association law, making it possible for associations to hold hybrid and virtual meetings of members without needing to amend the by-laws.

Until now, this was only possible when the by-laws specifically allowed virtual meetings to be held or all members had approved the use of virtual meetings in writing.

Background Previously – more specifically: before COVID – meetings of members had to be held in person unless – as was the case for most associations - association by-laws expressly provided the option of holding virtual or hybrid meetings, or all members explicitly approved this option.

In early 2020, with the COVID pandemic in full swing, legislators introduced transitional statutory rules to facilitate virtual shareholder, AGM and member meetings for stock corporations and associations.

Associations and stock corporations widely used these possibilities.

The virtual formats were well received and made it possible to reach members who lived further away.

The COVID transitional rules expired on 31 August 2022.

Legislators adopted permanent statutory rules for virtual shareholder and general meetings of the limited liability company (GmbH) and stock corporations (AG) before then; the relevant provisions of association law remained unchanged.

It wasn’t until 9 February 2023 that a draft bill was adopted, introducing a new second subsection in § 32 of the German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB ) and making it possible to hold virtual or hybrid meetings of members.

[UPDATE: The amendments entered into force on 22 March 2023, the day after the publication of the law in the Federal Gazette ( Bundesgesetzblatt ) (BGBl.

I 2023, 72 on 21 March 2023).

]

Content of the new rule The new rule allows members to use electronic forms of communication to participate in meetings and exercise their rights as members without having to be present in person at the meeting place (hybrid meetings).

Under the law, associations can now hold in-person meetings of members, where some members are present virtually.

It is no longer essential for all members to be physically present to exercise their rights.

If a hybrid general meeting is called, members can decide whether to be present in person or attend virtually.

In addition, the new rule makes it possible to hold purely virtual general meetings.

In this case, members attend via electronic communication.

For both purely virtual and hybrid meetings, the term electronic communication means audio and video transmissions as part of a video conference, as well as electronic forms of communication such as telephone, chat, and voting by email.

Legislators leave it to the association board to choose which electronic communication form is best for the association.

Requirements and modalities of calling a meeting The association chairperson can call a hybrid meeting of members at any time without further involvement of members in the decision to hold the meeting.

In contrast, the members must either resolve to hold the meeting only virtually or empower the board, by resolution, to call virtual meetings of members.

The members can adopt a resolution by a simple majority within a general meeting, although only subsequent meetings may be held virtually.

Alternatively, outside of the general meeting, the members can adopt a resolution on calling a virtual meeting or empowering the board to call virtual meetings using the written consent procedure providing the members unanimously approve the resolution.

Once the power to call virtual meetings has been conferred on the board, it can hold all future general meetings in this form until members revoke the power by resolution.

When calling a hybrid or virtual general meeting, the board must inform members how to exercise their rights."
ADVANT Beiten,Virtual general Meetings of members of an Association,"When calling a hybrid or virtual general meeting, the board must inform members how to exercise their rights.

The notice must provide sufficiently precise information about the form of electronic communication and technical means required to attend and participate in the meeting.

This should ensure that all members have enough time to prepare (technically) to participate in the meeting.

Summary The new rule is welcome.

It promotes the increased digitalisation of society and gives associations more flexibility when organising general meetings of members.

Limited liability companies and stock corporations have embraced the option of holding hybrid and especially virtual general meetings and meetings of shareholders; many associations are likely to adopt these formats, too.

The board’s discretion in selecting the form of electronic communication allows each association to decide which communication platform best befits the association.

Finally, it makes sense that the legislator distinguishes between hybrid and virtual general meetings and who can call them.

While hybrid general meetings simply expand member participation options, purely virtual meetings can be restrictive for members who do not have the necessary technical equipment to participate.

It is therefore only right that these options are made available to members in principle.

Even with the new rule, associations are free to adopt arrangements in the by-laws making hybrid and virtual general meetings generally admissible or to exclude the use of these forms.

ADVANT Beiten,Notification obligations under foreign trade law – the risks and stumbling blocks for M&A transactions,"Notification obligations for foreign transactions often fly under the radar in corporate transactions.

However, this issue must become a priority as (intentional or negligent) breaches of the rules are administrative offences and may result in significant fines.

The legal due diligence assessment carried out as part of an M&A transaction provides a careful assessment of the legal risks associated with the target and is an indispensable element of every transaction.

Often, little or no attention is paid to the notification requirements for foreign trade transactions under the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung, AWV).

This article provides an overview of the reporting obligations to make you more aware of this issue and the consequences of failure to comply.

Failure to comply with the reporting obligations is an administrative offence Any due diligence assessment should examine the notification obligations because the intentional or negligent infringement of these reporting obligations constitutes an administrative offence under § 19 (3) No. 1b of the Foreign Trade and Payment Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz, AWG), in combination with § 81 (2) No. 19 of the AWV and can result in fines of up to EUR 30,000.00 for each infringement.

As a legal person acts through its representative body, the responsibility for carrying out the notification lies with the board of directors.

Directors, (including former directors), therefore commit any infringements of the reporting obligations.

Accordingly, directors can be personally liable.

A continued, undetected breach would affect any new directors appointed after a transaction.

In addition, legal persons can also be fined under § 30 of the Act on Regulatory Offences (Gesetz über Ordnungswidrigkeiten, OWiG).

Reporting obligations The Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance establishes various notification obligations for foreign trade transactions, particularly in relation to capital movements and payments.

These obligations apply to domestic natural or legal persons.

For legal persons, this will depend on the location of the company’s head office, as stated in its articles of association.

Generally, the reporting obligations can coexist and exist independently.

The following notification requirements for capital movements and payments should be highlighted: Under § 64 (1) of the AWV, natural and legal persons located in Germany must notify the status (e.g., shareholding and voting rights) and selected information about the asset structure (e.g., assets and liabilities) of companies located abroad when that natural or legal person holds 10% of the shares or voting rights directly in a foreign company or 50% of the shares or voting rights indirectly in a foreign company through an independent foreign company (so-called K3 notification).

In addition, permanent establishments and allocated assets of foreign subsidiaries are also subject to the notification requirements.

The notification requirements under § 64 (1) of the AWV apply inversely to the assets of foreign natural and legal persons in Germany pursuant to § 65 (1) of the AWV (so-called K4 notification).

The obligation also applies to the domestic company and not the foreign company.

Under § 66 (1) of the AWV, those subject to the notification requirements must notify the assets and liabilities of foreign persons to the German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) each month where these assets or liabilities total more than EUR 5 million at the end of a month (so-called Z5 and Z5a notifications).

Under § 67 (1) of the AWV, those subject to the notification requirements must notify the German Federal Bank of any payments received from foreigners or residents for the account of a foreigner (incoming payments) or payments made to a foreigner or a resident for the account of a foreigner (outgoing payments) (so-called Z4 notification)."
ADVANT Beiten,Notification obligations under foreign trade law – the risks and stumbling blocks for M&A transactions,"Possible actions in the case of infringement and how to observe the requirements in due diligence assessments and M&A transactions Foreign trade law provides the possibility to make a voluntary declaration about an infringement of the notification requirements (leniency application) and receive immunity (§ 22 (4) of the AWG).

According to this provision, a negligent breach of the reporting obligations will not be prosecuted as a regulatory offence (not for intentional breaches), where the violation is uncovered by in-house controls and notified to the relevant authority, and appropriate measures have been taken to prevent the same type of breach reoccurring.

If all conditions for a leniency application are fulfilled, the administrative offence won’t be prosecuted.

The purchaser might also uncover the offence during the due diligence process.

The (potential) buyer should ask about compliance with these notification requirements.

If an infringement is uncovered, future infringements should be prevented.

For past infringements, we recommend alerting the vendor and discussing the possibility of a leniency application, which could be developed jointly.

Compliance with the notification obligations or - in the case of an existing infringement – the need to bear the consequences and make a leniency application should be taken into account when agreeing on the purchase price, in the catalogue of guarantees, and in the release rules.

Summary The notification obligations under foreign trade law are hidden risks that should be given greater attention in M&A transactions in the future.

Nobody wants to take on liability for an administrative offence with significant fines when they acquire a company.

Consequently, every due diligence assessment should at least consider the obligations to notify the German Federal Bank, and the sale and purchase agreement should reflect compliance with these obligations.

ADVANT Beiten,Implementing the Mobility Directive,"Introduction The German Act Implementing the Mobility Directive (EU) 2019/2121 was originally supposed to enter into force in January 2023, after the Federal Cabinet agreed on the draft bill on 6 July 2022.

However, the Bundestag only adopted the draft bill on 20 January 2023.

The Act entered into force on 1 March 2023, with a few minor exceptions.

The rules on cross-border conversions are now found in a new sixth volume of the Recast Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ).

The rules on cross-border mergers – previously found in §§ 122a et seq. of the Act – are now also regulated in the sixth volume of the Recast Act.

In addition to cross-border mergers (§§ 305 et seq. of the Recast Transformation Act), the sixth volume contains rules on cross-border divisions (§§ 320 et seq. of the Recast Act) and cross-border conversions (§§ 333 et seq. of the Recast Act).

The inclusion of cross-border conversions has not generally changed the modular system of the Transformation Act; there is still a basic reference to mergers except where a specific differing or supplementary rule applies for a different form of transformation.

The internal structure of the new sixth volume follows the familiar order, looking first at mergers, then divisions and lastly conversions.

Certain core elements can be summed up as follows: in the case of mergers, divisions and conversions, shareholders have a right to withdraw from the legal entity in return for cash compensation; § 313 of the Recast Act (for mergers) provides the obligation to make an offer to acquire shares in return for appropriate cash compensation.

In the case of mergers and divisions, the Recast Act provides a right to an improvement of the ratio of exchange.

The right to challenge the valuation is excluded for all three types of cross-border transformation.

Instead, any challenge to the valuation should be enforced in legal proceedings (see the changes to § 1 No. 4 of the Act on Shareholder Actions under Company Law (Revised version of the SpruchG)).

1

In the following, we briefly explain a few of the central aspects of the Act to Implement the Mobility Directive (UmRUG).

Divisions Divisions for the purpose of absorption Generally, the EU directive only deals with cross-border divisions for the purposes of founding a new company.

The new German legislation goes beyond this.

The Act Implementing the Mobility Directive also deals with divisions for the purposes of absorption.

In the latter case, the assets are not transferred to a company formed through the division, but to an already existing legal entity, but this is restricted: under the first sentence of § 332

No 1 of the Recast Act, in the case of the division of a domestic company, there must be fewer than 400 employees on average; this applies to both the transferring and receiving companies.

This establishes a threshold of 80% of the threshold in the One-Third Participation Act ( Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz, DrittelbG ).

Under § 320 first sentence, No. 2 of the Recast Act, in the case of absorption by a domestic company, fewer than four-fifths of the number of employees decisive for participation under the law of the State to which the transferring company is subject must be employed on average.

The Act goes further than the Directive and provides rules for divisions for the purposes of absorption.

The success of these instruments will depend on the extent to which the other Member States also allow cross-border divisions for absorption.

As the law already provides for domestic divisions, division for the purposes of absorption offers a high degree of flexibility because there is no need to establish a new legal entity and the assets can instead be transferred directly to a legal entity that already has an operative business.

There is no - undesired – new legal entity.

The former possibility to transfer assets Until now, shares in a company could be sold to a purchaser by way of a share deal."
ADVANT Beiten,Implementing the Mobility Directive,"There is no - undesired – new legal entity.

The former possibility to transfer assets Until now, shares in a company could be sold to a purchaser by way of a share deal.

Certain business units could also be transferred by way of an asset deal.

Finally, there was also the option of transferring a company through cross-border universal succession, by way of the so-called accrual model 2 involving a partnership, typically a limited partnership in the form of a GmbH & Co KG (“KG”).

Universal succession involves either the transfer of all shares in the KG to a (foreign) company or the acquisition of all the shares in the KG by that company and the withdrawal of all other shareholders from the (target) company.

Transactions may still have one of these structures.

The Recast Act introduces the possibility, not previously foreseen or not explicitly foreseen under the Transformation Act, to transfer all assets by way of a partial universal succession.

The advantage of this model compared to the accrual model, is that a partnership is not required.

The advantage over the asset deal is obvious.

Even if the assets to be transferred must be designated with sufficient precision for both asset deals and divisions, 3 in the case of divisions, the assets will transfer without needing to list and transfer them all separately.

This applies to liabilities and contractual relationships, which – subject to subsequent extraordinary rights to terminate in change-of-control rules – can be transferred with more legal certainty by way of partial universal succession under § 131 of the Transformation Act.

Conversion The Recast Act provides a clear legal basis for cross-border conversions.

It also eliminates uncertainties based on the lack of legal foundation.

4 Improvement of the exchange ratio Generally, in the case of a merger, shares are granted in the acquired stock company.

Where the exchange ratio for the shares is too low, according to § 15 (1) of the Transformation Act, the acquiring legal entity can be required to provide an additional cash payment as compensation.

Sections 72a and 72b of the Recast Act supplement this rule.

These provisions provide liquidity protection for both cross-border and German domestic conversions and, in the case of stock companies, allow shares to be granted in lieu of an additional cash payment to improve the exchange ratio (§ 72a of the Recast Act).

According to § 72b of the Recast Act, additional shares granted under § 72a can be created through a capital increase against contribution in kind.

The purpose of the contribution in kind is to satisfy the claim of shareholders to additional shares, established by court judgment or settlement under the Act on Legal Challenges under Corporate Law ( Spruchverfahrensgesetz ).

The advantage of this procedure is that liquidity must be preserved when creating additional shares –through an increase in capital - in the acquiring company; payment in cash is otherwise foreseen under § 15 of the Transformation Act.

This option applies in principle to divisions, too.

Protection of creditors The Recast Act increases protection for creditors – besides secondary liability, for example - compared to the protection provided both during earlier national conversions in Germany and cross-border mergers under §§ 122a of the Transformation Act.

Upon request, the transferring company must provide creditors with security before the cross-border merger can be registered.

Under § 122j of the previous Transformation Act, security had to be provided for cross-border mergers under § 232 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

If the creditor generally has the right to security under § 122j, it must be provided in accordance with § 232 of the Civil Code, 5 i.e., through a pledge or bond."
ADVANT Beiten,Implementing the Mobility Directive,"If the creditor generally has the right to security under § 122j, it must be provided in accordance with § 232 of the Civil Code, 5 i.e., through a pledge or bond.

When making a notification to the commercial register, the representative body of the transferring legal entity must ensure no securities have been enforced before the courts (see § 315 (3) No. 2 of the Recast Act) within three months of the announcement of the plan in accordance with § 314 (3) of the Recast Act.

Creditors can block the registration where they have brought a claim for appropriate security.

Role of registry courts The Act implementing the Mobility Directive registry gives courts a key role in cross-border conversions.

They must do more than just assess whether the company was set up for abusive or fraudulent purposes (see section 7 below).

Under § 316 (1) of the Transformation Act – using a merger as an example – the court will examine within three months of the application for registration, whether the transferring company fulfils the requirements for the cross-border merger.

Registration includes the determination that all relevant conditions have been fulfilled, and all necessary procedures and formalities have been performed.

Registration will carry an annotation indicating the cross-border merger will be effective subject to the conditions set out in the law of the Member State where the acquiring or new company is based.

The court will issue a merger certificate ex officio for the registration.

Registration may not occur before the expiry of the three-month time limit for the assertion of claims for security.

In Germany, under previous practice, the court normally decided much quicker.

The judicial authority to conduct a review could even lead to an extension of the procedure depending on the specifics of the case.

Assessment of whether there are any abusive or fraudulent purposes Based on the EU Directive, the Recast Act introduces a so-called assessment of abuse for cross-border conversions for the first time.

The court scrutinises whether there is any indication the cross-border conversion has (1) abusive or fraudulent purposes leading to or aimed at the evasion or circumvention of EU or national law, or (2) criminal purposes.

If this scrutiny reveals such purposes, the register court will reject the registration (see §§ 316 (2), 329 first sentence and 343 (3) of the Recast Act).

Examples of indications of such abuse were introduced at short notice during the legislative procedure.

These include when (1) the parties only commence a necessary negotiating procedure in relation to employee participation when prompted by the court; (2) the number of employees clearly amounts to at least four-fifths of the threshold decisive for employee participation in the company, no added value is created in the target country, and the administrative offices remain in Germany; or (3) a foreign company will become the debtor for occupational pensions or entitlements through the cross-border merger and the company does not have any other operative business (§ 316 (3) No. 1-3 of the Recast Act).

Whether the impact of this additional scrutiny will be significant in practice remains to be seen.

It should be noted that other legal provisions also apply, such as those to protect workers’ rights (new provisions or amended provisions; the Act on Co-determination Rights of Workers in the Case of Cross-border Conversions and Divisions ( MgFSG ), and the Act on the Co-determination Rights of Workers in the Case of Cross-border Mergers ( MgVG ).

It remains to be seen whether there is room for more extensive scrutiny of possible abuse or fraud and where it should be performed in the procedure.

Practical questions on the procedure for cross-border conversions A purely German legal view will be insufficient in some cases.

Instead, the corresponding provisions of the (EU) foreign law must also be considered."
ADVANT Beiten,Implementing the Mobility Directive,"Instead, the corresponding provisions of the (EU) foreign law must also be considered.

Fortunately, cross-border mergers were an opportunity to become familiar with this in practice.

Nevertheless, a need for clarity and coordination between the parties – such as the notary and the foreign commercial register – can still be expected in the early days.

This should be kept in mind when planning the timing of any measures.

Review and outlook One cannot help but think that the procedure will be more expensive and complex.

Still, with the exception of the cross-border merger, which was already codified, cross-border conversions are now regulated by law for the first time and will have greater legal certainty.

This must be recognised.

In practice, some measures may now be possible for the first time, not necessarily in a legal sense, but in effect.

With the Act Implementing the Mobility Directive expanding the scope of options to other legal instruments, cross-border conversions offer new opportunities without devaluating the previous tools, which will undoubtedly still have their use.

This is particularly true for the transfer of business units or departments to another Member State.

Practice will show if the assessment of whether there is an abusive or fraudulent purpose will become a challenge or hurdle, and whether it will effectively prevent parties seeking to “dishonestly” move assets across borders, or whether the procedural requirements will be too complex.

However, as there is a practical need for cross-border conversions, the new instruments are likely to be used in practice despite the expected hurdles.

ADVANT Beiten,Recent Developments in the Act on the Modernisation of Partnership Law,"The legislative procedure for the modernisation of partnership law is over.

The “Act on the Modernisation of Partnership Law” ( Gesetz zur Modernisierung des Personengesellschaftsrechts , in short: MoPeG ) introduces numerous key changes for all types of partnerships.

Of note are the register for partnerships governed by civil law and new rules on contesting shareholder resolutions.

The law will enter into force on 1 January 2024.

Overview of the planned changes Basic difference between internal and external partnerships under civil law The distinction introduced by the MoPeG into § 705 (2) of the Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch ) between the legal capacity to make agreements with third parties on the one hand (external partnership) and the lack of legal personality of the partnership for internal agreements on the other (internal partnership) is a key element of the new law on partnerships under civil law ( Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts (GbR)).

This distinction follows the relevant case law of the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) and should be welcomed.

Under § 705 (2) alternative 1 BGB-MoPeG, there will be an external partnership when the shareholders have expressed a common intention for the partnership to engage in business transactions.

Under this provision, the partnership can have rights and obligations, and it can also hold assets under § 713 BGB-MoPeG. External partnerships include professional partnerships, small traders, or other companies active in business, such as real estate companies.

Under § 719 (1) BGB-MoPeG, such a partnership will exist vis-à-vis third parties as soon as it takes part in legal business with the approval of all shareholders, but at the latest with its entry in the newly created register (see below).

Under § 705 (2) alternative 2 of the BGB-MoPeG, an internal partnership only serves to establish the legal relationships of the shareholders to one another.

Sections 740 to 740c of the BGB-MoPeG apply some standards for external partnerships to internal ones.

However, internal partnerships do not have any legal capacity or, in accordance with § 740 (1) of the BGB-MoPeG, hold corporate assets.

Internal partnerships, therefore, can still be used to establish rules for voting trust agreements and pooling arrangements, sub-participations in shareholdings, and similar relationships, which only affect the rights and obligations between the shareholders.

However, internal partnerships do not appear in legal transactions with third parties, i.e., with those who are not shareholders, as external partnerships or at least pseudo-external partnerships otherwise apply and, accordingly, shareholders are personally liable.

Distinction between the external and internal partnership Sections 705 et seq. of the BGB-MoPeG are based on the assumption that the basic legal type of partnership will be an external partnership with legal capacity.

In line with the statutory presumption under § 705 (3) of the BGB-MoPeG, the partnership will be presumed to have the ability to participate in legal transactions (and thus an external partnership) when its business purpose is the operation of a company under a joint name.

The courts would otherwise have to interpret the common will of the shareholders in each case.

In the future, the issue of the distinction between internal and external partnerships is likely to increase.

A clearly defined corporate purpose can provide a remedy.

Introduction of the partnership register External partnerships can register in the newly established partnership register under § 707 (1) of the BGB-MoPeG. Following § 707 (2) of the BGB-MoPeG, the register records the name, headquarters, and address of the partnership, as well as the names, and residence or headquarters of the shareholders, and their powers of representation."
ADVANT Beiten,Recent Developments in the Act on the Modernisation of Partnership Law,"Following registration, partnerships must add the suffix “ eingetragene Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts ” (Registered Partnership under Civil Law) or “ eGbR ” to their name in accordance with § 707a (2) of the BGB-MoPeG. Upon entry in the register, the good faith protection of § 15 of the Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB ) applies following § 707a (3) of the BGB-MoPeG. Third parties can rely on the validity of the register.

Publication in the register provides a sound basis for legal relations and creditors with information about the shareholders that are personally liable for the partnership.

The draft bill provides in § 707c the possibility to change from the partnership register to the commercial register when a partnership (GbR) changes its form to another form of partnership or company.

This affects small, registered enterprises (GdR) transforming into a general commercial partnership ( offene Handelsgesellschaft, OHG ), as well as those with activities exceeding the thresholds for not requiring a commercially organised business operation under § 1 (2) of the HGB.

Conversely, small commercial partnerships registered in the commercial register until now can change their status to the GbR in accordance with §§ 106 and 107 of the HGB-MoPeG. In principle, registration of the external partnership in the partnership register is not necessary for legal capacity.

However, § 47 (2) of the GBO-MoPeG (Land Register Regulation), for example, provides that a partnership may only be entered in the land register if it is registered in the partnership register.

In the case of the acquisition or change of rights to property or equivalent rights, therefore, a GbR must be registered in the partnership register before the acquisition or change can be entered in the land register.

Immediately after the entry into force of the MoPeG, all further legal changes to rights entered in a register will require the prior registration of the partnership concerned in the partnership register.

As a result, most external partnerships in Germany will have to register in the partnership register, despite the voluntary nature of registration, in order to exercise these rights.

They otherwise risk significant delays in conducting legally binding transactions in relation to the registered rights.

This affects all transactions involving property and equivalent rights (transfer of ownership, priority notices, mortgages, and loans), shares the partnership holds in other listed companies (GmbH, OHG, KG and other eGbR), and intellectual property rights (trademarks, patents).

In practice, therefore, all GbR, which are recorded in registers or wish to have rights recorded or changed in a register in the future should register in the partnership register shortly after the Act enters into force.

Failure to do so will result in delays to registration in the land registry and other registries because the partnership must be in the partnership register first.

Significant changes to the internal arrangements of the GbR, OHG and KG

The draft bill introduces a range of changes to the relationship between shareholders of the GbR, OHG, and KG.

Until now, voting rights and the share of profit and loss were based on capital distribution unless otherwise specified.

In practice, these rules were often waived in the partnership agreement.

Now, under § 709 (3) of the BGB-MoPeG, a partner’s voting rights and share in profit and loss will primarily follow the participation agreement or, alternatively, the agreed values of contributions.

This applies to the GbR and, through the references in §§ 105 (3) and 161 (2) of the HGB, to the OHG and KG, too."
ADVANT Beiten,Recent Developments in the Act on the Modernisation of Partnership Law,"This applies to the GbR and, through the references in §§ 105 (3) and 161 (2) of the HGB, to the OHG and KG, too.

If the partners have not established specific rules for voting rights and the distribution of profit and loss, they shall have equal voting rights and equal shares pursuant to the second sentence of § 709 (3) of the BGB-MoPeG. The agreed participation ratio shows the value of the economic participation of the partners in the partnership assets; in practice, this is often referred to as the share of capital.

For the first time, the law provides for fixed capital shares for all partnerships in the case of doubt, as is common in practice.

Existing partnerships should carefully assess whether their partnership agreement establishes an ownership structure or an agreed value of participation.

There is otherwise a risk of legal uncertainty when calculating voting rights and the share of profit and loss.

Representation in the consolidated limited partnership The draft bill contains special provisions for the popular consolidated limited partnership ( Einheits GmbH & Co. KG ), i.e., a limited partnership, where the only personally liable shareholder is a limited liability company (GmbH), in which the partnership holds all shares (consolidated limited partnership).

In accordance with § 170 (2) of the HGB-MoPeG, all rights in the general meeting of shareholders of the GmbH are administered by the limited partners, unless rules established in the articles of association deviate.

Until now, according to the case law of the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH), the management of the GmbH exercises these rights.

Consolidated limited partnerships should therefore consider whether to amend their partnership agreement.

Law applicable to defective resolutions of the OHG and KG Until now, any defects in resolutions of partnerships would result in the resolution being declared null and void.

If a partner sought to have a resolution declared null and void, under the previous law, they had to bring a declaratory action against their partner(s).

This issue has been substantially changed.

However, in contrast to the original plan, it has not been changed for all forms of partnership, just for the OHG and KG: §§ 110 to 115 of the HGB-MoPeG contain new provisions on defective OHG and KG resolutions, based on the law applicable to limited liability companies (GmbH) and stock corporations (AG).

In the case of serious defects, a resolution will exceptionally be null and void in accordance with § 110 (2) of the HGB-MoPeG. Defective resolutions otherwise apply but are voidable.

Under § 113 (1) and (2) of the HGB-MoPeG, an action for annulment must be brought against the partnership within three months of publication of the resolution in accordance with § 112 (1) and (2) of the HGB-MoPeG. The court’s declaration that the resolution is null and void applies automatically to all partners pursuant to § 113 (6) of the HGB-MoPeG. Section 108 HGB-MoPeG allows partners to adopt differing rules.

Existing commercial partnerships should therefore examine whether their current rules make sense in light of the new law.

Dr Barbara Mayer Daniel Rombach"
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"Originally, this Article was published in German language on 8 February as part of issue 2023/1-2 of the renown German M&A Magazine M&A Review ( Link ).

1. Introduction The market for distressed transactions is expected to grow in 2023 but will also become more difficult.

This makes it all the more important to deal with the specific legal aspects of acquiring a company in times of crisis or insolvency at an early stage.

2.

A look back at 2022 and ahead to 2023 The year 2022 will probably go down in history as the year of accumulated disasters.

Rarely have crises developed in such a concentrated form and from all sides.

While the global economy was still battling with the aftermath of the COVID 19 pandemic and another wave is currently emerging from China, Russia's attack on Ukraine not only shook the existing peace, but also caused economic turmoil through massive energy price hikes and aggravating supply chain problems.

The full dimensions are hardly foreseeable yet.

The high inflation rates, which were not believed to be possible, and the constantly rising interest rates are adding to the problems.

The crises had little impact on insolvencies until around mid-2022.

While the number of opened insolvency proceedings actually fell slightly by 0.4% between January and September 2022 as compared with the same period of the previous year, the number rose by 18.4% between September 2022 and October 2022 and slightly by 1.2% in November 2022 1 .

However, insolvency petitions are regularly filed some three months before proceedings are opened.

Hence, the increase in the October figures is due to applications filed in July/August 2022.

The number of insolvencies is expected to continue to rise in 2023.

As a result of the considerable rise in interest rates, business models involving strong debt financing are being put to the test, especially when it comes to follow-up financing.

If insolvency follows, the circle of potential investors narrows if they finance the acquisition − as is often the case − with a substantial share of borrowed capital.

For insolvency administrators, this means that they will have to make it clearer in future investment processes where the business opportunities are in the debtor's business operations.

This will probably lead to insolvency administrators thinking more often about the sale of parts of the business.

The business skills of the insolvency administrator are therefore coming into sharper focus.

This also increases the importance of specialised advisory firms dealing intensively with the further development of the debtor's business model in order to proactively address investors.

In addition, the number of companies that will not find an investor while insolvent is expected to increase.

This is because it has already become apparent in 2021 and 2022 that, due to the partial suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency as part of the COVID legislation, the statistics only showed a small number of cases.

Nonetheless, many enterprises were materially insolvent and proceedings that were opened suffered from a significant lack of assets.

This trend will become even more evident in 2023.

Still, in 2023 there will again be numerous opportunities to acquire companies in crisis or insolvency.

For this reason, the following is an overview of the legal particularities of the purchase from special situations.

3. Special legal features of distressed acquisitions If a potential target is in crisis, selling the company is often a strategic option to ensure its economic survival.

Prospective buyers are then facing the question of the right time to buy and of the best acquisition structure.

The strategic considerations start with the potential acquirer but can only be completed together with the target and, where necessary, the insolvency administrator.

3.1 Tactical considerations regarding the timing of the acquisition 1."
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"3.1 Tactical considerations regarding the timing of the acquisition 1.

Acquisition in a crisis Basically, the acquisition of a company that is in crisis or has already filed for insolvency is a normal M&A transaction that can be carried out as a share deal or an asset deal.

2. Acquisition of a company in a crisis by a share deal In a share deal, the buyer acquires the shares in the target company.

The legal entity and, as a rule, the legal form of the target company remains the same.

The acquirer takes over the target with all assets and, above all, all liabilities, including all tax obligations.

If the target company is already insolvent (section 17 (2) InsO (German Insolvency Code) or over-indebted (section 19 (2) InsO) at the time of the acquisition, the management remains obliged to file for insolvency unless it has already done so 2 .

The acquirer must therefore provide the target company with the necessary financial resources immediately after the takeover to survive any factual insolvency that may have occurred.

If the target company is only threatened with insolvency, the company is not obliged to file for insolvency, but has a right to do so.

Nevertheless, the acquirer must ensure that the target is adequately financed.

Whether an acquisition of the target in times of a financial crisis by means of a share deal makes sense can generally only be assessed through a careful legal, financial and tax due diligence examination.

If the crisis of the target company has already progressed to the point that a petition for insolvency must be filed or will have to be filed in the near future, there is often not enough time for an in-depth examination.

If the company is insolvent, the petition must be filed within three weeks and within six weeks if the company is over-indebted (section 15a (1) InsO).

Another question is whether the personnel required for the due diligence process is (still) available at the target.

Unless the target company is being assisted by professional restructuring advisors, there is often a lack of clarity about the actual extent of the crisis and the real need for financing.

Therefore, an acquisition by way of a share deal in a crisis is generally considered only if the acquirer ensures the full financing of the target company immediately after the takeover on a scale that removes any doubt as to the non-existence of any grounds for insolvency.

3. Acquisition of a company in a crisis by an asset deal If the acquirer does not want to take over the company in crisis with all its liabilities, the alternative is the asset deal structure.

In an asset deal, the acquirer buys the assets of the target company – usually through a separate acquisition company – and takes over the existing contractual relationships, provided each contractual partner agrees to the transfer.

This normally results in a transfer of the business pursuant to section 613a BGB (German Civil Code).

All existing employment relationships are transferred to the acquirer by operation of law if the employee concerned does not object.

The seller in crisis is therefore left with the purchase price, any assets not sold, and any contracts not taken over.

The seller also keeps those employment relationships whose transfer is objected to by the individual employee.

Finally, all of the seller's liabilities will remain with the seller.

If these cannot be settled in full from the purchase price, the seller may have to file for insolvency due to insolvency and/or over-indebtedness.

If insolvency proceedings are opened against the assets of the seller before the purchase agreement has been consummated, the insolvency administrator may choose not to perform the purchase agreement in accordance with section 103 (2) InsO.

In this case, any repayment claims or claims for damages of the acquirer are mere insolvency claims on which the quota is paid."
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"In this case, any repayment claims or claims for damages of the acquirer are mere insolvency claims on which the quota is paid.

If the purchase agreement has already been executed when insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the seller, the acquirer runs the risk of the company purchase agreement being contested due to insolvency or of the assets being transferred by the insolvency administrator of the seller.

The closer the seller was to being declared insolvent at the time of the sale to the acquirer, the greater the risk of contestation for the acquirer.

The particular grounds for contesta-tion reach back to a period of up to three months prior to the filing for insolvency (sections 130, 131 InsO).

However, this period may be extended – especially with regard to the acquirer's knowledge of the crisis and the motives of the seller – up to four, and even up to ten years in the most extreme cases (section 133 InsO).

The consequence of the contestation is that the acquirer must return the acquired assets and the transferred contracts to the insolvency estate.

In return, the acquirer has a claim against the insolvency estate for repayment of the purchase price.

This claim, however, is only a simple insolvency claim (section 38 InsO).

This claim will be satisfied with the insolvency quota in the final distribution in the insolvency proceedings.

Even if, in a specific case, an insolvency administrator may not be interested in actually bringing the company back to the insolvency estate by way of an insolvency contestation, the actual risk of contestation is enough to jeopardise the continuation of the target company.

Regardless of the risk of contestation, there are undesirable liability implications for the acquirer.

According to section 25 (1) HGB (German Commercial Code), the acquirer is responsible for all liabilities of the former owner arising from the operation of the business if he takes over the company name, i.e., the business name of the seller.

Such liability may be excluded, though.

This requires a registration of the fact in the commercial register.

The acquirer's responsibility for tax liabilities of the seller under section 75 (1) AO (German Tax Code), however, cannot be excluded.

The acquirer is responsible for taxes for which the obligation to pay is based on the operation of the business and for tax deductions, provided that the taxes have accrued since the beginning of the last calendar year preceding the transfer and are assessed or declared within one year of the date of registration of the business by the acquirer.

It is possible for the contracting parties to agree on an indemnity against such responsibility.

If the seller becomes insolvent after the closing, however, the indemnity claim is usually worthless.

Finally, the target company may have contractual relationships that are necessary for its operations, and which can only be transferred with the consent of the relevant contractual partner.

This may, for example, be a rental agreement for a production facility or an important patent.

In such case, completion of the deal will be made conditional on the contractual partner consenting to the transfer of the contract.

If the consent process takes too long, the company's economic situation may deteriorate to such a point that a petition for insolvency will have to be filed and the deal will ultimately fail.

For the acquirer, this may result in the need to provide financial support to the target company in order to avoid a petition for insolvency before the closing.

In this case, the acquirer bears the risk that the deal will nevertheless fail for lack of the third party's consent.

The acquirer can therefore achieve the required certainty of the transaction only to a limited extent, and in some cases even not at all.

4. Acquisition after the opening of insolvency proceedings"
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"The acquirer can therefore achieve the required certainty of the transaction only to a limited extent, and in some cases even not at all.

4. Acquisition after the opening of insolvency proceedings

The risks associated with an acquisition of the company in crisis before the opening of insolvency proceedings can largely be avoided if the acquisition takes place only after the opening of insolvency proceedings.

In normal proceedings, the seller is the insolvency administrator or – if the insolvency proceedings are in self-administration – the debtor company itself or its shareholders (see 3.2.

below).

When regular insolvency proceedings are opened, the debtor's management and transfer rights are transferred to the insolvency administrator (section 80 InsO).

There is no risk of contestation for the acquirer, in particular after the opening of insolvency proceedings.

This is because the provisions on contestation are only applicable to legal acts that were performed before the opening of the insolvency proceedings.

The insolvency administrator cannot later contest his sales transaction with the acquirer.

The same applies if the sale is carried out using an insolvency plan, especially in self-administration proceedings.

An acquirer seeking the greatest possible legal certainty will not purchase the company before the opening of the insolvency proceedings but instead purchase it after the opening of the proceedings.

3.2 Tactical considerations regarding the acquisition structure After the opening of insolvency proceedings, the transfer can take place in various ways.

Which acquisition structure is chosen in a specific case depends, on the one hand, on the type of proceedings chosen by the debtor and, on the other hand, on the acquisition structure preferred by the acquirer.

Basically, asset deal or share deal are again possible.

Often – particularly with larger insolvency proceedings – a structured bidding process is carried out, which is already prepared and, where appropriate, started during the opening proceedings.

The deal structure is usually not yet defined in the initial stage of the bidding process.

This is because the first priority at this point is the economic viability of an acquisition concept.

Once a narrower circle of acquirers has been identified, the focus shifts to the actual structuring of the transaction.

1. Reorganisation by transfer The typical way of buying a company from insolvency is what is known as reorganisation by transfer (übertragende Sanierung), which is done through an asset deal.

The assets are bought from the insolvency administrator.

There are, however, some particularities that distinguish such reorganisation by transfer from an ordinary asset deal where there are no insolvency proceedings.

Schedule The acquisition of an insolvent company often takes place under considerable time pressure.

The opening of insolvency proceedings means that there are natural dissolution tendencies.

Employees, customers, suppliers, and other contractual partners are worried and expect quick and reliable signals with regard to the future of the company.

Therefore, there are usually only a few weeks left for the review and negotiation process before the signing.

The time pressure is intensified by the often tight liquidity situation of the target company.

Due diligence Despite the tight schedule, a due diligence exercise should be conducted.

Such review may leave out company-law aspects because the transaction is an asset deal.

What is necessary, however, is an examination of contractual relationships and employment-law issues.

With regard to contractual relationships, it is important to examine whether the conditions are reasonable enough for the contract in question to be taken over.

The assumption or the new conclusion of contracts required for the operations should be made the subject of closing conditions."
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"The assumption or the new conclusion of contracts required for the operations should be made the subject of closing conditions.

It should also be examined whether the transaction requires a merger control and/or foreign trade law approval.

The tax audit, however, is not the primary focus (more on this below).

Based on our experience, a due diligence process is shorter and more superficial than for common transactions due to the considerable time pressure under which the parties are.

The information on the insolvent target company often has a lower quality or the personnel resources do not allow to provide this information in the desired quality.

Overall, a less clear picture of the target company thus often emerges.

Guarantees Acquisition risks are warded off by guarantees and indemnities in common transactions.

This is usually excluded in case of a reorganisation by transfer.

Insolvency administrators are only very rarely willing to provide guarantees or indemnities.

The personal liability of the insolvency administrator (sections 60 or 61 InsO) is also usually excluded - except for intent.

Risks may only be considered to reduce the purchase price.

Takeover of contracts Contracts, which the acquirer takes over, are limited to the economic closing date of the transfer.

Receivables and payables from the time before the economic closing date of transfer remain with the insolvency estate.

As of the economic closing date, the acquirer shall be responsible and shall fulfil the contract with third parties from that date.

The transfer of contracts to the acquirer requires the consent of the respective contractual partner.

Therefore, it should be clarified - in coordination with the insolvency administrator - with the most important contractual partners already prior to the signing whether the contract with the acquirer can be continued.

Responsibility for old liabilities The responsibility of the acquirer for liabilities shall be excluded until the economic closing date of transfer.

The insolvency administrator shall pay the insolvency quota on old liabilities from the time up to the opening of insolvency proceedings if the contractual partner is not specially secured and, therefore, may assert rights to separation from the estate or rights to separate satisfaction.

Liabilities which the insolvency administrator assumes as of the opening of proceedings, are liabilities of the insolvency estate and have to be fulfilled by the insolvency administrator in the full amount.

The acquirer, however, has nothing to do with this, since the delimitation takes place - as already stated - at the time when the target company is transferred to the acquirer with economic effect.

Even if the acquirer takes over the debtor's company name, a responsibility pursuant to section 25 HGB for the liabilities arising from the operation of the debtor's business is not an option 3 .

Taxes In case of a usual asset deal, the acquirer shall be liable for operating taxes of the target company pursuant to section 75 (1) AO (cf.

above, 3.1(3)).

Section 75 (2) AO explicitly excludes this liability for acquisitions from insolvency.

Transfer of business The transfer of the holding to the acquirer by way of the reorganisation by transfer out of insolvency leads to a transfer of business as in case of the usual asset deal if the preconditions of section 613a BGB are met.

However, the legal consequences are limited.

In fact, the employment relationships will be transferred to the acquirer.

Claims and entitlements to benefits arising from the company pension scheme, however, shall remain, irrespective of whether non-vesting or not, with the insolvency estate 4 , to the extent that they relate to the period up to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Wages in arrears up to the opening of insolvency proceedings neither have to be paid by the acquirer."
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"Wages in arrears up to the opening of insolvency proceedings neither have to be paid by the acquirer.

Insofar as wages are unpaid as of the opening of proceedings, the acquirer, however, shall be liable for this.

If the cause of the insolvency (also) lies in excessively high personnel costs, the acquirer will be interested in a reduction of personnel.

Terminations for operational reasons, however, are inadmissible pursuant to section 613a (4) sentence 1 BGB if they are announced due to the transfer of business.

A termination invalid pursuant to section 613a (4) sentence 1

BGB by the previous employer due to transfer of business, however, is not given if the workplace no longer exists due to a restructuring plan of the acquirer of the business and the implementation of the binding concept or restructuring plan of the acquirer has already taken on a concrete form at the time of the receipt of the notice of termination 5 (so-called acquirer's concept).

The right of termination is also modified by section 125 (1) sentence 1 No. 1

InsO: If an operational change (section 111 BetrVG (German Works Constitution Act)) is planned and if the insolvency administrator and the works council reach an agreement on a reconciliation of interests, in which the employees who should receive notice of termination are listed by name, it is assumed that the termination of the employment relationships of the listed employees is due to urgent operational requirements which impede a continued employment in this company or a continued employment under unchanged working conditions.

Furthermore, pursuant to section 125 (1) sentence 1 No. 2 InsO, the social selection of the employees can be verified only with regard to the length of service with the company, the age, and the maintenance obligations and insofar only for gross incorrect-ness; it shall not be regarded as grossly incorrect if a balanced personnel structure is maintained or created.

2. Acquisition by an insolvency plan In some cases, the acquisition from insolvency by means of a reorganisation by transfer is not possible or subject to excessive risks.

This is, in particular, the case if certain legal relationships are dependent on the insolvent legal entity and a transfer to the acquirer is excluded or problematic.

This might for instance be the case for certain permissions under public law of the insolvency debtor.

One also thinks of the acquisition of a retail company with numerous lease agreements.

Where there are no insolvency proceedings, the acquisition would take place by means of share deals so that it would not result in a change of legal entity.

If the preservation of the legal entity and the legal relationships dependent on it is required, the execution of an insolvency plan procedure comes into consideration under insolvency law.

The insolvency plan can either be submitted - in normal proceedings - by the insolvency administrator or by the debtor company within the framework of self-administration proceedings.

In self-administration proceedings, the debtor itself conducts the proceedings.

A trustee as a supervisor is deployed alongside the debtor who will supervise the correctness of the insolvency administration by the debtor.

The core of an insolvency plan is the debtor's restructuring concept.

The concept usually comprises the operational restructuring of the company as well as its debt reduction by comprehensive debt waivers of the insolvency creditors.

If the insolvency plan is approved by the responsible creditors' meeting and confirmed by the insolvency court, the regulations, in particular the debt waivers of the creditors, enter into force.

The insolvency proceedings are terminated and the (former) insolvency debtor continues its business operations.

Insofar as the creditors have not waived their claims, they will receive corresponding dividends from the insolvency estate."
ADVANT Beiten,Competitive advantages through early preparation for acquisition opportunities in a crisis,"Insofar as the creditors have not waived their claims, they will receive corresponding dividends from the insolvency estate.

In addition to the debt reduction, a change of shareholders can also easily take place by virtue of the regulations in the insolvency plan.

This is because any regulation can be made in the plan which is permissible under corporate law, in particular, the transfer of shareholder or membership rights, section 225a (3) InsO.

The plan may also provide for a capital decrease or increase, the performance of contributions in kind, the exclusion of subscription rights or the payment of severance payments to leaving shareholders, section 225a (2) sentence 3 InsO.

The Insolvency Statute, thus, permits that, by means of the plan, the shares in the debtor are transferred to a third party or a new shareholder is admitted.

It is significant that not the shareholders, but the creditors are responsible for the transfer of shares or the admission of new shareholders.

If a change of shareholders should be executed, not the transfer of shares (real share deal) is usually preferred, but the capital decrease concept in case of corporations.

In case of the capital decrease, the debtor's share capital will first be reduced to zero.

The existing shareholders hereby withdraw from the company.

In the following step, the capital will be increased to the amount requested by the acquirer.

The acquirer as the sole beneficiary will be permitted to subscribe to the new shares.

The subscription rights of the existing shareholders will be excluded.

The new shares are unencumbered and any risks arising from the former shares do not exist for the acquirer.

Usually, the capital increase and the payment of the corresponding contribution are accompanied by a further payment of the acquirer to the insolvency estate.

The payment serves to be able to present an appropriate ""purchase price"" and an appropriate insolvency quota for the creditors, since they may not be placed in a worse position by the insolvency plan than in normal proceedings (cf. section 245 (1) No. 1 InsO).

4.

Summary It can be assumed that the number of insolvency proceedings will continue to increase in the current year.

This could result in interesting opportunities for investors.

A purchase in the crisis prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is only rarely advisable.

A purchase after the opening, however, provides legal certainty.

The arrangement of the deal remains a tailored suit.

In addition to the reorganisation by transfer, every investor should also review the acquisition by means of an insolvency plan.

ADVANT Beiten,Equal pay for men and women: negotiating skills are not an objective differentiation criterion,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 16 February 2023 in Case No. 8 AZR 450/21<

The Federal Labour Court held that – regardless of the skill with which they negotiated their salary – women and men should earn the same salary when they perform the same or equal work.

Facts of the case A female employee had been working as a member of the company sales team since 1 March 2017.

When she started working for the company, her gross basic salary was EUR 3,500.00.

Two male employees worked on the same team.

One of the male employees commenced work for the company on 1 January 2017, almost the same time as the female employee.

The employer initially offered this male employee a gross basic salary of EUR 3,500.00, which he refused.

After negotiations, the employer increased the gross salary offer to the male employee to EUR 4,500.00.

According to the employer, this difference was justified because the male employee was employed to replace a better-paid female sales representative, who had left the company.

The employee claimed payment of salary in arrears amounting to the difference between her salary and the salary paid to her male colleague for the period from March 2017 to July 2019.

The employee argued that she should earn the same basic salary as her male colleague as both performed the same work.

In addition, the employee demanded the payment of appropriate compensation of at least EUR 6,000.000 for the discrimination suffered due to her gender with respect to her salary.

Both the Labour Court and the Regional Labour Court dismissed her claim.

The judgment The employee succeeded in her appeal to the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG).

The BAG affirmed that the employee had been discriminated against due to her gender because the employee had been paid a lower basic salary than her male colleagues, although they performed the same work.

Therefore, in the view of the BAG, the employee had a claim to the same basic salary as her male colleagues under Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), §§ 3(1) and 7 of the Transparency in Wage Structures Act (EntgTranspG).

The fact that the employee was paid a lower basic salary for the same work substantiated the assumption that the discrimination was due to gender.

The BAG further held that the employer’s claims, that the male employees were better negotiators or replaced a better-paid saleswoman who had left the company, could not rebut this assumption.

With respect to the payment of compensation for discrimination based on gender, the BAG awarded the employee EUR 2,000.00.

Consequences for practice The judgment of the BAG targets the elimination of wage disparities due to gender.

The BAG has now decided the question of whether better negotiating skills are an individual characteristic of each employee or whether differentiating based on these skills instead forms the basis for discrimination due to gender.

In the Court’s view, negotiating skills alone are not an appropriate objective criterion to justify a difference in pay between women and men.

In this way, the equal treatment laws limit private autonomy when concluding employment agreements.

These laws aim to close the existing pay gaps between women and men.

According to the BAG, it would be contradictory if employees could agree on higher pay for workers of one gender compared to workers of another gender for the same or equal work, without clear additional objective criteria for the difference.

Practical tip Employers should be prepared for other employees to follow this example and bring claims of discrimination due to gender with respect to salary negotiations.

Employers are therefore advised to avoid claims for wage disparities due to gender by not basing wage differences on the better negotiating skills of a worker in the future.

Salary differences are still permitted, providing any such differences are based on objective, gender-neutral criteria."
ADVANT Beiten,Equal pay for men and women: negotiating skills are not an objective differentiation criterion,"Salary differences are still permitted, providing any such differences are based on objective, gender-neutral criteria.

Where a remuneration system has not yet been established, we recommend that employers establish a system with objective criteria to determine salaries.

Such criteria can, for example, include qualifications obtained, international experience, language proficiencies (if the company would benefit from these languages) or the number of years that the employee has worked for the company.

In any case, good negotiating skills do not belong on this list.

ADVANT Beiten,New sustainability reporting and extended duties of business managers,"The EU is moving forward with its ESG activities and obliges many companies to provide comprehensive sustainability reporting.

This has a direct impact on the duties of board members and managing directors.

The post summarises the most important need-to-knows.

Large capital market-oriented companies, financial institutions and insurance companies with an annual average staff of more than 500 have been obliged to provide non-financial reports since 2017 (s289b(1) HGB (German Commercial Code)).

This is the result of the translation of what is known as the CSR Directive (or Non-Financial Reporting Directive, NFRD for short) into German law.

Companies subject to reporting requirements must, in addition to a brief description of their business model, address non-financial aspects in the non-financial statement (in particular environmental, employee and social issues, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery).

For about as long, discussions have been going on about the extent to which these reporting obligations affect the due diligence obligations of the board of directors or the management of the companies subject to these reporting obligation.

It therefore seems obvious that board members and managing directors must deal with the non-financial aspects in at least such a way that they can properly report on them.

Some argue that the range of actions and duties of business managers is being extended beyond the actual obligation to non-financial reporting.

The prevailing opinion, however, rejects this.

Regardless of any reporting obligations, managers should make business decisions on an adequately informed basis, including sustainability aspects as far as they are relevant for the particular decision.

Extension and clarification of sustainability reporting In the meantime, the EU has revised the non-financial reporting and developed it into a comprehensive sustainability reporting.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) recently came into force at EU level and must now be transposed into national law by the EU member states.

This will lead to a considerable widening of the range of companies subject to reporting requirements throughout the EU.

In Germany alone, some 15,000 companies will be obliged to provide the new sustainability reports in the future, instead of about 500 companies so far.

All in all, more than 50,000 companies will be affected, while the NFRD only covers some 11,700 companies across the EU.

Entities subject to mandatory reporting and commencement of reporting obligations The duty to report on sustainability is to apply to a large number of companies as of the following dates (see Art. 5 CSRD):

Group 1: For financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024, companies that are already required to report non-financial information under the NFRD (see above) will be subject to the reporting obligation.

Group 2: For financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025, all large corporations and parent companies of large groups as defined in ss267, 293 HGB (German Commercial Code) will be subject to mandatory reporting, i.e. companies that exceed two of the following three criteria on two consecutive reporting dates: balance sheet total of EUR20 million , net turnover of EUR40 million, average of 250 employees during the year.

Compared to the NFRD, the previous requirement of capital market orientation is dropped and the number of employees is reduced from 500 to 250.

Group 3: For financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026, capital market-oriented small and medium-sized corporations (with the exception of micro-entities) will be subject to mandatory reporting regardless of the number of employees.

Such SMEs may, however, opt out (having to state the reasons for it) in the first two years, so the reporting obligation will apply here no later than for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2028."
ADVANT Beiten,New sustainability reporting and extended duties of business managers,"Furthermore, small and non-complex banks and company-owned insurance entities will fall into this 3rd group.

Group 4: Finally, for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028, non-EU companies with a net annual turnover within the EU of more than EUR150 million in the last two financial years and a subsidiary within the EU belonging to Group 2 or 3, or a branch within the EU with a net annual turnover of more than EUR40 million, will also be subject to reporting requirements.

Contents of the sustainability reports The above-mentioned companies must include in their management report information that is necessary for understanding the impact of the company's activities on sustainability aspects as well as the impact of sustainability aspects on the company's business performance, business results and situation (""double materiality"").

According to Art. 19a of the Accounting Directive, this information must include the following: (a) a brief description of the company's business model and strategy, including, in particular, the resilience of the company's business model and strategy to risks and the company's opportunities in relation to (i) sustainability issues; (ii) how the company intends to ensure that its business model and strategy are consistent with the transition to a sustainable economy and the limitation of global warming to 1.5°C in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as set out in the European Climate Change Act (including, where applicable, the company's exposure to activities related to coal, oil and gas); and (iii) how the company addresses the concerns of its stakeholders and the impact of its operations on sustainability issues in its business model and strategy; (b) a description of the time-bound sustainability targets that the company has set, including, where applicable, absolute targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for at least 2030 and 2050, a description of the progress the company has made towards achieving those targets; (c) a description of the role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies in relation to sustainability aspects and their expertise in performing that role; (d) a description of the company's policy on sustainability; (e) information on the existence of incentive schemes linked to sustainability aspects offered to members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies; (f) a description of: (i) the due diligence process carried out by the company with regard to sustainability aspects and, where applicable, in accordance with the EU requirements for companies to carry out a due diligence process (cf. CSDDD-E); (ii) the main actual or potential negative impacts associated with the company's own operations and with its value chain; (iii) any measures taken by the company to prevent, mitigate, remedy or terminate actual or potential negative impacts and the success of those measures; (g) a description of the main risks to which the company is exposed in relation to sustainability aspects, including a description of the main interdependencies in this area, and the company's management of these risks; (h) indicators relevant to the disclosures referred to in points (a) to (g).

Sustainability reporting standards While no reporting standard has been specified for non-financial reports according to the NFRD so far and therefore a wide variety of standards were applied, companies will have to comply with technical standards for sustainability reports defined by the EU (European Sustainability Reporting Standards, or ESRS for short) in the future.

In November 2022, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), which was given the task of preparing such standards, submitted the first set of twelve cross-sectoral ESRS to the EU Commission; implementation is expected by 30 June 2023."
ADVANT Beiten,New sustainability reporting and extended duties of business managers,"This first set of draft cross-sectoral ESRS covers the following reporting areas: Cross-sectoral standards: ESRS 1 – General requirements and ESRS 2 – General disclosures.

Subject-specific ESG standards: environmental (ESRS 1 Climate change, ESRS 2 Pollution, ESRS 3 Water and marine resources, ESRS 4 Biodiversity and ecosystems, ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy), social (ESRS S1 Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain, ESRS S3 Affected communities, ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users) and governance (ESRS G1 Business conduct).

The CSRD also provides for the preparation of sector-specific, third-country-specific and SME-specific standards by 30 June 2024.

Taxonomy Regulation Under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, companies that are obliged to report non-financially in accordance with the NFRD must already provide information, independently of the CSRD, on how and to what extent the activities of the company are linked to economic activities that are to be classified as environmentally sustainable economic activities in accordance with Articles 3 and 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation.

In the future, the companies required to report under the CSRD will generally have to disclose such information in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation.

Duties of business managers in connection with sustainability reporting The management of the reporting companies must ensure, within the scope of their compliance obligation, that all legal requirements applying to the company are met.

With a view to non-financial reporting or future sustainability reporting, business managers must therefore take appropriate measures so the company can fulfil its reporting obligations.

This refers in particular to the sometimes challenging task of compiling the information and data required for it.

Furthermore, the description of the future sustainability reporting items is partly interpreted to mean that the CSRD presupposes that the companies − and therefore also their business managers − define actions and targets with regard to certain sustainability issues and make progress in achieving these targets.

This applies in particular to the 'description of the time-bound sustainability targets' (including greenhouse gas emission reductions, if applicable) and 'the progress the company has made towards achieving these targets' as well as the 'way in which the company intends to ensure that its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and the limitation of global warming'.

However, the discussion on the existence and content of any such obligation for action to be derived from the CSRD with regard to the definition and achievement of sustainability goals has only just begun.

Regardless of the further development, there is enough reason for business managers to intensively deal with the sustainability issues relevant to their company and to take them into account when making decisions.

ADVANT Beiten,ESG Due Diligence for Company Acquisitions,"Environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria have become increasingly important in corporate transactions, as they carry considerable liability and reputational risks.

Therefore, identifying ESG-related chances and risks is a must in due diligence.

ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance and relates to the planning and implementation of sustainability goals and responsible corporate governance.

Specific requirements vary, depending on the size of a company, on the industry and the local focus of its activities.

Mostly, these aspects have been considered merely in passing in the legal due diligence before a corporate transaction.

However, in view of the looming risks and the growing relevance for investment and financing decisions, it is preferable to also take ESG-relevant aspects into account.

What is an ESG Due Diligence?

ESG due diligence is not yet a market standard, even though a number of ESG issues are covered by the traditional due diligence, such as environmental damage, compliance, data protection and risks from contractual relationships.

However, the pressure to investigate sustainability aspects of the target company in the run-up to a corporate transaction is increasing: Social pressure is growing just as much as the expectations of customers and employees.

More and more often, ESG issues are the subject of legal proceedings.

ESG considerations are also of growing importance for the financing banks and financial investors.

Insofar as regulatory requirements already exist, for example when it comes to packaging and emission regulations or equal rights mechanisms, in the area of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), the EU taxonomy as well as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), these topics are part of every legal due diligence.

For reputational reasons, many companies ""undertake"" not only to comply with the legal provisions, but also to voluntarily submit to certain rules of the so-called soft law.

These include, for example, internal climate protection due diligence obligations based on the Paris Agreement of 12 December 2015 and taking into account the steady increase in climate protection lawsuits filed by associations and private individuals against companies in civil courts.

In conformity with core labour standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), many companies prohibit labour grievances.

Such declarations based on soft law are not strictly binding on the companies concerned.

Instead, the ""obligation"" is created by the expectations of potential investors or business partners whose disappointment might result in reputational damage and possibly a reduction in the value of the company.

Many CEOs see compliance with ESG criteria as an opportunity to set themselves apart from competitors and to build a corresponding corporate culture.

Subject of an ESG Due Diligence What exactly needs to be investigated in an ESG due diligence largely depends on the risk profile of the target company and on whether the transaction is ESG-driven, i.e., whether it (also) serves to improve the ESG profile of the investor.

Principally, it should be asked to what extent the company is sovereign in terms of environmental, social and governance aspects and whether government sanctions, loss of reputation, further required investment costs or loss of market share should be expected."
ADVANT Beiten,ESG Due Diligence for Company Acquisitions,"In general, it is recommended to look at the following factors: Environmental Environmental management systems Emissions/waste management/hazardous substances Ecosystems Climate change resilience Procurement/use of resources (water, raw materials, energy) Social Product safety/product stewardship Occupational safety and working conditions Diversity Equal opportunities Code of conduct in the supply chain Anti-discrimination policy Governance Risk management systems Structure and remuneration of the board Implementation of ESG in the business strategy, for example when selecting suppliers Cyber security/data protection Anti-corruption policy Reporting standards Advantages of an ESG Due Diligence Sellers preparing for the sale of their company may polish it up with a ""vendor ESG due diligence"" and avoid potential liability due to lack of disclosure or subsequent breaches of warranty.

From the buyer's perspective, ESG due diligence helps to identify risks of compliance violations and reputational damage, to reduce financing costs and - last but not least - to avoid personal liability of the acting management.

Findings from an ESG due diligence will be integrated into the purchase price determination and the list of warranties.

In some cases, exemption clauses will be necessary - for example, if there is a threat of fines or exclusion from public assignments; in other cases, so-called post-closing covenants, i.e., obligations to be fulfilled after the transaction has been completed, may be appropriate.

If a transaction is designed to improve the ESG profile of the buying company, identified risks may also be grounds for walking away from the deal altogether.

Conclusion ESG principles are becoming increasingly relevant at the private sector and institutional level in the context of corporate transactions.

Findings from an ESG due diligence can have a significant impact on the company valuation and the design of an SPA.

In order to adequately consider ESG-related opportunities as well as liability and reputational risks, any due diligence should - also - examine the target company's risk exposure, taking into account relevant ESG issues.

ADVANT Beiten,Is Consumer Protection finally getting teeth? EU Commission targets web stores and shopping apps,"With the statement ""Consumer authorities will finally get teeth to punish the cheaters,"" former Commissioner for Justice, Consumer Protection and Gender Equality, Vera Jourová, announced the redesigned framework in consumer protection through Directive 2019/2161/EU (known primarily as the ""Omnibus Directive"").

And as is the case with the GDPR violations, the sanctions envisaged, which are based on a company's annual global turnover, are indeed quite respectable, if not impressive.

The prohibited violation of certain consumer interests can incur costs of up to 4% of the annual turnover.

Now the European Commission, together with national consumer protection authorities from 23 member states plus Norway and Iceland, presented the results of a Union-wide review of retail websites and shopping apps.

The review focused on three specific types of manipulative practices (so-called ""dark patterns"") designed to encourage consumers to take actions that are not in their real interest.

These included the hiding of information relevant to decision-making, fake countdowns, and websites whose design was intended to pressure consumers into concluding purchase contracts and subscriptions.

The results are disappointing: The acting Commissioner for Justice said that of the nearly 400 online stores checked, almost 40% had used manipulative practices to exploit consumers' weaknesses.

It would now be up to the national authorities to exert influence on the retailers and take further measures if necessary.

The coordinated review of store providers is a so-called ""sweep"" to verify compliance with EU consumer protection law.

Enforcing the correction request is now the second step, non-compliance with which may entail such a severe fine in the constellations described.

In her statement at the time, Vera Jourová said that cheaters should not get off lightly.

Thus, it therefore remains to be seen with some excitement whether the first fines in the millions will now follow that will certainly make it into the headlines.

ADVANT Beiten,Globalisation of court proceedings through so-called commercial courts,"With increasing cross-border trade, the globalisation of legal dealings is becoming increasingly widespread as well.

There is, therefore, an urgent need for a contemporary justice more accessible for international actors.

The publication of the ""Key points of the German Federal Ministry of Justice for strengthening the courts in economic disputes and for introducing commercial courts"" is a first step in the right direction.

Thus, Germany is now facing up to the requirements for a global player in its legal system as well.

The language of court in Germany is German.

Pleadings, therefore, must be drawn up in German.

In fact, evidence may be submitted in its original language.

The court, however, may require a translation.

Court proceedings are in principle conducted in German as well.

In order to counter-act an ""escape"" of companies to other jurisdictions and arbitrations, several higher regional courts and regional courts have included English-language chambers in the schedule of responsibilities since 2010, for instance, in Hamburg, Frankfurt am Main or most recently in 2021 in Berlin as well.

These pilot projects, however, have failed to gain acceptance.

Plans for introducing so-called commercial courts are now presented throughout Germany for the first time with the key points published on 16 January 2023.

Thereby, the justice and business location Germany should be sustainably strengthened and the challenges of a globalised world with international trade and commerce should be met.

Proceedings conducted in English The innovations do not only provide for the introduction of so-called commercial courts.

Pursuant to the key point paper, the German federal states should also be able to provide that certain trade disputes can be conducted completely in English before selected regional courts.

It should also be possible that appeals and complaints are negotiated completely in English at the higher regional courts.

For this purpose, special senates should be set up.

So far, the German Courts Constitution Act provides that the court language is German.

If it is negotiated with the participation of persons who have no command of the German language, an interpreter has to be involved.

The involvement of an interpreter may only be omitted if all persons participating in the process have a sufficient command of the foreign language and agree.

There is so far the possibility to hold an oral hearing in English under the aforementioned conditions.

Pleadings, protocols, and decisions, however, necessarily must be drafted in German.

There is no exception.

In the future, it should not only be possible that proceedings are held in English.

It should also be possible that pleadings are submitted in English.

This also facilitates the examination of English-language evidence such as contracts.

Neither the contract itself nor the essential passages must be translated in the pleading.

This immensely simplifies, for instance, the interpretation of contractual provisions.

Commercial courts First instance special senates (so-called commercial courts) should be set up at the higher regional courts for large scale economic disputes.

These commercial courts can be addressed directly from a threshold of an amount in dispute of one million euros, for instance, and if all parties agree.

Then, the parties may skip the regional court as an instance and litigate directly at the commercial court.

The commercial courts are composed of judges who have a very good command of English.

For the proceedings before commercial courts, the possibility should in addition be given to prepare a verbatim record, as it is already known from the arbitration.

The parties should already be able to read this verbatim record in the proceedings.

It should be possible to lodge an appeal before the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) against the decision of the commercial courts."
ADVANT Beiten,Globalisation of court proceedings through so-called commercial courts,"It should be possible to lodge an appeal before the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) against the decision of the commercial courts.

If the proceedings before a commercial court are conducted in English, comprehensive proceedings in English should also be possible - in agreement with the responsible senate of the BGH.

The enforceability of English decisions of the regional courts as well as of the commercial courts and of the BGH should be ensured by means of translations into German.

In order to facilitate the further development of the law, the translations should also be published.

Video hearings During the corona pandemic, online court proceedings were increasingly conducted.

A first step towards the modernisation of court proceedings already became evident here.

The use of video conferencing technology has already proven its worth.

Therefore, its use and distribution should now not be scaled back again.

The objective is to extend online proceedings in the ordinary jurisdiction as well as in the specialised jurisdiction, to make them more flexible and, above all, to make them more practicable.

Protection of business secrets In the future, business secrets should receive more extensive protection than before in civil proceedings.

This is to be achieved by extension of the rules of procedure of the German Trade Secret Protection Act (Geschäftsgeheimnisschutzgesetz) to all civil proceedings.

Court proceedings are in principle open to the public in Germany.

So far, the general public could only be excluded in the course of a court hearing if an important business secret was discussed.

In the future, it should be possible to advance the protection of business secrets to the time the action is filed.

It should not be possible to use or disclose information classified as confidential outside court proceedings.

Remarks The proposals of the German Federal Ministry of Justice to strengthen the courts in economic disputes are to be welcomed.

Their legislative implementation is open, however, desirable.

So far, the ordinary jurisdiction in Germany offers few contemporary process instruments for large international economic disputes Key problems such as the recognition of German judgments in part not existing in third countries so far - in particular China - should also be addressed in this context through diplomatic channels.

ADVANT Beiten,Digital Services Act: New obligations for many online services as of 17 February already,"It is high time to assess whether an online service qualifies as an ""online platform"" under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

The definition of ""online platform"" is vague and wide.

Fines can be up to 6% of the yearly worldwide turnover.

Some of the new obligations apply as early as 17 February.

It seems that many online service operators still pay much less attention to the Digital Services Act than they should.

The DSA will be a real game changer - for ""online platforms"" more than for other intermediary services.

Therefore, we want to discuss what characterizes an online platform.

An online platform is – slightly simplified – defined as a hosting service that, at the request of a user of the service, stores and disseminates information to the public (unless it is a minor and purely ancillary feature).

A hosting service is any service that stores information provided by, and at the request of, a user of the service.

The problem with this definition is that it is so wide: Pretty much anything a user of an online service does has something to do with information which is stored somewhere.

Users fill in their names and contact details in a web form, choose a nickname under which they are known online, leave comments on a website, review and rate products in an online shop, communicate with others in a chat, store preferences for their news websites, customize avatars in a virtual world, build worlds or otherwise interact with an online game.

Business might have their profiles on a delivery service, details on their vehicles in a taxi app, or their products in an online marketplace.

Most of this information is stored somewhere by the operator of such service.

And, as said above, a hosting service is any service that stores information provided by, and at the request of, a user of the service.

This means that online services which do just that might be considered hosting services (the definition of a hosting service is almost identical to the one which was introduced in the e-Commerce Directive – under the e-Commerce Directive, there is some case-law on the definition of hosting service but not a lot which would help us narrow down this overly broad definition).

However, even providers who have not been able to invoke the exclusion of liability under the host-provider privilege to date may be affected by the due diligence obligations as a hosting provider.

As soon as this information is not only stored but shared with the public, the service might even be qualified as an online platform.

The DSA contains many new obligations for online platforms.

Most of them are only to be complied with by February 2024, but some as early as 17 February 2023 – especially the average number of monthly active users has to be published (very large online platforms with more than 45 million active users are another category with much more burdensome obligations).

As of February 2024, all the other obligations apply – for online platforms, they include the obligations to set up an internal complaint-handling system and an out-of-court dispute settlement system, to give priority treatment to trusted flaggers of problematic content, to implement measures and protection against misuse, transparency reporting obligations, restrictions on online interface design and organization (including restrictions of so-called ""dark patterns""), to establish rules for advertising on online platforms (with restrictions for personalized advertising which are stricter than GDPR provisions), to implement rules for recommender system transparency and the online protection of minors.

Some of these obligations can be quite onerous.

They require very relevant implementation efforts as – depending on the service – its core processes might have to be reviewed.

It also seems that the definition of online platform might be broader than it should be, covering services the legislator did not have in mind."
ADVANT Beiten,Digital Services Act: New obligations for many online services as of 17 February already,"It also seems that the definition of online platform might be broader than it should be, covering services the legislator did not have in mind.

Companies are therefore well-advised to examine carefully if their services are in fact online-platforms on a feature-by-feature-basis.

This may require legal analysis, e.g. in case the information which is stored consists of elements provided by the operator of the service which leaves little room for abuse, in case the service provider exercises control over the information which is stored or disseminated, or on the question whether a ""dissemination"" is ""public"" and is performed ""at the request"" of the user.

A diligent analysis may also have to include a technical analysis, e.g. what type of information is actually stored, and where.

Finally, it should be assessed whether the ""minor or ancillary feature"" exception can be applied.

These assessments must be carried out individually: For example, in some online shops, the review and rating system may be more important than in others, replays of some online games may be stored just on the user's PC while others store it on the server and let users share them, and the influence a service operator exercises on the information it stores and shares can vary widely.

ADVANT Beiten,Social selection: how close an employee is to retirement can be considered to the employee’s detriment,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 8 December 2022 in Case No. 6 AZR 31/22 (Press release) When performing the social selection to determine which employment relationships will be terminated for operational reasons, “age” can be taken into account for the reconciliation of interests to the detriment of the employee where the employee is already receiving an old-age pension or can receive one within two years of the end of the employment relationship foreseen by the letter of termination.

Old-age pensions for severely disabled persons are the sole exemption.

Facts of the case The case before the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) involved a plaintiff, who was born in 1957 and had worked for the employer since 1972.

After insolvency proceedings were opened over the employer’s assets, the insolvency administrator and the works council performed the reconciliation of interests to obtain a list of 61 names, including the plaintiff’s, from a total of 396 employees.

These 61 employees would be issued with notices of termination for operational reasons.

The list of names was a result of the social selection.

The insolvency administrator considered the plaintiff the least worthy of protection within her peer group because she was the only employee with the option of receiving the old-age pension for those employed for an exceptionally long time, in accordance with §§ 38 and 236b of the Social Code (SGB VI), soon after the end of her employment relationship.

The plaintiff considered the termination ineffective.

She claimed that the social selection was flawed because she was clearly more worthy of protection than a significantly younger colleague who was born in 1986 and had worked for the employer for a much shorter period (since 2012).

Both the Labour Court in Dortmund and the Regional Labour Court in Hamm, on appeal, followed the plaintiff’s argumentation and held in her favour.

The judgment The BAG saw things differently: the judges in Erfurt considered the “age” selection criterion ambiguous.

Increasing age generally means an increased need for social protection because older employees still typically have more difficulty finding a new position.

This need for protection decreases when the employee either already receives a replacement income in the form of an old-age pension without deductions or can receive one at the latest within two years of the end of the employment relationship.

The only exemption is old-age pensions for persons with a severe disability in accordance with §§ 37, 236a SGB VI.

When considering age in the reconciliation of interests, the employer and the works council have a measure of discretion which would allow a high age to be considered to the detriment of the employee in line with the stated requirements.

Consequences for practice The decision should be welcomed.

The statutory rules in § 1 (3) of the Act Against Unfair Dismissal (Kündigungsschutzgesetz, KSchG) and § 125 (1) No. 2 of the Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung, InsO) provide merely that employers shall take the criteria for social selection, including age, “sufficiently into account.”

This does not necessarily mean that the need for social protection should be given more weight as the employer ages.

In contrast, it would be difficult to see why the fact that an employee will have security in the form of an old-age pension in the foreseeable future or is already receiving such security should not result in “less” need for social protection.

And lastly, it also increases the protection of younger employees, who do not (yet) have such security.

Accordingly, the fact that the BAG has now settled this controversial matter of law and created certainty for practice by establishing the two-year limit for “close to retirement” should also be welcomed."
ADVANT Beiten,Social selection: how close an employee is to retirement can be considered to the employee’s detriment,"However, it should be noted that an early pension for severe disability may not be considered within the framework of the social selection as this would constitute inadmissible discrimination on the basis of severe disability under the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) (Judgment of the ECJ of 6 December 2012 in Case No. C-152/11).

Naturally, the remaining social selection criteria such as seniority, maintenance obligations and severe disability must be considered.

Within this framework, however, it is now possible to rate an employee who is close to retirement or is already receiving an old-age pension as less needing of social protection.

ADVANT Beiten,Receipt of E-mails in the Course of Business Transactions,"E-mails have become a popular and indispensable means of communication in business transactions used not only to transmit information quickly but also to conclude agreements.

In this context, the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) had to address the very practice-oriented question as to when a declaration of intent transmitted by e-mail is deemed to be delivered to the recipient.

Pursuant to the ruling of the BGH, the declaration is already received at the time when the e-mail is stored on the recipient's server.

A revocation of the declaration received is no longer possible thereafter.

BGH, Judgement of 06 October 2022 - VII ZR 895/21

Brief summary of facts The parties to the dispute argued about the payment of work wages.

The Plaintiff's lawyers sent an e-mail (""first e-mail"") to the Defendant on 14 December 2018 at 09.19 a.m.

In this e-mail, the Plaintiff had its lawyers state that the claim from the final invoice still amounted to EUR 14,347.23 and that, in addition, only legal fees in the amount of EUR 1,029.35 would be claimed as damages for delay.

In another e-mail sent on 14 December 2018 at 09.56 a.m. (""second e-mail""), its lawyers clarified less than an hour later that the first e-mail should be disregarded as a final review of the amount of the claim had not yet been carried out by the Plaintiff.

The right to assert further claims remains reserved according to the e-mail.

On 17 December 2018, the Plaintiff submitted a higher final invoice in the amount of EUR 22,173.17.

A few days later, on 21 December 2018, the Defendant transferred to the Plaintiff EUR 14,347.23 on the main claim and EUR 1.029,35 to reimburse the legal fees.

The Plaintiff filed an action for payment of the difference of EUR 7,825.94 between the first and the second final invoice.

The Regional Court dismissed the action.

The appeal before the Higher Regional Court also remained unsuccessful for the Plaintiff.

In the appeal before the BGH, the Plaintiff sought payment of the differential amount.

BGH, Judgement of 06 October 2022 - VII ZR 895/21

The BGH confirmed the decision of the Regional Court and the Higher Regional Court; the appeal was without success.

The BGH considered the first e-mail to be an offer by the Plaintiff to conclude a settlement.

According to the Court, the Defendant accepted the settlement offer by making the payment a few days later.

Thereby, the legal relationship between the parties was completely replaced by the new agreement on a reduced work wage, the settlement (so-called novation).

The offer made in the first e-mail was binding because it had been received by the Defendant and had become effective upon receipt (cf.

Section 130 (1) German Civil Code (BGB)).

The second e-mail was not to be regarded as a valid revocation within the meaning of Section 130 (1) sentence 2 BGB (see below).

The background to the Court's reasoning is the difference between the acceptance period of an offer (Section 147 (2) BGB) and the revocation period of an offer (Section 130 (1) sentence 2 BGB).

In each case, it is a matter of making offers to absent parties.

A contract is concluded by offer and acceptance.

The acceptance period is the time during which an offer is binding and can be effectively accepted.

The revocation period is the period of time during which an offer can still be withdrawn by revocation.

The revocation period ends with the receipt of the declaration of intent.

This means that revocation is only possible before or at the same time as receipt of the declaration of intent (cf.

Section 130 (1) sentence 2 BGB).

The acceptance period, on the other hand, runs until the time when the recipient's response can normally be expected, cf.

Section 147 (2) BGB.

In the present case, the BGH confirmed that the offer made by the Plaintiff could be accepted within an acceptance period of approximately two to three weeks."
ADVANT Beiten,Receipt of E-mails in the Course of Business Transactions,"Section 147 (2) BGB.

In the present case, the BGH confirmed that the offer made by the Plaintiff could be accepted within an acceptance period of approximately two to three weeks.

Receipt of a Declaration of Intent by E-mail Since the revocation of an offer is only possible until the receipt of the offer, the revocation period decisively depends on the receipt.

According to settled case-law, a declaration of intent among absent parties (e.g. an offer transmitted by e-mail or mail) is deemed to have been received if it has reached the recipient's sphere of influence in such a way that the recipient has the opportunity to take note of the content of the declaration under normal circumstances.

According to the Federal Court of Justice, an e-mail that is received on the recipient's mail server within normal business hours, i.e. is made available to the recipient ready for retrieval, is already delivered when it is received on the recipient's mail server.

Whether the e-mail is actually retrieved, opened, and read by the recipient is irrelevant.

The only decisive factor is the possibil-ity of taking notice.

Therefore, the first e-mail, with which the settlement offer was made, was already delivered on 14 December 2018 at 9.19 a.m.

The second e-mail, which was received 37 minutes later, therefore did not constitute an effective revocation of the settlement offer.

This is because a revocation of the settlement offer was no longer possible after receipt.

The settlement was reached by transferring the offered amount on 21 December 2018 - i.e. still within the acceptance period of two to three weeks.

This leads to the effective conclusion of the contract or, in this case, to the conclusion of the settlement.

There is no legal basis for a later additional claim for the difference, as the Plaintiff asserts in the lawsuit.

The contract concluded between the parties, on which the Plaintiff's original claim for payment of the higher work wage was based, was replaced by the settlement, which reduced the work wage claim.

Furthermore, the BGH clarified that the acceptance of an offer that was unsuccessfully revoked - due to being too late - did not violate the principle of good faith and was thus effective.

Background With its ruling, the German Federal Supreme Court decided on the extremely practice-relevant, yet so far unresolved question of the receipt of a declaration of intent by e-mail.

The decision relates to the receipt of e-mails during normal business hours.

The question of when an e-mail is received when sent outside normal business hours or on public holidays has not yet been clarified.

The facts of the case decided by the BGH did not give rise to a need to clarify this question.

There are different opinions on when an e-mail can be expected to be retrieved in the course of business when it is received outside business hours.

It is predominantly argued that the receipt then takes place on the following business day, at the latest by the end of business hours.

It is generally agreed that actual knowledge of the content of the e-mail is not required for receipt.

For the sake of comparison: According to prevailing opinion, a declaration of intent transmitted by letter is delivered when it is received in the recipient's letterbox.

The digital counterpart to the letterbox is the mail server.

According to the BGH, the server is already within the recipient's sphere of influence.

Note It is encouraging that the BGH has now ruled on the previously unresolved question of the receipt of an e-mail, the most common type of communication in business transactions.

However, some legal questions remain unanswered: The BGH's decision only relates to business transac-tions.

It remains unclear whether and to what extent the principles on the receipt of e-mails also apply to private individuals.

In practice, the problem of the burden of proof still remains."
ADVANT Beiten,Receipt of E-mails in the Course of Business Transactions,"It remains unclear whether and to what extent the principles on the receipt of e-mails also apply to private individuals.

In practice, the problem of the burden of proof still remains.

It is often not technically feasible to prove that an e-mail was stored on a (third-party) server.

However, this is a prerequisite for the receipt.

Not every server supports the automatic sending of a transmission confirmation.

A read receipt is not suitable because it is up to the recipient to send it or not.

Moreover, the fact that the e-mail was actually noticed is irrelevant for the receipt.

However, mere proof that the e-mail was sent, and that no non-delivery notification was received is not sufficient to prove receipt.

This is because there is no legal presumption that an e-mail sent arrives at the recipient's server, any more than there is a presumption that a letter arrives at the recipient.

The BGH's decision also demonstrates that once an offer has been validly made, it is in fact not revocable when transmitted by e-mail, as the e-mail arrives on the recipient's incoming server within seconds, is ready for retrieval and has thus been delivered.

If one wishes to reserve the right to make changes to the offer, it is therefore recommended to make this clear by means of an appropriate disclaimer.

For example, the offer could be marked ""without recourse"" or ""subject to change"".

This is the only way that a unilateral adjustment is still possible at a later point in time.

This applies to offers in general.

After all, even if the offer is sent by regular mail, it must be expected that it will be accepted quickly by the recipient.

The revocation or amendment of the offer then is too late.

ADVANT Beiten,New German Company Register for Companies under Civil Law (GbR),"The introduction of the ""Company Register"" as of 01 January 2024.

With the entry into force of the German Act on the Modernisation of Company Law (MoPeG) on 01 January 2024, a new register will be created, the company register.

This register will be an independent addition to the Commercial Register and the Transparency Register and will record civil law companies (GbR) and their partners.

Although the registration of the GbR is conceived by the legislator as fundamentally ""voluntary"", for most of the civil law companies appearing in legal transactions the registration will be anything but voluntary.

Companies can and should already prepare for this.

Relevance of the Company Register So far, the GbR and its partners are not entered in a register.

This means that it is often difficult for participants in legal transactions to find out who is a partner in the GbR and thus liable for its obligations.

In the case of other types of companies, such as general partnerships ( Offene Handelsgesellschaft, OHG ), limited partnerships ( Kommanditgesellschaft, K G) and partnerships ( Partnerschaftsgesellschaft ), there are corresponding public registers that provide certainty about the essential circumstances of the company, such as its name, registered office, and partners.

The company register is intended to increase the publicity of the GbR (with the corresponding will of its partners) to make its participation in legal transactions more secure.

Registrability of the External Partnership under Civil Law Not all GbRs can be entered in the register.

This option is only to exist for the external GbR according to section 707 (1) German Civil Code Draft (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch Entwurf, BGB-E) (BGB according to the draft of the MoPeG).

The differentiation between external and internal GbR in the new MoPeG follows the relevant case law of the Federal Supreme Court.

According to section 705 (2) alt.

1 BGB-E, an external GbR exists if the company is to partici-pate in legal transactions according to the joint will of the partners.

Pursuant to section 705 (2) BGB-E, it can be the bearer of rights and obligations and forms its own corporate assets pursuant to section 713 BGB-E. External GbRs are, for instance, professional-practice firms (Berufsausübungsgesellschaften), small-scale traders ( Kleingewerbetreibende ) or otherwise entrepreneurially active companies, such as real estate companies.

Basically, a GbR is an external GbR whenever the partners (intend to) appear in legal transactions under the name of the GbR.

According to section 719 (1) BGB-E, such a company comes into existence in relation to third parties as soon as it participates in legal transactions with the consent of all partners, but at the latest with its entry in the newly created company register.

According to section 705 (2) alt.

2 BGB-E, an internal GbR is only to serve the purpose of structuring the legal relationship between its partners.

The internal GbR has no legal capacity and, pursuant to section 740 (1) BGB-E, no corporate assets.

This makes the internal GbR eligible for regulating voting and pooling agreements, sub-participations in company shares and similar relationships.

Yet it may never be registered.

An internal GbR that is accidentally entered in the company register would be regarded as an external GbR, at least in terms of its legal appearance - with all the resulting consequences.

Content of Entry The content of the entry in the future company register is largely based on the previous regula-tions for the commercial register.

Pursuant to section 707 (2) BGB-E, the name, registered office and address of the company, the names, place of residence or registered office of each partner and their power of representation are to be entered, among other things.

After registration, the GbR is obliged under section 707a (2) BGB-E to use the suffix ""eingetragene Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts"" or ""eGbR""."
ADVANT Beiten,New German Company Register for Companies under Civil Law (GbR),"After registration, the GbR is obliged under section 707a (2) BGB-E to use the suffix ""eingetragene Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts"" or ""eGbR"".

Pursuant to section 707a (3) BGB-E, the protection of good faith of section 15 German Commercial Code (HGB) is to be applied accordingly to the registra-tions.

Every outsider can thus rely on the correctness of the entries.

This register publicity allows a more reliable assessment for legal transactions as to who is available to the company's creditors as a personally liable partner.

Furthermore, section 707c BGB-E provides for the possibility of a change of status from the company register to the commercial register if a GbR wishes to change its legal form to another type of partnership.

This applies in particular to registered, small trade GbRs that wish to change to the legal form of OHG on an optional basis, as well as those whose activities exceed the threshold for commercial business operations according to section 1 (2) HGB.

In turn, small commercial partnerships (OHG) that have been registered in the commercial register up to now can change their status to a company under civil law (GbR) in accordance with sections 106 and 107 HGB Draft (HGB-E).

The entry of the external GbR in the company register is not mandatory and not required for its legal capacity.

It retains all its previous rights even after the introduction of the company register and also remains registered in other registers, e.g., in the land register.

However, section 47 (2) Draft German Land Register Act (Entwurf Grundbuchordnung, GBO-E) provides in future that a GbR may only be entered in the land register if it is also entered in the company register.

In the event of the acquisition or amendment of rights to real property or rights equivalent to real property, a GbR must therefore always be pre-registered in the company register before it can make the entry of the acquisition or amendment in the land register.

For practical purposes, all GbRs that are registered in the land register or wish to register rights in the land register in the future are thus advised to make such an entry in the company register promptly after the law comes into force.

Problems after the Introduction Immediately upon entry into force of the MoPeG, several new regulations will require the affected GbR to be pre-registered in the company register.

Therefore, a large part of the existing external GbRs in Germany will have to be registered, irrespective of the envisaged voluntary nature, to remain capable of acting with regard to these rights.

Otherwise, they risk considerable delays in carrying out legal transactions regarding the rights registered for them.

This applies to all legal transactions concerning real property and rights equivalent to real property (transfer of ownership, priority notice, mortgages, land charges), the participation of the GbR in other registered companies (GmbH, OHG, KG, and other eGbR) and intellectual property rights (trademarks, patents).

The law shall come into force on 01 January 2024.

Companies do not have the opportunity to apply for registration in advance.

Hence, there will probably be a great rush on the newly created company register in January 2024.

The responsible states had therefore already asked for a further delay in the introduction of the company register after 2024, but this was rejected by the German Federal Parliament.

For this reason, companies should be prepared for considerable delays in the requested registration.

Since other registers will not be active for the company until the company is registered (e.g., not registering the sale of a property in the land register), considerable delays may occur, some of which may jeopardise the company's existence.

Recommended Courses of Action The expected problems should already be addressed by the partners."
ADVANT Beiten,New German Company Register for Companies under Civil Law (GbR),"Recommended Courses of Action The expected problems should already be addressed by the partners.

First, it should be checked whether there is an indirect registration obligation, i.e., whether the external partnership holds registered rights or participates in registered companies or would like to acquire such rights in 2024.

If this is the case, acquisition procedures should already be carried out and concluded in the current year 2023.

If acquisitions are planned for 2024 or later, they should be advanced if possible.

Pre-registration or the lack thereof will not affect legal positions existing on 01 January 2024.

Foreseeable changes in the number of partners in the GbR, participation in other companies, land ownership and other registered rights should thus already be anticipated in 2023.

The GbR and its partners can then react more relaxed to the problems and the expected delays in the implementation of the company register.

ADVANT Beiten,"ESOP, VSOP & Co.: Employee share ownership options","Many companies are looking for qualified and motivated employees and junior staff − the 'war for talents' has been going on for a long time.

Especially for start-ups and young companies that cannot pay top salaries, the participation of employees in the success of the company can be very attractive.

What is known as the skin-in-the-game effect motivates employees to invest long-term and intense effort in the company.

However, the general conditions for employee profit sharing in Germany are considered unfavourable in an international comparison.

There are no wide-ranging tax benefits.

Yet even in Germany an employee participation programme may be implemented in Germany through professional contractual arrangements.

Below you find an overview of the typical employee share ownership schemes.

Direct equity ownership A company may give employees a direct stake in the company's capital by granting employees a share in the company's capital.

The employees become shareholders.

In addition to the employment relationship between the company and the employee, this also creates a direct link within the company’s structure.

As shareholders of the company, the employees do not only have a direct share in the profits of the company, but can also exercise far-reaching information, control and co-determination rights.

For the company and the existing shareholders, a direct equity ownership of employees typically leads to increased administrative work.

They have to deal with additional shareholders through such employees' direct equity ownership, which makes uncomplicated, quick decision-making more difficult than in a small circle of shareholders.

From a tax point of view, it should be noted that the employee must pay income tax on the difference between the price and the value of the share at the time of its acquisition.

The transfer of company shares at a discount or free of charge is deemed to be hidden employment remuneration.

This leads to what is known as the dry-income issue: the employee must pay income tax on their capital share without receiving an increased net salary in return.

The legislative has given small and medium-sized enterprises the option to defer the payment of wage tax for 12 years under certain circumstances (s19a EstG (German Income Tax Act)).

Yet this is no sufficient solution to the dry-income issue.

The tax-free allowance to which the employee is entitled if the employee receives shares in the company free of charge or at a discount, which has now been increased to EUR 1,440 per calendar year, does not change that.

The capital gains from the sale of the shares are subject to withholding tax (25%) or the partial-income procedure (Teileinkünfteverfahren) (only 60% of the capital income is taxed), depending on the size of the holding (1% threshold).

A (not yet publicly available) key point paper from the German Federal Ministry of Finance, according to which tax benefits will be available also to larger companies than in the past, raises hopes for a future minimisation of tax disadvantages in the granting of shares.

In order to alleviate the dry-income problem, it is planned to extend the period of taxation by 8 years to 20 years and even beyond that if the company assumes liability for the wage tax owed.

In addition, the tax-free allowance to which the employee is entitled is planned to be raised to EUR 5,000 per calendar year.

However, these positive proposals are only an internal discussion paper of the Ministry of Finance.

For the time being, the focus should therefore be on other forms of employee participation.

Option rights As it were, options are a preliminary stage to direct equity participation.

Option rights are regularly issued as part of employee stock option plans (ESOP).

The employees get an entitlement to receive shares at a previously determined exercise price on specified conditions."
ADVANT Beiten,"ESOP, VSOP & Co.: Employee share ownership options","Option rights are regularly issued as part of employee stock option plans (ESOP).

The employees get an entitlement to receive shares at a previously determined exercise price on specified conditions.

The entitlement may, for instance, be linked to a certain number of service years or the achievement of certain economic key figures.

Only when the option is exercised does an option holder receive real shares in the company, which convey the shareholder rights defined for direct equity participation.

From a tax point of view, option rights differ from direct equity participation insofar as wage tax regularly only accrues at the time the option is exercised (on the difference between the actual value and the exercise price).

The dry-income problem also exists at this time.

Here too, the tax payment may be deferred under certain circumstances (s19a EstG).

The capital gains from the sale of the shares received from exercising the option are also subject to withholding tax (25%) or the partial-income procedure (only 60% of the capital income is taxed), depending on the size of the holding (1% threshold).

Virtual share option plans Especially in the start-up sector, virtual company shares, called phantom shares or virtual stock option plans (VSOP) are often chosen as a form of employee participation.

Phantom shares are merely modelled on a direct equity participation - it is a purely debt-based capital transfer relationship.

This means that the employees do not participate in the company in terms of company law, but only in mere economic terms.

If certain pre-determined requirements are met (typically in the event of the sale of a majority stake in the company), the employee is treated as if they held real shares in the company by receiving a payment equal to the value of their virtual shares.

Unlike in the case of direct equity participation, the granting of virtual shareholdings does not directly lead to the accrual of wage tax; the relevant point in time here is the receipt of the remuneration.

This is a major advantage of this type of employee participation: it avoids the dry-income issue because the employee is only taxed once there is a corresponding liquidity flow.

All payments based on phantom shares, on the other hand, are subject to wage tax, as they are income from employment.

Conclusion The common feature of all three forms of employee share ownership is that the direct or indirect participation in the economic success of the company is meant to be an incentive for employees.

Due to the current legal situation, a virtual participation in a company seems particularly attractive from a legal point of view.

It is less complex than ESOPs and avoids the (still) unresolved dry-income issue.

However, which form of employee participation is the most suitable always depends on the individual circumstances.

It should be assessed and tailored in consideration of the structure and specific concerns of the company in question.

ADVANT Beiten,Games Law in Germany: 2022 RECAP,"After having had an excellent start into the new year, we would like to look back on the year 2022 from a German ""games law"" perspective and go into a ""speed run"" through –what we personally think were most important innovations and rulings on games and e-sports.

We want to focus on the ""main quests"" of 2022 and venture a detour to the places where one or the other legal ""Easter Egg"" was hidden.

Privacy and Data Protection

The Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) (BGH I ZR 186/17) again had to deal with the right of consumer protection associations to institute legal proceedings in the event of GDPR violations, and once again referred the case to the European Court of Justice.

The proceedings between the umbrella organisation of consumer associations (vzbv) and Facebook (Meta) regarding an earlier design of the app centre for instant games had last been suspended by the FCJ in 2020 and referred to the ECJ to clarify the question of the legal standing of associations.

Subsequently, the ECJ had already affirmed this on the merits.

E-Sports The non-profit status of e-sports promised in the coalition agreement between the governing parties was not implemented in 2022.

E-sport has not been recognized as a sport in Germany to date.

Granting such a status would be possible, for instance, by adding it to the catalogue of non-profit purposes (Section 52 German Fiscal Code).

The Federal Government stated upon request that the content and timetable for the implementation of the non-profit status of e-sports had not yet been determined.

More encouraging news on e-sports came from the EU.

In its resolution 2022/2027, the European Parliament emphasized the importance and positive impact of e-sports and video games.

The resolution states, among other things, that national, regional and global e-sports tournaments could be seen as a means of promoting cultural exchange and Europe's culture and values, and that video games and e-sports can also offer significant benefits to many players in terms of mental health and enable spreading positive values.

The European Parliament nevertheless considers that e-sports and traditional sports are different ""sectors"", which is related to the position of power of the publisher, who holds an exclusive and unrestricted right to use its games.

However, sports and e-sports complemented each other, learned from each other, and promoted comparable positive values.

The European Parliament's demands to the Commission include introducing an e-sports visa for the Schengen area and adopting guidelines regarding the status of professional e-sports players.

We eagerly await to see how the European Commission implements this request.

The Regional Court of Kiel (17 O 24/20) had to deal with a case in which an e-sports athlete successfully sued another e-sports athlete for injunctive relief and damages for pain and suffering due to defamatory statements broadcast via the streaming platform Twitch.

The Regional Court of Kiel found that the plaintiff's general right to privacy had been unlawfully violated by the insults in dispute.

This does not change even if a ""rough tone"" prevails in e-sports - as claimed by the defendant.

Protection of Minors The protection of minors in games was also a subject of intense discussion in 2022.

On the one hand, this covered the content of the games themselves, such as the depiction of violent actions in the post-apocalyptic survival game ""Dying Light 2,"" and on the other hand, and above all, usage risks in digital games.

The Norwegian consumer organization Forbrukerrådet published an extensive report on the supposed ""enfant terrible"" among the usage risks - the Lootbox - which was supported by other consumer organizations in Europe.

This report was picked up, among others, by ZDF Magazin Royale, a journalistic-satirical TV program, and thus stimulated a new the discussion about the Lootbox issue, which had meanwhile faded away in Germany."
ADVANT Beiten,Games Law in Germany: 2022 RECAP,"Usage risks in computer games and how to deal with them will continue to keep us busy in 2023, as the USK (Entertainment Software Self-Regulation Body) has revised itscriteria for reviewing, rating, and labelling digital games based on the 2021 revision of the German Protection of Minors Act (Jugendschutzgesetz).

Now, interaction risks (usage risks) must be taken into account, and the games must make explicit reference to these by means of so-called descriptors.

At present, there are the following four categories of interaction risks (usage risks): In-Game purchases Chats In-game purchases + random objects (e.g., loot boxes)

Location sharing That the topic is red-hot is also proven by the record fine of 520 million US dollars imposed in December in the USA against the company Epic Games, among other things, because of communication options available in the game Fortnite (Fortnite has since been adapted in this respect).

It remains to be seen whether similar proceedings will occupy European or even German courts in 2023.

What else was up?

The Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia (19 B 961/21) had to deal with the legality of the indexing of a computer game because it is harmful to minors.

Referring to the Bushido decision of the Cologne Administrative Court, the Higher Administrative Court clarified that the Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Minors can make up for the hearing of the author pursuant to Section 21 (7) of the German Protection of Minors Act during court proceedings.

Platform Regulation Additional tasks which will continue to keep us busy also in 2023, arose from the coming into force of the Digital Markets Act and, in particular, the Digital Services Act.

The latter subjects providers of intermediary services (mere conduit, caching and hosting services as well as operators of online platforms and search engines) to a comprehensive catalogue of duties.

The Digital Services Act will put an end to the patchwork of regulations currently in force for providers of intermediary services providers in the European Union.

In doing so, the law follows the seemingly simple principle that what is illegal offline should also be illegal online.

Less simple, and thus worthy of careful consideration, is the sometimes extensive, graduated catalog of obligations that goes hand in hand with the law.

Providers of online services, such as multiplayer games, must now check in the first place whether and which of their services fall under one of the above categories to determine the resulting new obligations.

Non-compliance with the regulations can be sanctioned with heavy fines of up to six percent of consolidated annual worldwide turnover in future.

Copyright The German Federal Court of Justice confirmed its previous line on network blocking for copyright infringements in a ruling in October (BGH I ZR 111/21).

According to this ruling, the blocking of websites by access providers can only be demanded if the rights holder has tried all other reasonable means to no avail.

In the case decided, it was still possible to bring an action for information against the Swedish host provider to identify the infringer.

The Cologne Regional Court (14 O 38/19) dealt with contributory liability for copyright infringement of automation software (also known as: bots) for a well-known smartphone and tablet game in early 2022.

The question arose as to whether a managing director could be held liable for the infringing acts (in addition to the defendant company).

The Cologne Regional Court assumed this, applying the general principles of complicity pursuant to Section 25 (2) German Criminal Code, because the latter had a significant share and influence on the organizational, technical and entrepreneurial framework of the copyright infringement.

Bots were also (indirectly) an issue before the German Federal Constitutional Court in 2022 (BVerfG - 1 BvR 1021/17)."
ADVANT Beiten,Games Law in Germany: 2022 RECAP,"Bots were also (indirectly) an issue before the German Federal Constitutional Court in 2022 (BVerfG - 1 BvR 1021/17).

There, a bot creator defended himself against the enforcement of an injunction limited to the Federal Republic of Germany.

The publisher, on the other hand, took the view that the title also required the debtor to do everything possible in Germany to prevent future copyright infringements by third parties - including third parties abroad.

This was also the view of the Dresden Higher Regional Court in its order for payment of an administrative fine to the detriment of the bot creator.

However, the Federal Constitutional Court considered the order to be arbitrary and thus a violation of the bot creator's fundamental right under Article 3 (1) of the German Constitution.

As a consequence of the principle of territoriality applicable in copyright law, the infringing act in question must hence have been committed at least in part within Germany.

The cease-and-desist order from the main proceedings (BGH I ZR 25/15) must not be understood as a general obligation to act.

Consumer Protection Law Challenges for companies arose at national and EU level as a result of new requirements in consumer protection law.

The implementation of the Directive on certain aspects of contracts relating to the provision of digital content and services (Directive 2019/770/EU - Digital Content and Service Directive) added a new section to the German Civil Code (BGB) in Sections 327 et seq.

German Civil Code, which regulates rights and obligations in contracts for digital content and services between entrepreneurs and consumers.

As Recital 19 of the Directive also makes clear: Very relevant for ""digital games"".

New and surprising for some companies was the fact that consumer protection provisions from distance selling law now also apply when a consumer ""pays with its data"" rather than with money.

This now results, among other things, in comprehensive pre-contractual information obligations, the requirement of a revocation instruction and the necessity of a contract confirmation.

Companies should urgently tackle this and other homework (such as reviewing user terms and conditions) in 2022, because the implementation of the ""New Deal for Consumers"" means that companies will face severe fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover in the future for violations of European consumer protection law.

On a national level, Section 312k of the German Civil Code, new version, has been in force since July 1, 2022, which stipulates that a ""cancellation button"" must be made available to consumers in electronic business transactions for continuing obligations against payment (entgeltliche Dauerschuldverhältnisse).

Consumer groups and associations didnot hesitate for long to issue the first warnings which have led to improvements by the companies according to the consumer watchdogs.

The cancellation button is mandatory for the vast majority of continuing obligations that can be concluded online, regardless of whether they were concluded before July 1, 2022.

What else was up?

The Karlsruhe Regional Court (3 O 108/21) dealt, among other things, with the premature expiration of the right of cancellation when purchasing game currency in an in-game store.

In deviation from the standard 14-day cancellation period, the statutory consumer right of cancellation pursuant to Section 356 (5) of the German Civil Code may expire prematurely and end earlier under certain circumstances in the case of contracts for the supply of digital content.

The consumer must confirm that the right of cancellation expires before the 14 days have expired in this case and that the entrepreneur begins to provide the digital content before the end of the cancellation period in the case of contracts against payment."
ADVANT Beiten,Games Law in Germany: 2022 RECAP,"As the Karlsruhe Regional Court states in its ruling, however, this does not require any prior information about the conditions, the procedure and the exercise of the right of cancellation.

A checkbox with the addition ""I agree to the execution of the contract [...] before the expiry of the cancellation period and know that my right of cancellation thereby expires.""

makes it sufficiently clear that a right of cancellation exists and is extinguished.

Following the decision of the Karlsruhe Regional Court, a ""waiver"" of the right of cancellation is also legally permissible before the final purchase confirmation.

Conclusion We note that in fact, there was a lot of work to be done in 2022 as well.

One or the other struggle in copyright law had to be fought out.

The right tools had to be prepared for the compliance jungle, which presents new challenges from year to year.

Now it is time to focus on the legislative quests that the year 2023 brings.

ADVANT Beiten,The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - will it become a reality?,"Exporters in third countries and importers have to start preparing for the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

Companies importing iron, steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizers and electricity will be obliged to purchase so-called CBAM-certificates and pay the difference between the carbon price paid in the country of production and the price of carbon allowances in the EU ETS.

Producers in third countries will be required to provide information concerning their emissions.

In detail: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is no easy Sunday afternoon walk and going alone only renders it more complicated.

Even though a provisional deal for joint action on EU-level has now been reached, questions remain: Can the EU implement a WTO compatible CBAM?

Additionally, will the EU achieve its objective if the CBAM does not survive multilateral criticism?

CBAM and the European Green Deal Three years ago, in 2019, the European Union has set reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 as necessary and attainable objective, delivering on the commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The European Green Deal is the overarching strategy, to be implemented by more than fifteen new laws or changes to existing legisla-tion, the so-called ""Fit for 55"" package.

The goal is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

The ""Fit for 55"" package 1 foresees establishing the CBAM together with changes to the current EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

The CBAM should equalize the carbon price between domestic and foreign products.

In accordance with the applicable legislative procedure, the European Commission put forward a draft which is concurrently discussed by the European Parliament (EP) and the 27 Member States in the Council 2 .

The draft was welcomed by the EP's Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee (ENVI) but the EP rejected the proposal as not ambitious enough.

Over several months, the EP and the Council negotiated a compromise version that was tentatively agreed in December 2022 3 .

Current situation: EU only reduction efforts The EU has an Emissions Trading System (ETS) for more than fifteen years and CBAM is designed to function in parallel with this system, complementing it for imported goods.

The ETS puts a cap on the amount of greenhouse gases companies are allowed emit.

Within the cap it is possible to buy emission allowances that can be traded with.

Some of the allowances are auctioned, however, the rest of the allowances are given for free by the European Commission to certain sectors at risk of carbon leakage.

Carbon leakage refers to the problem of companies relocating their production offshore, to countries with fewer environmental protection.

CBAM addresses this issue, i.e. that the greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts of the EU are offset by increasing emissions outside its borders through relocation of production to non-EU countries (where policies applied to fight climate change are less ambitious than those of the EU) or increased imports of carbon-intensive products.

The EU accounts for some 8 percent of carbon dioxide emissions (without counting the emissions created by imports).

It would be counterproductive and against the objective of the Paris Agreement to decrease emissions in the EU while importing more carbon-intensive products.

Future situation: Offsetting ""imported"" emissions Under the CBAM, carbon pricing is done through the instrument of CBAM-certificates, similar to ETS certificates.

""CBAM certificate"" means a certificate in electronic format corresponding to one ton of embedded emissions in goods.

Importers of certain energy-intensive goods have to buy CBAM-certificates in order to be allowed to import those goods into the EU.

The required number of CBAM-certificates corresponds to the total embedded emissions of the imported goods."
ADVANT Beiten,The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - will it become a reality?,"The required number of CBAM-certificates corresponds to the total embedded emissions of the imported goods.

The goods concerned are enumerated and are in the beginning limited to the most carbon-intensive sectors: iron and steel, cement, fertilisers, aluminium, electricity, and hydrogen, as well as some precursors and a limited number of downstream products.

Indirect emissions would also be included in the regulation in a well-circumscribed manner.

The EP wanted to be more ambitious and had to compromise while the Council compromised on some indirect emissions.

Over time, the free emission allowances to some EU producers under the ETS would gradually be phased out and the product scope of the ETS and CBAM would converge.

In the beginning, as of October 2023, CBAM would start with reporting obligations before requiring the purchase of certificates.

Companies would need to register as ""declarants"" with the EU, to be able to import products covered by the CBAM.

Declarants would need to submit annual declarations of their emissions to the national competent authorities of the Member States, from whom they would need to purchase certificates, reflecting the embedded emissions of the products they imported over the previous year.

The original plan was to phase out the free ETS allocations and end free allocations all together in 2035 and the CBAM to come into effect in January 2023, with a transition period until the end of 2026.

The phasing in of CBAM will now take longer.

WTO compatibility and economic consequences Plenty initiatives have been launched to tackle global warming, but manifold obstacles have remained in their way to realization, ranging from geopolitical circumstances to considerations of unilateral advantages.

Suffice to say that a ""G7 Carbon Club"" was talked about but not even followed up, much less creating a single global emissions price.

As regards the economic consequences in the EU, the emissions-intensive industry considers that the lack of relief of the ETS burden for exports with the simultaneous expiry of the free allocation of certificates leads to imbalance and the increased risk of relocation of industries.

While EU-based manufacturers of emission-intensive raw materials would be protected from imports originating in countries with lower carbon dioxide prices, the export of emission-intensive raw materials from the Union would hardly be economically viable, as the production costs would no longer be competitive in international comparison without free allocation of allowances.

With respect to political considerations, several countries have already voiced their concerns, ranging from CBAM violating trade agreements to decrying it as blatant protectionism.

Brazil, South Africa, India and China have stressed the negative implications for developing countries.

In particular, many concerns have been voiced about the compatibility of CBAM with international law.

However, a CBAM compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is not per se impossible and could be justified on environmental grounds.

The GATT compatibility of the CBAM depends mostly on its design and application; at the time of writing the December compromise draft was not yet published and may not reflect the ultimately adopted text.

It could qualify as a border adjustable internal measure under GATT Article III or, if found to be discriminatory, could be justified under the general exceptions of GATT Article XX, relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (GATT Article XX(g)) or necessity to protect human, animal or plant life or health (GATT Article XX (b)).

Under EU law, the legal basis of the CBAM is Article 192 para.

1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), which allows the Union to take action in order to achieve to the environmental and climate objectives specified in Article 191

para.1 TFEU."

ADVANT Beiten,Federal Labour Court publishes judgment on the recording of working time – duty to act and co-decision right,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 13 September 2022 in Case No. 1 ABR 22/21 Employers must record the beginning, end and duration of the daily working time of employees, and do not have a grace period to implement a time-recording system, except where the legislators have adopted a derogation that is admissible under EU law.

The works council (currently) has a co-decision right with respect to the establishment of arrangements for recording working time – subject to any future statutory rule.

Facts of the case The dispute erupted over whether the works council of a work operated jointly by two employers had a right of initiative concerning the introduction of an electronic working time-recording system.

After a conciliation committee was established to look at the question of the “adoption of a works agreement on the introduction and use of an electronic system to record working time”, the employers questioned the conciliation committee’s jurisdiction.

In response, the works council brought an action under the resolution procedure to establish that it had a right of initiative in this case.

The judgment The Federal Labour Court ( Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG ) answered the application in the negative (see also the article by Lipinski/Holzapfel on the press release of the Court).

In the Court’s view, the only restriction to the right of initiative for the introduction of an electronic system to record working time is the fact that the matter is prescribed by legislation (§ 87 (1), introductory half provision, Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz, BetrVG ).

When and to what extent a statutory provision, which is binding on the employer, regulates the subject of co-determination both finally and with respect to content, the parties will not have any flexibility concerning arrangements and the works council will not have any co-decision right.

In the view of the BAG, the right of initiative cannot relate to the introduction of working time recording – the “whether”.

In this respect, employers already have a statutory duty to act.

Pursuant to § 3 (2) No. 1 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act ( Arbeitsschutzgesetz, ArbSchG ), employers are required to introduce a system that records the start, end and thus the duration of working times, including overtime at their sites.

According to the Court, this derives from the interpretation of this employee protection standard in line with EU law.

At its core, the BAG judgment provides that the duty to record working time applies expressly to all employees of a work within the meaning of § 5 (1) first sentence of the BetrVG.

However, the Court noted that the national legislator can adopt provisions that would exempt certain employees from the duty to record working time, providing any such provisions are in line with EU law.

This could be the case where the duration of the working time cannot be measured and/or is not predetermined due to special characteristics, or where the employees themselves can set the working time.

The duty is not limited to the introduction of a system to record working time, the use of which is optional for employees.

Instead, the system must actually be used.

However, responsibility for recording the working hours may be delegated to employees.

The BAG (initially) strengthened the co-decision and initiative rights of the works council with respect to arrangements for the protection of health under § 87 (1) No. 7 of the BetrVG.

Subject to any other future rules legislators may adopt, the works council has a right of initiative for the arrangements for the system to record working time.

As this also relates to the form of recording (manual or electronic) and the works council’s application in this case only covered the electronic recording of working time, the application was unsuccessful."
ADVANT Beiten,Federal Labour Court publishes judgment on the recording of working time – duty to act and co-decision right,"It limited the conciliation committee to only one possible form of implementation and, therefore, the committee potentially could not issue a (comprehensive) substantive decision on the form of working time recording.

Consequences for practice In the BAG’s view, employers are responsible for recording all working time under the current law.

There is no grace period: the duty already applies.

According to the reasoning of the judgment, where there is a works council, employers are also not free to decide alone whether to record working time with “paper and pencil” or electronically at the site.

In the absence of any binding requirements in accordance with § 3 (2) (1) of the ArbSchG, employers have some leeway when selecting and defining the system for recording working time, as long as the legislator has (still) not adopted any exhaustive provisions.

Employers can use this leeway when working with the works council in accordance with § 87 (1) No. 7 of the BetrVG to determine the particulars of recording working time, such as the “form” it should take.

In this respect, the BAG rejected a right of co-decision for the “whether” while strengthening the right with respect to “how”.

However, it is important to stress that the BAG assumes this is the “current” legal situation, which is subject to any further future rules adopted by legislators.

Whether the obligation to record working time also applies to executive employees is not entirely clear.

The present case only concerned the question of whether the duty relates to all employees of the work within the meaning of § 5 (1) first sentence of the BetrVG.

The Senate answered this question in the affirmative.

Some consider that the obligation does not apply to executive employees – based on an interpretation that is in line with EU law.

Whether this is correct in light of the current law and whether this is what the BAG intended, cannot be said conclusively yet.

However, as the BAG explained, the fact that the legislator has not yet adopted any special rules would generally support a different view.

Further, the fact that special rules apply for certain areas (e.g., employees in road haulage, the crew of vessels for inland waterways, seafarers under the Act on Employment at Sea and those working offshore) must also be considered.

Trust-based working hours can still be used.

However, any trust-based system must respect the relevant legislation and working time must be recorded.

Practical tip Employers should take the time now to analyse whether and to what extent there is (currently) a need to act within their operations before any expected legislative changes are adopted.

Employers should ascertain which employees are currently recording working times.

Depending on the outcome of this assessment, it could make sense to be cautious at the relevant sites and wait for the legislator to further elaborate on the obligation to record working time before negotiating and agreeing to a new works agreement – to the extent that there is a works council.

The expected new legislation could result in changes to the scope of potential arrangements and thus to the co-decision right as well.

This would make the “half-life” of any hastily negotiated works agreement on recording working time rather short.

A draft bill for the legislation should be presented in the first quarter of 2023.

There is also currently no risk of direct fines in the case of an infringement of the duty to record working time under § 3 (2) No. 1 of the ArbSchG because it (currently) does not constitute an offence.

The adoption by the Council took place on 28 November 2022.

The CSRD amends the Directives 2013/34/EU, 2004/109/EG and 2006/43/EG as well as the Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.

After the adoption by the Council, the CSRD will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force 20 days thereafter.

Subsequently, the member states will have to implement the CSRD within 18 months.

What Are Sustainability Aspects?

Art. 1 CSRD names here: the sustainability factors within the meaning of Art.

2 Number 24 of the Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, which include environmental, social and employee matters, the respect for human rights and combating corruption and bribery as well as governance factors.

Who is affected?

As of 1 January 2024: large entities of public interest (with more than 500 employees) which are already now subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (""NFDR""), the reporting obligation begins in 2025; As of 1 January 2025: large entities which are currently not subject to NFRD (an entity is considered to be large if it fulfils at least two of the following three criteria: more than 250 employees, revenue of more than EUR 40m and balance sheet total of more than EUR 20m), the reporting obligation begins in 2026; and As of 1 January 2026: listed SMEs and certain other entities, the reporting obligation for these begins in 2027, whereby SMEs can have themselves exempted from this obligation by 2028.

In addition, there will be reporting obligations for non-European entities if they achieve a net revenue of more than EUR 150m in the EU and if they have at least one branch or subsidiary in the EU.

ADVANT Beiten,"ECJ confirms Commission's action against selective tax advantages as state aid, but the path remains rocky","On November 08, 2022, the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union (EGC) of September 24, 2019 regarding the Luxemburg tax decision in favour of Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe (in short: FFT)/Commission (Joined Cases T-755/15 and T-759/15; on appeal C-885/19 P and C-898/19 P) and annulled the previous decision of the Commission of October 21, 2015 on State aid granted by Luxembourg to FFT.

While generally confirming the Commission's line of action, the ECJ based its decision on the fact that the Commission's assessment of the reference system and whether a selective advantage was granted to FFT had been carried out incorrectly.

The ruling continues the series of judicial review of the Commission's recent practice of considering tax advantages as aid.

On this matter see (German) Luxembourg Court upholds Commission's line on targeting selective tax benefits as aid, September 24, 2019 , (German) Combating tax evasion by looking at the Apple Ireland case, July 15, 2020, (German) Legal but unfair?

The road to greater tax justice via state aid law remains rocky, May 17, 2021, The background to the current appeal decision of the ECJ is the adaption of a tax ruling by Luxembourg tax authorities in favuor of FFT.

The European Commission determined in its decision of October 21, 2015 that the tax ruling constituted state aid incompatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU and in violation of the implementation prohibition under Article 108 (3) TFEU.

In its judgment of September 24, 2019, the EGC confirmed the Commission decision.

However, FFT now successfully sought the annulment of this judgment and the annulment of the Commission decision.

In its decision, the ECJ once again emphasized that a national measure constitutes State aid under four conditions: First, the measure must originate from a State or use State resources.

Second, the measure must be found to affect trade between Member States.

Third, the beneficiary must obtain a selective advantage through the measure, and fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition.

For the third condition relating to selective advantage, it is the Commission's task to first determine the relevant reference system.

Given the fiscal autonomy of the Member States, this is to be understood as the tax regulations under national law.

The Commission must then show that the measure in question derogates from the reference system by distinguishing between economic operators who are in a comparable factual and legal situation with regard to the objective pursued by the reference system.

It must also show that this distinction cannot be justified by the nature or general scheme of the reference system.

Advocate General Pikamäe found that the Commission decision and the judgment of the EGC were lawful, but the ECJ did not agree with this view.

It ruled that the Commission had erred in its examination by applying an incorrect arm's length principle outside the concretely applicable Luxembourg tax law.

On the one hand, the ECJ confirms the Commission's approach against selective tax advantages as State aid; on the other hand, the ruling shows that the ECJ examines the reasoning of the European Commission as well as of the EGC with meticulous care.

The determination of a tax advantage as State aid may have become more difficult in cases comparable to the Fiat case, but it cannot be ruled out.

ADVANT Beiten,Inflation relief bonus – overview and practical options,"The inflation relief bonus ( Inflationsausgleichsprämie ) allows employers to pay their employees a bonus of up to EUR 3,000 tax-free and free from social security costs before 31 December 2024.

In addition to the possibility to make a one-off payment to all employees, the rule provides further interesting options for employers.

This article explains the legal basis and what form those options might take.

Background The inflation relief bonus (also known as just the “inflation bonus”) is intended to give employers an incentive to pay their employees an additional bonus.

It is a tax-free amount for which social security also does not need to be paid.

The rule is comparable to the “Corona bonus”.

However, after having to extend the “Corona bonus” numerous times, legislators decided to provide a longer time period (more than 26 months) for the payment of an inflation bonus from the beginning.

Overview Established in the Income Tax Act (§ 3 No. 11c of the EStG), the key elements of the inflation relief bonus are: The payment must be voluntary, i.e., paid in addition to other bonuses and payments owed to employees.

Existing wage components (such as Christmas bonuses) may not be transformed into inflation bonuses.

The bonus may take the form of a cash payment or benefits in kind.

The payment must refer to inflation.

There are no specific requirements in this respect.

It will be sufficient, e.g., if pay slips indicate the inflation relief bonus.

The total tax-free amount may be split up into smaller payments.

However, all inflation bonus payments made between 26 October 2022 and 31 December 2024 will only be tax-free up to a total of EUR 3,000.

This tax-free amount applies to each employer.

Regardless of whether an employee has already received the full amount of the bonus from their old employer, a new employer can still pay the employee the full bonus.

As with other additional benefits, the works council must be involved and the employment law principles of equal treatment and the effectiveness of voluntary payments must be respected.

Employers bound by a collective agreement should also assess whether the agreement grants employees an entitlement to the payment of an inflation relief bonus, or if such an entitlement is planned.

Options One-time payment or staggered payments The bonus may be paid as a one-time payment (one payment of a maximum of EUR 3,000), or as various smaller payments made over the period until 31 December 2024.

The employer may also split the amount over the whole period, e.g., pay a monthly amount of EUR 125 from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024.

A staggered arrangement is also possible, such as a monthly payment of EUR 100 per month in 2023, increasing to EUR 150 per month in 2024.

This effectively allows employers to use the tax-free amount for wage increases that are pending but not yet binding, and generate “more net from the gross pay,” at least until 31 December 2024.

To ensure the amount is tax-free, the increase must be temporary until 31 December 2024, and it must be identified as the inflation relief bonus.

It might be beneficial for those starting a job with a new company to agree to a lower basic salary until 31 December 2024, which would then be supplemented by the inflation bonus.

Such an arrangement could be very attractive for both employers and employees towards the end of the period of validity – the end of 2024.

All the same or difference Generally, employers are neither required to pay an inflation relief bonus nor to favour all employees in the same way.

The employment law principle of equal treatment allows for differential treatment.

As with other benefits (e.g., bonus payments), any such differential treatment requires an objective reason.

The following differences could be possible, for example: Key date rule: Only employees who have an employment contract that has not been terminated at the time of the payment will receive a bonus."
ADVANT Beiten,Inflation relief bonus – overview and practical options,"The following differences could be possible, for example: Key date rule: Only employees who have an employment contract that has not been terminated at the time of the payment will receive a bonus.

Differences based on salary groups: The inflation relief bonus can be higher for lower salary groups.

Higher salary groups can even be excluded.

When the difference between the salary groups are not that big, a sliding scale should be adopted (the higher the basic salary, the lower the inflation bonus).

Cash payment or payment in kind Even though the public debate about the inflation relief bonus has focused on cash payments, employers can pay the tax-free amount of EUR 3,000 in other benefits (e.g., vouchers for petrol, goods, or food).

The financial advantage is tax-free and free from social security payments.

It is also possible to split the bonus between cash payments and payments in kind.

Summary If you look more closely at the inflation relief bonus, various options are available to employers.

The basic principles of employment law and the rights of the works council must be respected when implementing the bonus.

If employers have questions, they should seek legal advice.

However, in view of the long period of validity, every employer should be able to find a way to use the inflation relief bonus for their benefit.

ADVANT Beiten,Limitation period for (payment in lieu of) leave entitlements despite employer’s failure to put the employee in a position to take their leave?,"Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 22 September 2022 in case C-120/21

The calendar year is drawing to a close.

For employers and employees, the focus moves to leave entitlements.

How many days of leave are left?

When do they have to be taken?

What does the company have to do in this respect?

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has already clarified the legal situation in this area of law, e.g., in its judgment on the obligations of employers to enable employees to take their leave.

The ECJ has now tightened its jurisprudence on this issue.

Facts of the case After the termination of the employment relationship, the employee claimed payment in lieu of 101 days of leave that she had not taken during the five previous years.

The employer refused to pay, claiming that the limitation period had expired.

At first instance, the Labour Court held largely in favour of the employer.

On appeal, the District Labour Court granted the employee payment in lieu of the leave because the employer had failed to fulfil its obligations and enable the employee to take her leave in each case.

The Federal Labour Court stayed the proceedings and submitted the matter to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on the question of whether the European rules on appropriate working conditions preclude the application of the German limitation periods where the employer fails to put the employee in a position to actually take their leave by informing them of their leave entitlements and inviting the employee to use them.

The judgment The ECJ answered this question in the affirmative.

The limitation periods established in the German Civil Code limit an employee’s right to paid annual leave under Article 7 of Directive 2003/88/EC and Article 31 (2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The limitation periods pursue the employer’s legitimate objective of ensuring legal certainty.

However, in the view of the Court, this interest will no longer be legitimate where the employer has failed to inform the employee of their leave entitlements and is therefore responsible for the fact that the employee has not taken their leave and is now making a retroactive request for (payment in lieu of) leave entitlements from such a long time ago.

In such a situation, employers may not benefit from their reliance on the limitation periods.

European law provisions, therefore, preclude reliance on the national limitation periods where they apply irrespective of whether the employer has actually put the employee in the position to take their leave by informing the employee about their leave entitlements.

Consequences for practice The judgment again accentuates the effect of an employer’s failure to inform its workers of their leave entitlements.

In such cases, employers cannot rely on limitation periods.

Practical tip For many companies, the obligation imposed on employers by the ECJ case law to inform employees of their untaken leave entitlements is still a low priority.

However, this judgment of the ECJ shows the wide-reaching (financial) consequences of the failure to comply with this obligation.

Employers should therefore ensure without delay that they are complying with the obligations imposed by the ECJ with respect to informing employees of their leave entitlements and about the expiration of such entitlements.

This obligation can be fulfilled, for example, by hanging a notice on a notice board about payroll processing or speaking to employees directly.

ADVANT Beiten,The 11th Amendment to the Act against Restraints of Competition: Paradigm Shift in Antitrust Law,"With the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and the considerable price increases for fuels in Germany, an intense public discussion began on how the Federal Government can legally record 'silent' coordination of behaviour between companies (especially in transparent, oligopolistically structured markets).

Against this background, the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate (BMWK) presented a first draft on 26 September 2022 to tighten competition law and strengthen the Federal Cartel Office (""Competition Enforcement Act"").

The explanatory memorandum to the draft states: ""Where the market structure stands in the way of competition, for example because there are only a few suppliers in the market and parallel price developments are regularly observed to the detriment of consumers, the intervention instruments of antitrust law are to be strengthened.""

Accordingly, the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) is to be given powers equivalent to those of a regulator to intervene in market and corporate structures even even with regard to companies which have neither committed a cartel infringement nor are planning a merger and have not behaved in an abusive manner - a paradigm shift in antitrust law, where the cost-by-cause principle previously applied.

According to the draft bill the FCO is to be strengthened in 3 areas: in conducting sector inquiries and imposition of measures thereafter, in the enforcement of the Digital Market Act and in the disgorgement of advantages.

The first hearings on the draft are going to take place as early as October so that a speedy legislative process and adoption before the end of this year can be expected.

The fact that the next, 12th amendment to the Act against Restraint of Competition (ARC) has already been announced by the BMWK for next year also speaks in favour of a quick adoption.

Thus, almost 1.5 years after the 10th ARC amendment came into force, two further amendments are already in the pipeline of the Ministry.

Details of the proposed 11th ARC amendment: I. Follow-up and streamlining measures to the sector inquiry With the instrument of sector inquiries the FCO investigates and analyses the structures and conditions of competition in specific sectors of the economy.

These market studies are not based on the suspicion of a cartel infringement and are not directed against individual companies.

Rather, it is a procedure for gaining knowledge with the possibility of subsequently carrying out cartel proceedings against specific companies on the basis of possible antitrust infringements.

The FCO is, for example, currently conducting such investigation in the fuel markets.

The draft bill provides for a strengthening of these inquiries.

In the future the FCO will be able to order measures and remedies following a sector inquiry (which may now only take a maximum of 18 months) without having established a specific infringement of the law by a market participant.

The only prerequisite for ordering remedies is that the FCO has identified a significant, lasting or repeated disturbance of competition on at least one market or across markets.

The remedies that follow can be behavioural and structural, with non-abuse unbundling (widely called for on both sides of the Atlantic) provided for as an ultima ratio.

The draft provides, inter alia, for measures relating to: granting access to data, interfaces, networks or other facilities, supplying other companies, including the granting of rights to use intellectual property, official or comparable approvals or permits, the supply relationships between undertakings on the markets concerned and at different market levels, common norms and standards, the organisational separation of company or business divisions.

It shall also be possible for the FCO to impose requirements on certain types of contracts or contractual arrangements including contractual provisions on the disclosure of information."
ADVANT Beiten,The 11th Amendment to the Act against Restraints of Competition: Paradigm Shift in Antitrust Law,"It shall also be possible for the FCO to impose requirements on certain types of contracts or contractual arrangements including contractual provisions on the disclosure of information.

This catalogue is not exhaustive, so that all measures necessary for restoring effective competition are in principle to be available to the FCO.

With the exception of unbundling , the measures are not ranked in a specific order so that considerable legal uncertainty for companies which comply with (cartel) law can be expected.

This applies all the more as the draft does not specify against whom the measures are to be directed.

The only criterion so far is the necessity of the specific measure for the elimination or reduction of the distortion of competition - an indeterminate legal concept that requires considerable further clarification of both, courts and authorities.

II.

Extension of the FCO's powers to enforce the Digital Market Act and Private Enforcement Originally, a similar and equally far-reaching regulatory instrument was envisaged for the European Commission at a European level (""New Competition Tool"").

This proposal ultimately gave way to the Digital Markets Act (""DMA"").

The DMA, which will come into force on 1 November 2022, is a European regulation designed to ensure that digital markets where gatekeepers (i.e. companies that control market access for others due to their market power and network effects) are and remain contestable, i.e. that other market players can exert competitive pressure on these gatekeepers, and to ensure fairness and a level playing field for players in digital markets in the EU.

The draft bill on the 11th amendment to the ARC provides that in the future the FCO may investigate possible infringements of the DMA and for this purpose also make use of the investigative powers available to it in the event of suspected infringements of antitrust law.

This will enable the FCO on the one hand to support the European Commission in enforcing the DMA and on the other hand to generate synergies for the enforcement of national supervision of gatekeepers, which is regulated in section 19a ARC.

Since the DMA is to be enforced not only by public authorities but also by private parties (by means of actions for injunctive relief and damages) (private enforcement), according to the draft bill, the simplifications that have so far applied to antitrust damages actions will in the future also apply to claims for the enforcement of rights and obligations under the DMA - undoubtedly an advantage for Germany as a place of jurisdiction and a new danger for companies that are addressees of the DMA. III.

Reduction of the requirements for the levy of benefits Courts and authorities have so far hardly ever ordered disgorgement due to the high standard of proof required.

To change this, the draft bill provides that in the future the requirement of fault will be deleted altogether.

In addition, the period during which disgorgement may be orderedf will be extended to 10 years after the infringement has ended.

Particularly interesting is the introduction of (rebuttable) statutory presumptions, whereby it is presumed that the cartel infringement resulted in an advantage for the undertaking concerned this advantage amounts to at least 1% of the worldwide group turnover of the goods and services concerned.

IV.

Initial Evaluation

As a first step in implementing its competition policy agenda published in February, the BMWK wishes to strengthen the FCO's powers of intervention and lower the requirements for various instruments and claims.

The skimming off of advantages in particular is likely to be used increasingly by the FCO in the coming years and to have a deterrent effect on companies."
ADVANT Beiten,The 11th Amendment to the Act against Restraints of Competition: Paradigm Shift in Antitrust Law,"The skimming off of advantages in particular is likely to be used increasingly by the FCO in the coming years and to have a deterrent effect on companies.

Since some anti-competitive phenomena of the 21st century - especially in digital markets, which are particularly susceptible to concentrations of power due to strong network and scale effects - cannot (or can no longer) be controlled with the existing antitrust toolbox, the BMWK deliberately breaks with the existing antitrust doctrine and gives the FCO quasi-regulatory powers.

It remains to be hoped, however, that in the course of the legislative process the decisive issues of the preconditions and the legal consequences will be clarified in such a way that legal uncertainty will be reduced.

To this end, more specific requirements can be introduced for both definitions of individual characteristics or preconditions (e.g. for the term ""significant, persistent or repeated distortion of competition"") and the legal consequences (e.g. who can be affected by a measure after a sector inquiry has been carried out).

ADVANT Beiten,"The Digital Services Act – ""A new Sheriff in Town""","Thierry Breton, EU Commissioner for Internal Market, announced the Digital Services Act (""DSA""), which is intended to harmonise regulations on the internet at EU level, with the pictorial comparison of ""a new sheriff in town"".

It has been 20 years since the EU first laid down a basic legal framework for the regulation of the internet – namely the eCommerce Directive of 2000.

Since then, it has been the Member States who took the lead on making the internet a safer or at least better place – however, on national level (e.g. in Germany with the Network Enforcement Act).

This led to regulations regarding the internet being very inconsistent across the EU.

From a business perspective, at times there was the impression of a fragmentation of the ""European Internet"".

Therefore, the EU Parliament and eventually the EU Council on October 4, 2022 approved the DSA.

Other than hoped by some and feared by others, the DSA is not a ""constitutional law for platforms"".

Rather it contains basic rules for the so-called intermediary services providers.

The underlying idea of the DSA is: ""What is illegal offline, should be illegal online"".

At first glance, this sounds like an obvious truism, and in fact the regulations of the DSA are more of a tightening up or standardisation of regulations that already exist in many member states.

However, many new obligations have been added with the real novelty being the possibility of initiating sanctions against companies along with a system of fines modelled on the GDPR).

To whom the DSA applies The DSA is aimed at ""intermediary services providers"" who offer their services in the EU.

This includes, for example, internet providers, cloud services and content sharing platforms, but also social networks, app stores and online marketplaces.

The extent of regulation depends on the respective type of intermediary service.

A distinction is made between the pure transmission of data (""mere conduit""), transmission with short-term intermediate storage (""caching"") and ""hosting"", with the special case of online platforms.

The strictest regulations apply to ""very large online platforms"" and ""very large online search engines"".

Areas of regulation of the DSA – Harmonising Limited Liability Exemptions and establishing Due Diligence Obligations At first, the DSA establishes a standardised legal framework for the conditional exemption from liability of intermediary service providers for the data or content they transmit.

The exemption is mainly based on the knowledge of the intermediary services providers of the illegality of the content.

Due Diligence Obligations applying to All Intermediary Services

The DSA furthermore lists obligations of the intermediary services providers, some of which are very detailed.

Providers of intermediary services must act against illegal content when ordered to do so by the relevant national judicial or administrative authority.

However, there neither a general duty of the intermediary services providers to monitor all information, nor are they obliged to actively search for facts indicating illegal activities without prior indications.

Intermediary services providers are required to establish a single point of contact for direct communication with the authorities and the Commission, as well as a point of contact enabling the users of the service to communicate directly and rapidly with the services providers.

Additional information will need to be provided in the terms and conditions of the services providers.

This will ensure the fundamental rights of users, such as freedom of expression, freedom and pluralism of the media, and other fundamental rights are adequately reflected in the terms and conditions.

The information shall cover restrictions on content as well as the policies, procedures and tools used for content moderation, as well as the internal procedures for handling complaints."
ADVANT Beiten,"The Digital Services Act – ""A new Sheriff in Town""","The information shall cover restrictions on content as well as the policies, procedures and tools used for content moderation, as well as the internal procedures for handling complaints.

Where the intermediary service is primarily directed at or used by minors, the terms and conditions must explain the conditions for and restrictions on the use of the service in a way minors can understand.

For providers of intermediary services of any kind, it is advisable to review their general terms and conditions at an early stage according to these standards.

There are now also transparency obligations (e.g. annual reports) for all services providers.

The scope of this obligation varies depending on the type of intermediation service.

Specific Obligations for Hosting Services (including Online Platforms)

Providers of hosting services must implement notice and action mechanisms.

These must include a report function for illegal content which is easily accessible for users.

If restrictions are imposed on user content or behaviour, the services provider must give a clear and specific statement of reasons for the restrictions to any affected recipient of the service.

If a hosting provider becomes aware of any information that gives rise to the suspicion of a criminal offence involving a threat to the life or safety of a person, the provider must inform the relevant authorities.

Special Category: Online Platforms Online platforms, such as social networks or online marketplaces, are defined as providers of hosting services that not only store information provided by the recipients of the service but also disseminate such information to the public at the recipient's request.

Such online platforms will have further obligations.

Online platforms must establish an internal complaint procedure and out-of-court dispute resolution.

They shall process notices about illegal content given by ""trusted flaggers"" without undue delay.

The DSA entails detailed provisions on how to deal with users that frequently provide manifestly illegal content.

New transparency obligations apply for advertising on online platforms.

Generally, users need to be provided with information about the advertiser and the person who paid for the advertising.

Online platform providers using ""recommender systems"" must inform users about the main parameters they use for these recommender systems and what options users have to modify or influence these parameters.

This should be detailed in the platform's terms and conditions.

Online platforms must not present advertising based on profiling that uses ""sensitive"" personal data, as defined in Art. 9 of the GDPR.

This may even apply where the user has consented to the processing of their personal data.

Personalised advertising based on profiling to minors must not be presented by online platforms where they are reasonably certain the user is a minor.

Online platform providers should review functions such as ""recommended for you"" or similar.

Such algorithm-based suggestions often process user profiles for the purposes of personalised advertising within the meaning of the DSA.

The DSA expressly prohibits the use of ""dark pattern"", i.e. application interfaces that interfere with users' free decision-making, for example, by displaying different sizes of consent and rejection options.

Where a platform allows consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders, the platform must ensure traders are traceable and must therefore collect specific information about the trader's identity.

For very large online platforms having in average at least 45 million EU users per month, even more comprehensive transparency obligations apply.

They must give their users the possibility to refuse recommendations based on profiling.

They must establish risk management systems and meet specific compliance requirements."
ADVANT Beiten,"The Digital Services Act – ""A new Sheriff in Town""","They must give their users the possibility to refuse recommendations based on profiling.

They must establish risk management systems and meet specific compliance requirements.

And they must be publicly accountable for meeting these requirements and will be subject to annual independent audits.

In a crisis (such as war), very large online platforms may be subject to further obligations.

These requirements also apply to very large search engines.

Enforcement and Sanctions Non-compliance with the DSA can be punished with heavy fines of up to six percent of the group's annual turnover.

The competent national authority of the member state in whose territorial jurisdiction the intermediary services provider falls is responsible for enforcing the regulations of the DSA and imposing the respective fines.

In the case of very large online platforms/very large search engines, the responsibility here lies with the Commission.

Companies will not only be subject to obligations if they are providers of any kind of intermediary services; they will now have the possibility to take better action against illegal content or illegal products (for example, counterfeit products, etc.).

The new regulations will probably apply from February 2024 and even earlier for very large online platforms.

It remains to be seen whether and how the ""new sheriff"" will ensure better control and security online.

ADVANT Beiten,Competence of the General Works Council in the case of uniform use of Microsoft Office 365 within the company,"German Federal Labour Court (BAG) as of 08 March 2022 – 1 ABR 20/21 The BAG strengthens the competence of the general works council for the introduction and use of technical facilities in the case of uniform company administration and data storage (e.g. Microsoft Office 365).

Summary of Facts The employer intended to introduce and use Microsoft's Office 365 software package in all its offices.

The use of the software was to be in the form of a single-tenant solution.

For this, it was planned that the entire company for electronic data processing would be managed as a uniform client (tenant) with a central administration, and data created and collected during use would be stored in a uniform cloud.

The general works council agreed to the company-wide use of the software package.

A local works council, however, considered the general works council to be incompetent and requested that its own competence be established for parts of the software package.

Decision The BAG strengthens the competence of the general works council and states - as did the Cologne Regional Labour Court before - that the general works council is responsible for exercising the right of co-determination pursuant to Section 87 (1) no. 6 of the Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz - BetrVG) in the case of the company-wide introduction and use of Microsoft Office 365.

The Office 365 software package is a technical device within the meaning of Section 87 (1) no. 6 BetrVG.

When using the desktop applications and the individual services of the software package, data is generat-ed or collected that can be used to monitor the performance and behaviour of employees.

In the opinion of the BAG, the uniform company administration of the software with centrally assigned administration rights enables centralised control of the behaviour and performance of employees in all company establishments.

For compelling technical reasons, this central monitoring option requires an inter-company regulation.

It is irrele-vant that user-specific settings can be made for individual modules or that company-specific regulations can be made for the use of individual modules.

The principle of separation of competences requires the exclusive competence of the general works council.

Consequences in practice The BAG's decision is appreciated.

It strengthens the primary competence of the general works councils and group works councils with regard to the introduction and use of software packages at company or group level.

As a general rule, local works councils are primarily responsible for exercising co-determination rights under works constitution law.

If, however, matters affect several establishments or the company as a whole and regulations must be made on a compulsory basis for all establishments, the general works council has the primary responsibility for exercising co-determination rights.

This also applies accordingly to the primary competence of the group works council.

The thresholds for a primary competence of the general or group works council are high.

Negotiations and the conclusion of agreements with these bodies therefore regularly require delega-tions from the local works councils.

The BAG also emphasises the principle of separation of competences, according to which the regulation of a matter is either the exclusive responsibility of the individual works councils, the general works council or the group works council.

This creates legal certainty that even with regard to individual modules of a software package, negotiations do not have to be conducted with several bodies at different levels.

This means that there is no need to negotiate with several local works councils, but one body is responsible for the whole company or group."
ADVANT Beiten,Competence of the General Works Council in the case of uniform use of Microsoft Office 365 within the company,"This means that there is no need to negotiate with several local works councils, but one body is responsible for the whole company or group.

Practical advice The decision shows once again that by designing the framework conditions of technical facilities, especially with regard to administration rights, storage options and control powers, influence can be exerted on the body responsible for negotiations.

Decisions of employers to create uniform technical framework conditions are respected by the BAG even if it would be technically possible to create them individually for each establishment.

These design options should therefore be considered in advance with regard to the body to be involved and used if necessary.

Framework (general) company agreements that provide framework regulations for further modules or updates required at a later date are also a useful variant to simplify negotiations on the introduction and use of technical facilities, such as complex software packages.

ADVANT Beiten,Amount of Compensation Payment in Case of Post-Contractual Non-Compete Obligation,"German Federal Labour Court as of 25 August 2022 – 8 AZR 453/21

When an employment relationship ends, so does the employer's non-compete obligation.

Employees are then able to use their practical knowledge for a competitor.

In order to prevent a competitive set-up later down the line, employers often opt for a post-contractual non-competition obligation.

The condition precedent is, most notably, a compensation payment for the time of the obligation, a non-competition compensation (""Karenzentschädigung"").

Again and again, disputes arise in connection with the post-contractual non-competition obligation and with the amount of the non-competition compensation.

Now the German Federal Labour Court was asked to decide whether so-called Restricted Stock Units (""RSUs"") granted by the parent company have to be considered when it comes to the amount of the non-competition compensation.

Case Background

The claimant was employed by the company from 2012 until January of 2020.

In the employment agreement, the parties agreed on a nine-month post-contractual non-competition obligation according to which the employer undertook to pay a non-competition compensation.

The amount of non-competition compensation agreed was ""half of the last contractual benefits received"".

Under a separate agreement, the employee took part in a share ownership programme (RSU programme) of the US parent company.

The employer took on the calculation of RSUs already transferred and settled everything with the parent company internally.

Under the title ""Summary of the Personal Remuneration"", the employer informed the employee about the expected amount of remuneration for the year of 2019, which consisted of a basic salary and the current value of the RSUs expected to become due in the calendar year.

In an ""informative overview"", the employer explained that the RSUs are provided by the parent company and will not be considered for the calculation of the post-contractual non-competition compensation.

In October of 2019, the employment relationship was terminated by means of a settlement agreement.

In deviation from agreements between the employee and the parent company, it provided that all RSUs still due for 2019 will be transferred to the employee despite the release from work.

After leaving the company, the employer received the agreed non-competition compensation.

By means of the action, the employee sought a non-competition compensation which was calculated by taking into consideration the RSUs granted in the three-year period before leaving.

The Decision The Federal Labour Court decided that the employee does not have any claim to a higher non-competition compensation.

The court held that RSUs were no ""contractual benefits"" as defined in the contractual agreement.

The term ""contractual benefits"" only covered benefits which are based on the interchangeability of the employment contract und which the employer owes the employee as remuneration for performed work.

The agreements on the granting of the RSUs were made with the parent company.

Taking the RSUs into account when calculating the non-competition compensation requires that the employer has assumed an (co-)obligation.

Such an obligation does not arise, in particular, from the fact that the employer took care of all taxation and administrative matters for the parent company with regard to the RSUs.

Practical Implications

The amount of the non-competition compensation must reach half of the last contractual benefits received by the employee for each year of the obligation.

Here, the following principally applies: the more far-reaching the obligation, the higher the compensation payment in order to be fully binding.

All remuneration payments actually received by the employee for the work performed, i.e. all benefits in cash and in kind (e.g. annual remuneration, bonus payments, holiday allowances) are taken into account when calculating the compensation payment."
ADVANT Beiten,Amount of Compensation Payment in Case of Post-Contractual Non-Compete Obligation,"Depending on whether fixed wages or variable remuneration components are concerned, different points in time or periods are decisive for the calculation.

After this judgment it is clear that when the amount of the non-competition compensation is calculated, benefits paid by third parties, like, in particular, RSUs granted by the parent company, are not taken into account, unless the parties have agreed otherwise.

Practical Advice Offering the prospect of RSUs is a popular means to motivate employees to stay with the group, create financially attractive incentives for company loyalty and, at the same time, also enough performance incentive.

Employers should be careful to not assume liability for RSUs granted by third parties - in particular the parent company -, as this can have significant financial consequences.

Liability is not accepted already when the employer has influence on the content of the ""if"" of the granting, the criteria or the amount of the remuneration (e.g. by assessments or propositions).

If the contractual obligation only exists between the employee and the parent company, it is a difficult process for the employee to enforce claims, especially because in many cases parent companies, like here, have their seat abroad and therefore other jurisdictions apply.

ADVANT Beiten,Spectacular Turn of Events in Erfurt: Employers are Now Obliged to Record Staff's Working Hours After All,"German Federal Labour Court as of 13 September 2022 – 1 ABR 22/21 It is safe to say that this is the most important decision of the year in labour law and a true surprise for the companies: the Federal Labour Court (BAG) made it clear that all employers are obliged to record the working hours of their employees irrespective of whether there is a works council or not.

Case Background

The proceedings were originally about the scope of the co-determination rights of the works council.

The employer and the works council were in dispute over whether the works council had the right to pro-actively request the introduction of electronic time recordings.

Negotiations between the parties regarding the conclusion of a company agreement on working time recording were behind the dispute.

The employer had even purchased the hardware required for recording time electronically already.

When the company decided not to introduce time recording after all, however, and the negotiations with the works council were abandoned, the works council was set on obtaining confirmation by court that it has a right of initiative regarding the introduction of an electronic time-recording system.

The BAG had already rejected such right of initiative with reference to the purpose of the statute in 1989.

The Regional Labour Court of Hamm, however, opposed this decision with judgement dated 27 July 2021 (7 TaBV 79/20) stating that works councils were indeed allowed to request the introduction of electronic time recording on their own initiatives.

The employer lodged a legal appeal against this.

While this appeal was generally successful, the BAG bases its decision on completely different reasons than in 1989 and is therefore expected to cause far-reaching repercussions for the day-to-day running of businesses.

The Decision The BAG determined that companies are legally obliged to record working hours based on the application of the Occupational Safety and Health Act in compliance with European law alone.

Therefore, this judgement constitutes an aftermath of the highly publicised ECJ ruling dated 14 May 2019 in the matter CCOO versus Deutsche Bank SAE (C-55/18) which obliges the member states to introduce statutory provisions for recording working hours.

The BAG had already addressed this ruling only a few month ago when it determined that the considerations of the ECJ do not make a difference when it comes to the burden of proof in lawsuits concerning overtime hours ( 4 May 2022 - 5 AZR 359/21 ).

The following still applies: if an employee wants to bring an action regarding the payment of overtime work, the employee continues to be obliged to present and prove the overtime hours worked as well as the employer's orders to work overtime.

Practical Implications Even though it does not appear so at first glance, the decision also contains good news for employers.

For it leads to legal clarity for companies, as it rejects the extension of the co-determination rights of the works council in an important regard.

It has now been determined that work councils do not have a right of initiative and, therefore, cannot demand the introduction of electronic time-recording systems against the will of the companies.

According to the press release, the BAG does not require the employer to record time technologically or electronically either.

It must only meet the requirements of the ECJ which requires an objective, reliable and accessible system to record time.

Practical Advice and Outlook Employers are now obligated to introduce a system with which they can record the hours worked by their employees.

In our view, however, this does not mean a comeback of time clocks nor the end of trust-based working time.

It will still be possible for companies to delegate the documentation of working time to the employees with regular plausibility checks probably being required."
ADVANT Beiten,Spectacular Turn of Events in Erfurt: Employers are Now Obliged to Record Staff's Working Hours After All,"It will still be possible for companies to delegate the documentation of working time to the employees with regular plausibility checks probably being required.

If and in how far the BAG will make more detailed specifications in this regard remains to be seen.

In addition, employers - if not already done - should set clear regulations for ordering and working potential overtime hours to avoid potential lawsuits concerning overtime hours.

It will also be interesting to watch whether the German legislator, who was ""overtaken"" by the BAG with this decision, will dare to approach the very important topic ""Reform of laws on working hours"" pursuant to the specifications of the coalition agreement.

In order to cast these changes into German law, the German government has planned respective amendments to the German Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz).

These amendments will, in particular, reform the current procedure for the transfer of a German limited liability company, a GmbH, to another EU member state.

At first glance, this cross-border company conversion will become more complex and difficult.

It might therefore be a lucrative option for shareholders of German GmbHs to initiate a cross-border conversion this year, i.e. before the amendments will come into force.

I. Overview of the Essential Amendments On 6 July 2022, the Federal Cabinet adopted the draft of an Act to Implement the Conversion Directive (UmRUG-RegE).

This government draft continues the implementation of the Directive on Cross-Border Conversions, Mergers and Divisions (Company Conversion Directive, UmwRL) as a part of the so-called Company Law Package of the EU.

The objective of the Company Conversion Directive is to create uniform regulations for cross-border transformation activities for corporations (limited liability company (GmbH), public limited company (AG), partnership limited by shares (KGaA)) within the EU.

This standardisation of legal requirements is complemented by a comprehensive EU effort to digitally interconnect national commercial registers and enable companies to transfer to other EU countries with legal certainty.

II.

Company Conversion of a German Limited Liability Company The cross-border company conversion means the transfer of a corporation founded under the laws of one EU member state to a legal form under the laws of another EU member state.

Figuratively speaking, the corporation takes off its German legal dress and exchanges it for that of another EU member state.

One form of cross-border conversion that we frequently assist with is the transformation of a German GmbH into a Dutch B.V. ( Besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid ) or into a Luxembourg S.à r.l.

( Société à responsabilité limitée ).

The adaptation of the regulations in the EU is accompanied by a number of innovations for this cross-border conversion, involving more steps and a more complex procedure.

Due to the additional submission and waiting periods we expect that the cross-border conversion of a German GmbH to another European country will take longer in the future.

The now codified procedure consists of two steps.

Once the prerequisites for the conversion in Germany have been met, the company must be registered in its new legal form in the register of the destination state in compliance with the relevant foundation regulations.

1.

Conversion Report Once the shareholders have decided on a cross-border company conversion, the management must first prepare a Conversion Report.

This Conversion Report must illustrate the economic and legal effects of the cross-border company conversion for the GmbH, the shareholders and the employees.

In particular, the management must describe the effects of the cross-border conversion on the future business activities of the company and its subsidiaries, if any.

In case the GmbH has multiple shareholders, the report further must explain how the company conversion affects the shareholders' legal positions.

The Conversion Report must be made available to the shareholders electronically six weeks prior to the resolution on the conversion.

2. Conversion Plan In the future, the management will additionally have to draw up a Conversion Plan.

The Conversion Plan constitutes the core of the cross-border conversion and contains its key points.

These are, in addition to the company name and the registered office of the new legal form, an indicative timetable for the cross-border conversion."
ADVANT Beiten,Government Draft on the German Transformation Act: Will the Quick Cross-Border Company Conversion Come to an End?,"These are, in addition to the company name and the registered office of the new legal form, an indicative timetable for the cross-border conversion.

The Conversion Plan must be notarially recorded one month prior to the resolution of consent by the shareholders and subsequently be submitted to the registration court with a request for publication.

Only in a second step, upon expiry of the month, shareholders may approve the Conversion Plan in a shareholders' meeting.

3. Examination Report If the GmbH has more than one shareholder, in the future also a Conversion Examination must be performed.

Previously, such an examination was only required in the case of mergers.

The examination must be carried out by one or more experts, checking the information in the Conversion Plan for completeness and correctness.

After the examination, the conversion examiners will prepare an Examination Report.

Also, the Examination Report must be made available to the shareholders one month before the shareholders' meeting.

If the GmbH has multiple shareholders and these do not waive the Conversion Examination in a notarially recorded form, this requirement may delay the cross-border conversion consid-erably.

4. Conversion Resolution Once the Conversion Plan, the Conversion Report and, if necessary, the Examination Report have been made available to the shareholders meeting the respective deadlines the shareholders vote in a notarially recorded shareholders' meeting on the cross-border conversion.

A qualified majority of 75% of the votes cast must be in favour of the cross-border company conversion.

Then the management of the company must register the resolved conversion with the commercial register and apply for the issuance of a so-called Conversion Certificate.

5. Examination by the Registration Court Another important change regarding the cross-border company conversion is the now required verification of lawfulness by the registration court.

In the future, the registration court will examine all the procedural steps and formalities described above.

Only after completion of the examination will the registration court issue the Conversion Certificate.

It certifies that all relevant requirements have been met in Germany.

The Conversion Certificate is required for the registration of the company in the destination state.

The German registration court transmits the Conversion Certificate electronically to the competent register in the destination state.

In the future, in addition to checking the documents, the registration court will also carry out a check for abusive practices.

If there are any indications, the court will examine whether the cross-border conversion is planned for abusive or fraudulent purposes.

The examination by the registration court can lead to considerable delays in the conversion.

Although the Act provides for an examination period of three months, it remains to be seen whether the registration courts will reach the limits of their capacity in view of the newly introduced procedures for cross-border conversions, mergers and divisions.

6. Blockade by Creditors The reform of the German Transformation Act also legally regulates that, in the future, creditors of the GmbH can interrupt the registration of the cross-border conversion by filing an action for a security provision.

Thus, creditors who can credibly demonstrate that they are entitled to a claim against the GmbH which arose prior to the publication of the conversion, and which has become due after the publication, can prevent the cross-border conversion, if the conversion endangers the settlement of the outstanding claim.

Creditors must assert their claim for security in court within three months of the publication of the conversion by the registration court.

7. Relocation to the Member State

The new registration of the company can then be filed with the competent register of the destination state."
ADVANT Beiten,Government Draft on the German Transformation Act: Will the Quick Cross-Border Company Conversion Come to an End?,"7. Relocation to the Member State

The new registration of the company can then be filed with the competent register of the destination state.

In addition to observing the formation provisions of the respective destination state, the company will have to submit the Conversion Certificate issued by the German registration court to the register of the destination state.

In this respect, the register of the destination state is bound by the findings of the Conversion Certificate.

This will simplify and accelerate the entry of the company in the register of the destination state in the future.

The cross-border conversion becomes effective upon entry in the register of the destination state.

Once the company is registered in the destination state, the register of the destination state will notify the German commercial register of the entry so that the German register can delete the company from the German commercial register with reference to the conversion.

8.

Transitional Arrangements The government draft of the Act to Implement the Conversion Directive (UmRUG-RegE) provides for a transitional period for cross-border conversions that were resolved by the company before 31 January 2023 and filed with the registration court before 31 December 2023.

During this transitional period, the cross-border conversion is still possible in accordance with the former legal provisions.

9.

Conclusion Thus, in the future there will be legal certainty for the shareholders and the registration courts for cross-border conversions.

This is welcome, as the procedure for cross-border conversions currently depends to a large extent on how the respective registration courts apply the rules in practice.

The downside of the ensuing legal certainty in the European Economic Area is the expected prolongation of the procedure.

This can be combined with higher costs for the company due to growing expenses.

III.

Outlook The Conversion Directive is to be transposed into national law by 31 January 2023.

IV.

Last Chance for a quick Cross-border Company Conversion?

The welcome harmonisation of European conversion law reforms the current legal situation in Germany.

However, due to the increased complexity and the newly introduced procedural steps, cross-border conversions will take longer once the amendments come into force, especially in the first period after the amendment.

To avoid application of the amendments to the Act regarding a cross-border conversions, it may be advisable to initiate the cross-border conversion this year so that the conversion can be completed in accordance with the current legal situation.

We will be pleased to advise you on whether it is reasonable for your GmbH to convert to another European country before the end of the year.

ADVANT Beiten,The revised Coronavirus Occupation Health and Safety Regulation in a nutshell,"Faithful to the “tried and tested” motto On 31 August 2022, the Federal Cabinet adopted a new Occupational Health and Safety Regulation for Dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 Virus (Corona-ArbSchV).

The revised law gives employers responsibility for implementing the measures.

There is no longer any obligation to implement specific measures.

The flu season will soon be upon us.

Occupational health and safety measures are needed to protect workers against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The Omicron variant has been circulating in Germany since January 2022 but has resulted in proportionately fewer serious illnesses.

However, the total number of those with the virus was ten times higher in Sumer 2022 compared to the past two summers.

In response to the rate of infection with the Omicron variant, for which vaccinated persons have also tested positive multiple times, and the resulting high levels of illness in the workforce, the Federal Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) found it necessary to prepare a proposal for a draft bill for a new Corona-ArbSchV.

The new Corona-ArbSchV will enter into force on 1 October 2022 and will apply initially until 7 April 2023.

On 24 August 2022, the BMAS released a draft bill for a revised Corona-ArbSchV. It required employers to again offer employees the possibility to work from home and to provide rapid tests.

However, the version adopted by the Federal Cabinet on 31 August 2022 only requires employees to assess various measures as part of the company hygiene concept.

In contrast to previous versions of the Corona-ArbSchV, there is no longer any obligation to implement specific measures.

Company hygiene concept measures The focus of the new occupational health and safety measures is the obligation for employers to establish a company hygiene concept.

This hygiene concept should evaluate the well-known and proven measures for protection against infection and establish and implement the measures that the company considers necessary.

In this respect, the employer does not have a direct obligation to implement the measures.

Instead, the employer must evaluate, based on its own risk assessment in accordance with §§ 5 and 6 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, whether it should implement certain measures within the company to the extent that the operational requirements allow.

In this respect, the employer can consider the regional occurrence of infection, as well as the specific risks of infection for the activities performed.

According to the draft bill, the BMAS has based the list on the measures that have proven both practical and effective during the pandemic.

Employers should pay particular attention to the following measures when evaluating the company hygiene concept: Maintaining a minimum distance of 1.5 metres between persons Ensuring hand hygiene Adherence with etiquette for coughing and sneezing Airing interior areas following infection protection guidelines Reducing contacts between persons for operational reasons The offer for employees to carry out appropriate activities from home where no operational reasons would prevent it The offer for workers who cannot work solely from home to test themselves regularly for free.

To avoid the spread of infection through droplets, a minimum distance of 1.5 metres between two persons should be maintained.

Where the distance falls below this minimum and health and safety measures are insufficient, employers must make protective face masks available to employees.

Suitable hand hygiene rules must also be established.

According to the explanatory memorandum to the draft bill, this will be guaranteed if the employer makes available cold water, soap and disposable towels or suitable hand sanitiser.

The avoidance or at least the reduction of contact between persons within the workplace is the last suitable measure."
ADVANT Beiten,The revised Coronavirus Occupation Health and Safety Regulation in a nutshell,"The avoidance or at least the reduction of contact between persons within the workplace is the last suitable measure.

Employees should, for example, avoid using the same rooms or vehicles or split employees into teams that are as small as possible.

Business trips or other in-person meetings should be reduced to only those which are necessary to continue operations.

The new version of the Corona-ArbSchV no longer mentions avoiding contact, but merely from a reduction in contact.

Employees should, for example, avoid using the same rooms or vehicles or be split into teams that are as small as possible.

Business trips or other in-person meetings should be reduced to only those which are necessary for continued operations.

No obligation to offer employees to work from home In adopting the new version of the Corona-ArbSchV, the Federal Cabinet decided that employers should no longer be obliged to offer employees the opportunity to work from home.

When evaluating the company hygiene concept, the employer should merely assess whether an offer to work from home should be made to employees and whether such an offer should be implemented as part of the hygiene concept.


In the view of the BMAS, allowing employees to work from home has proven to be a good way to avoid unnecessary contact with other persons at work.

Despite this fact, the Federal Cabinet succumbed to pressure from the FDP and stopped short of imposing a strict obligation to allow employees to work from home.

Instead, employers are free to decide whether to offer their employees the opportunity to work from home.

In so doing, the company must assess whether the tasks performed by the employee can be performed from home or whether operational needs rule out working from home.

This will be the case when operations would otherwise be significantly restricted or could not be maintained.

Such activities include processing and distributing incoming post, processing incoming and outgoing goods, and counter or janitorial services.

When looking at the overall picture, the employer must also consider that working from home can make it easier to combine private life and work, e.g., for employees who have additional care responsibilities for dependents due to the Coronavirus.

The draft bill names caring for a sick child as one such additional care responsibility.

This relates specifically to circumstances brought about by the Coronavirus, such as the needs of employees with disabilities or with health factors which would put them at risk for a severe case of infection (e.g., weak immune system).

Where the offer to work from home is made, the employee will not have any obligation to accept the offer.

It will still be necessary for the employee’s home to fulfil the necessary technical and spacial requirements and for an agreement on working from home to be concluded between the employer and workers.

Such an agreement could, for example, be contained in an individual employment contract or works agreement.

Option for employees to be immunised In accordance with § 3 of the Corona-ArbSchV, employers must make it possible for their employees to be immunised against the Coronavirus during working time.

This provision regulates the employer’s support obligations with respect to the provision of the necessary personnel, rooms, amenities, devices, and resources.

All in all, the new version does not contain any completely unknown rules.

Instead, a weakened variant of the familiar rules will enter into force in October.

For most employers, therefore, the assessment requirement that will apply from 1 October 2022 will not cause any significant difficulties.

Most rules will already be implemented within the company, and many have remained unchanged.

At a glance As an employer, what do I have to consider from 1 October 2022?

ADVANT Beiten,And again: attachment of Corona bonus,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 25 August 2022 in Case No. 8 AZR 14/22 Voluntary corona bonuses paid by an employer to its workers to compensate the employees for the strains of performing their work during the pandemic are “hardship pay” and, as such, are exempt from attachment in accordance with § 850a No. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO).

Facts of the case The employee worked as a kitchen assistant and barkeeper for a restaurant.

The employer paid a voluntary corona bonus of EUR 400.

As the employee was in the middle of an ongoing insolvency proceeding, the insolvency administrator asked the employer to pay the administrator the corona bonus, which the administrator viewed as an attachable emolument.

When the employer refused, the insolvency administrator brought an action against the employer.

At first instance before the Labour Court in Braunschweig and on appeal to the Regional Labour Court of Lower Saxony, the claim was dismissed.

The Courts held that the term “hardship” in § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO refers to the particular pressures faced by employees when performing their duties.

This includes circumstances that are detrimental to the employee’s health and measures necessary for their protection.

As a barkeeper, the employee had to comply with social distancing rules and hygiene measures and was required to wear a mask.

The employee also had an increased risk of infection through contact with guests of the restaurant and endured significant psychological stress.

The sense and purpose of the protection from attachment in § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO are to ensure the economic livelihood of the debtor (in this case the employee).

That’s why it’s advisable to keep bonuses away from creditors where those bonuses are designed to compensate for adverse and particularly onerous working conditions.

It would miss the purpose of the corona bonuses – recognition for the performance of work under the special conditions of the pandemic – if these bonuses would not be protected from attachment.

A corona premium should therefore benefit the employee without restriction so that they get the additional pay for the dangers faced through their job.

Section 850a No. 3 of the ZPO grants protection from attachment only to the extent that the relevant bonus does not exceed the “normal framework”.

This requirement is also fulfilled here.

In this respect, § 3 No. 11a of the Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz) provides that corona premiums will be tax exempt up to an amount of EUR 1,500.

Bonuses that are lower than this amount will not exceed the “normal framework”.

The insolvency administrator appealed to the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG).

The judgment Without success: the BAG agreed with the lower courts and rejected the insolvency administrator’s claim.

In granting the bonus, the employee sought to compensate the employee for the hardship they suffered in performing their work.

Accordingly, this is an unattachable bonus under § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO.

The amount of the bonus also did not exceed normal levels.

Consequences for practice The judgment is right.

The voluntary corona bonuses were intended to honour the particular burdens that made performing work during the pandemic more difficult, and these premiums should be protected from attachment by creditors.

It is not clear from the brief press release of the BAG whether the BAG has followed the strict line taken by the LAG Berlin-Brandenburg (judgment of 23 February 2022 in Case No. 23

Sa 1254/21, see ADVANT Beiten Labour Law Newsletter, June 2022, page 11), according to which the protection against attachment will depend on whether a premium rule was applied indiscriminately to all employees (then it can be attached) or whether it depends on the specific hardship faced by the individual employee (then unattachable).

We will have to wait for the reasoning of the Court to be published."
ADVANT Beiten,And again: attachment of Corona bonus,"We will have to wait for the reasoning of the Court to be published.

Practical tip This judgment clarifies that any corona bonus should be protected against attachment where the employee faced additional burdens in performing their work due to the pandemic and the tax-free level of EUR 1,500 was not exceeded.

In such cases, an attempt by the employee’s creditors to garnish the bonus can be rejected and the bonus can be paid to the employee.

In contrast, care should be taken where corona bonuses were paid without any distinction based on the hardship actually faced by the employees.

In such cases, it is recommended that one wait until the full judgment is available and not pay any bonus to either the employee or their creditors.

Instead, in such cases, employers try to agree on temporarily withholding the payment or, where it is not possible to reach an agreement, deposit the amount of the bonus with the court.

ADVANT Beiten,An order to wear a surgical face mask as a safeguard against the Coronavirus does not entitle the wearer to a hardship supplement under the collective wage agreement for industrial cleaners,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 20 July 2022 in Case No. 10 AZR 41/22

An employer’s order for employees to wear medical face masks (surgical masks) as a safeguard against the Coronavirus does not fulfil the requirements for a hardship supplement under § 10 No. 1.2 of the Framework Collective Wage Agreement for commercial workers in the industrial cleaning industry.

Facts of the case The worker is employed as a cleaner.

The Collective Wage Agreement for the Industrial Cleaning Industry applies to his employment relationship based on the order declaring the Agreement generally binding.

Between August 2020 and May 2021, he wore a medical face mask while carrying out his cleaning duties as instructed by his employer.

The employer adopted the measures to safeguard against the Coronavirus.

The employee demanded he be paid a hardship supplement equivalent to 10% of his hourly wage for wearing the mask based on § 10 No. 1.2 of the Framework Agreement.

He claimed that wearing a medical face mask while working constituted a hardship that should be compensated by the hardship supplement.

A medical face mask should be considered part of his personal safety equipment because it also reduces the risk that the wearer will become infected.

The lower courts dismissed the claim.

The judgment The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) shared the view of the lower courts.

It clarified that a medical face mask is not a respiratory mask within the meaning of § 10 No. 1.2 of the Collective Wage Agreement.

The collective provisions relate to occupational health and safety regulations.

Accordingly, the term respiratory mask includes only those masks which are personal protective equipment and are primarily intended to protect the individual wearer.

This does not apply to medical face masks, which are designed to protect others, not the wearer, and do not meet the requirements under the occupational health and safety provisions for personal protective equipment.

The employee is therefore not entitled to a hardship supplement under the provisions of the Collective Agreement for wearing a medical face mask.

The judgment of the BAG is correct and logical.

In line with the judgments of the lower courts in this case and other judgments at first instance, the supplement should be denied.

In its opinion of 24 April 2020, the Trade Association for Industrial Cleaning (one of the parties to the Collective Agreement) also clarified that only FFP masks of protection classes 1 – 3 are respiratory masks within the meaning of the Collective Agreement; everyday masks and surgical masks do not fall within this definition.

The wording of the provisions of the Collective Agreement, but also the sense and purpose of the rule target the personal protection of workers.

In addition, the hardship supplement only applies – as is clear from the broader context of the standard – when a certain intensity is exceeded.

This is not the case when wearing a simple surgical mask.

Consequences for practice The judgment is relevant to more than just the Collective Wage Agreement for the Industrial Cleaning Industry.

The provision in question concerns general occupational health and safety provisions.

Accordingly, the BAG clarified that respiratory masks are only those masks that are designed for the personal protection of the wearer and are part of the wearer’s personal protection equipment.

Medical face masks are designed to primarily protect others and not the wearer.

This argument can be applied in other cases, and not just those based on the Collective Wage Agreement for Industrial Cleaning Services.

ADVANT Beiten,Discrimination is presumed when the employment of a severely disabled worker is terminated without the agreement of the Integration Office,"Judgement of the Federal Labour Court of 2 June 2022 in Case No. 8 AZR 191/21 Failure to obtain the agreement of the Integration Office in accordance with § 168 of the Ninth Volume of the Social Code (SGB IX) when terminating the employment of a severely disabled person will result in a presumption, pursuant to § 22 of the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeinen Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, AGG), that the employment agreement was terminated because of the disability.

Facts of the case The employee worked as a janitor for a primary school on the basis of a contract that fell under a personnel sharing agreement.

He was paralysed on one side of his body following a stroke and declared incapacitated for work on 11 February 2018.

The employer became aware of the incapacity on 12 February 2018 through the employee’s then supervisor.

The employer terminated the employment relationship at the end of March 2018.

In addition to an action for unfair dismissal, which ended in a settlement, the employee brought an action for the payment of damages for discrimination based on his severe disability in accordance with § 15 (2) of the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG).

In his view, the fact that the employer failed to get the approval of the Integration Office before terminating the employment relationship substantiated his claim.

When the notice of termination was issued, there was no official verification of his severe disability, nor had the employee applied to be recognised as a severely disabled person.

However, the employee argued that his severe disability was so obvious that no verification was necessary.

The judgment The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) rejected the claim for payment of damages under § 15 (2) of the AGG.

The dismissal was direct discrimination within the meaning of § 3 (1) of the AGG, but the employee had failed to sufficiently show that the discrimination was a result of his severe disability.

The Court confirmed that the infringement of § 168 of the SGB XI could establish the rebuttable presumption in § 22 of the AGG that the severe disability was “causal” for the discrimination.

However, the employee had failed to conclusively prove the infringement of § 168 of the SGB XI.

His disability was not evident at the time of the dismissal.

Consequences for practice This judgment shows that there can already be a claim for compensation under § 15 (2) of the AGG where the (severe) disability has not yet been verified nor has the person applied for verification.

Such a claim nevertheless requires that the severe disability was evident to the employer.

A disability, even a severe disability, will only be obvious in very exceptional cases.

The requirements for the obviousness characteristic are strict: the BAG held that the test was not fulfilled in this case, even though the employee was in intensive care with one side of his body paralysed following his stroke.

Practical tip Careful attention should be paid to compliance with the procedural duties and/or duty of care with respect to severely disabled persons in daily practice to avoid claims for compensation for discrimination from persons with severe disabilities.

Failure to comply with all requirements can lead to a presumption of discrimination based on disability.

In the case of job applications, for example, private and public employers must comply with the duties to investigate and the right of participation in accordance with §§ 164 and 165 of the SGB IX respectively.

The decision of the BAG makes it clear that the failure to acquire the approval of the Integration Office in accordance with § 168 of the SGB IX may be a fact that would establish a presumption of discrimination and a causal link between the discrimination and the severe disability within the meaning of § 22 of the AGG.

If such facts exist, the employer is encouraged to refute the presumption of discrimination on grounds of severe disability."
ADVANT Beiten,Discrimination is presumed when the employment of a severely disabled worker is terminated without the agreement of the Integration Office,"If such facts exist, the employer is encouraged to refute the presumption of discrimination on grounds of severe disability.

ADVANT Beiten,Take caution with full and final settlement clauses!,"Judgment of the Regional Court of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern of 20 April 2022 in Case No. 5

Sa 100/21 Employers should consider carefully whether it makes sense to use so-called full and final settlement clauses.

Full and final settlement clauses are provisions in termination/winding up agreements or court settlements which swiftly and comprehensively settle all open claims arising out of an employment relationship between the parties.

They are designed to provide legal certainty quickly.

However, caution should be taken when drafting them.

Facts of the case To terminate the employment relationship on 31 October 2020, the employer and employee concluded a termination agreement.

This contained a full and final settlement clause “that all claims against the other party arising out of or in connection with the employment relationship and its termination, irrespective of the legal grounds, whether or not the claim has been established shall be completely settled with the fulfilment of this termination agreement.”

The employee subsequently claimed continued payment of wages for June/July 2020.

At first, the employer paid the employee the wages.

In November 2020, the employer informed the employee in her payslip for October 2020, i.e., after the end of the employment relationship, that she had no claim for continued remuneration.

The employer therefore offset the amount of overpaid wages for June/July 2020 with her salary for October 2020 and paid the employee a smaller net amount.

The judgment The Regional Court of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Landesarbeitsgericht, LAG) held that it is not necessary to address the question of whether the employee had a claim for repayment.

The conclusion of the termination agreement and the “constitutive negative acknowledgement of debt” extinguish all claims against the other party.

This full and final settlement clause also covers any possible “claims of unjust enrichment” from overpayment of wages.

In the interests of a quick settlement, the full and final settlement clause should be interpreted broadly.

The clause prevented the employer from carrying out any set-off at the start of November.

The employee therefore has a claim for the continued payment of wages.

In the Court’s view, the only exception to this is claims, which are regulated in detail and separately from any full and final settlement clause, such as clauses concerning employee rights to leave and compensation for leave not taken, the payment of overtime, or employer claims for the return of work materials.

For the LAG, it did not help the employer’s argument that the parties agreed that the employment relationship would be settled in an orderly fashion in accordance with the provisions of the employment agreement and that the resulting net amount would be paid out.

Offsetting a payment against an earlier overpayment did not fall under the adopted rule.

Consequences for practice The LAG followed the case law of the Federal Labour Court, interpreting full and final settlement clauses broadly.

For this reason, a termination agreement should be formulated carefully so that an employee does not have to unwillingly waive rights to claims such as claims for the repayment of any excess salary paid or performance-linked advance.

The legal nature and effect of a full and final settlement clause should be determined through interpretation.

Practical tips When the parties want to exclude claims from the full and final settlement clause, those claims must be expressly mentioned in the agreement.

If this does not occur, the claims will be lost and cannot be enforced.

This decision shows that the employer should also consider carefully which claims it might still have against the employee.

Possible claims should also be considered prior to any hearing before the labour courts or the conclusion of any contractual agreement so that any full and final settlement clause is not concluded in haste.

ADVANT Beiten,Vacation in quarantine? – The ECJ will now decide,"Federal Labour Court of 16 August 2022 in Case No. 9 AZR 76/22 (A)

The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) submitted a question to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling on whether the refusal to regrant leave to an employee because he was not ill but ordered by the relevant authority to isolate during his leave, is compatible with European law.

Facts of the case An employee was forced to quarantine during his leave because he had contact with a person who was infected with the Coronavirus.

He demanded that the squandered leave be regranted because he was unable to organise his leave freely as a result of the quarantine order.

The Labour Court in Hagen dismissed the claim, while the Regional Labour Court in Hamm found in favour of the employee on appeal.

The judgment The BAG has called on the ECJ to issue a preliminary ruling in this case.

The Federal Leave Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz) contains a rule specifying that sick days shall not be counted as leave.

This provision only applies to sick days and the lower courts have generally held that this rule does not apply where the employee is forced to quarantine although they are not themselves ill (see Vacation even if stuck in quarantine | Advant Beiten (advant-beiten.com) ).

The application of EU law, especially the EU Working Time Directive and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, could give a different conclusion.

The BAG stayed the proceedings before it until the ECJ issues its preliminary ruling on the question.

Consequences for practice The preliminary reference to the ECJ brings with it not insignificant risk that leave will need to be regranted when employees were not able to properly take it, not because they were ill but because they had to spend it in quarantine.

There is no legal basis for a regrant of leave under German law.

However, the ECJ might come to a different conclusion given the importance of the right to paid annual leave.

Practical tip

The preliminary reference to the ECJ means uncertainty for employers.

Unless and until the ECJ has decided that the refusal to regrant leave in such cases is contrary to EU law, employers can continue to refuse employee claims for the regrant of leave.

However, employers will have to accept the higher risk when doing so.

As a precaution, employers should prepare for employees to have a claim for the regrant of leave and to take this into account in planning.

In addition, employers should establish the necessary reserves.

The ECJ ruling should not be expected before next year.

In addition, employers are free to regrant any relevant leave entitlements now, for example, to strengthen employee loyalty.

In such cases, any claims of “company practice” should be avoided.

Possibility of online formation through the Digitalisation Directive Until now, anyone wishing to establish a GmbH in Germany had to visit a notary in person.

However, in times when video conferences have become indispensable to businesses, why should it not be possible to meet with a notary online?

The so-called Digitalisation Directive (EU Directive 2019/1151) required all EU member states to allow for the online formation of corporations by 1 August 2022.

The corresponding German implementation act was already passed in 2021 (""DiRUG"") and has now entered into force.

Accordingly, companies and founders can establish a limited liability company (GmbH) or the entrepreneurial company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (UG (haf-tungsbeschränkt))), popular among start-ups, conveniently from their offices or home since 1 August 2022.

The first online foundation occurred on 1 August 2022 ( Bundesnotarkammer erste Onlinegründung ).

Virtual involvement of the notary Nonetheless, it is still not possible to protect the founders and legal transactions from identity fraud and money laundering without involving a notary.

However, notarisation can now take place virtually, using a specially secured video communication system provided by the Federal Chamber of Notaries.

All necessary declarations of intent can be notarised via this video communication system.

To identify involved individuals, the notary first reads out the data from an electronic means of identification using the notary app.

For German citizens, this is the ID card with the so-called eID function (all ID cards issued since 2017 have this online ID card function, which must, however, be activated once beforehand by the holder of the ID card).

This satisfies the requirement of the signature of all shareholders under section 2 (1) sentence 2 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG).

Subsequently, the notary compares the photo with the video image of the persons involved, advises the founders – as before – on the drafting of the articles of association, and checks their legal capacity or powers of representation.

Finally, all involved persons sign the contract with a qualified electronic signature.

For this purpose, all involved individuals receive an SMS-TAN to confirm their signature.

Following the notarization of the electronic signature, the notary electronically sends the document to the registry court for registration.

As soon as the entry in the register has been made and checked by the notary, all will immediately be informed about the successful completion of the procedure.

Consequently, an online formation requires (1) a PC or tablet with internet access and webcam/microphone, (2) a smartphone with the notary app, and (3) an identity card with an eID function.

An explanatory video by the Federal Chamber of Notaries can be found here: Onlineverfahren Notar.

Incidentally, the founders are not free to choose their ""online notary"" but must choose a notary in whose official sphere, for instance, the future registered office or the (residential) seat of a partner is located.

Prospects and classification The implementation act DiRUG currently only permits the online formation of a GmbH as a cash formation.

The DiREG (Act Supplementing the Regulations for the Implementation of the Digitalisation Directive and Amending Other Provisions of 15 July 2022) will extend this option to non-cash formations as of 1 August 2023.

Exceptionally, non-cash for-mations involving the contribution of objects whose transfer is itself subject to notarisa-tion (e.g. real property or shares in a limited liability company) will continue to be excluded from this online procedure."
ADVANT Beiten,Formation of a GmbH from home possible since 1 August 2022,"Accordingly, shareholder resolutions amending the articles of association, including capital measures (increase and reduction of the share capital), can be made by way of online communication with a notary, provided they are unanimous (due to section 53 (3) sentence 2 GmbHG) starting 1 August 2023.

Since 1 August 2022, the notarial certification of register applications using video communication has also been possible online in the same way for sole traders and corporations.

DiREG extends this possibility to all legal entities.

Moreover, applications to the register of partnerships, cooperatives, and associations can also be established online with a notary.

ADVANT Beiten,Regional Labour Court of Schleswig-Holstein: Compensation claim for discrimination after applying for a job via eBay Classified,"Judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Schleswig-Holstein of 21 June 2022 in Case No. 2

Sa 21/22

An applicant, who used the chat function on the online portal “eBay Kleinanzeigen” to apply for a job advertised on the site fulfils the definition of an applicant in § 6 (1) 2nd sentence of the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, AGG).

Neither his repeated enquiry about whether the advertiser was only looking for a woman nor the fact that he used a “form” for the pre-trial enforcement of his compensation claim constituted an abuse of rights, as claimed by the employer.

Neither provides sufficient indication of a pseudo application which is solely designed to be able to subsequently claim compensation.

Facts of the case A small business with an auto repair shop ran an ad in the positions vacant section of eBay Kleinanzeigen (eBay Classified).

The ad stated: “Secretary wanted!

We’re looking for a secretary to start immediately.

Full-time/part-time: It would be great if you have experience.

…”

The ad used Sekretärin, the feminine form of Secretary in German.

The claimant answered the ad via the chat function and described in a few sentences his reasons for wanting the position.

He referred to his office experience and made it explicitly clear that he was applying for the position.

He also asked the defendant whether they were only looking for a woman for the position.

The company also used the chat function to reject his application, stating that they were looking for “a lady for the secretarial position”.

The male claimant saw discrimination based on sex in the rejection of his application and claimed compensation equivalent to three times the gross monthly salary from the company.

The company rejected his claim, arguing that his application was only designed to allow him to claim damages and should therefore be considered an abusive use of the law.

The judgment The Labour Court in Elmshorn rejected the claim for compensation because the claimant was not an applicant.

The Court categorised the claimant’s response to the position vacant as him “making contact” because he failed to provide sufficient personal information.

However, the Regional Labour Court of Schleswig-Holstein held in favour of the Applicant.

The informal application made via the chat function in eBay Kleinanzeigen gave the applicant the necessary status under the AGG.

Those who take the unusual step of advising a position via eBay Kleinanzeigen must expect that they will receive applications for the position which do not take the classical written form and are not accompanied by extensive application documents.

In addition, the law does not require any minimum level of personal information.

Simply, the applicant must be identifiable.

The Regional Court also rejected the claim that the Claimant had abused his legal rights.

The defendant’s repeated questions about whether the company was only looking for a woman for the position was not sufficient indication that the applicant only applied for the position to claim compensation under the AGG.

As the claimant’s application was only rejected because of his sex, he was entitled to claim compensation.

Consequences for practice The judgment provides legal clarity on the status of an applicant in online recruiting scenarios and shows that even small companies should be sensitised to the requirements of the AGG.

It makes it clear that these requirements also need to be considered when a job is advertised via online portals and digital channels.

The Regional Court of Schleswig-Holstein makes it unmistakeably clear that the recruitment procedure can start when a short response to a position vacant ad is received via an online chat.

Accordingly, a person who applies for a position vacant that is advertised online by sending just a few sentences via the chat function will be an applicant within the meaning of the AGG."
ADVANT Beiten,Regional Labour Court of Schleswig-Holstein: Compensation claim for discrimination after applying for a job via eBay Classified,"Accordingly, a person who applies for a position vacant that is advertised online by sending just a few sentences via the chat function will be an applicant within the meaning of the AGG.

In addition, the judgment confirms the high hurdles established in the case law for the claim of an abuse of rights.

Accordingly, the circumstances must generally indicate that the claimant’s application is part of a systematic “business model”.

To the extent that the applicant may be seriously interested in the position, such systematic circumstances will not be present.

Practical tip

As companies are increasingly using online channels for recruitment (e.g., LinkedIn, Xing, WhatsApp), it should be noted that the application procedure can start when a chat message is received.

Accordingly, the HR team should take the same care when answering a chat on behalf of the potential employer that they would take when placing an online position vacant ad and ensure that they do not discriminate against applicants.

A hasty chat response could potentially result in a claim for damages under the AGG.

ADVANT Beiten,The Control of European Investments in China,"China's response to the increased control of Chinese investments worldwide, especially in Europe and the US, is called the National Security Review .

Despite its silent existence of more than a decade, it most recently began to grow teeth.

With China pioneering in many major technology areas, such as industrial automation, IoT or future technologies, such as AI, electro-mobility or fintech, and considering the growing protectionism, it can be expected that China will apply its National Security Review regime to further control its market access, if needed.

Foreign investors newly investing in China or restructuring their existing China investments should be aware of the scope of the Chinese FDI control and its possible effects on their future investments.

In the case a foreign investment is caught under the Chinese National Security Review and was not cleared prior to closing, the foreign investor might be ordered to unwind or dispose the investment.

National Security Review The National Security Review (外商投资安全审查) is led by the National Development and Reform Commission (""NDRC"") and the Ministry of Commerce and conducted through a joint Working Mechanism Office (""WMO"") within the NDRC and applies to all foreign investments in the People's Republic of China (""PRC"").

The WMO might also consult other Ministries or public institutions during the National Security Review on a case-by-case basis.

The legal basis of China's National Security Review can be found in China's National Security Law (中华人民共和国国家安全法) 1 and its Foreign Investment Law (中华人民共和国外商投资法) 2 .

Whereas those two legislations were still silent on the formal procedure of the National Security Review, this gap was filled by the promulgation of the Measures for Security Review of Foreign Investments (外商投资安全审查办法) 3 , which became effective on January 18, 2021.

Foreign Investment is defined as any investment activity that is directly or indirectly conducted within the PRC by a foreign investor, including the investment into a new project or the formation of an enterprise in China, alone or together with any other investor; the acquisition of equity in or assets of an enterprise in China by means of mergers and acquisitions (public takeovers not included); and any investment by foreign investors through other means.

The definition of Foreign Investment clearly illustrates the vast reach of the Chinese FDI control, not only including M&A activities but also applying to greenfield investments, joint ventures, and investments by other means, presumably VIE-structures, trust, contractual control or offshore (foreign-to-foreign) transactions involving Chinese companies or assets.

Besides, any investment from Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan will also be treated as Foreign Investment.

Scope of the National Security Review The Chinese National Security Review applies a twofold test whereby any Foreign Investment must be reported by a foreign investor or the relevant parties in China prior to its implementation if the investment qualifies as an investment in a sector related to China's national defense and security , such as China's military and armaments industry, or an investment to be carried out at a location in vicinity of a Chinese military institution or an arms-related industrial facility; or an investment in a sector critical to the national security whereby the foreign investor acquires the actual control of the target company.

Critical sectors include , but are not limited to important agricultural products, important energy and resources, critical equipment manufacturing, important infrastructure, important transportation services, important cultural products and services, important information technology and Internet products and services, important financial services, key technology, or any other important field related to national security ."
ADVANT Beiten,The Control of European Investments in China,"However, the acquisition of actual control of the target company by the foreign investor is only relevant for investments into critical sectors; investments into a sector related to China's national defense and security are always subject to the National Security Review.

Review Procedure The Chinese National Security Review can be divided into four stages : (i) the consultation, (ii) the application, (iii) the general review and (iv) the special review.

Prior to the application for the National Security Review, the parties to a foreign investment may consult with the WMO on an informal basis to seek guidance and/or clarify any open issues.

Upon receipt of the formal application , the WMO will review the application and decide within 15 working days whether to initiate a formal review proceeding.

In the case a general review is initiated, the WMO must decide within another 30 working days whether to open a special review because the investment affects or may affect China's national security.

In case a special review is initiated, the WMO has another 60 working days to render its final decision.

The WMO may extend the review period due to special circumstances or request the parties to further supplement their application while suspending the review period until submission of the requested documentation.

However, there is no time limit or statute of limitation applicable to the National Security Review.

If an investment subject to the National Security Review has not been reported, the WMO may request the parties to follow up on their notification obligation.

Once a National Security Review is applied for or initiated, the consummation (closing) of the investment is prohibited.

Review Standard The Measures for Security Review of Foreign Investments do not stipulate any clear review standard.

Therefore, the WMO is given broad discretionary powers in deciding whether China's National Security is affected by the foreign investment.

The WMO may clear an investment, attach conditions to a clearance or, if the parties cannot remedy the national security concerns, eventually prohibit the investment.

The decision is final and without recourse to ordinary courts.

Non-compliance Non-compliance can result in the unwinding of the investment (i. e. disposal of equity interests or assets and the reinstation of the status quo ante ), the revocation of approvals, penalties, or a negative credit record in China's credit information system.

Thus, China's National Security Review should be considered at an early stage of the investment plan.

If it is unclear whether an investment might fall into any of the listed categories (military and defence or critical sector), a foreign investor should contact the local NDRC branch on an informal basis and ask for guidance.

Foreign investors should be aware that third parties can propose a National Security Review to the WMO if they believe that China's national security is or may be affected by a Foreign Investment.

ADVANT Beiten,Federal Cabinet approves Whistleblower Act,"On 27 July 2022, the Federal Cabinet adopted the draft bill for a Whistleblower Act, which was presented in April.

The Act will enter into force three months after it is adopted by the German Bundestag, most likely in January 2023.

Background The Whistleblower Act implements the EU Whistleblower Directive, which seeks to establish standard protections for informants throughout the EU.

Implementation is long overdue, as the deadline for transformation into national law ended on 17 December 2021.

In 2019, Germany provided some protection for whistleblowers with the adoption of the “Act on the Protection of Business Secrets”.

However, this new draft bill goes far beyond the 2019 Act.

Content of the draft bill The Whistleblower Directive and the German Whistleblower Act are designed to establish comprehensive protection for whistleblowers.

This is based on the following components: Companies and organisations with more than 50 employees must establish and operate a secure internal whistleblower system .

Small companies with fewer than 250 workers have been granted a “grace period” until December 2023.

Whistleblowers must have the option of providing information orally, in writing or in person, as they wish.

When information is provided, the internal reporting channel must provide the whistleblower with confirmation of receipt within seven days .

Within three months , the competent person or body must inform the whistleblower of the measures taken, e.g., the opening of an internal compliance investigation or the referral of the matter to the relevant authority, such as a law enforcement agency.

Second, Germany must establish the equivalent possibility to provide information to the Federal Office of Justice (Bundesamt für Justiz) as an external notification body .

The Laender can also establish bodies that whistleblowers may notify in such situations.

Whistleblowers can decide freely whether to notify the internal company body or the external body.

To protect the whistleblower against “retaliation”, the law contains a wide-reaching reversal or the burden of proof : if a whistleblower is “disadvantaged” with respect to their professional activities, it will be assumed that the disadvantage they face is in retaliation.

In addition, the whistleblower may claim damages for the (assumed) retaliation.

Significance for practice Companies and organisations should prepare for and organise professional installation and implementation of an internal notification system in good time because failure to do so can result in significant fines.

If a whistleblower system is already part of the internal compliance management system, companies should assess whether the system is in line with the requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act and make any necessary adjustments in time.

Particular care should be taken with respect to the reversal of the burden of proof when implementing personnel measures “near” the whistleblower, such as in their team or at their level.

This is particularly important when the whistleblower reveals their identity (they are not required to remain anonymous), when there is an exemption releasing the notification body from the duty to maintain confidentiality (§ 9 of the draft bill), or when the notification body infringes the duty of confidentiality.

In such cases, the identity of the whistleblower will be exceptionally known.

Accordingly, a failure to consider the whistleblower for a pending promotion, but even the breach or simple failure to extend a fixed-term employment contract could be considered “retribution”.

As a result, the employer will have to show that they have not disadvantaged the whistleblower due to the notification made by the employee.

If this exculpatory evidence is insufficient, the employer may face a claim for damages from the whistleblower, as well as fines."
ADVANT Beiten,Federal Cabinet approves Whistleblower Act,"If this exculpatory evidence is insufficient, the employer may face a claim for damages from the whistleblower, as well as fines.

Employers should therefore be prepared for the reversal in the burden of proof to be used as an additional “weapon” in an action against unfair dismissal, which could make it more difficult to defend against such a claim.

Conclusion The Whistleblower Act will require all companies with more than 50 employees to review and adapt any existing internal whistleblower system or to establish such a system for the first time.

Companies should consider whether to outsource and use a third party as their notification body and as the operator of the notification system.

In any case, companies are required to follow up on notifications, take measures and remedy violations.

Finally, employers must ensure that any whistleblower is protected against retribution.

At the same time, they should bear in mind the potential for misuse of the new reversal of the burden of proof.

ADVANT Beiten,"So tell me, what do you think about the minimum wage?","The Insolvency Law Senate of the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) was again asked to provide a clear answer to this pivotal question on 25 May 2022 (Case No. 6 AZR 497/21).

The case concerned an action for annulment taken by the insolvency administrator against a payment received by an employee from their insolvent employer.

The insolvency administrator was tasked with administering and disposing of the assets of the insolvent employer.

These tasks include examining the lawfulness of payments made prior to insolvency and, where there are anomalies, enforcing the repayment to the insolvency assets.

The insolvency administrator may, for example, “contest” payments made prior to insolvency, i.e., claim the repayment or refund of the payments.

This also applies to payments made to employees.

However, salary payments may only be contested in certain cases.

If the employer pays the salary at the latest three months after the work was performed, the payment will generally constitute an uncontestable cash transaction (§142 (2) second sentence of the Insolvency Code, Insolvenzordnung, InsO).

It becomes dangerous for employees when wages are in arrears for more than three months or where the payment is received via another source than that foreseen in the employment contract (e.g., through foreclosure or the threat of an application for insolvency).

The latter is referred to as “incongruent cover.”

Especially in such cases, employees may be required to repay wages.

Does this apply to the whole salary?

That is exactly the question.

The case law and literature have long discussed a ban on contesting salary payments for amounts below the minimum subsistence level protected under constitutional law.

In many cases, the Sixth Senate of the BAG has rejected such a ban for incongruent cover.

Until now, the question of whether this also applies to congruent cover has been left open.

What was the BAG asked to decide?

The employee, who was the defendant in the case, received her salary on 24 August and 26 September 2016 for the respective months.

At this time, the employer was unable to pay and transferred the wage payments from his mother’s bank account, which he had endowed with funds for this purpose.

On 12 October, he filed for insolvency.

After the opening of the insolvency proceedings on 1 December 2016, the insolvency administrator challenged these wage payments and demanded their repayment.

The Regional Labour Court agreed with the insolvency administrator but only granted the claim for repayment for the amount that exceeded the statutory minimum wage.

The Court held that the employee should be allowed to keep the minimum wage.

What did the BAG decide?

The Sixth Senate of the BAG set aside the judgment of the Regional Labour Court and awarded the insolvency administrator a claim for the repayment of the entire payments received by the employee on 25 August and 26 September 2016, including the amount of the minimum wage.

Even though the employee did not receive the payment from the debtor but from his mother, it constituted a payment made in fraud of creditors.

The debtor provided his mother with the funds needed to make the payments (a so-called indirect contribution).

As the defendant’s claim was against the debtor as her employer, the payment made via the employer’s mother’s bank account was an incongruent payment and thus incongruent coverage under § 131 (1) of the InsO.

The constitutional law protection of the minimum wage did not provide any restriction on the right to challenge the payment as the provisions on the protection against attachment in the Code of Civil Procedure and social legislation already guaranteed sufficiently protection.

Legislators did not provide any limit on the right to contest the payment nor any special protection against enforcement.

The claim for repayment under insolvency law must thus also relate to the statutory minimum wage."
ADVANT Beiten,"So tell me, what do you think about the minimum wage?","The claim for repayment under insolvency law must thus also relate to the statutory minimum wage.

The legal consequences of the minimum wage end with payment by the employer.

...

and what's new about that?

The judgment should not be a surprise.

The fact that there is no constitutional law ban on challenging the incongruent payment of salaries based on the minimum subsistence level is in line with the case law of the highest Court.

What’s special about the decision is that it provides, for the first time, indications as to how the Court would decide in a parallel case of congruent coverage.

It’s no coincidence that the BAG has only had to decide on a challenge to the incongruent payment of wages until now.

The prerequisites for the challenge to congruent payment are much stricter and therefore occur much less frequently.

In such cases, the employee must have been aware of their employer’s inability to pay or suspension of payments (§§ 17, 130, 133 (3) of the InsO).

This is entirely possible where the employee works in the accounting department or is a commercial executive for the company.

Those who have followed the case law since 2014 on the relevance of the minimum wage when contesting wage payments must ask why incongruence should make the constitutional protection of the minimum subsistence level secondary.

In our view, the recent judgment contains a clear indication that the BAG does not see any real distinction between congruent and incongruent payments.

The Senate was first to bring up the idea of a ban on challenging payments below the minimum subsistence level in its judgment of 29 January 2014, which is well worth reading (Case No. Az.

6 AZR 345/12).

After some lower courts (including both lower courts in the current case) applied the concept in their rulings, the same Senate advised that the idea was only meant to “fuel debate” and, after considering the arguments, this idea could not be upheld.

If judges of the Labour Courts or Regional Labour Courts feel that they have been misled, they will keep it to themselves.

The result of this unsuccessful development of the law is at least clear: The Court determined that social law, rather than restrictions on challenges to payments would guarantee the protection of the employees’ subsistence.

This protection comes in the form of the attachment provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and social law, which is why a general restriction against challenging payments in insolvency proceedings was not advisable under constitutional law.

To the extent that contested insolvency payments fall through due to the two-month deadline in § 324 (3) of the Third Volume of the Social Code, this two-month deadline would be restricted and not the deadline for contesting payments under insolvency law.

Any other approach would be contrary to both the concept of the equal treatment of creditors in the Insolvency Code and the protective mechanisms in social law.

It is not the community of creditors but the greater community of solidarity that is responsible for ensuring the livelihood of creditors.

Everything else is reserved for the legislators.

This argumentation applies equally to contesting congruent and incongruent payments.

Even the guiding principle developed by the Court no longer refers to the individual facts or circumstances of the case as it did in the previous judgments.

Instead, the Court simply states: “Contesting the payment of wages also includes the amount up to the statutory minimum wage”.

This should be a sufficient indication.

Outlook Whether or not one agrees that “the advisable minimum subsistence level under constitutional law is secured… regardless of the challenge to the payment”: the recent decision clarifies that the BAG does not consider it appropriate to position the minimum wage issue in the law on contesting payments in insolvency procedures (any longer)."
ADVANT Beiten,"So tell me, what do you think about the minimum wage?","On the other hand, since the decision in this case concerns a contest to an incongruent payment, it will be difficult to avoid the above principle soon being made “official” and confirmed in a case concerning challenges to payments with congruent coverage.

However, in its judgment of 25 May 2022, the BAG already indicated how it will decide in that case.

The community of creditors in an insolvency procedure is not there to cushion social hardships arising from the challenge to payments as part of insolvency proceedings or to enforce other claims against the insolvency assets, but is instead a group of creditors who have suffered a loss.

ADVANT Beiten,"FIFA, UEFA and Super League – Who is the Bad Guy from a Competition Law Perspective?","Hearing on the European Super League before the European Court of Justice After the European Super League had almost been forgotten, the debate about the highly controversial project is now resurging again.

In April 2021, twelve top European football clubs announced their intention to establish their own European breakaway competition, the ""Super League"", in rivalry with UEFA's international competitions, and of whom these twelve clubs planned to form the core.

After a few days of fierce opposition from, in particular, fans, clubs and officials, the project quickly seemed buried.

Only Real Madrid, Juventus Turin and FC Barcelona remained committed to the idea.

Consequently, the Madrid Commercial Court submitted a series of questions to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg concerning European competition law and the ECJ's answer will strongly influence the future organization of professional football.

The central questions are: Did FIFA and UEFA act as an illegal cartel?

Did they abuse their dominant position within the international market?

Is there a restriction of fundamental EU freedoms?

Running Foul of EU competition law?

The European Superleague Company, S.L. requests the Madrid Commercial Court to find that the actions and statutes of UEFA and FIFA violate Articles 101 and 102 TFEU on cartels and abuse of dominant positions 1 .

In addition, Superleague Company claims breaches of the four fundamental freedoms protected by the Treaty (Articles 45, 49, 56 and 63 TFEU).

The Spanish court submitted six preliminary questions to the ECJ which should assess the prior authorization required by FIFA and UEFA for the organization of competitions by third parties if FIFA and UEFA members want to participate in them.

Furthermore, the Spanish court asks whether FIFA and UEFA may impose sanctions on clubs and/or players participating in the Super League, as well as imposed rules on the ownership of all rights associated with the competition.

UEFA and FIFA – an anticompetitive cartel?

Super League accuses UEFA and FIFA of running an anti-competitive cartel.

The authorization procedure for the creation of new competitions would serve to secure their monopoly position and prevent competition on the market.

The ""radical conflict of interest"" created by UEFA's ""dual role"" as regulator and operator is particularly decried in this context: Why should UEFA voluntarily allow competition in the hitherto exclusive market by granting authorizations to competing events?

Besides, the threatened sanctions against players and clubs would be contrary to other EU law rules.

Core of the defense: the preservation of ""sporting integrity"" In their written and oral submissions, more than twenty EU Member States are (almost) united in defending UEFA.

Despite years of scandals and criticism of the world football's governing body and its members, UEFA is now said to represent the values of the European Sports Model, to protect the physical and ethical integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen and merit-based competition, which would always be open to the best performing teams.

While it is acknowledged that the regulations and conduct of FIFA and UEFA could, in principle, be against the prohibition of cartels, the protection of ""sporting integrity"" is put forward as a legitimate objective in the sense of the Meca-Medina decision of the ECJ 2 .

According to this jurisdiction, the three-step test applies, which requires a legitimate objective, consequential effects restrictive of competition inherent in the pursuit of those objectives, and the proportionality of the measure.

In the view of UEFA and FIFA as well as many of the participating Member States, these requirements are fulfilled.

Thus, opposing the Super League would not amount to an illegal restriction of competition under Article 101 (1) TFEU and any infringement of Article 102 TFEU (prohibition of abuse of a dominant position) would also justified."
ADVANT Beiten,"FIFA, UEFA and Super League – Who is the Bad Guy from a Competition Law Perspective?","When looking at possible justifications of restrictions, the social and economic aspects of the case and not only strictly (antitrust) legal arguments should be taken into account in the decision-making.

Regarding to the alleged conflict of interest, it can be argued that – as with other business companies – such a conflict is inherent in the defense of one's economic interest and is not per se anti-competitive.

In this respect, a different legal treatment of undertakings operating in the field of sport would appear artificial.

At the same time, FIFA, UEFA and Member States are counterattacking and argue that the Super League represents a ""textbook example of a cartel"" leading to the ""death of open competition"".

This argument is based on the fact that the new competition foresees a certain number of permanent, financially strong members.

This would be contrary to the principle of a participation based on merits.

The German Federal Minister of Sports Nancy Faeser therefore says: ""Anyone who loves football is against a Super League.""

However, can such an argumentation actually hold up legally?

EU competition law as a binding framework The European Commission, which is also heard in all preliminary ruling procedurs, takes a nuanced stand adopting in large parts the General Court's position in the ISU-judgement 3 .

It insists on compliance with EU law.

Thus, it calls for a system of ""checks and balances"" on the monopoly power of FIFA and UEFA.

The exercise of regulatory functions must be subject to restrictions, obligations and review to prevent such bodies from distorting competition.

A modification of the approval procedure by FIFA and respectively UEFA could be a possible consequence which would have to be designed as a procedure regulated on the basis of objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria, so that approval is not de facto excluded from the outset.

The Commission appeared also doubtful as to the legality of threatened sanctions, namely bans on participating in FIFA and UEFA competitions and national leagues, or on playing for the national team.

In particular, doubts were expressed on the necessity and proportionality of the measures.

Nevertheless, the Commission also acknowledges that UEFA may have ""legitimate objectives to restrict competition"" but that ""any defense of the European Sports Model must respect European law, in particular with regard to competition law and fundamental freedoms"".

UEFA may have a conflict of interest in approving competitions organized by third parties.

Finally, the question of whether the Super League itself constituted a cartel would have to be examined in another proceeding.

Waiting for the decision of the ""referee"" from Luxembourg After the hearing before the ECJ, which mainly focused on the technical complexities of EU competition law, the opinion of the Advocate General Athanasios Rantos, announced for 15 December 2022 and often indicative of the final judgment, is now eagerly awaited.

The final ECJ ruling will probably depend to a large extent on whether the 15 judges recognize that the restrictions in question are inherent in the pursuit of the legitimate objective and what weight they give to that objective in the context of their consideration.

The judgement is expected at the end of this or in the beginning of the next year.

Given the apparent similarity of the cases, the appeal of the International Skating Union (ISU) against the ISU-judgment was also heard by the ECJ's Grand Chamber on Monday, 11 July 2022 4 .

ADVANT Beiten,Recertification of medical devices,"In our blog post of 26 May 2021, we informed on the EU Medical Device Regulation (""MDR"") and the German Medical Device Regulation Implementation Act (""MPDG"") entering into force.

In that blog post, we pointed out that there would be no exemption for existing certifications.

Therefore, medical devices which had been certified before the MDR entered into force are generally required to be retested and recertified under the new requirements.

Article 120 MDR has determined transitional periods, stipulating in paragraph 2 that certificates issued after 25 May 2017 will become void at the latest on 24 May 2024.

The Federal Association for Medical Devices (""BVMed"") recently emphasised that around 30% of medical devices could therefore 'disappear' from the market because the new regulatory system of the MDR lacks the capacity to certify existing products in due time and the documentation effort for existing products has increased dramatically.

This concerns various products, such as surgical materials, but also plasters, glasses and rapid antigen tests.

These problems arising out of the implementation of the MDR were discussed at detail at the EPSCO meeting held by the health ministries of the European member states on 14 June 2022.

A solution to the problems is however not at sight.

While the postponement of deadlines and the expansion of resources at the notified bodies are being discussed, legal adjustments or amendments to the MDR do not yet exist.

It is therefore important to have existing products recertified in a timely manner.

ADVANT Beiten,Fit for 55: The difficult path to climate protection in the European Parliament,"The greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels, and by 2050 the European Union should be climate neutral.

That is the EU's target – an ambitious one, especially considering how divided MEPs were initially on the implementa-tion of concrete measures and how dissatisfied certain EU Member States are with the drafts.

The ""Fit for 55"" package includes draft amendments to existing EU legislation in the fields of climate, energy and transport and 13 new legislative proposals aiming to reduce emissions in a wide range of sectors.

This makes it the EU's largest revision of climate and energy legislation to date.

The package was presented by the Commission one year ago, in July 2021.

For the drafts to become binding legal acts, the approval of the European Parliament as well as of the Member States, represented in the Council of the European Union, is required.

Dissatisfaction about the planned emission-free mobility The European Parliament's most straightforward vote on a measure in the climate package so far was the adoption of the Commission's proposal to revise the CO2 emission performance standards for new cars and vans, reaching zero-emission road mobility by 2035.

This means a de facto ban on the sale of diesel, petrol, and hybrid vehicles.

However, to arrive at an agreement among European environment ministers on this issue proved more difficult.

Especially Germany's role in the negotiations was strongly criti-cized, for making late and uncoordinated proposals, such as a proposal on allowing synthetic fuels.

Nevertheless, the Council voted in favour of the Parliament's position.

Still, the German government continues to hope that a recital clause inviting the Com-mission to examine the use of CO2 neutral fuels outside the scope of the fleet standards will allow it to weaken the phase-out consequences.

Disagreement on the revision of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) One of the central elements of the Commission's proposal, the reform of the European Emissions Trading System and its extension to transport and buildings, was initially rejected.

So far, only energy-intensive industrial sectors, the energy sector and aviation within Europe must have their emissions certified.

While conservative politicians wanted to weaken the Commission's proposition by amending it, for example by continuing distributing free allowances to companies for a longer period of time, the Greens and Social Democrats considered the draft not being enough ambitious and instead of agreeing on a softened emissions trading regume, they rejected the text.

However, Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Liberals agreed on a compromise outside the plenary sessions.

That compromise reduces emissions in ETS by 63% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.

The Commission's original proposal set a target of 61%, and the Environment Committee originally called for 67%.

It was also agreed to gradually phase out the free allowances by 2032, and from 2027 onwards, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) should also be applied to the ETS sectors.

Nevertheless, whether the CBAM will become law and is compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organization must still be seen.

Surprisingly, in the plenary session on 22 June 2022, MEPs went even further than agreed in the compromise and now want to establish a new ETS for commercial buildings and transport by 2024.

According to the Parliament's vote, before this ETS is to include private buildings and road transport, there should be a new co-decision procedure, as this would further increase energy costs for citizens.

Maritime transport should also be covered by emissions trading in the future.

On the night of 29 June 2022, the Council announced its negotiation position on this issue, which is more similar to the Commission's proposal."
ADVANT Beiten,Fit for 55: The difficult path to climate protection in the European Parliament,"On the night of 29 June 2022, the Council announced its negotiation position on this issue, which is more similar to the Commission's proposal.

For example, it does not adopt elements such as the separation between the commercial and private building and transport sectors because of the difficulty of implementation.

In the future trialogue, an inter-institutional negotiation, essential points will still have to be discussed.

Final votes are being adjourned Important votes on parts of the climate package were initially adjourned, such as the vote on the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the vote on a Social Climate Fund to help vulnerable citizens cope with the increased costs of the energy transition.

However, this made it possible to draw up even more climate-friendly drafts, which were adopted by the Parliament.

The Council has also already announced its negotiation positions on these issues, which, nevertheless, differ from the Parliament's drafts in some points.

In these negotiations, the German government again was not very willing to compromise and wanted to drastically reduce the climate social fund.

This made coming to an agreement within the Council more difficult.

Faster agreement in votes on environmental targets MEPs were able to agree more quickly on environmental targets, including higher ambitions for carbon sinks in land use and in the forestry sector, higher emission reduc-tions in international aviation and higher reduction targets for EU Member States.

Nonetheless, especially in the latter case, it is debated how the set target of 40% renewable energy sources in the EU's overall energy mix by 2030 can be reached, as currently the share of renewable energy is at only 20%.

The Council has not yet com-mented on these targets.

Sufficient willingness to compromise?

It is striking that the Parliament successfully voted on texts of the climate package that concern theoretical targets, while actual measures were rejected or the vote on them was postponed.

It will be interesting to see whether the European Parliament and the Council, despite having differing positions, will show enough willingness to compromise in order to pass legislation that will help achieve EU's climate goals.

ADVANT Beiten,Federal Labour Court holds COVID test requirement in the workplace is valid,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 1 June 2022 in Case No. 5 AZR 28/22

The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) handed down its first judgment on workplace hygiene concepts and provided legal certainty for employers when adopting workplace regulations to protect against Corona risks.

Employers may impose measures which go beyond the statutory rules and recommendations applicable at the time.

The BAG grants employers a considerable margin of discretion: the protective measures adopted may not counteract the pursued objective.

Facts of the case In August 2020, after taking various structural and organisational measures to protect employees against infection with the COVID-19 virus, such as increasing the size of the orchestra pit, the Bayerische Staatsoper (Bavarian State Opera House) ordered all employees to present a negative PCR test at the start of the season.

The Staatsoper’s hygiene concept, which was based on expert advice, established this obligation.

This concept also required employees to undergo subsequent tests, although the testing frequency depended on the group to which the specific employee belonged (groups 1 to 4, depending on the risk of infection in the workplace).

The employees could choose whether to take part in the tests organised by the Staatsoper or whether to be tested elsewhere and bring the result of the test with them.

When an employee refused to take a PCR test at the start of the season, she was subsequently not given any work.

The employer also cancelled the payment of her salary.

The musician brought a claim for the payment of her salary based on the delay in acceptance and sought continued employment without any obligation to take any tests.

The judgment Like the lower courts, the BAG rejected the appeal on all counts.

If employees refuse to present the results of lawfully ordered Corona tests, they are not “willing to perform” their work.

The employee is therefore not entitled to payment of their salary for the period in which they did not work.

According to the BAG, employers are not only justified but required to regulate the working conditions to protect employees from risks and threats to life and health.

The occupational hygiene concept can include regular testing of employees, providing all other possible suitable protective measures – such as regular airing, mask wearing, etc. – have already been taken.

The orders of the Staatsoper in this case were therefore also lawful.

According to the BAG, the Staatsoper had not exceeded the scope of its discretion.

This is because, in the case of an order to take a PCR test, the employer’s intrusion on the bodily autonomy of the employee is minimal and the PCR test promoted the aim pursued by the Staatsoper – to protect against Corona outbreaks in the workplace and break through the infection chain.

The basic right to self-determination over personal data (data privacy) does not make the order unlawful.

If an employer may order employees to take tests as part of the employee protection concept, the tests will also be lawful under data protection law.

The BAG rejected the claim for work without the presentation of a Corona test because the claim was too general (so-called global claim).

The flautist’s claim for further work without testing also covered situations in which she was otherwise required – e.g., under law – to present a Corona test.

Consequences for practice This judgment of the BAG provides clarity and establishes the test that courts will apply when assessing company employee protection concepts.

In this respect, the BAG approves a considerable scope of discretion for employers.

In particular, an order for all employees to take Corona tests can be permissible.

However, this requires a well-balanced hygiene concept and other protective measures, e.g., the wearing of a mask, etc. to be taken.

If these measures do not offer adequate protection, employees can be obligated to take Corona tests."
ADVANT Beiten,Federal Labour Court holds COVID test requirement in the workplace is valid,"If these measures do not offer adequate protection, employees can be obligated to take Corona tests.

At the core of this decision is the benchmark for assessment: the Court followed the recent jurisprudence of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and determined that only those protective measures that are not suitable for achieving the employer’s aims, do not promote those aims or even oppose those aims will be unlawful.

This shows that the Court does not impose a strict standard but protects the decisions of employers.

In addition, the BAG confirms that employers may also impose measures which go beyond the statutory rules and recommendations.

Practical tips Although the legal review of such worker protection concepts is limited, companies should still develop them with care and document the considerations and decision-making process.

This is particularly true when Corona tests are to be ordered.

These can be part of the hygiene concept even if they are not required under statute.

Such measures do, however, need grounds.

The aim must therefore be clearly defined, and the tests must be necessary, suitable and appropriate in accordance with the above decision.

In this case, the aim was to detect and break infection chains.

In addition, the implementation of the testing concept must ensure sufficient protection of health data.

Still, we have tried to present the facts and judgment as objectively as possible."
ADVANT Beiten,Employer to pay compensation when information about former employee remains on company website,"Judgment of the Labour Court of Neuruppin of 14 December 2021 in Case No. 2

Ca 554/21

Many companies introduce their employees by name on the company website.

When the employer fails to delete such information promptly after an employee leaves the company, it can be expensive for the former employer, as the judgment of the Labour Court (Arbeitsgericht, ArbG) of Neuruppin shows.

Facts of the case A biologist, who worked as an office manager, was named on her employer’s public website and introduced as the company’s in-house biologist, although this was not her position.

When she left the company, the employee requested that the company delete the information from its website.

When her name and incorrect position still appeared online one year later, she sent her former employer a reminder and demanded that the company issue a cease-and-desist declaration to confirm that they had removed the information and claimed EUR 8,000 in damages.

The employer deleted the information and provided the requested cease-and-desist declaration but paid only EUR 150 in damages.

The employee then brought a claim before the Labour Court in Neuruppin, demanding payment of only EUR 5,000 in damages, minus the EUR 150 that had already been paid.

The judgment The ArbG Neuruppin ordered the former employer to pay EUR 1,000 in damages, minus the EUR 150 already paid.

The Court based its decision on data protection law, as the name of the employee is personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Under Article 82 of the Regulation, where a person suffers damage as a result of a data processing infringement, the person shall have the right to receive damages from the data controller.

In this case, it is the former employer that processed the employee’s data without justification after the employee left the company.

Due to the accompanying invasion of privacy, even non-material damage will be considered when calculating the amount of compensation to be awarded, which shall expressly serve as a warning and deterrent.

In addition, the employer had a duty to delete the data promptly after the employee left the company not just under data protection law, but as a general ancillary obligation of the (terminated) employment relationship.

The Court therefore held that compensation amounting to EUR 1,000 was appropriate.

Consequences for practice The judgment of the ArbG Neuruppin highlights the risk of liability under data protection law, which is particularly virulent when an employee leaves the company.

Employers are well advised to update the company website quickly in such cases and delete all information about the former employee.

This is especially true when the employment relationship does not end amicably, and additional areas of conflict are best avoided.

Practical tip The judgment concerns the legal use of employee information on the internet, whether it is on the company website or social media.

Such information can include names, photos and videos of the employee.

Considering the not insignificant risk of liability and an increasingly consolidated case law, employers should thoroughly assess their use of employee data in advance.

In particular, the employer must ensure that the employee has given their legally effective consent, which covers all purposes, before using any data.

Where there is subsequently no justification for the use of the employee’s data, such as because the employee did not give their consent, the infringing data must by deleted without delay.

ADVANT Beiten,Venture Capital - Draft of the Federal Ministry of Economicy and Climate Protection for a Start-up-Strategy of the Traffice Light Coalition,"Start-ups do finally receive the attention they deserve: On 1st June 2022 and for the first time, the German government presents targets and measures for a comprehensive start-up-strategy.

The details still require precise wording and legislative implementation.

Initial voices welcome the holistic approach to developing Germany and Europe into a stronger start-up location.

The draft of such strategy paper is available here (German language only).

Relevance of Start-ups Germany is a strong business location.

However, the main pillars are industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, not start-ups.

Nevertheless, the German government recognizes that start-ups are of great importance for the German economy.

At the same time, the government broadens its view and emphasizes the relevance for society in general and ecology in particular: For example, almost one-third of all start-ups perform activities in the field of climate and environmental protection, and, thus also contribute significantly to the sustainable transformation of the German economy.

According to the government's paper, start-ups are idea generators and innovation drivers and therefore create momentum, renewal and transformation.

Thus, they are materially important to promote.

Objectives The main objectives of the start-up-strategy are ambitious and have been named as follows: strengthen financing for start-ups, make it easier for start-ups to attract talent - make employee participation more attractive, igniting the start-up spirit - making start-ups easier and more digital, strengthen female start-up founders and diversity, facilitate start-up spin-offs from science and universities, improve framework conditions for public benefit start-ups, mobilize start-up competencies for public contracts, make it easier for start-ups to access data, strengthen real-labs - facilitate access for start-ups and put a general focus on start-ups.

Implementation of the Start-up-Strategy in a Nutshell At present, it is difficult for new and fast-growing German start-ups with huge capital requirements to raise sufficient funds - loans are hardly an option.

For this reason, financing is provided by government support programs and specialized public and private investors.

This is where the start-up-strategy essentially kicks in.

In summary, the financing of start-ups - in addition to many other measures - is to be conducted by the following steps: Among other things, the German government will use the future fund and its individual modules to support innovative technology-oriented start-ups in the growth phase and provide EUR 10 billion in new public funding over an in-vestment period until 2030.

In addition, the INVEST program is to be relaunched to further and sustainably stimulate the business angel market in Germany.

The effective date for a new INVEST funding guideline is targeted for 1st January 2023.

The requirements for initial public offerings (IPOs) are to be reviewed, simpli-fied and modernized.

Sales tax exemption for venture capital funds shall be implemented.

Establishment of a capital stock in statutory and private pension plans as well as a minimum investment quota in venture capital funds.

Moreover, in view of the tight applicant situation on the labour market the following priority measures are planned to attract more talents: Further development of the ""skilled labour strategy"" (Fachkräftestrategie) to simplify and accelerate the immigration of skilled workers from foreign countries, in particular by anchoring the professional and university degrees of foreign skilled workers and simplifying administrative procedures.

Improving income tax law in the context of employee participation.

Simplify accessibility of ""remote work"".

In addition, simplified ""founding"" is to be ensured with a digital (notarial) founding act for the founding of German limited liability companies (GmbH)."
ADVANT Beiten,Venture Capital - Draft of the Federal Ministry of Economicy and Climate Protection for a Start-up-Strategy of the Traffice Light Coalition,"Simplify accessibility of ""remote work"".

In addition, simplified ""founding"" is to be ensured with a digital (notarial) founding act for the founding of German limited liability companies (GmbH).

In order to increase diversity, female founders are to receive targeted support, for example through a new funding line ""EXIST Women"" or the targeted financing of diverse and female venture capital funds.

Furthermore, numerous priority measures are intended to (i) facilitate spin-offs from science and universities, (ii) improve framework conditions for public benefit-oriented start-ups, (iii) mobilize start-up competencies for public contracts, (iv) facilitate start-ups' access to data, (v) strengthen real-labs, including by creating (new) experimenta-tion clauses, and (vi) centralize the start-up ecosystem through targeted networking.

Outlook The general naming of the goals shows that many measures will still be characterized by great dynamism and that there is still a lot ""in flux"" here.

It remains to be seen whether the start-up-strategy - still intended for this summer - will be finally adopted by the traffic light government.

Then there should be more clarity about the exact legislative implementation.

Overall, the federal government is pursuing a holistic approach and will implement the strategy - as of now - in bundled measures within the current legislative period.

Annual monitoring of the development of Germany as a start-up location is also planned.

We will continue to observe the development of the start-up-strategy with interest and look forward to its implementation with anticipation.

ADVANT Beiten,Chinese Investments in Germany - Is FDI Control an Obstacle?,"In this interview, our expert Dr Patrick Hübner talks about the increasing control of Chinese direct investments in Europe and Germany.

He explains which FDI control measures exist and what influence the pandemic had on Chinese investments.

Welcome to ""Article 5"", the ADVANT Beiten Podcast.

*

My name is Jörg Hahn and I’m a former editor and journalist for a major German newspaper.

Today I’m talking to Dr Patrick Hübner about the developments in the control of Chinese investments in Europe and Germany.

Patrick Hübner is a lawyer and partner at ADVANT Beiten and is a member of the firm’s Corporate/M&A, Foreign Trade Law and China practices.

He has represented numerous clients in investment control proceedings before the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action in Berlin (which we’ll refer to as just the ""Ministry"").

We’re looking at the increasing control of Chinese investments in Europe and Germany and explore what this means for German companies looking for foreign investors from the Far East to avert impending insolvencies, bridge liquidity bottlenecks or find a successor for the company.

Jörg Hahn: Patrick, anyone following the German media over the past few years will have seen the growing scepticism towards investments from China.

The 2016 takeover of robotics manufacturer Kuka by the Chinese Midea Group was a key moment in the control of foreign investments, and it is said to have led to a change in thinking in German industry and politics.

What do you think about this development?

Patrick Huebner : In my opinion, Germany and Europe are still very attractive locations for foreign investment.

This is due to the good framework conditions, the predominantly stable political situation, good infrastructure and a large supply of highly qualified labour.

The takeover of Kuka by the Midea Group in 2016 was a key moment which led to a noticeable increase in the control of foreign direct investments in Germany, especially those from the People's Republic of China.

Germany now looks very closely at who is investing and what is being invested in.

Still, there are only a few known cases since 2016 in which foreign investments were prohibited or prevented in some other way.

This might be because FDI review procedures are not public, but it corresponds with our experience in recent years: Most of the M&A transactions subject to German FDI review are cleared by the Ministry.

This is a very good sign for Germany as an investment destination.

Jörg Hahn: Have there been any cases in the past where Chinese investments were prohibited in Germany?

Patrick Hübner:

Yes.

Six cases are worth mentioning.

The acquisition of Kuka by Midea was ultimately completed in 2016 after the US defence business was carved out.

In the same year, there was a tug-of-war over AIXTRON, an equipment manufacturer in the semiconductor industry.

A Chinese investment fund sought to take over the German manufacturer.

The deal eventually fell through due to US security concerns.

Two further cases occurred in 2018.

The first formal prohibition decision was imposed by the Ministry on the planned acquisition of the German special machinery manufacturer LEIFELD METEAL SPINNING by a Chinese state-owned company from the nuclear industry; In the second case, the German Federal Government intervened indirectly and acquired shares in German grid operator 50 HERTZ, a former Vattenfall subsidiary, through the German development bank (KfW) to prevent the State Grid Corporation of China from acquiring the shares.

In 2020, the second formal prohibition decision followed.

IMST is a German communications technology company active in the fields of satellite and radar communications as well as 5G technology which became the target of a takeover by the Casic-Group, a major Chinese state-owned defence contractor.

Since the beginning of this year, we have been reading about another two failed takeovers."
ADVANT Beiten,Chinese Investments in Germany - Is FDI Control an Obstacle?,"Since the beginning of this year, we have been reading about another two failed takeovers.

The deadline for the public takeover bid of SILTRONICS by Taiwanese chip supplier GlobalWafers ultimately expired before the Ministry had made a decision.

The takeover of German medical ventilators manufacturer HEYER MEDICAL AG by the Chinese Aeonmed-Group was vetoed by the Ministry, assumingly due to concerns for the security of the German public health care.

This marked the third formal prohibition decision.

*

* Jörg Hahn: Who are the top investors from third countries?

Patrick Hübner:

The top investors in Europe are currently the USA, followed by the UK and the PRC, which is also reflected in the number of FDI control proceedings.

Jörg Hahn: Looking at the European Commission's first Foreign Direct Investment Review Report, released in November 2021, we can see a dramatic decline in Chinese M&A transactions in 2020, falling by nearly 2/3 year-on-year.

What could be the reason for the sharp decline?

Is it just general uncertainty related to the pandemic?

Patrick Hübner: Our firm's China practice has also seen a general decline in M&A transactions with Chinese participation.

The pandemic is certainly one reason for this, but I would say it is far from the only reason.

Before the pandemic, there was already a degree of uncertainty due to the ongoing trade disputes.

The pandemic increased this uncertainty.

During the pandemic, travel restrictions were also introduced.

Many investors want to ""see and touch"" what they intended to buy, but could not do so due to the restrictions on air travel and the quarantine requirements when re-entering the PRC.

We know many investment projects have been postponed indefinitely.

And, finally, the regulatory issues already mentioned played - and still play - a particularly important role: on the Chinese side, there is the regulation of outbound investments and foreign currency outflows, and on the European and German side, there is the control of Chinese direct investments.

Jörg Hahn: At the start of the pandemic, the EU Trade Council warned of a ""European clearance sale"" and the former German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs announced the revision of Germany's foreign trade law.

What happened?

Patrick Hübner: What happened?

Over the last two years, the control of foreign direct investments in Germany and the EU picked up in speed, with Chinese investors increasingly becoming the focus of national FDI reviews, as the examples I mentioned indicate.

These protectionist efforts of the European Union against China are nothing new.

However, the pandemic became acted as a ""fire accelerant"" in the light of the feared wave of insolvencies in Europe.

At the European level, the EU Screening Regulation was adopted in spring of 2019, well before the pandemic, incidentally at the initiative of Germany, France and Italy.

Since it entered into force in autumn 2020, the EU Screening Regulation has created a uniform framework for controlling foreign direct investment in the EU.

The EU Screening Regulation can be seen as a unified European response to the increasing activities of Chinese investors worldwide and China's ambitious plans to secure global technological supremacy by 2049.

In light of the EU Screening Regulation, 24 of 27 EU member states have already either introduced an investment control regime, revised the existing regulatory framework, or launched corresponding initiatives.

In Germany, for example, there have been several amendments to the foreign trade laws that have significantly tightened up the existing FDI control regime.

We’ve definitely noticed the effects in M&A transactions with foreign investors.

Jörg Hahn: What is FDI control and what specifically does the German FDI control cover?"
ADVANT Beiten,Chinese Investments in Germany - Is FDI Control an Obstacle?,"We’ve definitely noticed the effects in M&A transactions with foreign investors.

Jörg Hahn: What is FDI control and what specifically does the German FDI control cover?

Patrick Hübner: Generally speaking, FDI control allows the respective EU member state to examine whether a foreign investment affects national or European interests related to public security.

German FDI control covers not only the acquisition of a company, but also the acquisition of shares in a German company when certain voting right thresholds are reached, as well as the acquisition of a definable part of a business or its essential operational assets.

Jörg Hahn: What specific changes have there been in the field of FDI control in Germany?

Patrick Hübner: In the past three years, the two main sets of regulations in Germany, the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act (""Außenwirtschaftsgesetz"") and the German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance (""Außenwirtschaftsverordnung""), have been revised several times.

Some related regulations, such as most recently the German Ordinance on the Designation of Critical Infrastructure (""Verordnung zur Bestimmung Kritischer Infrastrukturen""), have also been adapted.

The amendments implement three main changes: First, they expand the scope of the German FDI control.

The relevant voting rights thresholds were lowered so that German FDI control applies in some cases where only 10 percent of the voting rights are acquired.

The cases in which the Ministry must be notified were significantly expanded in terms of both quantity and quality; Second, they significantly tighten the review standard of the German FDI control, i. e. where previously an actual threat to the public security or the essential security interests was required to prohibit a foreign investment, from now it will be sufficient if there is a probable impairment of the public security or the essential security interests; and Third, the amendments extend the review period, resulting in noticeable delays in M&A transactions with foreign investors.

Jörg Hahn: What are the specific features of the current FDI control regime in Germany?

Patrick Hübner: German FDI control distinguishes between sector-specific FDI review and cross-sectoral FDI review.

Sector-specific FDI review mainly covers cases in which a foreigner, i.e. an acquirer based outside Germany including in another EU Member State, intends to acquire an interest of 10 percent or more of the voting rights in a German company involved in the defence and armaments industry.

All other acquisitions are subject to cross-sectoral FDI review, where the acquirer is a non-EU / non-EFTA investor and the acquisition meets or exceeds certain industry-specific thresholds of 25, 20 or 10 percent.

It is important to note that, where the German target company operates within a (critical) industry sector, which is particularly relevant to security, the planned acquisition must be notified to the Ministry and may not be consummated (closed) before clearance.

Jörg Hahn: To which industrial sectors does this ""mandatory notification obligation"" apply?

Patrick Hübner:

The obligation to notify an acquisition to the Ministry applies in all industry sectors that are – from the perspective of the German Government – particularly relevant to public security.

For sector-specific FDI review, these industries are the defence and armaments industry, certain products with IT security functions and certain defence-critical facilities.

For cross-sectoral FDI review, the mandatory notification obligation applies to classic industry sectors such as critical infrastructure, cloud computing, the media industry, and the healthcare sector, which was added to the list of sectors at the beginning of the pandemic."
ADVANT Beiten,Chinese Investments in Germany - Is FDI Control an Obstacle?,"The mandatory notification requirement also applies to numerous, particularly promising future technology sectors, such as artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing), automated driving or flying, robotics, semiconductors, and network technologies (keyword: 5G), but also includes areas such as cybersecurity, aviation and aerospace, nuclear technology, critical raw materials and others.

Jörg Hahn: In light of the recent tightening of German foreign trade laws, what do German companies need to keep in mind when looking for an investor from China?

Patrick Hübner: German companies seeking investors from China or planning to sell the company or parts thereof to them should address the question of whether the planned investment or acquisition may be subject to German FDI control at an early stage.

Incidentally, this applies to all non-EU investors, including those from the US, UK and Northern Ireland.

In the defence and armaments sector, it even applies to investors from other EU Member States.

In our experience, realistic timing is key.

To this end, it is important to know that German FDI control is divided into two stages, the preliminary and main proceedings, and can take up to 10 months or longer for complex transactions.

To obtain transaction security as quickly as possible, we recommend notifying the acquisition to the Ministry before the contract is concluded or applying for a certificate of non-objection.

Jörg Hahn: Let's assume a German company which does not belong to a particularly security-relevant (critical) industry sector is looking for an investor from the US or China to acquire shares in the company.

What applies?

Patrick Hübner:

Two cases must be distinguished here: If the planned investment is below the generally applicable threshold of 25 percent for investments in non-critical industry sectors, in other words, if the US or Chinese investor does not acquire control of 25 percent or more of the voting rights in the German company, the investment is exempt from FDI approval.

In this case, the acquisition does not fall under the scope of German FDI control.

If, on the other hand, the 25% threshold is reached or exceeded, the acquisition is subject to German FDI control.

However, since the German target company in our case does not operate in a critical industry sector, the acquisition does not have to be reported to the Ministry and can be closed.

Since the Ministry can still review threshold-relevant investments ex officio up to five years after the conclusion (signing) of the contract, many investors decide to apply to the Ministry for a certificate of non-objection (Unbedenklichkeitsbescheinigung) as a precautionary measure, even where notification is not mandatory, to obtain transaction security at an early stage.

Jörg Hahn: What can the Ministry do if it concludes that an acquisition constitutes a risk to public security?

Patrick Hübner:

The Ministry can prohibit the acquisition - as in the case of Leifeld Metal Spinning, IMST or Heyer Medical - or issue orders restricting the acquisition.

In our experience, however - for reasons of proportionality – the Ministry usually tries to remedy security-related concerns primarily by creating a balance of interests in the context of negotiating public-law contracts.

This is often the milder remedy compared to unilateral orders.

If a prohibition or order is issued, it does not have to be simply accepted.

Prohibitions and orders are administrative acts that can be appealed.

However, it must be noted that the Ministry has broad discretion when deciding whether an acquisition is likely to impair security-related interests, which can be reviewed by German courts only on limited grounds.

* Jörg Hahn: How many German FDI reviews have there been and which industries have been affected?

Patrick Hübner:

According to the Ministry, there were more than 300 FDI control proceedings in Germany in 2021."
ADVANT Beiten,Chinese Investments in Germany - Is FDI Control an Obstacle?,"Patrick Hübner:

According to the Ministry, there were more than 300 FDI control proceedings in Germany in 2021.

This is remarkable, as it represents almost double the number of FDI reviews compared to the previous year, despite the general decline in M&A activity.

This shows that the expansion of the type of cases subject to the mandatory notification obligation has significantly increased the Ministry's caseload of FDI reviews.

In total, more than half of the FDI reviews are attributable to US investments and, since BREXIT, to UK investments, too.

Only a small proportion of the acquisitions reviewed involved Chinese investors.

Information and communications technology, infrastructure, healthcare, and semiconductors industries have been particularly relevant for FDI control.

Jörg Hahn: Thank you very much, Patrick.

Do you have a forecast for the future of Chinese investment in Germany?

Patrick Hübner: I don’t have a “crystal ball”, but I can try.

In the next one or two years, I expect we will see an increase in greenfield investments in Germany and Europe.

Chinese companies will be entering the market and setting up new operations, making long-term investments, expanding existing market activities - such as in the field of electromobility - creating huge value for the German economy and offering many opportunities for German companies, for example in the context of cooperation and joint ventures.

With the end of the pandemic, Chinese direct investments should return.

Despite the increased number of transactions in critical industry sectors subject to mandatory notification, there is still significant investment potential in Germany and Europe, such as in Italy and France, but also Poland, for example.

Finally, most of the investments subject to the German FDI control, whether from the US or China, are ultimately approved by the Ministry.

Europe and Germany remain very attractive targets for foreign investments.

ADVANT Beiten,"""Get-to-know-each-other internships"" – caution with this stumbling block under accident insurance law","Judgment of the Federal Social Court of 31 March 2022 in Case No. B 2 U 13/20 R

When a ""get-to-know-each-other internship"" includes a tour of the company, accident insurance cover can apply through the statute of the employer’s liability insurance association.

Facts of the case An applicant for a position took a one day, unpaid ""get-to-know-each-other internship"" with the potential employer.

To this end, the applicant and the company concluded a get-to-know-each-other/internship agreement.

During the internship, the applicant took part in discussions, especially with the IT department, and went on a site tour, viewing the company’s high-bay warehouse at the end.

While viewing the high-bay warehouse, the applicant fell and broke her upper right arm.

The judgment Contrary to the defendant (the employer’s liability insurance association) and the lower courts, the Federal Social Court (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) held that this was an accident at work.

This was only because, according to its statutes, the employer’s liability insurance association provided accident insurance for persons who toured the company.

While the interests of the applicant in getting to know her potential new employer were generally not covered, these interests would not exclude accident insurance coverage in this case according to the statute of the association because the statute did not limit the coverage to persons who were visiting the company solely to tour the site.

Consequences for practice The welcome judgment of the BSG offers new opportunities for the design of get-to-know-each-other internships.

However, each company should check whether its liability insurance association has a similar rule in its statute.

This will not always be the case.

Without such a rule in the statutes, there will rarely be accident insurance coverage for such internships by operation of law.

Insurance protection coverage otherwise only applies in the case of employment within the meaning of § 2 (1) of the Seventh Volume of the Social Code (Sozialgesetzbuch), when the injured person is integrated into an external company and their instructions are subordinate to the instruction issued by the company, in particular with the respect to the time, duration, location and type of performance (see judgment of the BSG of 12 December 2013 in Case No. B 4 AS 87/12 R).

The decisive criterion is an action in the interests of another party.

In the case of a get-to-know-each-other internship, the applicant’s interests in getting to know their potential employer are paramount.

Persons who are primarily acting in their own interests are not automatically covered by accident insurance by law.

Practical tip Before any get-to-know-each-other internship commences, the applicant and the potential employer should conclude several agreements.

Care is required not only considering the stumbling block for accident insurance protection, but also to avoid an obligation to pay the applicant for the internship.

Without a contractual agreement, a get-to-know-each-other internship or work placement can give rise to a de facto and thus indefinite employment relationship, which would give the applicant a claim for remuneration for work performed.

A real ""trial work placement,"" is correctly not classified as an employment relationship, and only arises when there is no obligation on the applicant to perform any work and the trial work placement is only designed to grant the applicant the opportunity to get to know the company and their potential position.

In this case, the employee is not subject to the right of the potential employer to issue instructions nor does the employer exercise such a right and may not direct any instructions to the applicant.

Trial ‘work’ is therefore effectively ruled out.

Such a ""trial work placement"" can only be for a short period to avoid triggering any wage entitlements, in particular any claims for the statutory minimum wage."

ADVANT Beiten,Same holiday pay for all – ECJ strengthens the rights of temporary agency workers,"On 12 May 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) handed down its preliminary ruling in a case involving two temporary agency workers in Portugal (Case No. C-426/20).

They had been assigned to the user undertaking for two years based on temporary employment contracts.

At the end of the assignment, the employees still had paid leave and holiday pay owed to them.

A dispute arose between the user company and the employees about which rules applied to this settlement: a special rule for temporary agency workers which would grant the workers fewer days of paid holiday and less holiday pay in the specific circumstances, or the general statutory leave rules for employees in Portugal, which would grant the workers the same level of leave as they would have received had they been employed directly by the user undertaking.

While the special rule for temporary agency workers calculates leave and holiday pay on a pro rata basis depending on the duration of the contract, the general statutory rule grants a full year’s leave for each year of employment that commences at the start of the calendar year, as well as pro rata leave where the employment relation-ship starts or ends during the year.

The user undertaking took the view that the special rule for temporary agency workers applied and sought to compensate only the lower level of leave and holiday pay accordingly.

The national court sought a preliminary ruling from the ECJ on whether the special rule for temporary agency workers was contrary to Directive 2008/104/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on temporary agency work (Directive 2008/104/EC).

The ECJ held that the equal treatment principle established in article 5 of Directive 2008/14/EC applies, which provides that at least those substantial terms and condi-tions of employment that would apply had the workers been employed directly by the user undertaking will apply, including the payment in lieu of paid annual leave that is not taken and the payment of holiday pay.

Accordingly, a national rule, which would pay temporary agency workers less than directly employed employees, will be contrary to Directive 2008/104/EC.

This ruling should be interesting for temporary agency workers working in Germany.

Under § 7 (4) of the Federal Leave Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz, BUrlG), leave not taken by the end of the employment relationship will be compensated where could not be taken because the employment relationship ended.

In light of the judgment of the ECJ, the equal treatment principle will need to be taken into account when calculating any payment in lieu of leave as well as any holiday pay in accordance with § 11 (1) of the BUrlG. Temporary agency workers must at least be put in the same position as they would have been in, had they been employed directly by the user undertaking during the period of employment.

ADVANT Beiten,Mass redundancy notifications – “should information” remains voluntary,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 19 May 2022 in Case No. 2 AZR 467/21

The failure to provide target numbers in accordance with § 17 (3) 5th sentence of the Act against unfair dismissal (Kündigungsschutzgesetz, KSchG) does not make the mass redundancy notice invalid.

Facts of the case The employer regularly had more than 20 employees working for its business.

In the period between 18 June and 18 July 2019, the employer dismissed 17 of these employees.

The employee claimed that the dismissal is ineffective because the mass redundancy notification failed to provide all of the information that should be provided in accordance with § 17 (3) 5th sentence of the KSchG.

The judgment The Regional Labour Court of Hessen (Landesgericht Hessen, LAG) held that a mass redundancy notice is ineffective if it does not contain all of the information that should be included.

The Court based its decision on an interpretation of the KSchG in line with the EU Collective Redundancy Directive, which requires all relevant information to be provided.

This includes information about the sex, age, occupation, and nationality of the employees to be dismissed – the so-called should information – in accordance with § 17 (3) 5th sentence of the KSchG.

The LAG Hessen assumed that it would be possible to interpret § 17 (3) 5th sentence of the KSchG in line with the Directive; such an interpretation would be consistent with the wording, the hierarchy of norms, and the will of the legislator as evident from the legislative history.

On appeal, the BAG annulled the judgment and remitted the case back to the lower court.

The BAG clarified that the failure to provide the so-called “should information” in accordance with § 17 (3) 5th sentence of the KSchG does not make the mass redundancy notification ineffective.

According to the clear intentions of the legislature, failure to provide the should information does not make the mass redundancy notification invalid.

National courts cannot use an interpret the law in line with the EU Directive to break with this legislative decision.

Such an interpretation is also not advisable.

The case law of the ECJ has clarified that the information in § 17 (3) 5th sentence of the KSchG does not have to be contained in the notification, even under the EU Directive.

Consequences for practice Employers can relax, at least temporarily.

The Court decided not to establish a new hurdle for reporting mass redundancies.

Practical tip Despite the judgment of the BAG, mass redundancy notifications remain a stumbling block for effective notices of dismissal.

In the past, courts constantly established new requirements for the notification.

Employers should carefully check whether a mass redundancy notification can be avoided, such as by remaining below the thresholds or spreading the redundancy notices over a 30-day period (e.g., with multiple waves of dismissals or the use of a cleverly staggered voluntary programme).

More extensive measures will require early planning before negotiations on the reconciliation of employer and employee interests start.

ADVANT Beiten,The effect of the electronic certificate of incapacity for work on the employment relationship,"At the end of 2019, the German legislative adopted the third Act on relief from excessive bureaucracy (Bürokratieentlastungsgesetz III, BEG III), paving the way for the introduction of the electronic certificate of incapacity for work (elektronischen Arbeitsunfähigkeitsbescheinigung, eAU).

This will digitalise a large portion of the 77 million certificates issued annually, each of which has up to 4 counterparts.

It foresees various “digitalisation phases”.

Phase 1 involves the digital transfer of certificates of incapacity for work from the panel physician to the health insurance provider.

Phase 2 will replace the “yellow certificate” with a data record.

Originally, Phase 2 was to become binding on 1 July 2022.

However, the Corona pandemic has delayed the technical implementation; Phase 2 will now start on 1 January 2023.

Technical problems are not the only hurdle to implementing Phase 2.

It raises numerous labour law issues, too.

Not for all employees First, it should be mentioned that even after the implementation of Phase 2, an eAU will not be issued for all employees.

The certificate of incapacity to work in paper form will still have to be used for certain employees.

These include employees who have private health insurance and those treated by a doctor who is not a panel physician.

The same applies to rehabilitation and preventative medical institutions, and where the medical certificate is from a doctor in a foreign country.

Retrieval by employers In the future, where the employee does fall within the scope, they will no longer have to present their employer with a certificate of incapacity to work.

The employer will instead retrieve the data from the health insurance provider.

The following must be kept in mind: Employers are not entitled to take a “shot in the dark” and request data from health insurance providers without a reason.

A request may only be made after an employee has indicated an inability to work.

In addition, due to some technical hurdles, the eAU will not necessarily be available immediately after the doctor has confirmed the inability to work.

As doctors must sign the data using a qualified electronic signature, delays in the transfer can be expected.

Health insurers therefore recommend that employers first try to retrieve an eAU on the day after the employee has seen the doctor.

This does not release the employee from the obligation to inform the employer of their inability to work without delay.

Continued payment of wages and right to refuse performance One legal issue concerns the right of the employee to refuse to work.

A new subsection 1a is introduced into § 5 of the Continued Remuneration Act (Entgeltfortzahlungsgesetz, EFZG), which releases employees with statutory health insurance from the obligation to present a certificate of inability to work.

There will no longer be a “yellow certificate” to give the employer.

However, until now, the presentation of (or failure to present) this “yellow certificate” was the basis for the employee’s right to refuse to work under § 7 (1) No.

(1) of the EFZG.

While the introduction of the new subsection 1a brings § 5 of the EFZG into line with the changed circumstances, no changes are currently planned for § 7 of the EFZG.

This means that there is no express statutory rule that would justify the employer’s refusal to continue paying the employee’s wages where the employee fails to meet their obligations to have a doctor confirm their incapacity to work.

That this was not what the legislator intended is clear from both the eAU’s aim of reducing bureaucracy and from the name of the BEG III.

It is not obvious why the legislator would also want employers to bear the responsibility for the failure to present a doctor’s certificate confirming the inability to work (in time)."
ADVANT Beiten,The effect of the electronic certificate of incapacity for work on the employment relationship,"It is not obvious why the legislator would also want employers to bear the responsibility for the failure to present a doctor’s certificate confirming the inability to work (in time).

To rectify this situation and close the gap in the legislation, employers should at least be given the right to refuse to perform their duties when an employee fails to fulfil their obligation to have their incapacity for work determined by a doctor (in due time).

In the future, the employer will also be justified in contractually moving the material time for this to the first day of the incapacity for work.

In this respect, standard provisions in employment contracts which require the employee to present a certificate of inability to work from the first day of illness will be ineffective.

For older contracts, such clauses should be interpreted as being valid under the new rules so that, after the entry into force of the new legal status, the employee is required to have their inability to work confirmed on the first day of said inability, rather than requiring the employee to present a doctor’s certificate on the first day.

Practical tip:

Nonetheless, employers should still aim to adapt such clauses to bring them into line with the new law, especially if other changes must be made to the employment agreement anyway.

Employers should ensure that new contracts take the new laws into account and change the focus of the relevant contractual provisions to the determination by a doctor rather than the presentation of the doctor’s certificate.

For the transitional period, future changes to the law can be anticipated and a two-tier approach can be used accordingly.

Evidentiary value of the eAU Finally, the question arises as to whether the eAU will have the same evidentiary value as the conventional certificate of inability to work.

Conventional certificates allowed the employer to draw conclusions based on indications.

Frequently changing doctors or the use of doctors whose practices are located far away from the employee’s home could, for example, raise suspicions about the validity of the inability to work.

As things currently stand, the employer will not be provided such information because the data received will no longer indicate which doctor provided the certificate.

If the amount of information in the certificate is reduced, the evidentiary value of the certificate should be reduced accordingly.

Summary The eAU will result in a reduction in the level of bureaucracy, at least once digital communication between doctors, health insurers and employers is properly established.

Employers must also consider several new employment law features early on.

In particular, employers should address the question of how delays and glitches in the transfer of electronic certificates of inability to work will be dealt with in the future.

Clauses in employment contracts should also be slowly adjusted to bring them into line with the new system.

ADVANT Beiten,Good news from Erfurt: social plans may cap severance payments,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 7 December 2021 in Case No. 1 AZR 562/20

Many employers wonder whether severance payment caps in social plans adopted to implement operational changes constitute an impermissible disadvantage for older employees.

The grant of additional bonuses to employees who waive the right to bring an action for unfair dismissal also has employers on thin ice: is the separate works agreement effective or does it constitute a circumvention of the ban against making social plan benefits dependent on the waiver of the right to bring an action for unfair dismissal?

Does a cap in the social plan also cover these bonuses?

The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) recently looked at these and other essential operational issues.

Facts of the case When closing a site, the employer and the works council concluded a social plan.

The social plan capped severance payments at EUR 75,000.

The works agreement (WA) concluded on the same day included a “waiver bonus” (also referred to as a “turbo clause”), which employees could claim if they did not bring an action for unfair dismissal.

The WA contained neither a cap nor a clear reference to the rule in the social plan.

The employee brought an action for unfair dismissal and was awarded the maximum amount of EUR 75,000.

In addition, he claimed he had a right to the waiver bonus because it was not covered by the cap in the social plan.

In addition, he argued that the settlement cap clause inadmissibly disadvantaged him because of his age, so he should have a claim to an “unlimited” settlement under the social plan.

The judgment In contrast to the lower courts, the BAG upheld part of the claim and decided as follows: The cap in the social plan was not void because it disadvantaged older employees .

This disadvantage is objectively justified by its legitimate aim.

The cap on settlements is designed to ensure just distribution: given the limited social plan funds, all affected employees should be granted equitable bridging support.

Without a cap on the severance payments, these funds would be exhausted from reaching settlements with older employees as such employees are generally entitled to higher severance pay.

The waiver bonus in the WA was effective .

In contrast to the judgments of the lower courts, the BAG held that there was no circumvention of the ban against making payments under the social plan dependent on a waiver of the right to bring an action for unfair dismissal.

This stems from the interpretation of the WA.

In addition, by granting settlements of up to EUR 75,000, the social plan redressed the economic disadvantage faced by the employees affected by the change in operations.

The cap in the social plan does not affect the waiver bonus.

As the WA does not cap the bonus, the BAG had to interpret whether the cap in the social plan also applied to the waiver bonus.

The Court held that it did not.

According to the BAG, any other interpretation would infringe the principle of equality under works constitution law because the employee who was entitled to the maximum severance under the social plan would not receive any further payment for waiving the right to bring an action for unfair dismissal.

This would contradict the purpose of the waiver bonus.

Consequences for practice The fact that the BAG chose not to follow the lower courts but considered the common practice of simultaneously negotiating the social plan and waiver bonus (in a separate WA) to be lawful is to be welcomed.

To do this, the Court had to overturn its previous case law.

In addition, the BAG provided clear requirements for an effective cap in social plans."
ADVANT Beiten,Good news from Erfurt: social plans may cap severance payments,"To do this, the Court had to overturn its previous case law.

Practical tips If employers wish to agree on a cap in the social plan and an additional waiver bonus with the works council, the following should be kept in mind: The social plan and waver bonus provisions should be kept formally separate: A separate budget (“pot”) should be set up for each type of payment and these payments should be calculated separately; The waiver bonus should be less than the severance cap

If both payments are to be capped, the social plan and WA should contain separate rules for each (alternatively, fixed amounts can be agreed for the waiver bonus).

Where there are caps in the social plan, the severance amounts should be assessed to confirm that they are still sufficient to mitigate the expected economic losses.

ADVANT Beiten,A fixed-term employment contract is not effective where a scanned signature is used,"Judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Berlin-Brandenburg of 16 March 2022 in Case No. 23

Sa 1133/21 A scanned signature does not fulfil the written form requirements for a fixed-term agreement.

This will be the case even if the employment relationship is only supposed to exist for a few days.

Facts of the case The employee concluded 25 short-term, temporary employment contracts with the employer, a recruitment agency, over a four-year period.

The contracts were always for a term of between one and seven working days, with one of 21 working days.

Most recently, the employee worked as a hostess at a trade show.

The employment contract was for a fixed term of five working days and had a scanned signature of the managing director at the bottom.

After countersigning the contract, the employee sent the original back.

This was normal practice for agreements concluded between the parties.

The employee brought an action claiming that the fixed term of the last employment contract was ineffective.

She argued that the contract was invalid under § 14 (4) of the Act on part-time and fixed-term employment contracts (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz, TzBfG) because it infringed the written form requirement.

The employer argued that the written form requirement did not require the employer to provide the employee with an original written declaration of acceptance.

It further argued that it is an abuse of law and violates the good faith principle for the employee to bring an action based on the lack of written form after concluding 24 previous contracts in the same manner without mentioning this defect.

The judgment The Regional Court (Landesarbeitsgericht, LAG) of Berlin-Brandenburg held in favour of the employee.

The fixed term was ineffective due to a failure to comply with the written form requirement.

This requirement was set out in § 126 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and was fulfilled when the exhibitor personally signs the agreement.

The written form requirement can also generally be satisfied by electronic form.

In this case, it needs to be an electronic document with a qualified electronic signature.

A scanned signature does not fulfil the written form requirement.

The managing director did not sign the agreement himself, nor did he sign it using a qualified electronic signature.

Where a signature is mechanically reproduced, such as a scan, the document has not been signed by hand.

A scanned signature is also insufficient for the qualified electronic signature requirements.

Subsequently signing the agreement will not make the fixed term effective.

The employee did not act in bad faith or abuse the legal system.

The fact that she had not criticised the practice for the previous 24 fixed-term agreements did not prevent her claim from succeeding.

The employer’s reliance on a practice that was not legally conform was not worthy of protection.

The result of the ineffective fixed term was an employment relationship that continued until the notice of dismissal, since issued, took effect.

Consequences for practice The judgment highlights the need to comply with formal requirements.

In contrast to normal employment contracts which do not need to follow any specific form requirements, a fixed-term agreement requires written form to be effective.

If the fixed term is invalid because of a failure to comply with the written form requirement, the employment agreement will be concluded for an indefinite period.

As the judgment shows, there is no exemption for contracts concluded for a short period.

Practical tip Employers should pay strict attention to the written form requirement for a fixed-term contracts.

In principle, both parties must sign the same document.

In addition, the signed fixed-term agreement must reach the employee before the start of the contract.

The signatures of both parties must apply to the entire agreement establishing a fixed term."

It is not clear, whether he qualified electronic signature fulfils the written form requirement of § 14 (4) of the TzBfG. Some of the legal literature rejects this approach.

Numerous pending cases throughout Germany concern the question of whether the qualified electronic signature is sufficient for a fixed-term agreement to be effective.

The LAG viewed the qualified electronic signature as a form of signature by one’s own hand.

However, there has not been a judgment of the German Federal Labour Court on this matter.

For certainty, we recommend that both parties hand sign their name on the contract.

ADVANT Beiten,Vacation even if stuck in quarantine,"Judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Schleswig-Holstein of 17 May 2022 in Case No. 1

Sa 208/21 Even if you are forced to isolate at home as a close contact, you can still take leave (at home) and the employer does not have to subsequently grant leave that has already been taken while in quarantine according to a recent judgment of the Regional Labour Court (Landesarbeitsgericht, LAG) of Schleswig-Holstein.

Facts of the case Imagine: finally, your long-awaited vacation is about to start when the health authority orders you to quarantine at home as a close contact.

This is exactly what happened to an employee.

He was forced to spend his 3032 Christmas holidays alone at home.

In his view, this was comparable to being sick during his vacation and the Federal Leave Act (Bundesur-laubsgesetz, BUrlG) does not count the period of illness as leave – although, in this case, he was not incapable of working due to illness.

Accordingly, he demanded that his employer grant him the days of leave that he had lost while in quarantine.

The case came before the LAG Schleswig-Holstein.

The judgment The LAG rejected the employer’s claim to a regrant of leave.

According to the Court, the employer had fulfilled the employee’s entitlement to leave by granting the leave and paying the employee holiday pay.

All other events that disrupted his holiday fell within the employee’s general sphere of risks and were his “personal fate.”

In particular, the employer does not owe the employee a successful vacation.

Paragraph 9 of the BUrlG provides that, in the case of illness during leave confirmed by a doctor’s certificate, the days of incapacity for work do not count towards annual leave.

However, this provision does not apply in the current case.

The law does not specify what should happen in the current situation.

However, if the legislator had wanted a specific rule to apply, it had two years to adopt appropriate provisions.

Only when the employee is already unable to perform their duties due to illness are they justified in not counting this same period towards granted leave.

Consequences for practice Employers should welcome this judgment because it supports a row of decisions rejecting the “analogy” described above (= corresponding application) and thus the claim sought by the employee.

However, this has not closed the matter entirely.

Most recently, the LAG Hamm added to the uncertainty and approved the grant of new leave in light of the significance of leave entitlements under EU law.

Until the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) clarifies this issue, employers can still apply the predominant jurisprudence of the highest courts and reject the request for new leave.

Practical tip Employers can refer to the judgment in this case and reject any claim for new leave where leave was already approved, and the health authority orders the employee to go into quaran-tine during their holiday (but they are not too ill to work).

Until the BAG hands down a clear judgment on the issue, employers must accept the remaining uncertainty introduced by the judgment of the LAG Hamm.

ADVANT Beiten,No employment relationship with the user company even though (foreign) temp agency has no permit for personnel leasing,"Judgment of Federal Labour Court of 26 April 2022 in Case No. 9 AZR 228/21

Leasing workers from a foreign temp agency that does not have a permit for personnel leasing does not result in a fictional employment relationship between the user company and the worker when the agency relationship is subject to the law of another EU Member State.

Facts of the case A French temp agency sent a worker on assignment to a German company to provide consultancy services in relation to the changeover to a new ERP system (Enterprise Resource Planning, software solutions for resource planning).

The employment agreement and the agreement on the provision of services were subject to French law.

The French company did not have a German permit for personnel leasing.

After the end of the assignment, the French worker brought a claim against the German company and asked the Court to determine that an employment relationship existed between the two and sought to enforce various claims for payment.

The question of the extent to the worker had been integrated into the operations of the German company remained contentious.

The judgment The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) rejected the French worker’s claim.

Even though the French temp agency did not have a permit for personnel leasing, the Court held that no employment relationship arose between the worker and the German company.

Accordingly, there were also no payment entitlements.

The lower court assumed that §§ 9 and 10 of the Employee Leasing Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz, AÜG) were overriding mandatory national law that applies in the case of cross-border employee leasing, even when the underlying contractual relationships are subject to foreign law (in this case French law).

Where the temporary employment agency does not have a permit, §§ 9 and 10 of the AÜG provide that the employment contract between the agency and the agency employee will be invalid and a fictional employment relationship will be established with the user of the worker’s services; this fictional relationship formed the possible basis for the worker’s claims in this case.

However, the BAG did not follow this approach.

It held that §§ 9 and 10 of the AÜG were not overriding mandatory provisions under private international law (Article 9 of the Rome I Regulation).

The administrative offence provisions in the AÜG already provides sufficient punishment for breach of the permit requirement in employee leasing cases such as the present one.

Consequences for practice The judgment significantly reduces the risks in the case of cross-border personnel leasing.

Companies using such services will not face the threat of the establishment of a fictitious employment relationship in the circumstances described.

Following this logic, the contractual relationship between the temporary employment agency and the user company will remain valid – where this contract is subject to foreign law – and will need to be unwound.

In this respect, the contractual provisions agreed between the parties will prevail.

Practical tip

What’s true for purely domestic cases of personnel leasing is also true for cross-border cases: much care must be taken to correctly structure and implement the contractual relationships.

In the case of a service contract, the user company should avoid integrating the worker into the company.

In the case of personnel leasing, care should be taken to ensure, for example, that the relevant permits have been obtained.

ADVANT Beiten,Repayment obligation in advanced training agreements,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 1 March 2022 in Case No. 9 AZR 260/21 Highly trained employees are essential for any company.

It is in an employer’s interest to support the professional development of their employees.

At the same time, employers want to ensure that they will benefit from any training employees receive.

Accordingly, advanced training agreements often contain repayment obligations.

But it is not so easy to ensure that such clauses are effective, as a recent judgment of the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) again shows.

Facts of the case An employee worked as a geriatric nurse at a clinic.

She concluded a professional development agreement with her employer.

Pursuant to the agreement, the company would pay the costs of the training.

In return, the agreement contained a repayment clause, requiring the employee to repay the costs of the training if the employment relationship was terminated within a commitment period of six months and the employer was not responsible for the grounds for termination.

The employee terminated the employment relationship within the commitment period and was then asked by the employer to repay the costs of the training.

The Labour Court (Arbeitsgericht) and the Regional Labour Court (Landesarbeitsgericht) both rejected the employer’s demand for repayment.

The judgment The BAG confirmed these decisions.

In the view of the BAG, the repayment clause was ineffectively formulated in the preformulated standard contract because it unreasonably disadvantaged the employee.

The repayment clause in the advance training agreement applies where the employee terminates the agreement for any reason for which the employer is not responsible.

The case of an unforeseen, permanent inability of the employee to perform her duties, such as in the case of a serious illness, is not covered.

If the employee terminates the employment relationship before the end of the commitment period because she is involuntarily and permanently unable to perform her duties, the employer cannot have any further interest in maintaining the “meaningless” employment relationship until the end of the commitment period as it cannot use the employee’s acquired qualifications anyway.

The fact that the investment in professional development does not pay off for the employer due to the involuntary, permanent inability of the employee to perform their duties is a normal business risk.

In addition, the employee’s occupational freedom under Art. 12 (1) first sentence of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) is restricted as she must continue to work from the company until the end of the commitment period, possibly even after the expiry of the term of continued remuneration, to avoid the repayment obligation.

The restriction placed on occupational freedom by the repayment clause is not compensated by an appropriate financial advantage.

Consequences for practice The judgment confirms the jurisprudence of the BAG that the involuntary inability of an employee to perform their duties may not be covered by a repayment obligation.

The wording should therefore explicitly exempt such cases from any repayment obligation.

Practical tip Particular care needs to be taken when drafting any repayment clauses in advanced training agreements.

The case law establishes various, in part very specific requirements for this.

A repayment clause should still be included as it can cover cases in which the employment relationship is terminated due to a fault of the employee.

ADVANT Beiten,Participation in a “wildcat strike” can justify extraordinary dismissal,"Judgment of the Labour Court of Berlin of 6 April 2022 in Joined Cases No. 20 Ca 10257/21, 20 Ca 10258/21 and 20 Ca 10259/21 Downing tools to participate in a “wildcat strike”, a strike that is not organised by the union, can constitute a breach of duties and justify extraordinary dismissal without notice.

Facts of the case The employees were employed as bike couriers.

To ensure their demands were heard, the employees participated in a four-day strike.

This strike was not organised by a union but taken solely by the employees.

Despite numerous requests from the employer to end the “wildcat strike”, the employees did not take up their work again.

The judgment The Labour Court (Arbeitsgericht) in Berlin held that the extraordinary notices of dismissal with immediate effect which were issued were effective.

In doing so, the Court applied the settled case law of the labour courts.

Accordingly, industrial action is only legal when it is taken by parties able to conclude a collective agreement in order to assert the demands that they are seeking to implement through a collective agreement.

On the employee side, unions and not individual employees can sign a collective agreement.

Accordingly, a strike that is not authorised by the union cannot result in the conclusion of a collective agreement and is therefore not valid industrial action.

Consequences for practice Employers do not have to simply accept employees ceasing work without the backing of the union.

This is an unjustified refusal to work and classic labour law measures can be used to counter such unjustified action.

It must be kept in mind that the employee’s conduct will only justify a written warning and notice of dismissal when the employee does not perform their work.

Where an employee only takes part in such strikes outside of working hours, a notice of dismissal is not justified - at least for unlawful refusal to work.

Practical tip Where employees participate in “wildcat strikes”, employers should demand that the employees return to work without delay and simultaneously warn of legal consequences for their employment if they fail to comply.

If this does not have the desired effect, employers can issue notices of extraordinary dismissal with immediate effect.

ADVANT Beiten,When the bride has to quarantine: claim for damages for the cancelled wedding,"Judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Munich of 14 February 2022 in Case No. 4

Sa 457/21.

Infection ruins wedding.

This is one way to summarise the decision of the Regional Labour Court ( Landesarbeitsgericht, LAG ) of Munich.

A wedding celebration had to be cancelled because the bride had to isolate herself.

At least the bride and groom were not saddled with a loss because (fitting for Valentine’s Day) the LAG awarded damages to the employee (who was also the bride).

Facts of the case The Managing Director for the employer returned to the office after his vacation with a cold.

Despite his obvious symptoms, he didn’t isolate himself as a precaution but returned directly to work after his vacation and took part in external meetings.

The employee drove with the ill Managing Director in one car to various meetings.

Neither of them wore a mask in the car.

Then the inevitable happened: a short time later, the Managing Director tested positive for the Coronavirus.

Under the rules applicable at the time, the employee had to go into quarantine as a close contact and the planned wedding celebration could no longer take place.

The caterer, music and rented rooms: everything had to be cancelled.

The total damages were EUR 5,000.

The employee claimed this amount in damages from the employer.

She won her case before the Labour Court.

The employer did not want to pay and appealed the decision.

The judgment The LAG followed the decision of the Labour Court and found in favour of the employee.

It held that the employer had breached its duty of care through the conduct of the Managing Director and caused the wedding to be cancelled.

In the view of the LAG, the ill Managing Director should not have taken the employee with him in his car.

If he had not come into the office or had they at least driven to the meetings in separate cars, the employee would not have had to go into quarantine and the wedding could have taken place as planned.

The LAG also did not see any contributory negligence on the part of the employee that could have mitigated the circumstances (she could have worn a mask or driven in her car).

The employee could not be expected to demand that her line manager take a separate car.

In the Court’s view, this would be the same thing as the employee advising the Managing Director that he was not sufficiently considering his health and not responding appropriately.

The LAG did not want to require this of the employee, especially during a pandemic.

Consequences for practice The judgment takes a textbook approach to the catalogue of duties of employees, breach of duties, causality, and contributory negligence.

The judgment is particularly relevant in practice because it highlights the importance of each company having a hygiene concept.

A breach of the duty of care can be expensive in the circumstances and the judgment gives clear form to this duty, which is often less tangible.

Practical tip

The legislators have now bowed out of the fight against the pandemic in the workplace almost entirely.

There are almost no clear and binding rules and responsibility has shifted to the employer.

However, as the pandemic is not yet over and we can again expect to have a high number of cases in Autumn at the latest, employees should use the illusory “Corona summer break” to review and adapt existing corporate hygiene concepts.

And one should remember: in 2020 and 2021, many weddings were cancelled due to lockdowns.

And precisely these weddings (hopefully, in most cases anyway) will take place in 2022 and 2023 instead.

ADVANT Beiten,Voluntary Corona bonuses – free access for garnishing of wages?,"Judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Berlin-Brandenburg of 23 February 2022 in Case No. 23

Sa 1254/21 A Corona bonus, which is the subject of a collective agreement and is granted to all employees but does not take into account the specific burden suffered or exposure faced by individual employees during the Corona crisis, is not protected by the emoluments exemption in § 850a No. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO) and can be garnished (subject to the attachment-exempt threshold).

Facts of the case The employee had filed for private insolvency and had relinquished “all attachable claims for earnings” under his employment contract to the insolvency administrator.

The applicable collective agreement foresaw a one-off Corona bonus that would be paid to all employees without distinction for 2020 and 2021 (as a tax-free grant).

Based on the relinquishment order, the employer paid the Corona bonus to the insolvency administrator rather than the employee.

The employee brought a claim seeking to have the bonus paid (again) directly to him arguing that the emoluments exemption in § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO applied to the bonus as “danger or hardship pay”.

The judgment The Regional Labour Court (Landesarbeitsgericht, LAG) of Berlin-Brandenburg did not share this view.

Even though the provisions of the collective agreement expressly stated the aim of the bonus as “mitigating the additional burden caused by the Corona crisis,” it was still not protected against garnishment.

The emoluments exemption in § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO only applies to bonuses and premiums that are paid to employees to balance out a particular hardship that goes beyond the normal levels or a danger associated with the performance of their work.

As the rule granting the bonus payments did not differentiate based on the extent to which individual employees were exposed to particular hardship or danger due to the Corona crisis (e.g. through increased risk of infection due to frequent direct contact with customers), and the bonus was instead paid to all employee regardless of the type of work they performed, the collective bonuses only served to balance out or mitigate the “overall societal effects of the Corona crisis” without establishing a connection to the individual performance or circumstances of the performance of the work.

Considering the purpose stated in the collective agreement, this is not a “danger or hardship pay” within the meaning of § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO.

As a result, the bonus may be garnished and the employer’s payment to the insolvency administrator was legal.

Consequences for practice The judgment not only provides legal certainty – the question of whether Corona bonuses can be garnished is highly controversial (except for Corona bonuses paid to those working in the care sector, which may not be garnished under statute).

The LAG in Lower Saxony, for example, took the opposite view in an earlier decision (of 25 November 2021 in Case NO. 6

Sa 216/21)

and affirmed that the bonus was protected from garnishment.

Both Courts allowed the appeal so that the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) will now have the final say on the issue.

It is at least doubtful whether the scope of § 850a No. 3 of the ZPO should be interpreted as narrowly as it was by the LAG of Berlin-Brandenburg.

It is not apparent from the wording of the provision that the emoluments exemption only applies to bonuses that take the degree of hardship or danger faced by the individual employee into account.

Practical tip Until the BAG has issued its final clarification, employers are well advised not to pay out any Corona bonus affected by the garnishing of wages to either the employee or the attachment creditors, but to try instead to reach an agreement with the employee and the creditors that the payment will be provisionally withheld."
ADVANT Beiten,Voluntary Corona bonuses – free access for garnishing of wages?,"Where it is not possible to reach an agreement, the employer should deposit the monies with the relevant court to be held until the issue of entitlement is clarified.

The employer will otherwise run the risk of paying the wrong party so that they would have to claim the payment back from that party and repay the bonus to the other (correct) party.

If the opinion of the LAG Berlin-Brandenburg is followed, the question of exemption from garnishment will depend on the specific arrangements in the (collective or works) provisions concerning the bonus, which will necessitate the consideration and check of the specific provisions on a case-by-case basis.

ADVANT Beiten,Effective denial of pension adjustments for pension fund commitments,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 3 May 2022 in Case No. 3 AZR 408/21

The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) has provided clarification with respect to the adjustment of pension benefits for pension fund commitments based solely on profit sharing pursuant to § 16 (3) No. 2 of the Act for the Improvement of Operational Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersver-sorgung, BetrAVG).

With this judgment, the Third Senate provides employers with the opportunity to assess existing pension fund commitments for risks with respect to pension adjustments.

Facts of the case The Court was asked to consider the employer’s obligations to adjust the employer-financed portion of the company pension, which the employer had drawn from a regulated pension fund since 1 October 2011.

The pension fund had established separate assets and liabilities for different wage categories, in particular for new and legacy tariffs.

A further distinction is made within these categories for profit classes.

The pension fund entitlements of the Claimant were therefore determined by two tariffs.

The Claimant took the view that the employer had illegally failed to adjust the pension fund annuities in 2014.

In her view, the pension should have been adjusted based on the developments in the consumer price index (CPI) over the three previous years and the employer also had a duty to assess whether adjustments should be made in the future.

According to the Claimant, § 16 (3) No. 2 BetrAVG did not abolish this duty as the applicable transitional rules in § 30c (1a) of the BetrAVG constituted inadmissible retroactivity and the pension fund illegally used surpluses to build accruals for losses.

The judgment The BAG held that the employer-financed part of the Claimant’s pension was subject to pension adjustments based on the CPI for only one of the two tariffs applicable to the Claimant.

The other tariff fulfilled the conditions of the exception in § 16 (3) No. 2 of the BetrAVG, so that all pension fund surpluses related to that bond portfolio had to be used to increase the pension benefits.

The BAG also held that the exemption clause did not infringe the prohibition against allowing property to deteriorate under the EU Mobility Directive, as the new rules in § 16 (3) No. 2 of the BetrAVG do not lower the protection existing under national law, but instead makes a correction.

The Court held that there was also no inadmissible retroactivity of the transition provision in § 30c (1a) of the BetrAVG for this exemption, arguing that the legislator adopted an effective date rule that is both justifiable and fact-based.

Consequences for practice and practical tip Where the employees failed to bring a claim before 1 January 2016, the transitional provision in § 30c (1a) of the BetrA will protect employers committed to providing a company pension plan against employee demands for adjustment.

Employers should therefore review the contracts with their pension fund and check whether the contracts deal with the use of surplus in line with § 16 (3) No. 2 of the BetrAVG, which protects employers against further demands for adjustment from employees under § 16 (1) of the BetrAVG.

ADVANT Beiten,"Hot off the press from the BAG on the payment of overtime – Approved, tolerated or operationally necessary? – Good news for employers","On 4 May 2022, the German Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) handed down a decision on the payment of overtime that will have a significant impact.

The judgment deals with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the obligation of employers to establish a system of recording working time and makes a clear distinction between working time as a means of protecting the health of workers and working time in terms of the right to payment.

Facts of the Case The employee was employed as a delivery driver for a retail establishment.

His working time was recorded by way of technical recording equipment.

The start and end of his working time were set.

Breaks were not.

At the end of his employment relationship, the claimant sought payment for hundreds of hours of overtime.

He claimed that he had worked the whole time (as recorded technically) and could not take breaks because any breaks would not have left him with enough time to make all his deliveries.

The employer disputed the overtime.

In a noteworthy (and controversial) decision, the Labour Court in Emden (ArbG) found in favour of the claimant at first instance.

The Court held that the employer had an obligation to pay in accordance with the judgment of the ECJ of 14 May 2019 – Case No. C-55/18 –

[CCOO].

This judgment – which has become known as the “time clock” judgment – requires the EU Member States to compel employers to establish a comprehensive system of time recording.

As a result, the ArbG held that the employer had a direct obligation to measure, record and control the working time of its employees.

Any infringement of this obligation by the employer will result in a reversal of the burden of proof: if the employer failed to establish a reasonable system of recording time and fails to control the working time as required by the ECJ judgment, the employee must only plausibly present the number of overtime hours claimed.

In contrast, the employer then had to show that the overtime was not worked or was not necessary.

In this respect, the ArbG simply brushed aside the settled jurisprudence of the BAG on the allocation of the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence.

The Regional Labour Court of Lower Saxony (Landesarbeitsgericht, LAG) could not make much of the reasoning of the Court in Emden and essentially dismissed the action.

In the view of the LAG, the time clock judgment did not have any impact on the burden of proof and burden of producing evidence in cases involving overtime.

A claimant seeking payment for overtime will have the burdens of proof and producing evidence both for the number of hours of overtime and for their necessity.

The judgment The employee was also unsuccessful in his claim before the BAG.

The BAG shares LAG’s view that the judgment of the ECJ in the time clock case does not change anything with respect to the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence.

The central finding: an obligation to measure the daily working time is based on EU law and serves to protect the health of workers.

However, it does not have any effect on the principles for the allocation of the burden of proof under German law in a case concerning the payment of overtime.

As the claimant was unable to meet these burdens of proof and to produce evidence, there was no payment due for the supposed overtime.

Consequences for practice The judgment will be a relief for many companies.

Given the stir caused by the decision from Emden, the BAG took an important decision of principle.

The numerous cases involving overtime necessitated such a decision.

Everything remains as it was: employees must provide proof of the overtime worked and when this overtime was worked.

They must also show what work they did, and that the employer required, knew about or approved the overtime.

Derogating from this principle based on the ECJ judgment required interpretation acrobatics."
ADVANT Beiten,"Hot off the press from the BAG on the payment of overtime – Approved, tolerated or operationally necessary? – Good news for employers","Derogating from this principle based on the ECJ judgment required interpretation acrobatics.

Fortunately, the BAG clearly rejected the special approach taken by the Court in Emden.

Practical Tips Employers confronted with claims for payment of overtime must carefully assess whether the claim satisfies the burdens of proof and providing evidence.

Deficiencies in the statement of claim should be presented as part of an effective defence in the case – referring to the case law of the BAG, of course.

Companies must also ensure that conduct does not imply tacit acquiescence or that managers have not been too quick just to “sign off” on overtime.

It remains to be seen (at least until the full judgment is available), what position the BAG has taken concerning the obligation to record working time as part of employee health and safety: does the BAG consider that there is already an obligation to record working time or is action needed by the German legislator for the obligation to apply?

ADVANT Beiten,Corona update for employers,"On 16 February 2022, Germany's federal and Land governments decided to lift and reduce key Corona measures by 20 March 2022.

The public debate about mandatory vaccinations has also picked up speed, making it a good time to look at the so-called “institution-related mandatory vaccinations,” which will take effect on 16 March 2022.

(Institution-related) Mandatory vaccinations In December 2021, the legislator introduced “institution-related mandatory vaccinations” for certain areas of the healthcare sector (§ 20a Infection Protection Act, Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG).

At first, the new rules only affected healthcare facilities (“institution-related”).

However, a closer look revealed that mandatory vaccinations will also apply to some employees outside of the healthcare sector.

Against this background and considering the possible imposition of general mandatory vaccinations, employers from other sectors should keep a close eye on the arrangements and employment consequences for the new rules.

The substance of the new rules The new rules don’t impose mandatory vaccinations; they impose a duty to provide certain evidence of immunity.

By 15 March 2022, persons working in healthcare, aged care, and other care facilities must either present a vaccination certificate or proof of recovery from the virus (“2G proof”) or provide a doctor’s certificate to show that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.

When the 2G proof expires, the employee must present a new certificate within one month.

The submission requirement is based on activities within the facility and is not limited to employees of the facility.

It also includes external persons who are not just temporarily (for a few minutes) at the facility (e.g., tradesmen).

Actual contact with persons from vulnerable groups is generally irrelevant; persons working in the administration department will also be required to submit their 2G proof.

This makes it clear that the duty to provide the relevant certificates not only applies to companies active in the healthcare sector, but also to manufacturers of medical and medical technology products, as well as to various service companies (e.g., cleaning companies, tradesmen, etc.), where their employees visit healthcare facilities that are covered by the measures.

If the 2G proof is not submitted by the deadline, or if there are doubts about its validity, employers must inform the responsible health authority, which can then impose orders (e.g., disqualification from the practice of certain activities).

Practical tip:

The law does not say what form the notification and submission of personal data to the health authority must take.

Accordingly, an email will be sufficient.

For good measure, the employer should ask the authority to confirm receipt of the email.

Persons who start working for a healthcare institution after 16 March 2022 must submit the evidence before they start work, i.e., they can only be active in the facility after valid 2G proof has been presented.

Accordingly, from 16 March 2022, there will be a statutory disqualification from the practice of certain activities for new recruits who fail to provide 2G proof, while “existing employees” will only be disqualified where the relevant health authority orders.

Employers and employees may be fined up to EUR 25,000 for an infringement of an order or the statutory disqualification.

Employment law consequences Where a statutory or ordered disqualification applies to employees and they cannot be deployed elsewhere (e.g., outside the facility or in home office), the employer's obligation to pay remuneration does no longer apply in accordance with the principle of “no work, no pay”.

Practical tip:

Employers should decide how they want to deal with employees who fail to fulfil the statutory requirements."
ADVANT Beiten,Corona update for employers,"Practical tip:

Employers should decide how they want to deal with employees who fail to fulfil the statutory requirements.

If an employee can’t work elsewhere (e.g., from home, as might be the case for a nurse or someone providing nursing care for the elderly), the employee will be disqualified from that work upon the entry into force of the law and the employer won’t have to pay the employee any longer.

In light of the strict jurisprudence of the Federal Labour Court on the topic, it will only be possible to issue a notice of dismissal to the employee on personal grounds because they are no longer qualified to perform the work in exceptional circumstances.

If an employee persistently refuses to present the appropriate proof and they are likely to be permanently unemployable due to disqualification, the employment relationship can be terminated on conduct grounds, providing the employee previously received a warning for relevant conduct.

Companies that have at least a connection to the medical and healthcare sectors should assess whether employees are employed in facilities that fall under § 20a of the IfSG.

If an employee is not only temporarily active in such a facility so that 2G proof is required, the employer must demand that employees submit the relevant proof.

End of the obligation to work from home Although numerous employees are affected by the new rules in § 20a of the IfSG, the key statutory measures for the protection against the Coronavirus and the related requirements on employers will, for the most part, end on 20 March 2022.

The exact timeline for the abolition of each measure is still unknown and depends on the relevant Land.

However, the current obligation to work from home in accordance with § 28b (4) of the IfSG will expire on 19 March 2022.

This is likely to raise the question of whether employees will have to return to work from the office or whether they can continue, at least in part, to perform their duties from their home office.

Loss of the statutory special entitlement In the wake of the Corona pandemic, legislators introduced a transitional statutory entitlement to work from home for the first time.

The elimination of § 28b of the IfSG also eliminates this statutory special entitlement.

Unless employers and employees have reached an agreement on remote work, the employer can use its right to give directions and order employees to return to work at the office (this is also in line with the judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Munich of 26 August 2021 in Case No. 3 SaGa 13/21).

As many employees wish to continue working from home or working remotely, at least sometimes, many employers have already developed appropriate concepts.

Where possible, employers should exercise their right to give directions and authorise employees to work from home or work remotely, rather than grant employees a right to work from home or work remotely.

This has the advantage of making it easier to have the employee return to work in the workplace.

It should also be noted that the term “home office” is not legally established in Germany.

Colloquially, home office is often used as a synonym for both legally established terms, “teleworking” and “remote working”.

The primary difference between the two is that the Workplace Regulation applies to telework and requires the installation of a fixed workplace with a monitor in the employee’s private dwelling.

In contrast, the Workplace Regulation does not apply to remote working: employees can perform their work from any place they wish within Germany, without any difficulties, via an IT connection to the company.

The Coalition Treaty for the current “traffic light” Government intends to keep both working from home and teleworking as permitted forms of remote working.

In particular, the Treaty proposes to give employees the right to request to work from home or remotely.

Employers should only be able to refuse this request on operational grounds."
ADVANT Beiten,Corona update for employers,"In particular, the Treaty proposes to give employees the right to request to work from home or remotely.

Employers should only be able to refuse this request on operational grounds.

(Urgent) “Operational issues” can also be found, for example, in the Federal Leave Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz) or the Act on Part-time and Fixed-term Employment Contracts (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz).

Sometimes the law establishes presumptive examples, sometimes the courts have further defined the term in individual cases.

The same can be expected for “operational grounds” in relation to the request to work from home.

Naturally, the specific nature of the work may constitute an operational ground that would be opposed to working from home.

The nature of the work of an employee working in an assembly line in a production facility could conceivably prevent that employee from working from home.

The Coalition Treaty also intends to make it possible for employees to work remotely within the EU.

Currently, employers face significant risks if employees work remotely in another EU Member State (e.g., the possible establishment of a permanent establishment for tax purposes in that Member State).

Possible arrangements employers can make Unless employers have not already done so, they should develop flexible working arrangements in this context.

We recommend, that companies do this on the basis of their instruction right ( Direktionsrecht ).

In addition to avoiding giving the employee a right to work from home, this approach avoids the administrative burden of concluding a separate contract with each employee.

As the works council has a co-determination right with respect to the structuring of mobile work in accordance with § 87 (1) No. 14 of the Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz), the employer may also conclude a works agreement with the works council establishing the details for remote work.

The co-determination right covers, for example, the rules about the duration of remote working, the start and end of daily working hours for mobile work, and the place from which employees may work remotely.

Practical tip:

Employers should set detailed uniform rules that employees must comply with when working from home/working remotely (e.g., exclusive use of an encrypted wireless network).

The 3G rule for access to the workplace and rapid antigen tests are dropped The far-reaching steps of lifting the statutory corona protection measures affects in particular the 3G obligation in workplaces (§ 28b (1) of the IfSG).

This means, from 20 March 2022, employees are no longer required to show that they are immune (vaccinated, recovered or tested) unless the obligation to provide evidence for work in a healthcare, aged care, or other care institution applies (§ 20a of the IfSG, see above).

Accordingly, this also means employers no longer have to check the status of employees (vaccinated, recovered or negative test).

Practical tip:

In a few exceptional cases, such as where special circumstances exist or all employees consent, employers may continue to check the 3G status in the workplace on a “voluntary” basis.

This could be the case where the check forms part of a particularly strict hygiene concept within the workplace or where it is justified by the circumstances (e.g., employment of persons requiring special protection).

Apart from that, employers must continue to offer employees two rapid antigen tests per week (§ 4 (1) of the Covid-19 Occupational Health and Safety Regulation (Covid-19-Arbeitsschutzverordnung)) and provide medical-grade protective masks (§2 (2) of the Covid-19-Arbeitsschutzverordnung).

With the lapse of the regulation on 20 March 2022, these obligations will also cease to apply to employers.

How exactly employers will continue to ensure basic protection and which specific measures they will have to follow remains to be seen.

We will let you know.

ADVANT Beiten,Strengthened rights for (severely) disabled employees during the first six months of employment,"Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 10 February 2022 in Case No. C-485/20

Most employees don’t feel entirely secure in their employment relationship during the first six months – rightly so.

The strong general protection against unfair dismissal, which applies to all employees equally, and the stricter special protection against unfair dismissal which applies to groups that are worthy of protection, such as severely disabled persons, normally only starts once the employment relationship has existed for an uninterrupted period of six months.

Often, the parties agree on a probationary period with a significantly reduced notice period.

In a recent judgment, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) significantly reduced this uncertainty during the first six months, at least for (severely) disabled employees.

The Court held that the employment of a (severely) disabled person can only be terminated during the probationary period where certain conditions are fulfilled.

Facts of the case The claimant was employed as a railway track maintenance technician for a Belgian railway company and was still a trainee.

He was diagnosed with a heart condition and fitted with a pacemaker.

As the pacemaker was sensitive to electromagnetic fields, he could no longer be employed to work near the railway tracks.

In addition, he was recognised as having a disability.

The employee was then employed for three months as a warehouseman and later dismissed on the grounds that he was unable to perform the duties for which he had been recruited.

In contrast to statutory staff members, during the training period, employees did not have the right to be reassigned to another position.

The judgment The ECJ was asked to decide whether this approach was compatible with the requirements of Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.

This Directive requires “reasonable accommodations” to be made for people with disabilities.

The Court held that the Directive applies to all employees, even trainees.

Accordingly, a disabled employee must be reassigned to another position rather than have their employment terminated, unless this would impose an unreasonable burden on the employer.

To assess whether such measures would constitute a disproportionate burden, the financial burden, the size, financial resources, and total turnover of the company, as well as the possibility of obtaining public funding or other assistance will be decisive.

There must also be a suitable vacant position that the worker is capable of performing given their skills and abilities.

This must be determined in advance.

Consequences for practice This judgment will also have an impact on the German legal system: in Germany, a severely disabled employee only has special protection against dismissal after six months of uninterrupted employment.

This was an attempt by the German legislator to remove an obstacles to the employment of workers with a severe disability because an immediate increase in the level of protection against unfair dismissal for employees with a severe disability could act as a deterrent for some employers and thus reduce the number of opportunities on the employment market for severely disabled applicants.

This judgment could thwart the conscious decision of the legislators and its desired effect.

During the first six months of employment, employers in Germany must now also respect at least a toned-down protection against dismissal.

Before dismissing an employee with a (severe) disability, the employer must check whether the employee may be reassigned in accordance with the guidelines established by the ECJ.

This could result in companies being less willing to employ persons with (severe) disabilities.

ADVANT Beiten,Fairplay and cancellation agreements – Time to think or sign immediately?,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 24 February 2022 in Case No. 6 AZR 333/21

In 2019, the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) established for the first time that a cancellation agreement will be void when it was concluded in disregard to the principle of fair negotiations (Judgment of the BAG of 7 February 2019 in Case No. 6 AZR 75/18).

This principle will be infringed, for example, when one party creates or exploits a situation of psychological pressure to make it significantly more difficult or even impossible for the other party to reach a voluntary and considered decision.

For the BAG, whether such a situation exists will depend on the facts in the specific case.

Recently, the Court had the opportunity to decide such a case.

The BAG held that an employer does not have to give an employee time to think before concluding a cancellation agreement.

Facts of the case The dispute concerned the continuation of the employment relationship after the conclusion of a cancellation agreement.

On 22 November 2019, the managing director and the defendant’s later lawyer held a meeting with the employee in the managing director’s office.

They alleged that the employee had changed the sales prices in the IT system without authorisation in order to simulate higher profits.

After a break of about ten minutes (in which the managing director, the lawyer and the employee sat silently in the room), the employee signed the prepared cancellation agreement which would end the employment relationship on 30 November 2019 (the normal notice period was six months; the offer did not contain any settlement).

Other details of the discussions were disputed.

On 29 November 2019, the employee brought a challenge to the cancellation agreement claiming that she was unlawfully coerced and wanted her job back.

She claimed she was threatened that if she didn’t sign the agreement, she would be issued with a notice of termination of employment with immediate effect and a criminal complaint would be filed against her.

She was not given long to think about her options, nor was she allowed to obtain legal advice.

She claimed that this constituted an infringement of the principle of fair negotiations.

The Labour Court found in favour of the employee, while the Regional Labour Court reversed the decision and dismissed the claim.

The judgment The employee’s appeal was unsuccessful.

The cancellation agreement is effective.

The BAG was unable to ascertain any illegal coercion.

According to the BAG, given the circumstances in the case, a reasonable employer could seriously consider issuing a notice of termination of employment with immediate effect and filing a criminal complaint.

The employer also did not negotiate unfairly.

In this respect, the BAG followed the judgment of the Regional Labour Court on appeal.

The employee’s freedom of choice was not violated by the fact that the cancellation agreement was only on offer if she signed it immediately so that she could not delay her decision.

Consequences for practice Little by little, the BAG has provided clarity concerning the principle of fair negotiations and has been reticent in applying the principle, which is to be welcomed.

The principle should be applied restrictively, as employees already have adequate protection through the right to challenge the validity of a cancellation agreement on grounds of deception or coercion.

According to the press release, time pressure will not automatically be an indication of unfair negotiations.

The BAG also makes it clear that, in the specific situation, the employer was justified in considering issuing a notice of extraordinary termination of employment and filing a criminal complaint.

The question of illegal coercion must therefore be answered in the negative in this case.

Practical tip The full judgment of the Court, when it is available, will provide greater legal certainty."
ADVANT Beiten,Fairplay and cancellation agreements – Time to think or sign immediately?,"The question of illegal coercion must therefore be answered in the negative in this case.

Practical tip The full judgment of the Court, when it is available, will provide greater legal certainty.

However, the fact that a cancellation agreement can be conditional on its immediate signing is welcome from an employer’s perspective.

It is also already clear that the evidence of the discussions and circumstances in which they took place will be important in such situations.

Employers should take detailed minutes of any severance talks and always ensure that a witness is present.

If, as the BAG rightly states, a finding of coercion and a breach of the principle of fair negotiations will depend on the facts of the case, employers are well-advised to examine and document the circumstances of the specific case.

ADVANT Beiten,Leave can be cut while on short-time work,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 30 November 2021 in Case No. 9 AZR 225/21

The Federal Labour Court (BAG) recently decided that annual leave can be cut proportionately when whole workdays are not worked because of short-time work.

This judgment is the second wide-reaching decision of the Court in connection with the Corona pandemic (after its judgment on the continued payment of wages where there are site closures during lockdown).

Facts of the case The claimant works part-time as a sales assistant (3 days per week).

She has an annual leave entitlement of 14 days (28 days in the case of a 6-day week).

During the Corona pandemic, the defendant introduced short-time work.

In June, July and October 2020, the employee had short-time work with zero hours work based on a short-time work agreement.

In November and December, the employee worked for a total of five days.

The company, therefore, recalculated the employee’s annual leave for 2020 at just 11.5 days.

The employee claimed that she was due a further 2.5 days of annual leave.

The Regional Labour Court of Dusseldorf (LAG Düsseldorf, judgment of 12 March 2021 in Case 6 Sa 824/20) held in favour of the employer.

According to § 3 (1) of the Federal Leave Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz, BurlG), no leave was acquired during the three months of short-time work with zero workdays.

The annual leave was reduced proportionately.

The judgment The BAG followed the view of the LAG Düsseldorf.

According to the press release, the Court reasoned that the loss of whole workdays due to short-time work justified a recalculation (“reduction”) of the leave entitlements during the year.

Under § 3 (1) of the BurlG, an employee is entitled to 24 workdays of paid leave where the working time is spread evenly over six days in the week.

If the weekly working time is spread over fewer or more than six workdays under the employment agreement, the leave entitlement must be calculated in light of the work rhythm applicable for the leave year in according with the formula (24 workdays x number of days the employee has to work divided by 312 workdays).

The loss of workdays due to short-time work justifies the recalculation of the leave entitlement.

Based on the contractually agreed short-time work, lost workdays are not to be equated with periods that the employee has to work either under national or EU law.

The employee’s leave entitlements for 2020, therefore, did not exceed the 11.5 workdays calculated by the company.

Calculated on the basis of the three months in which the employee did not work at all, the employee has leave entitlements of only 10.5 workdays (28 workdays x 117 workdays with work obligations divided by 312 workdays).

Consequences for practice The judgment of the BAG brings much needed legal certainty for many employers.

If whole workdays are not worked due to short-time work, this will reduce the annual leave entitlement accordingly.

Employers now have legal certainty of their right to reduce employee leave during the next short-time work period, where this is desired from a corporate policy perspective.

The decision is not limited to longer periods of short-time work with no work (at least according to the press release).

The BAG uses the general term “whole workdays not worked” as a result of short-time work, which necessitates a recalculation of the leave entitlements.

However, there are often also “whole workdays not worked” for pro rata short-time work, too.

The opinion of the Court should provide more clarity in this respect.

Practical tip Annual leave can be reduced proportionately in the case of short-time work where whole workdays are not worked.

The following formula should be used to calculate the reduced leave: (Number of leave days x Number of individual days with work obligations) / 260 (for a 5-day working week) or 312 (for a 6-day working week)

The reduction should be undertaken as soon as possible when there is short-time work."
ADVANT Beiten,Leave can be cut while on short-time work,"The reduction should be undertaken as soon as possible when there is short-time work.

Where the duration of the short-time work is unclear, the leave entitlements should be recalculated each month and communicated to the employee.

In particular, any reduction should be entered into the relevant HR management system without delay.

This will limit the number and scope of cases in which employees take leave that they are no longer entitled to after the recalculation.

ADVANT Beiten,Enforcing the rule of law in the EU – the European Court of Justice upholds the conditionality regarding the budget,"The European Court of Justice approves the conditionality mechanism Today, the European Court of Justice upheld the conditionality mechanism which makes the receipt of financing from the Union budget subject to the respect by the Member States for the principles of the rule of law, see judgments in Cases C-156/21 and C-157/21.

The Regulation 2020/2092 on a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget establishes a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget in the case of breaches of the principles of the rule of law in a Member State.

In order to attain that objective, the regulation allows the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, to adopt protective measures such as the suspension of payments to be made from the Union budget or the suspension of the approval of one or more programmes to be paid from that budget.

The full bench of the European Court of Justice has rejected challenges to these rules.

The Union is founded on common values and compliance by the Member States with the common values is a condition for the enjoyment of all the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to a Member State.

The sound financial management of the Union budget and the financial interests of the Union may be seriously compromised by breaches of the principles of the rule of law committed in a Member State.

The rules are not designed to penalise a Member State for breaches of the rule of law as such.

The European Commission has now to review the breaches of the rule of law in several Member States and to propose the necessary actions in order to safeguard the Union budget.

Upholding the rule of law is and remains fundamental for civilized societies While many believed that the checks and balances established over centuries in the Western world would withstand any assault on the rule of law, and would moreover be adopted by many other countries, not least the Eastern European countries having acceded the European Union, the developments over recent years have proved otherwise.

Upholding the values of the European Union Upholding the values enshrined in the EU founding treaties, as developed, and set forth in Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Union, has always been a formidable task for the European Union institutions.

While the so-called infringe-ment procedure against an EU country that fails to implement EU law (for instance for not implementing EU legislation on the protection of the environment) is widely accepted, an action against a Member State for disrespecting the EU's fundamental values is not.

EU Member States have raised concerns about the rule of law in Austria, when the Freiheitliche Partei Österreich acceded to power under its leader Jörg Haider more than twenty years ago, and more recently with Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Article 2 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) establishes as core values that ""The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.

These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.""

Article 7 TEU sets forth a procedure in two steps: If they consider that there exists a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2, the European Parliament, the European Commission, or one-third of Member States can ask the European Council to make such a determination.

For the Council to adopt such a determination, four-fifths of the Member States must agree and the Parliament consent.

The majority threshold is high, but less than the unanimity requirement for taking the next steps.

The next steps are a formal warning, and ultimately sanctions and the suspension of voting rights."
ADVANT Beiten,Enforcing the rule of law in the EU – the European Court of Justice upholds the conditionality regarding the budget,"The majority threshold is high, but less than the unanimity requirement for taking the next steps.

The next steps are a formal warning, and ultimately sanctions and the suspension of voting rights.

This is where procedures have stalled in the past against Hungary and Poland.

Both countries obtained the support of at least each other which was insufficient to forestall a decision in the first phase, but enough to stop the second step, i.e. sanctions or the suspension of voting rights.

The Article 7 TEU decision-making process is arduous, and the unanimity requirement is an obstacle to success to act against very serious threats, such as the Polish Constitutional Court stating that several articles of EU Treaties are incompatible with Poland's constitution.

Will new instruments freezing the flow of money be more effective?

In view of the deadlocks encountered in Article 7 TEU proceedings, a new instrument was devised, consisting in withholding EU money to the Member State in question.

The new rules were adopted in Regulation 2020/2092, despite the fierce opposition of Hungary and Poland in the negotiations concerning the EU budget and the extra budgets for overcoming the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, € 800 billion next-generation stimulus fund.

Hungary and Poland challenged the rules in the European Court of Justice.

In summary, they argue the new rules circumvent the Article 7 procedure and have nothing to do with the protection of the EU budget.

The Court has now rejected the arguments; the new rules are not to penalize a Member State for breaches of the rule of law as such but for the distinct issue of protecting the budget.

The judgment has paved the way for action by the EU and made it easier to fight for EU core values.

Any procedure must be initiated by the European Commission and decisions using the new mechanism must be made by the Council.

But unlike the Article 7 TEU sanctions mechanism requiring unanimity among Member States, decisions to freeze funds may be made by qualified majority.

This means that it becomes more difficult for a country to find enough like-minded countries in order to veto a decision.

A number of Member States and the majority of the European Parliament are adamant that the Commission starts using the rules, with the Parliament even considering legal action against the Commission for dragging its feet.

Moreover, two big Member States are more than hesitant to support decisive actions against Hungary and Poland.

The struggle to find a coherent and strong response to the challenges of the rule of law is not over.

At this moment, a number of issues await decisive action, from the dispute over the appointment of judges in Poland, to lignite mining at the Turow open pit mine on the border with Saxony and the Czech Republic to the Romanian Constitutional Court arguing that Romanian law overrides EU law.

ADVANT Beiten,Accident insurance protection applies to the “domestic commute” from the bed to the desk in the home office,"Judgment of the Federal Social Court of 8 December 2021 in Case No. 2 B U 4/21 R The Federal Social Court (FSC) extends accident insurance protection in the home office: the way from the bedroom to the desk is now also an insured way to work when the employee intends to start work immediately.

Accident insurance protection no longer starts with “walking through the front door of the house.”

Facts of the case The employee was on his way to work from his bedroom to his home office downstairs.

Normally, he starts working immediately and does not have breakfast first.

While walking down the spiral staircase between the two floors, he slipped and broke one of his thoracic vertebrae.

Based on the previous jurisprudence of the Federal Social Court, the employers’ liability insurance association and the Regional Social Court (Landessocialgericht, LSG) of North Rhine-Westphalia (Judgment of 9 November 2020 in case L 17 U 487/19) both rejected his claim for an accident at work.

The judgment >The FSC reversed the decision of the LSG of North Rhine-Westphalia and confirmed that it was an accident at work.

Previously, the FSC has drawn a clear border, so that the way to work only started with “walking through the front door of the house”.

The FSC has now abandoned this border in the case of working from home.

According to the FSC, an employee who falls on the way directly from their bed to their home office is protected by statutory accident insurance.

The route taken to start work in a home office is performed in the interests of the employer and should therefore be insured as a path at work.

Consequences for practice With this judgment, the FSC extends its accident insurance protection for employees working from home.

It should be noted that this case stems from an accident that occurred in 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic.

The obligation to work from home during the pandemic did not play a role.

The decision also did not concern the explicit statutory extension of industrial accident protection to the home office and remote working, which entered into force on 18 June 2021 – as implemented through the new § 8 (1) third sentence of the Seventh Volume of the Social Code (Sozialgesetzbuch, SGB VII).

The present situation has become significantly more relevant since 2018, and the decision is likely to be relevant to numerous older cases simply because of the Corona pandemic.

By recognising the “domestic route to work” as an insured route, the FSC abandons its restrictive case law based on its previous legal position.

This brings the judgment into line with what the legislator is seeking to achieve with the new § 8 (1) third sentence of the Seventh Volume of the Social Code: comprehensive accident insurance for remote working and working from home.

Further cases will be needed to clarify when the rule applies and will probably follow.

Practical tip The extended accident insurance protection has made remote work and working from home even more attractive for employees.

Employers should therefore think now about how they will deal with employee requests to continue using the current proven working model after the end of the Corona pandemic.

The clock can no longer be turned back on these developments.

Employers should therefore prepare themselves now.

ADVANT Beiten,Start-Ups offer a “young team”: no discrimination based on age,"Judgment of the District Labour Court of Berlin-Brandenburg of 1 July 2021 in Case No. 5

Sa 1573/20

A job advertisement referring to a “young team” could indicate discrimination against older applicants.

However, depending on the wording of the advert, the assessment might be different in the case of a start-up.

If you want to avoid becoming a breeding ground for compensation claims, avoid any direct or indirect reference to age – regardless of whether young or old – in job adverts.

Facts of the case Approximately two years after it was founded, a start-up advertised a job for a position as a “Key Account Manager”.

In the ad, the company stated that it offered a “young team with flat hierarchies that give you real freedom”.

An applicant, who was born in 1972, received a letter informing them that their application had been unsuccessful.

The applicant took this as an opportunity to claim compensation and brought an action before the labour court. 


The applicant claimed that the letter of rejection showed unlawful discrimination on the basis of age.

The applicant submitted the job advert as an indication of this discrimination.

They claimed that the wording “young team” showed that the company was targeting younger applicants.

The start-up argued that “young team” didn’t refer to the age of any applicants, but to the relatively short period since the start-up had been established.

The judgment The applicant was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation before both the Labour Court and the Regional Labour Court and both Courts dismissed the case.

The Courts couldn’t identify any discrimination against the unsuccessful applicant based on age.

In particular, the Courts held that the wording “young team”, as described in the job advert in this case, did not constitute any indication of an unlawful disadvantage due to age.

The reference to a “young team” in a job advert can indicate an expectation that the successful applicant should be “young” to fit in well with the team.

If this was the case, the Courts probably would have found in favour of the applicant.

However, the Courts understood the words “young team” to have a different meaning in this specific case.

Since the company introduced itself in the opening few passages as a start-up that had only existed for a few years, the reference to a “young team” should be understood as paraphrasing “a workforce that has only existed for a short period.”

Consequences for practice Adverts for positions vacant may not violate any of the prohibitions against discrimination on the grounds listed in § 7 (1) of the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, AGG).

This is written in black and white in § 11 of the AGG.

Job adverts referring to the age of the desired applicant should be avoided.

Employers otherwise risk claims for compensation from unsuccessful applicants.

Job adverts will be considered discriminatory on the basis of age when they make specific age stipulations (e.g., “at least 30 years old” or “Maximum age of applicants: 45 years old”) or provide age brackets (e.g., “18 to 35 years old”).

However, even seemingly neutral criteria can constitute discrimination based on age.

This can include a reference to a “young team”.

In the above case, the company was able to rely on the fact that it was a start-up.

In other cases, unsuccessful applicants have won claims for compensation where there was a reference to a “young team” in the job advert.

Practical tip

Regardless of whether your company is a newly established start-up or one that has been active on the market for a while, you should avoid using the word “young” in the job adverts.

Start-ups can of course refer to the fact that they were recently established.

They can use the year of establishment or the term “start-up” in the job advert, for example.

Descriptions that use the adjective “young”, such as “young team” or “young company,” should be avoided as a precaution."

ADVANT Beiten,Who is Mister X? The anonymous claim for performance of a collective agreement,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 13 October 2021 in Case No. 4 AZR 403/20

If a workers’ union brings an action for the implementation of a collective agreement, the affected union members do not have to be named in the action (at first).

The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) again confirmed that employers must fulfil purely contractual obligations arising under a collective agreement.

The workers’ union can enforce this right to implementation by way of a claim for performance, but it will be limited to those employees who are members of the union.

Facts of the case At the heart of the case was a dispute between the Bayerischen Jounalisten-Verband e.V. (Bavarian Journalism Association) and the Bayerischen Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting Service) about the implementation of collective agreements.

The employer and the union had concluded various works agreements, which also allowed for rules concerning the remuneration of personnel with the same status as employees.

The basis for this remuneration was to be a so-called fee framework for television and radio.

In December 2016, the employer changed its remuneration practice and started paying personnel with the same status as employees a daily rate rather than in line with the agreed fee code.

The union saw this as a breach of the collective agreement and sued the employer for implementation (application of the fee code) for all personnel with the same status as employees, without naming these persons in the suit.

The union was unsuccessful before the two lower courts.

The Courts held that the action was inadmissible because the claim did not specify the names of the affected persons.

The judgment The union persisted and had at least some success on appeal.

The BAG held that the employer breached its implementation obligations under the collective agreement.

The per diem reporters had to be paid in accordance with the special fee code agreed in the collective agreement.

The payment of daily flat rates contradicted the rule in the collective agreement.

The union can bring an action to force compliance with the collective agreement.

In bringing this action, which logically can only apply to union members, the union does not have to specify the names of the persons working for the employer to whom the suit relates.

The union can – and this is the important part of the judgment –commence the action without naming names, i.e. to bring the action on behalf of an anonymous union member to enforce the rights of the members.

This prevents the employer from learning who is a member of the union.

In contrast to the judgment of the District Labour Court, the BAG held that the admissibility of the claim did not require the affected union members to be named in the main proceedings.

Consequences for practice The judgment is particularly important from a procedural perspective as the right to claim performance has been recognised for a while.

Since the union did not specify the union members in its lawsuit, the lower courts rejected the claim as inadmissible because it infringed § 253 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung).

This provision is designed to allow the defendant, in the case of judgment against them, to readily recognise what they need to do to comply with the judgment.

This is in line with the BAG’s long jurisprudence in this area.

The Labour Court and the Regional Labour Court held that this requirement was not fulfilled because the claim only referred abstractly to “members of the union”.

The lower courts found the employer would not know exactly what it had to do.

The BAG relaxed this certainty requirement, making it possible for unions to bring an action for enforcement of a works agreement without revealing the names of the employees who fall under the collective agreement."
ADVANT Beiten,Who is Mister X? The anonymous claim for performance of a collective agreement,"As the employer is not allowed to ask an employee whether they are a member of a union, the union does not have to reveal the names of its members in any claim for performance.

Practical tip Employers that are confronted with performance actions from unions have lost a procedural plea against the admissibility of the claim as a result of the judgment of the BAG.

However, the BAG also assumes that the names of the workers will have to be provided to the defendant/employer sooner or later.

The fact that the court affirms the claim for performance is not enough to directly result in payment entitlements for individual members.

Employees who seek to invoke the more advantageous rules of remuneration, for example, must eventually reveal that they are a member of the union and fall under the collective agreement to benefit.

ADVANT Beiten,NFT Art: Big Hype – Many Open Legal Questions!,"The art market for non-fungible tokens (in short, ""NFTs"" ) is booming!

The sale at auction by Christie’s in March 2021 of the digital artwork "" Everydays: The First 5000 Days "" by the artist Beeple for the (then) record price of USD 69.3 million for an NFT artwork was only the opening bell.

Since then, the hype surrounding NFT art 1 has continued to grow explosively and the ties between the classic art world and the digital art and crypto-scene have developed at tremendous speed.

Christie’s started a collaboration with the NFT marketplace Open Sea and held its first auction via this platform in December 2021.

The competition is not sleeping either.

Since the start of 2021, Sotheby’s operates an auction house in the interactive virtual world Decentraland.

Users can trade in NFT art and other digital works via this digital auction house.

In October 2021, Sotheby’s also announced that it was taking the next big step towards connecting the analogue and virtual art worlds with the launch of its own NFT trading platform under the name "" Sotheby’s Metaverse "" .

A further sensation followed at the start of December 2021 with the auction of the NFT artwork "" the Merge "" by the artist PAK through the NFT trading platform Nifty Gateway for a record total sum of USD 91.8 million.

In this case a complex procedure was used to split the work and the related NFTs into a total of 266,455 shares (""fractionalisation"") , which were sold to more than 28,000 buyers.

Given the total sales price, ""the Merge"" not only broke Beeple’s record for the most expensive NFT artwork, but it also took the record for the most expensive artwork of a living artist ever sold in a public sale.

But what makes digital NFT art so valuable?

To answer this question, it helps to recognise the key problem with traditional digital art: it can be easily reproduced identically.

It was impossible to create a unique digital artwork.

After its release, an artist could no longer control whether her work was copied or shared.

Digital art is therefore an ideal use case of blockchain-based NFTs.

NFTs are ""non-fungible"" by definition, i.e. they cannot be exchanged and are thus unique.

They are the opposite of ""fungible tokens"", which can be exchanged and are primarily used for cryptocurrencies.

If a digital artwork is linked to a unique NFT (""tokenisation"") , the resulting certificate allows the owners to show that they are the exclusive owner of the linked digital artwork.

This makes the tokenised work a kind of original digital artwork.

Thus, digital art becomes really tradeable for the first time.

As a result, interest in buying digital art has increased exponentially and sales prices have exploded in the last year.

There are countless further examples for the booming NFT art market.

With one record price chasing the other, the question arises how legally secure the trade of NFT art is.

This article provides an overview of the various existing legal issues and current discussions related to NFT art under German law.

I. Technical background Before delving into the legal issues related to NFT art, some basic knowledge of the main features of blockchain-based NFT technology is useful.

A blockchain 2 is essentially a constantly expanding, decentralised public database, which is continuously updated via a limitless number of participating computers (""nodes"") in a global network.

This database consists of individual blocks in which specific information of the blockchain participants (e.g. transactions) can be saved.

The blocks are cryptographically connected, so that every new block clearly references the previous blocks in the chain.

This linking ensures that the data saved in the previous blocks cannot be subsequently changed.

Since the whole blockchain is stored by all nodes, it is also not possible to manipulate the data from a central location.

Within a blockchain, assets are represented by NFTs."
ADVANT Beiten,NFT Art: Big Hype – Many Open Legal Questions!,"Since the whole blockchain is stored by all nodes, it is also not possible to manipulate the data from a central location.

Within a blockchain, assets are represented by NFTs.

NFTs can only be created (""minting"") on programmable blockchains (e.g. Ethereum).

Such blockchains allow NFTs to be minted through ""smart contracts"" .

These are not contracts in a legal sense, but transaction codes, which represent certain contractual provisions technically, and document and control their execution.

It is not possible to make subsequent changes to smart contracts due to the described functionality of the blockchain.

Each NFT has a ""token-ID"" and is clearly identifiable through this token-ID in combination with the smart contract address, through which the NFT was generated.

In addition, the smart contract of an NFT can contain specific information about the asset represented by the token, as well as the identity of the owner.

If the token represents a digital artwork, the smart contract normally contains only a link to the image file and not the file itself.

Various configurations are possible.

For the Beeple NFT described above, the smart contract was linked to a ""IPFS hash"" .

This is a unique cryptographically generated fingerprint of a data file.

The Beeple NFT did not link directly to the hash of the image file, but to a text file that contained the most important metadata about the image.

The actual image file of the Beeple artwork can be found via another link.

II.

Many open legal issues Given the recent headlines about sales of NFT art, it is not surprising that the legal literature has also started to look more closely at this topic over the past few months.

Since there is no law in Germany yet that establishes a clear legal classification of NFTs or NFT transactions and other issues in this connection, the debate about the NFT phenomenon has been lively and open.

This article provides an overview of the main issues raised in this debate so far.

1.

Similarity to ownership As NFTs are not corporal objects within the meaning of Sec.

90 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) , there is no ownership of NFTs according to Sec.

903 BGB.

Instead, it might be possible to apply Sec.

903 BGB analogously.

The unintended loophole (planwidrige Regelungslücke) in German law necessary for such an analogue application should exist since the legislator has presumably not yet considered the issue.

In addition, the interests of the owner of an NFT can be compared to those of an owner of a corporal object.

Exactly like ownership, the NFT has, in a sense, an ""assignment and exclusion function"" (Zuordnungs- und Ausschlussfunktion) because it is assigned to a particular user via the smart contract and other users are excluded from using it.

The assignment of the NFT to a single authorised user and the transparency guaranteed by the smart contract should also sufficiently fulfil the ""principle of publicity and certainty"" (Publizitäts- und Bestimmheitsgrundsatz) required under German property law.

Given this similarity of NFTs to ownership, an analogue application of Sec.

903 BGB seems justifiable.

The legislator could provide clarity by establishing a legal fiction (comparable to Sec. 2 (3) of the German Electronic Securities Act (Gesetz über elektronische Wertpapiere) ), through which NFTs are considered objects within the meaning of Sec.

90 BGB.

There is also a discussion that NFTs should be classified as ""another rights"" (sonstige Rechte) within the meaning of Sec.

823 (1) BGB.

The owner of an NFT should have the ownership-like position necessary for this, as outlined above.

The classification of NFTs as ""another rights"" within the meaning of Sec. 823 (1) BGB therefore seems reasonable too.

2. Relevance of minting under copyright law The debate also covers the issue of whether minting an NFT tied to a digital artwork results in a use of this work that is relevant under German copyright law."
ADVANT Beiten,NFT Art: Big Hype – Many Open Legal Questions!,"Since the smart contract normally only contains a link to the digital artwork (see above under I), minting does not constitute a reproduction (Vervielfältigung) of the artwork within the meaning of Sec.

16 of the German Act on Copyright and Related Rights ( Gesetz über Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte, UrhG) .

A use of the work in form of ""making it available to the public"" (öffentliche Zugänglichmachung) in accordance with Sec. 19a UrhG by inserting the link in the smart contract will normally also not apply if the originator has put the work online.

In this case, minting is not an act of use that is relevant under German copyright law.

3.

Which rights of use does the buyer obtain?

Whether the buyer of an NFT also acquires the rights of use to the artwork represented by the NFT depends on the intentions of the parties in each case.

An NFT transaction does not always result in a transfer of rights of use.

The agreement should therefore be transparent with respect to which rights are acquired.

Often the rights of use are regulated in the general terms and conditions of the NFT trading platform used.

In addition, license terms can be linked in the metadata of the smart contract.

4.

The sale of NFT art from a copyright perspective Another issue is the question of how the sale of NFT art should be classified under German copyright law.

As the artwork tied to an NFT is normally only linked in the smart contract (see above under I), the artwork itself is not touched by the transaction.

The sale of the NFT in the blockchain, therefore, does not involve any reproduction or distribution of the work (Sec. 16 and 17 UrhG).

The work is also not ""made available to the public"" within the meaning of Sec.

19a UrhG because the artwork was already linked to the smart contract during minting (which in turn normally will not fall under Sec. 19a UrhG, see above under II.2).

Therefore, at best sales-related measures, such as previews of the linked work provided via the sales platform to advertise the NFT, can be relevant under German copyright law.

Such measures often constitute a reproduction (Sec. 16 UrhG) and a use of the work by ""making it available to the public"" (Sec. 19a UrhG).

5.

Significant risk of misuse!

From a purely technical perspective, anyone can mint an NFT for a digital artwork published online.

There is no guarantee that the creator of the NFT is also the originator of the artwork or at least the copyright holder.

Just as a forger of a painting can write the signature of one of the old masters on a painting, a fraudulent internet user can mint an NFT for a digital work and claim that the work is an original or at least an authorised copy.

Since it is not possible to acquire rights of use in good faith under German copyright law, the buyer will be left empty-handed in this case.

The copyright holder also does not have any legal recourse against unauthorised minting because minting does not constitute an act of use that is relevant under German copyright law (see above under II.2).

It is therefore not surprising that the first cases of unauthorised NFT minting are already making the headlines.

In November last year, various well-known artists accused the London curator and founder of the "" Art Wars Project "", Ben Moore, of minting and selling NFTs for photos of the works created by the artists as part of the project without their authorisation.

6.

Automatic participation in the proceeds of sale Smart contracts make it possible to automatically pay the artist a portion of the proceeds from future sales.

This has great potential for NFT art.

The creator of the NFT can regulate in the smart contract that he or she is to receive a particular share of any future proceeds of resale.

If the NFT is sold, the blockchain will automatically transfer the relevant amount to the creator."
ADVANT Beiten,NFT Art: Big Hype – Many Open Legal Questions!,"If the NFT is sold, the blockchain will automatically transfer the relevant amount to the creator.

From a legal perspective, the creator of a digital NFT artwork is well advised to establish an automatic payment of proceeds of sale through the smart contract.

The author will otherwise normally not be entitled to a share of the proceeds under Sec.

26 UrhG because the ""right of resale"" under German copyright law generally only applies to physical original works.

III.

Implications for artists and art dealing There are numerous open legal issues related to the trade in NFT art.

The German legislator and German courts should therefore establish the framework for a legally secure token economy.

Until then, it is up to the artists, gallery owners and platform providers to make NFT transactions as transparent as possible in order to ensure that all parties have the necessary legal certainty.

Above all, artists themselves can help to prevent the unauthorised minting of NFTs of their works.

Digital artworks should not be released before the related NFT has been minted.

This eliminates the opportunity for third parties to create the first NFT for the work.

In addition, artists (and galleries) should ensure transparency by publishing information about which NFT is linked to the original artwork.

This will provide at least some legal certainty.

ADVANT Beiten,Collective redundancies must be notified even in the case of dismissal due to illness,"Judgment of the Regional Labour Court of Dusseldorf of 15 October 2021 in Case No. 7

Sa 405/21

The Regional Labour Court (Landesarbeitsgericht) in Dusseldorf held that, where the thresholds are exceeded, collective redundancies must be notified to the Employment Agency (Agentur für Arbeit) even in the case of dismissal due to illness.

Facts of the case The dispute involved dismissal(s) due to illness.

Prior to issuing a notice of dismissal to the Claimant, the employer had issued 34 other notices of dismissal due to illness within a 30 day period.

The Claimant brought an action for unfair dismissal and argued the dismissal due to illness was invalid.

In particular, the Claimant argued that the employer should have submitted a mass redundancy notification to the Employment Agency and carried out the consultation procedure with the works council.

At first instance, the Labour Court in Dusseldorf found for the Claimant.

The judgment The Regional Labour Court in Dusseldorf confirmed the judgment of the lower court.

The dismissal was invalid due to the employer’s failure to submit a notification of collective redundancy pursuant to § 17 (3) of the Act against Unfair Dismissal (Kündigungsschutzgesetz, KSchG) and carry out the consultation procedure with the works council in accordance with § 17 (2) of the Act.

The threshold of 30 dismissals within 30 calendar days was exceeded.

It was therefore necessary to make a collective redundancy notification.

This conclusion cannot be invalidated by the fact that the dismissals in question were due to illness or on personal grounds.

In the view of the Regional Labour Court, such dismissals also must be taken into account when calculating the thresholds under § 17 (1) first sentence of the KSchG.

This follows from the interpretation of the rule: the wording of § 17 of the KSchG refers to dismissals and does not specify their grounds.

Systematically, the exceptional provision in § 17 (4) of the KSchG only applies to termination without notice.

Consequences for practice Generally, the employer must inform the Employment Agency before issuing multiple dismissals on personal, conduct or operational grounds – how many depends on the size of the operations.

As § 17 of the KSchG applies to dismissals on personal or conduct grounds, as well as redundancies on operational grounds, all dismissals must be taken into account when calculating the thresholds.

Practical tip A collective redundancy notification is necessary in the case of multiple dismissals on any grounds.

Section 17 of the KSchG only provides an exception in the case of dismissal without notice.

In the case of doubt, a collective redundancy notification should therefore be submitted as a precaution.

If one is not submitted, the dismissals will be invalid.

A further appeal was rejected.

ADVANT Beiten,ATAD Implementation Act Changes in CFC-Regulations,"This blog post is the third part of the series on the ATAD Implementation Act.

You can access the previous contributions regarding Hybrid mismatches and the changes in Exit Taxation via the corresponding links.

Changes to the Controlled Foreign Companies-Regulations through the ATAD Implementation Act After the legislator failed to implement the ATAD Directive (Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive) into national law in time by the end of 2019, this has now been done with the ATAD Implementa-tion Act of 30 June 2021.

The ATAD Implementation Act will only result in a few changes to the previously applicable legal situation in the area of the taxation of Controlled Foreign Companies (""CFC"").

This is due to the fact that far-reaching regulations already exist in Germany through the national laws on CFCs in the Foreign Tax Act (Außensteuergesetz, AStG).

One major change is the switch to a shareholder-based approach.

The decisive criterion is the control of an intermediate company.

According to Section 7 Para.

2 German Foreign Tax Act, this is now the case if, at the end of the respective financial year of the foreign company, more than half of the shares in the nominal capital are directly or indirectly attributable to the taxpayer alone or together with persons closely associated with him, or if he is directly or indirectly entitled to more than half of the profits or liquidation proceeds.

In this context, the associated persons do not have to be domestic residents.

The legislator thus abandons the concept of national control.

The risk of accidental or even unknown national control will thus be avoided in the future.

The decision of the legislator to define a catalogue of active income instead of passive income in Section 8 AStG contrary to the ATAD, remains unchanged.

The catalogue was, however, partially revised.

Among other things, interest is now always to be regarded as passive income.

The regulation on dividends, which had formerly been clearly laid out, was also revised.

Previously, all profit distributions by corporations were considered as active income without exception.

Now, only certain intercompany dividends qualify as active income.

The tax rate of 25%, which is the threshold for a ""low taxation"", has, however, remained unchanged.

The new legal situation also entails a change in the exemption limit for mixed income (Section 9 AStG).

To begin with, the revenue, instead of the gross income, is now the relevant factor.

In addition, the threshold of EUR 80,000 per company has been eliminated.

The relevant point in time for attributing CFC-income to the taxpayer has also changed.

Whereas under the old law, pursuant to Section 10 Para.

2 Sen. 1 AStG, the CFC-income was deemed to be attributed immediately after the end of the relevant financial year of the foreign company, under the new law it is deemed to be attributed in the assessment period in which the relevant financial year of the foreign company ends.

The new provisions are generally to be applied for the first time for the assessment periods for which CFC-income is to be attributed resulting from a financial year of the intermediate company or permanent establishment that begins after 31 December 2021.

Relevance in practice As mentioned above, though the ATAD Implementation Act only results in a few changes to the applicable legal situation, these must be taken into account in tax planning.

This applies in particular with regard to the changes to the active income catalogue in Section 8 AStG with respect to profit distributions by corporations.

There is an acute need for action here in the case of free float shares, as these are no longer covered by the new active income catalogue.

Particularly due to the far-reaching changes made by the ATAD in the other areas, the changes regarding the CFC-rules must not be neglected.

ADVANT Beiten,ATAD Implementation Act - Changes in Exit Taxation,"This blog post is the second part of the series on the ATAD Implementation Act.

You can find the previous blog post regarding so-called hybrid mismatches at Link .

ATAD Implementation Act and the Exit Taxation according to Section 6 German Foreign Tax Act (Außensteuergesetz, AStG)

Due to the ATAD Implementation Act, the so-called exit taxation according to section 6 AStG has been subject to some significant changes.

The group of taxpayers who may be subject to exit tax has been modified.

In the past, an unlimited tax liability in Germany of at least ten years was required.

From now on, taxpayers who have been subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany for at least seven years within a period of twelve years are subject to the exit taxation.

As before, taxpayers are subject to exit taxation if they hold shares of at least 1% in domestic or foreign corporations.

But caution is needed:

In case a partnership has opted for the taxation of corporations through the German Act for Modernisation of the Income Tax Act (Körper-schaftsteuerrecht-Modernisierungsgesetz, KöMOG) the partnership would also be subject to exit taxation.

Even after the reform of section 6 AStG, the most frequent cause of the exit taxation is the exit/move of the individual to abroad.

In addition, however, the transfer of a significant participation without a payment to persons not subject to unlimited tax liability leads exit taxation.

Also, the exclusion or restriction of German tax law causes exit taxation.

The assessed tax can be deferred at the taxpayer's application so that the tax can be paid in seven equal annual instalments.

Basically, the tax office will require a security deposit for this.

Whereas in the old regulation a distinction was made between departures to an EU/EEA country and those to a third country, the deferral regulation (Stundungsregelung) now applies in any case.

As a result, the regulation of indefinite deferral without security deposit for the exit to an EU/EEA country will not be applicable anymore.

Due to the ATAD Implementation Act the so-called return regulation was also adjusted.

According to the return regulation, the tax claim generally lapses if the taxpayer re-establishes a residence in Germany within seven years and becomes subject to unlimited tax liability again.

In the past, this time limit was only five years.

The time limit can be extended to a maximum of twelve years if the ""intention to return"" persists.

What at first glance appears to be a relief, however, turns out to be a disadvantage for those who have moved to an EU/EEA country: Under the previous regulation, these taxpayers could return without any time limit.

The new regulations will apply as of the 2022 assessment period.

Relevance in practice The ATAD Implementation Act has also modified and restructured the rules on exit taxation.

In contrast to exits to a third country, the new regulation entails disadvantages in case of an exit to an EU/EEA country.

This should be considered when planning an exit out of Germany.

ADVANT Beiten,Federal Labour Court: Compensation for a severely disabled applicant due to a failure to notify the position to the Employment Agency,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 25 January 2021 in Case No. 8 AZR 313/21

If an employer breaches provisions containing procedural and/or support obligations designed to benefit persons with severe disabilities, this breach will normally establish a statutory presumption that the unsuccessful, severely disabled applicant was not included in the selection/hiring procedures due to their disability and was therefore disadvantaged.

Such provisions include the first sentence of § 165 of the Ninth Volume of the Social Code (Sozialgesetzbuch, SGB IX), according to which public employers must notify the Employment Agency at an early stage of any new vacancies or new positions that need to be filled.

Publication of the position on the job board of the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit, BA) will be insufficient to fulfil this requirement.

Facts of the case A severely disabled applicant with a 50% degree of disability claimed compensation from a district because his application for a position with the district was unsuccessful.

In 2017, the district published a position vacant notice on the job board of the BA for a position as “Director Legal Office and Local Council (lawyer),” to be filled from January 2018.

According to the job description, the position required the applicant to have successfully completed a university degree in law or equivalent and have several years of relevant professional and managerial experience.

Although the Claimant did not fulfil these requirements, he applied for the advertised position in November 2017, indicating his severe disability.

The district did not invite the applicant in for an interview but informed him instead in April 2018 that they had selected another applicant.

In response, the Claimant submitted a claim for compensation to the district under § 15 (2) of the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, AGG).

He criticized the fact that he, as an applicant with severe disabilities, was not considered during the preliminary procedure of the selection process.

When he did not receive a response from the district, he brought his claim for compensation under § 15 (2) of the AGG before the Court.

The judgment While the Court at first instance dismissed the claim for compensation because the Claimant clearly did not fulfil the specifications of the position, the Federal Labour Court decided in his favour.

He was disadvantaged due to his severe disability.

The claim for compensation under § 15 (2) of the AGG was therefore established.

Contrary to the requirements of the first sentence of § 165 of the SGB IX, the district failed to notify the relevant Employment Agency of the advertised position, which could be filled by a person with severe disabilities.

The publication of the position on the job board of the BA could not (yet) be qualified as notification within the meaning of the first sentence of § 165 of the SGB IX.

The infringement of the notification requirement under § 165 of the SGB IX was enough to establish the statutory presumption under § 22 of the AGG, that the Claimant was not considered because of his severe disability and was therefore disadvantaged.

Consequences for practice The judgment makes public employers aware of just how strictly the Federal Labour Court will assess formal breaches of the law related to persons with severe disabilities during the recruitment process.

Although the lower courts found that the Claimant was obviously not suitable for the advertised position because he did not have the relevant professional experience, the Claimant was still presumed to be disadvantaged in the application process due to the district’s failure to fulfil a formal requirement and notify the Employment Agency.

If the notification had been made, the compensation claim would probably have been unsuccessful before the Federal Labour Court, too.

Practical tip"
ADVANT Beiten,Federal Labour Court: Compensation for a severely disabled applicant due to a failure to notify the position to the Employment Agency,"If the notification had been made, the compensation claim would probably have been unsuccessful before the Federal Labour Court, too.

Practical tip

In line with this judgment of the Federal Labour Court, public employers should ensure that they properly notify the appropriate Employment Agency of any positions which a person with severe disabilities could fill before advertising the position.

In this respect, publication of the position vacant on the job board of the BA will not be sufficient.

ADVANT Beiten,ATAD (Anti Tax Avoidance Directive) – Implementation Act - Hybrid mismatches,"On 25 June 2021, the Federal Council adopted the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (""ATAD"") (ATAD Implementation Act).

It was published in the Federal Law Gazette on 30 June 2021.

With the Act, the ATAD from the European Union was implemented into national law.

In particular, the national regulations on exit taxation, on CFC (controlled foreign company) taxation and on the avoidance of hybrid mismatches were adapted.

In the following first part of our three-part series on the ATAD Implementation Act, we look at the new rules for avoiding taxation mismatches in relation to hybrid arrangements.

The new section 4k German Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz, EStG) shall avoid the deduction of business expenses in case of hybrid structures between related parties or between persons ""with coordinated behavior"".

The idea is to avoid structures in which it comes to a double deduction of business expenses or a deduction without taxation of corresponding business income.

The regulations are structured as a treaty override, so that double taxation treaties do not have to be observed.

The application of these regulations is mandatory for all expenses incurred after 31 December 2019.

Expenses that were legally incurred before 31 December 2019 may be assumed to have been incurred after 31 December 2019 under certain conditions.

In detail, the following cases are covered: Section 4k (1) EStG covers operating expenses in connection with hybrid financial instruments (forms of lending) and from the transfer of capital assets.

In case the income (corresponding to the business expenses) is not taxed in the other state or is taxed at a lower rate than in Germany, a deduction of business expenses will be not permitted.

This may be the case, for instance, if income is qualified as non-taxable dividends abroad, but can be deducted as interest expense in Germany.

Provided that the mismatches are eliminated in future taxation periods and the at arm's length principle (Fremdvergleichsgrundsatz) has been considered a deduction should be possible.

Section 4k (2) EStG extends the restriction to payments from services (e.g., interest, rent and license payments, etc.) which are not taxed in the state of the service recipient due to different qualification of the services or the legal entities involved (only non-taxation, not low taxation).

Such cases can be possible in permanent establishment structures or in the case of different classification of hybrid entities (non-transparent classification in one state and transparent classification in the other state).

A double deduction of operating expenses (e.g., in the case of so-called double-dip structures) is restricted by section 4k (4) EStG.

A deduction remains possible if corresponding income is taxed in both states.

Section 4k (5) EStG is intended to prevent the deduction of operating expenses for structures in which the income in the other state is offset by expenses that would not be deductible in Germany under section 4k (1) to (4) EStG if they were incurred in Germany.

Such constellations may be possible in the case of multi-level financing structures with the use of hybrid financial instruments, in which, for instance, the interest payments and interest income at the individual levels usually balance out, but at the top level, for instance, there is no taxation of the interest income due to a hybrid financial instrument.

Relevance in practice Entities with cross-border relations (e.g., financing, shareholding or other service agreements) should keep an eye on the regulations of section 4k EStG (applicable retroactively as of 1 January 2020).

Such cross-border structures should be also reviewed from a tax perspective to mitigate potential tax risks.

ADVANT Beiten,Delivery cyclists have a right to a bike and a mobile phone,"Judgment of the Federal Labour Court of 10 November 2021 in Case No. 5 AZR 334/21

You see them everywhere, tearing through the city on their bikes while glancing at their smartphones: delivery cyclists delivering an evening meal or the weekly shopping in huge backpacks.

The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) has now held that employers must make available to the delivery riders the work tools necessary for the riders to deliver delicacies such as pizza or burgers.

Facts of the case The case was brought against an employer of bike courier riders who deliver food and drinks from various restaurants.

The employment contracts took the form of general terms and conditions and required the cyclists to provide their own bicycle and use their own mobile phone.

For each hour of work, the cyclists received a EUR 0.25 credit that could be used for bike repairs at specific repair shops.

An employee brought a claim before the court and demanded that the employer make available a roadworthy bicycle and a suitable smartphone for his contractually agreed activities.

He argued that it was the responsibility of the employer to provide the necessary tools.

The employer responded that its employees already had their own bicycle and mobile telephone anyway.

Any disadvantage from using their own was compensated by the statutory option to reimburse expenses and to provide credit for repairs.

The judgment The BAG decided in favour of the employee: the requirement for the cyclist to use his own bike and smartphone unreasonably disadvantaged the Claimant in contravention of § 307 (2) No. 1 and the first sentence of § 307 (1) of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) and is therefore ineffective.

The contractual provisions in question meant that the employer did not have to pay the procurement and operational costs to the detriment of the employee, nor bear the cost risk associated with wear and tear, loss, or damage to the essential work tools.

This was contrary to one of the basic concepts of the working relationship, which requires the employer to provide the essential tools for the performance of the agreed activities and to ensure that the tools functioned effectively.

In the Court’s view, the resulting disadvantage was also not sufficiently compensated in the present case.

The reimbursement of expenses, as required under statute, does not constitute appropriate compensation as there was no contractual provision.

In addition, the employee did not have free access to the budget for repairs.

The employee therefore has a right, in accordance with § 611a (1) of the BGB, to be provided with a bicycle and a smartphone that are suitable for the performance of the agreed activities.

Consequences for practice The judgment is designed to ensure that the minimum wage levels imposed by law cannot be undermined.

Employees, especially those who are only paid close to the minimum wage for their work, cannot be asked to make further sacrifices with their assets to be able to perform their work.

The employer must make the necessary tools available to the employee.

>

Practical tip

The judgment clarifies that employers cannot escape their obligations to bear the procurement and operational costs for necessary work tools.

However, the Court indicated that it would be possible to pay appropriate financial compensation instead of providing the tools.

This gives employers sufficient contractual leeway to find an appropriate solution.

ADVANT Beiten,Consumer Protection Law will get teeth in 2022: GDPR-style fines on the horizon - Part I,"2022 will be the year every company doing business in Europe will have to pay much more attention to Consumer Protection Law than they ever did before.

In Germany, many breaches of Consumer Protection Law can be fined with up to 4 per cent of the company's yearly turnover as of 28 May 2022.

Most other EU member states will adopt similar changes.

In this article, we will share some insights on our experience when guiding our clients through the EU regulatory framework commonly referred to as the ""New Deal for Consumers"", namely the ""Omnibus Directive"", the ""Digital Content and Service Directive"" and the ""Sale of Goods Directive"".

These have been, or will soon be, implemented in the national legal systems of the EU Member States.

The changes are manyfold – in this article, we concentrate on issues which can trigger a high monetary fine – and we only present our ""best of"" selection, so the examples we list are by no means complete.

Part I: General Terms & Conditions: It is an open secret that many companies based outside the EU did not care too much about the EU directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts – which has, at least on paper, very strict rules on what is permissible (or not permissible) in General Terms and Conditions (""GTC"" - including, of course, Terms of Use, or End User License Agreements).

Even companies which cared (often companies based in the EU) tested the limits of what is possible.

True, in case of doubt, GTC clauses must be interpreted in favor of the consumer.

And clauses which are too detrimental for the consumer are void.

But many companies took the risk and used clauses which were potentially void, as there was no real sanction other than that the clause was void, or that the clause would help the compa-ny in court less than the wording suggested (if a clause was void, it was simply replaced by the statutory regulations).

However, even clauses which were not to be applied by the court had a certain effect – as they often dissuaded consumers to exercise their rights.

In 2022, this situation changes.

With the EU Omnibus Directive, monetary fines can be imposed for clauses which are not permitted.

The EU Member States have a certain discretion on how exactly they implement the directive.

Germany has opted for a model under which a fine can be imposed for clauses which are on the ""blacklist"" of clauses which are always void (Sect. 309 German Civil Code).

Quite frankly: So far we did not see one single ""general terms and conditions"" document which did not contain at least a few clauses which are most likely an infringement of the ""blacklist"".

Many non-European companies, for example, use limitations of liability clauses which go way too far.

A good indication which can be quickly spotted: If the limitation of liability is written all in capital letters, it is most likely drafted under US law, not adapted to German law, and void – and can, in the future, trigger a monetary fine.

If, on the other hand, the general terms and conditions have been adapted to EU law, or especially German law, the limitation of liability is possibly the one clause which has been really, really carefully drafted, and contains some wording on ""cardinal obligations"" (of course, apart from judges and lawyers, no one would have ever heard the word ""cardinal obligation"").

Still, with a high likelihood, there are other clauses which can trigger a fine, unless the general terms and conditions have been revised very recently.

One example are clauses which contain a penalty (or hidden penalty), e.g., clauses which make the consumer pay a fixed amount when he does not fulfill his obligations – often found in GTC in eCommerce (e.g., default with payment, incorrect payment information, chargebacks)."
ADVANT Beiten,Consumer Protection Law will get teeth in 2022: GDPR-style fines on the horizon - Part I,"Other widespread examples are clauses according to which the consumer may not pursue his or her claims in a German court (but only before a certain arbitration court), or clauses requiring declarations by the consumer (e.g., a notice of termination) to be in writing.

One more opaque, but equally problematic prohibition concerns clauses which change the burden of proof or which make the consumer ""confirm facts"" – GTC which have been drafted under US law are typically full of clauses through which the consumer ""acknowledges"" something; these may fall under the ""blacklist"".

Coming soon, and due to recent changes in German law, this will also include clauses that automatically extend the term of the contract for a certain period (usually one year) or provide for an excessively long notice period - – such clauses can be found in the GTC of many companies with a long-term relationship with the customers.

That's just a few examples – the new game for invalid clauses is now open and called ""spot them all""."
ADVANT Beiten,On the Interpretation of the EU Blocking Regulation by the ECJ,"The Prelude On 21 December 2021, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) delivered the first judgment on the interpretation of the EU Blocking Regulation in Case C-124/20 Bank Melli Iran.

Five months earlier, the ECJ Advocate General Gerard Hogan had delivered an opinion in the case in which he held that Iranian companies can rely on EU law before the courts of the Member States against US secondary sanctions.

The crucial question is whether EU companies may terminate contracts with companies subject to US secondary sanctions without giving reasons, or whether such termination violates Article 5(1) of the EU Blocking Regulation and is invalid.

Background Bank Melli Iran is an Iranian bank with a branch in Hamburg that had concluded contracts with a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom for telecommunications services.

The contracts were terminated in November 2018, first with immediate effect and then with due notice.

Bank Melli Iran claimed before German courts that the termination was invalid.

After the withdrawal of the USA from the nuclear agreement with Iran (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA) in 2018 under then President Donald Trump, Bank Melli Iran was put on the list (SDN list, Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons-List) by the USA.

Under US law, this has the effect of prohibiting all business dealings with Bank Melli Iran worldwide, so-called secondary sanctions.

The sanctions affect the Iran business of companies without a direct connection to the territory of the USA.

The sanctions were imposed a few days prior to the termination of the contracts.

Deutsche Telekom generated about half of its turnover from operations in the USA.

International Law and Secondary Sanctions Given their reach beyond the US territory, secondary sanctions are regarded by the EU as a violation of international law, and the EU (then EC) had countered their effects as early as 1996.

Council Regulation (EC)

No 2271/96 of 22 November 1996 on protection against the effects of the extraterritorial application of legislation adopted by a third country, and of measures based thereon or resulting therefrom, stipulates that the requirements and prohibitions of the US sanctions listed in the updated annex to the EU Blocking Regulation may not be complied with in the EU.

In particular, the Article 5 of the Regulation reads in paragraph 1: No person referred to in Article 11 shall comply, whether directly or through a subsidiary or other intermediary person, actively or by deliberate omission, with any requirement or prohibition, including requests of foreign courts, based on or resulting, directly or indirectly, from the laws specified in the Annex or from actions based thereon or resulting therefrom.

The Annex covers sanctions imposed by the US.

Persons can only be exempted from complying fully or partially with the prohibition if compliance with the prohibition would seriously damage their interests or those of the EU, and provided the European Commission has authorized them to do so.

The Interpretation of the Blocking Regulation by the ECJ The ECJ first holds that Art. 5 (1) of the Regulation applies even if there are no rules on compliance at national level.

National courts must ensure compliance with the obligations or prohibitions provided for in the Regulation in civil disputes.

In the present case, the plaintiff argues that the statutory prohibition in § 134 Civil Code (BGB) applies by virtue of Article 5 of the blocking regulation, and the plaintiff bears the burden of proof that the requirements of § 134 Civil Code are met.

These requirements apply even in a situation where Deutsche Telekom terminated the contract without giving reasons (which it may do under the applicable civil laws)."
ADVANT Beiten,On the Interpretation of the EU Blocking Regulation by the ECJ,"These requirements apply even in a situation where Deutsche Telekom terminated the contract without giving reasons (which it may do under the applicable civil laws).

The application of the general rule on the burden of proof may however make it practically impossible or excessively difficult for the national civil court to establish a breach of the prohibition and as a consequence possibly impair the practical effectiveness of the prohibition.

The European Court of Justice therefore considers that a shift in the burden of proof is appropriate where ""all the evidence available to a national court tends to indicate prima facie that, by terminating the contracts in question, a person referred to in Article 11 of that regulation, who does not have an authorisation within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 5 of that regulation, complied with the laws specified in the annex"".

It is then ""for that person to establish to the requisite legal standard this his or her conduct did not seek to comply with those laws"".

Next, the Court addresses in detail Deutsche

Telekom's objection that the possible finding of invalidity of the termination would cause it serious damage.

It must be borne in mind that there is a separate procedure for granting exceptions to the prohibition, that the European Commission decides on exceptions on application and that Deutsche Telekom has not made any application.

The Court insists (as had the Advocate General) on the observance of the blocking regulation but nevertheless opened a small loophole in holding that the referring court must examine whether the prohibition could have disproportionate effects in concreto.

Outlook The European Commission considers revising the blocking regulation, and its proposals are expected for later this year.

The comments of companies concerned and business associations during the consultation for revisions of the blocking regulation as well as the opinion of Advocate General Hogan in the proceedings have made it clear that the current rules are rather crude and difficult to enforce.

The Commission’s proposals on how to improve this unsatisfactory situation are therefore eagerly awaited.

Until then, the Court's judgment does make clear that the law has to be observed."
