Cooley,FCC ‘Network Neutrality’ Order Shakes Up Broadband Privacy,"As described in our May 8 client alert , most of the discussion regarding the new network neutrality order from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has focused on the FCCs decision to reinstate rules the agency adopted in 2015 and then overturned in 2017.

Equally important, though, are the significant implications the order will have for customer privacy.

The FCCs conclusion that broadband internet access service (BIAS) should be treated as a telecommunications service will subject broadband providers to different requirements than those that have governed them since 2017, will create uncertainty about how to comply with those requirements and likely will lead to additional rulemaking activity at the FCC  further increasing uncertainty in the medium term.

FCC now in charge of BIAS privacy Telecommunications carriers are exempt from Federal Trade Commission (FTC) privacy rules and instead are regulated at the federal level entirely by the FCC.

Accordingly, the FCCs determination that BIAS is a telecommunications service shifts the regulation of BIAS privacy from the FTC to the FCC.

In recognition of this shift, the FCC and the FTC have entered into a new memorandum of understanding addressing how they will divide their jurisdiction and cooperate in regulating internet access services.

The decision to reclassify BIAS  mass-market consumer internet access service  as a telecommunications service does not affect the FTCs authority over non-BIAS offerings.

Thus, privacy for internet access services provided to enterprise customers or as specialized offerings customized for particular customers or uses will continue to be regulated by the FTC.

In other words, different types of internet access service will be subject to different privacy requirements, depending on what customers are being served and how the service is provided.

FCC privacy requirements for BIAS providers The basic privacy requirements for telecommunications carriers are contained in Section 222 of the federal Communications Act, which limits the ways in which customer information can be used by telecommunications carriers.

Section 222 applies to information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location and amount of use ofa service by telecommunications customers.

(This information is known as customer proprietary network information, or CPNI.)

As it did when it adopted the last round of network neutrality rules in 2015, the FCC decided it would not forbear from applying Section 222 to BIAS.

Under Section 222, BIAS providers will be required to obtain permission to use CPNI to market their services and will not be allowed to use CPNI they obtain from other carriers for marketing.

The FCC did not, however, apply its own privacy rules for telecommunications carriers to BIAS, concluding that those rules were not well adapted to internet access services.

This means BIAS providers will have relatively little guidance from the FCC concerning what information qualifies as customer information when the customer is purchasing BIAS, what kind of notices have to be provided to customers, and how to obtain and maintain consent to use customer data.

BIAS providers also will not be subject to the FCCs data breach notification requirements, which are part of the FCCs broader privacy rules.

While the FCC could provide BIAS providers with guidance on how to comply with Section 222, it is not likely that any guidance will be made available in the near future.

Proposed BIAS privacy rules could come soon Following the 2015 order, the FCC adopted broad reforms of its privacy rules, but those rules were overturned by Congress through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and the FCC is prohibited from readopting those or substantially similar rules.

However, the FCC likely will try to adopt new rules to cover BIAS, and particularly, to fill in the gaps concerning customer notice and consent."
Cooley,FCC ‘Network Neutrality’ Order Shakes Up Broadband Privacy,"However, the FCC likely will try to adopt new rules to cover BIAS, and particularly, to fill in the gaps concerning customer notice and consent.

The FCC has not signaled what it will do, but one possibility is that it will propose rules closely resembling the existing telecommunications carrier rules, with changes necessary to reflect the differences between BIAS and other telecommunications services.

Any FCC action to adopt new, BIAS-specific privacy rules likely will not occur until at least 2025, and it is likely that the privacy rules for BIAS would be subject to appeals, possibly including an argument that they are prohibited as a result of Congress overturning the 2016 rules under the CRA.

Until new rules go into effect, BIAS providers will have to rely on interpretations of Section 222 and any guidance the FCC issues.

Cooley,"FTC Continues to ‘Dispute’ Orange Book Device Patent Listings, But Still No Antitrust Enforcement","Over the last eight months, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has focused on what it characterizes as improper Orange Book listings and the impacts of such listings on generic entry.

Most recently, on April 30, 2024, the FTC initiated a second round of patent listing disputes  this one targeting more than 300 device patent listings for 20 medicines approved to treat diabetes, obesity, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypoglycemia, covering injectors, inhalers and nasal sprays.

The FTC sent letters to the companies listing patents urging them to withdraw their listings from the Orange Book.

This action follows an FTC policy statement, in which the agency announced it would consider improper Orange Book listings to be antitrust violations , and a first round of listing disputes initiated by the FTC in November 2023 that focused on inhaler products and epinephrine injector pens.

The FTCs actions have drawn the attention of members of Congress, who have urged companies targeted by the FTC to delist their patents, notwithstanding the absence of guidance about whether these types of patents are properly listed pursuant to the statute.

A recent Congressional Research Service report questioned whether additional clarity [from Congress] is needed on the types of patents that may be listed.

Antitrust enforcement on the horizon?

The FTCs actions do not compel delisting and are not antitrust enforcement actions.

Rather, the FTC has sent letters to the listers pursuant to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations that permit anyone to question an Orange Book listing.

Targeted companies then have 30 days to elect to either delist or maintain their listings.

In response to the November 2023 listing disputes, a handful of companies did delist some patents.

The majority, however, recertified and maintained their patent listings, arguing that their patents satisfy the statutory listing criteria and, therefore, are in fact statutorily required to be listed.

In letters to Congress , these companies defended their listings as not causing any real-world anticompetitive effect.

To date, the FTC has not brought any antitrust enforcement actions against these companies.

A key question going forward is whether the FTC ultimately brings antitrust cases.

In its policy statement, the FTC took the position that improper listings are illegal, regardless of the reasonableness of the decision to list or its competitive effects.

If the FTC were to bring litigation on this basis without additional evidence, it would likely face significant challenges.

Of course, the FTC may well be investigating to identify and prioritize fact patterns on which to base future antitrust enforcement.

The strongest antitrust cases would be where the FTC is able to prove both that a patent was intentionally improperly listed and a causal link between the improper listing and delayed or deterred generic entry.

In the meantime, it is clear that the FTC continues to devote considerable resources to this issue.

The FTC has, among other things, recently submitted amicus briefs in lawsuits against Sanofi in the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and against Teva in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, advocating that improper listings thwart competition and are actionable under the antitrust laws.

And, at a recent White House event, FTC Chair Lina Khan spoke about what she characterized as bogus patents listed in an obscure registry used to delay or block generics.

The FTC, however, is not questioning patent validity, only whether patents are properly listed, and listing patents  which is required by statute  is designed to facilitate generic entry by providing notice of relevant patents.

Moreover, generic entry is often tied to patent expiration, not the act of listing in the Orange Book.

Is this just about device patents?"
Cooley,"FTC Continues to ‘Dispute’ Orange Book Device Patent Listings, But Still No Antitrust Enforcement","Moreover, generic entry is often tied to patent expiration, not the act of listing in the Orange Book.

Is this just about device patents?

As was the case with the FTCs first round of patent listing disputes, in this most recent round, the FTC is focused on device patents that do not claim the specific drug.

The FTC has by now made clear its view that device patents that do not mention the drug are not listable, notwithstanding the long-standing ambiguity on this issue, the practice of listing these types of patents and the FDAs historic refusal to provide guidance.

In light of the FTCs focus on device patents that do not claim the drug, innovator companies that have marketed drug-device combination products, or that are developing such products, should assess whether any device patents may be vulnerable to FTC scrutiny.

Companies that are still developing intellectual property should consider claiming relevant drugs when drafting and prosecuting device patents.

Pharmaceutical companies also should recognize that the FTC appears likely to broaden its lens beyond device patents to include additional categories of patents it views as improperly listed.

FTC personnel have flagged, for instance, patents claiming manufacturing processes, packaging and distribution systems, such as REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies), as potentially being the focus of future listing disputes, as we discuss in this November 2023 client alert .

The FDA also has committed to continue to engage with the FTC to identify and address potential efforts to impede competition.

What else do I need to know?

We have detailed key considerations in earlier alerts on this topic (see this October 2023 alert and this November 2023 alert ).

In the current environment, the FTCs focus on this issue warrants attention from pharmaceutical companies that have listed patents or that are prosecuting patents that may fall into a category the FTC deems not proper for Orange Book listing.

Cooley,UK Government Publishes Response to Call for Evidence on National Security and Investment Regime,"On 18 April 2024, the UK government published the response to its call for evidence consultation on the functioning, scope and performance of the UK National Security and Investment (NSI) Act.

Please refer to our November 2023 alert outlining the key topics under consultation , as well as our February 2024 response to the consultation.

While the initial consultation document emphasised the desire to be as pro-business and pro-investment as possible to minimise the burden placed on companies and investors, the response to the NSI call for evidence places a stronger emphasis on the UK governments ability to scrutinise and intervene in transactions that could harm the UKs national security.

The focus is very much on fine-tuning the regime to ensure that it adapts to changing realities and keeps ahead of the national security risks facing the UK.

As such, while the response to the call for evidence sets out five proposed actions that will be taken forward by the UK government, these are better characterised as tweaks, rather than fundamental changes to the NSI regime.

Below, we summarise the key themes from the response, along with next steps.

What are the key themes and proposed actions?

Based on the 110 full responses to the call for evidence, the UK government has set out five key actions that it will focus on in the next six months:

1. The UK government will publish revised guidance on the exercise of its call-in powers as set out in its Section 3 statement.

Under the NSI Act, the UK government has the power to call-in a large number of transactions for review, even when the mandatory filing thresholds are not met.

The responses to the call for evidence included requests for more transparency and clarity on how the UK government exercises this call-in power  in particular, how it assesses the national security risks of a transaction and what areas of the economy it considers most sensitive.

The UK government will publish updated guidance (an updated Section 3 statement) covering these aspects.

Despite some respondents requests, the UK government also clarified that it would not introduce a fast-track process for certain types of acquirers at this stage, noting that transactions need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis even where, for example, an acquirer has already had a prior transaction cleared through the NSI system.

The updated guidance should offer welcome insight into the current national security priorities of the UK government and provide businesses with more certainty on the risk of intervention on particular proposed transactions.

2.

The UK government will publish updated market guidance in May 2024.

In response to requests from respondents, the UK government expects to publish further guidance covering the application of the NSI Act to transactions involving academia and outward direct investment.

This updated guidance is expected to be published in May 2024.

3.

The UK government will launch a public consultation on the 17 sectors subject to mandatory notification by summer 2024.

Under the NSI regime, certain transactions involving companies with activities in one or more of 17 specified sensitive sectors must be notified to and cleared by the UK government before closing.

The call for evidence sought feedback from respondents on the addition of two further sectors, as well as on other changes to clarify the scope of the existing sectors.

Sixty-three percent of respondents provided feedback on this point and requested clearer definitions and/or guidance in relation to a number of the 17 specified sectors.

In particular, clearer explanations for the sector definitions of Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Materials were requested, and additional guidance for Defence and Critical Suppliers to Government was also invited.

In response, the UK government will launch a formal public consultation on updating the mandatory sector definitions by summer 2024."
Cooley,UK Government Publishes Response to Call for Evidence on National Security and Investment Regime,"In response, the UK government will launch a formal public consultation on updating the mandatory sector definitions by summer 2024.

This will include proposals for a stand-alone Semiconductor sector and a Critical Minerals area, and views also will be sought on the possibility of adding Water as a sector subject to mandatory notification.

4.

The UK government will consider technical exemptions to the mandatory notification thresholds.

Noting the current breadth of the regime, the UK government requested feedback on whether the appointment of liquidators, internal reorganisations, Scots law share pledges and investments by public bodies should be exempt from mandatory notification requirements.

In response to the feedback received, the UK government intends to bring forward secondary legislation to exempt the appointment of liquidators, official receivers and special administrators from the scope of the mandatory regime in autumn 2024 (subject to parliamentary time).

However, with regard to making targeted exemptions for certain internal reorganisations, Scots law share pledges and transactions by public bodies, the UK government has signalled that further work is required to understand the feasibility of exempting these from the ambit of the NSI regime.

It is anticipated that the Investment Security Unit (the body responsible for administering the NSI regime) will undertake a national risk assessment to understand whether exemptions for these transactions are feasible, and whether they can be designed in such a way that they do not compromise the integrity of the NSI Act.

5.

The UK government will consider further improvements to the operation of the NSI system.

The call for evidence welcomed feedback on the operation of the NSI regime in practice  including operational processes and notification forms.

With several respondents calling for greater transparency around the operation of the system, the UK government will consider whether it is able to implement improvements based on the feedback received.

In addition, more than half of respondents opposed the UK governments proposal to request additional information through the notification forms, and the UK government has signalled that it will carefully consider this feedback before making any future changes to the forms.

What does this mean for businesses?

Despite symbolic nods to minimising the burden on businesses in the response to the call for evidence, we do not expect significant changes to the scope or operation of the NSI regime in practice.

While most transactions will likely continue to be cleared within the initial review period of 30 working days, the regime will remain broad in its application and capture a large number of transactions which do not raise UK national security concerns.

We also can expect the UK government to keep the scope of the regime under ongoing review, ensuring that it remains fit for purpose and taking into account developments in sensitive technologies, as well as potentially evolving threats to UK national security.

With tougher investment rules across the US and the European Union, we can only expect the UK to follow and strengthen its screening processes.

Cooley,UK Continues Focus on Trade Sanctions Enforcement With Updates to Export Control Guidance,"On 10 April 2024, the UK government updated its guidance on export controls regarding breaches of relevant legislation.

In addition to encouraging voluntary disclosures by businesses in respect of export control violations, the guidance now expressly recommends that disclosures also are made in respect of breaches of laws on trade sanctions.

Export controls restrict the transfer of certain goods, services, technology and information from the UK to other jurisdictions.

The guidance provides general information on what controlled goods are and the licences required before they can be exported.

A breach of the export control regulations may incur civil and potentially criminal liability.

The updates to the guidance are limited to its later section on Breaches of export control legislation (the section), which sets out the procedure for making a voluntary disclosure to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) for a suspected breach of export controls.

Disclosures are encouraged, because any penalty imposed by HMRC on a business as a result of a violation may be mitigated if the offender has voluntarily come forward.

Previously, the section only indicated that a voluntary disclosure should be made in respect of exports without an appropriate licence.

However, businesses also are now encouraged to make voluntary disclosures where they have breached trade sanctions legislation.

Trade sanctions are supplementary controls related to the export or import of goods or the provision of services to specific jurisdictions.

Trade sanctions are increasingly being deployed by governments across the world as a foreign policy tool and are subsequently becoming a more extensive part of their respective sanctions regimes.

This can be seen in the growing number of trade sanctions being imposed against Russia in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

In particular, a large number of trade sanctions and related restrictions are currently being enforced by the UK .

Lately, the UK has demonstrated an enhanced focus on enforcement of trade sanctions by announcing creation of the Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation (OTSI) .

Due to launch in the coming months, OTSI will be responsible for the civil enforcement of trade sanctions.

As part of this remit, it will seek to investigate and prevent the breach and circumvention of trade sanctions.

However, HMRC will retain responsibility for imposing criminal penalties in respect of trade sanctions, and it is anticipated that there will be a referral system between the two authorities.

Until OTSI is up and running, businesses can make voluntary disclosures by providing HMRC with the following information: Details of the export or breach of trade sanction and any relevant documentation.

An explanation of how the breach was discovered and why it occurred.

Details of any steps taken to remedy the breach and prevent further breaches.

This information can be sent to HMRC by post or to this updated email address .

Comments Trade sanctions are a vital and expanding component of sanctions regimes worldwide and can involve complex compliance requirements.

With more cross-border transactions being carried out than ever before, authorities are seeking more effective methods of investigation and enforcement in respect of those breaching or seeking to circumvent export control and trade sanctions legislation.

In this context, it is important that businesses have well-designed policies and procedures in place, which are regularly reviewed in line with regulatory developments.

As part of this, businesses should take into account their ability to make voluntary disclosures to HMRC on breaches and the incentives in place for doing so.

If you have any questions, please contact the Cooley authors listed below, who can advise you on the export controls and trade sanctions which may affect you and your business  and how the voluntary disclosure process may apply to you."

Cooley,FCC Reinstates ‘Network Neutrality’ Rules,"After a closely divided vote, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released an order effectively reinstating the network neutrality rules it adopted in 2015 .

This decision reverses a 2017 order during the Trump administration that revoked the 2015 decision.

Under the new order, broadband internet access service (BIAS) has been classified as a telecommunications service subject to the Communications Act requirements for telephone services.

The FCC also has adopted rules limiting blocking and throttling customer access to content and applications, preventing BIAS providers from offering content providers favorable access to users, and expanding the disclosures that BIAS providers must make.

Reclassification The FCC readopted the 2015 conclusion that BIAS should be treated as a telecommunications service rather than as an information service subject to limited regulation.

This decision applies only to mass-market services and to interconnection between BIAS providers and third-party content and application providers, but covers all technologies  including satellites  used to offer BIAS.

Broadband service provided to businesses, services provided by businesses that offer internet access to customers as a convenience (such as internet access in coffee shops) and specialized services not offered to the public at large (such as some telemedicine services) will not be treated as telecommunications services.

The FCC declined to treat network slicing, a technique used by wireless providers to segregate some traffic on their networks, as a specialized service and will consider individual services that use network slicing on a case-by-case basis.

The FCC determined that BIAS should not be subject to many of the obligations that apply to most telecommunications carriers.

The obligations that will not apply to BIAS include rate regulation, tariff rules, requirements to unbundle services and contributions to the federal universal service fund, although the FCC may review the question of contribution requirements at a later date.

However, BIAS providers will be subject to basic obligations to offer service on just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, to accessibility requirements for people with disabilities, to obligations to comply with FCC information collection requirements, and to rules governing cooperation with law enforcement.

BIAS providers also will be subject to the privacy requirements in the Communications Act, but not the current privacy rules, which the FCC determined were ill-adapted to BIAS.

BIAS providers also will be subject to the FCCs ban on exclusive contracts to provide service to tenants of multiunit buildings.

One of the most significant differences between the 2015 order and the new order is that BIAS providers will be subject to Section 214 of the Communications Act, which governs entry and exit from the interstate telecommunications business.

The order grants blanket authority to provide BIAS to all providers, except certain Chinese entities that have been banned from providing telecommunications services in the US.

It also indicates that the FCC likely will consider whether to adopt rules that require approval for transactions involving BIAS providers, similar to the rules that are in place for other telecommunications carriers today.

Reclassification also gives BIAS providers certain rights under the Communications Act.

These rights include access to utility poles and conduits for their facilities and the ability to obtain universal service funding.

Reinstated network neutrality rules The order reinstates the basic network neutrality rules that were adopted in 2015, which include the following: No blocking BIAS providers cannot block user access to lawful content and services provided by third parties.

No throttling BIAS providers cannot limit the speeds at which specific content or services are provided to customers."
Cooley,FCC Reinstates ‘Network Neutrality’ Rules,"No throttling BIAS providers cannot limit the speeds at which specific content or services are provided to customers.

This rule does not prevent BIAS providers from selling plans that lower speeds once customers reach specific usage thresholds, so long as the speeds are lowered for all content and services the customers receive.

No paid or affiliate prioritization BIAS providers cannot offer third parties the right to have their content or services carried at higher speeds or in preference to the content or services of other parties, and cannot give preferences to their own content or services.

Providers can obtain exceptions to this rule if they can show that prioritization is beneficial.

General conduct BIAS providers are not permitted to engage in other conduct that undermines the purpose of the rules, based on a test of whether the conduct creates unreasonable interference or an unreasonable disadvantage.

Transparency The order reinstates requirements to provide certain information to customers, including performance characteristics like latency and network management practices.

It also includes new mechanisms for disclosing the required information.

The limitations on blocking and throttling are subject to a BIAS providers right to engage in reasonable network management practices.

BIAS providers may request advisory opinions on whether their practices violate any of the rules and whether their network management practices are reasonable.

The order also reinstates the requirement that BIAS providers exchange traffic with content and service providers on reasonable terms and conditions.

As in the 2015 order, the FCC will consider complaints about the terms of traffic exchange on a case-by-case basis.

The order indicates that the rules do not require settlement-free traffic exchange or prohibit imposition of fees as a general matter, but did not rule out that these practices could be improper in specific cases.

Impact on state network neutrality laws The FCC ruled that state laws that impose the same requirements as the reinstated network neutrality rules or that impose lesser burdens on BIAS providers can be enforced, but any law that imposes additional burdens will be preempted and unenforceable.

This determination will be made on a case-by-case basis, but the FCC found that the California network neutrality law would not be subject to preemption.

Next steps The rules will go into effect 30 days after notice of the decision is published in the Federal Register, except for a few rules that must be approved by the federal Office of Management and Budget.

Like all previous network neutrality orders, this order is certain to be appealed.

The 2015 order was affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the same court largely affirmed the 2017 order but required the FCC to reconsider several issues.

Unless the order is stayed by the court hearing the case, the rules will remain in effect during the appeal.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – April One-Minute Reads,"SEC brings enforcement actions for AI washing In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled enforcement actions for a total of $400,000 in penalties against two investment advisers for making false and misleading statements about their use of artificial intelligence.

The SEC found that the two investment advisers claimed they were using an AI model, and that they were the first regulated AI financial advisor, when they were not.

In a statement, Gurbir Grewal, director of the SECs Division of Enforcement, said, As more and more investors consider using AI tools in making their investment decisions or deciding to invest in companies claiming to harness its transformational power, we are committed to protecting them against those engaged in AI washing.

Grewal also extended his comments to issuers, warning that public issuers making claims about their AI adoption must also remain vigilant about similar misstatements that may be material to individuals investing decisions.

State Street releases 2024 proxy voting and engagement policy On March 25, 2024, State Street released its 2024 proxy voting and engagement policy , effective for voting decisions as of March 26, 2024.

The only material change in the policy made by State Street was to its overboarding policy.

Under the revisions, State Street has updated its policy on limits for the number of outside boards on which a public company director may serve.

This is in exchange for a company-centric approach that requires a company to adopt a director time commitment policy  inclusive of an annual review process for evaluating director time commitments and numerical limits to the number of outside boards a director can serve on.

For companies that do not adopt a director time commitment policy, State Street will impose strict numerical limits on named executive officers, nonexecutive board chairs, lead independent directors and nonexecutive directors.

Amendments proposed to Delaware General Corporation Law

The Council of the Corporation Law Section of the Delaware Bar Association has proposed amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law that address the effects of recent Delaware cases.

The proposed amendments would: Explicitly permit a corporation to enter into contracts with current or prospective stockholders that contain the consent rights over certain corporate actions.

Allow for parties in a merger to contract for penalties or other consequences for a breach of the merger agreement or other failure to consummate the merger, and allow for the appointment of a stockholder representative to enforce any post-closing rights on behalf of stockholders.

Provide boards with the ability to approve agreements in either final or substantially final form, allow boards to timely ratify agreements, and exclude certain schedules to an agreement, including disclosure schedules, from being deemed part of the agreement unless expressly stated in the agreement.

The amendments still need to be approved by the executive committee of the Delaware Bar Association, as well as the Delaware General Assembly, before becoming effective.

Disclosure reminders noted for March 31 year-end companies For companies with a fiscal year that ended on or after March 31, 2024  excluding smaller reporting companies  the Rule 10b5-1 and insider trading disclosure requirements adopted in December 2022 will be required in their upcoming annual reports and proxy statements.

Specifically, new Item 402(x) requires issuers to disclose their option grant policies and practices in relation to the disclosure of material nonpublic information, as well as providing tabular disclosure showing grants made in the four business days before, or one business day after, the release of material nonpublic information in periodic or current reports.

This includes the percentage change in the market price of the underlying securities from the trading day before and after the release of such information.

In addition, issuers will be required to disclose in their Form 10-Ks, 20-Fs, or proxy and information statements whether  and, if not, why not  they have adopted insider trading policies and procedures and, file a copy of their insider trading policies and procedures as an exhibit to Forms 10-K or 20-F, respectively.

Disclosure, other than the exhibit filing, must be tagged using iXBRL.

Jury confirms shadow trading theory On April 8, 2024, the jury in the Panuwat case against the SEC returned with a verdict, finding Matthew Panuwat liable for insider trading on the theory of shadow trading.

In this case, the SEC claimed that Panuwat, an employee at Medivation, inappropriately used insider information related to Medivations upcoming merger with Pfizer to trade in the securities of an unrelated public company, Incyte Corporation, in violation of the Exchange Act.

The SECs claim rested on the theory that because Medivation and Incyte were comparable companies in the same industry, the news of Medivations merger would boost the stock price of Incyte.

Thus, using Medivations material nonpublic information to trade in Incytes securities ahead of the public announcement was still a violation of Rule 10b-5.

The jury returned a verdict in two hours and sided with the SEC.

Delaware Supreme Court applies MFW framework to other conflicted transactions The Delaware Supreme Court recently issued a decision in In Re Match Group, Inc.

Derivative Litigation , finding that in a transaction where a controlling stockholder stands on both sides of a transaction with a controlled corporation and receives a nonratable benefit, then entire fairness (and not business judgment) is the presumptive standard of review.

A controlling stockholder may shift the burden of proof back to the plaintiff by either using a special committee comprised of members independent of the controlling stockholder to evaluate and approve the transaction, or approving the transaction by the affirmative vote of unaffiliated stockholders.

If the controlling stockholder utilizes both shareholder protection measures  using a special committee and seeking a vote of unaffiliated stockholders  then the business judgment standard of review can apply.

The case involved the reverse spinoff of a company that acquired the business of Match.com.

The acquiror remained the controlling shareholder of Match even after Matchs 2015 initial public offering, holding more than 98% of the voting power of Match.

The reverse spinoff was approved by a special committee and a vote of unaffiliated shareholders.

However, one of the members of the special committee was the former chief financial officer of the controlling shareholder."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – April One-Minute Reads,"However, one of the members of the special committee was the former chief financial officer of the controlling shareholder.

The Delaware Supreme Court ultimately determined that because one member of the special committee was not independent, the company had not met the requirements to shift the standard of review from entire fairness to business judgment.

US Supreme Court holds pure omissions not actionable under Rule 10b-5(b)

The US Supreme Court held that a pure omission  an omission that does not render an affirmative statement materially misleading  cannot form the basis of a securities fraud claim under Rule 10b-5(b).

This decision resolves a circuit split regarding whether a company can be held liable under Rule 10b-5(b) solely for failing to make a disclosure required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K. With this decision, the Supreme Court held that such omissions cannot form the basis of a Rule 10b-5(b) claim if the omissions do not render the existing disclosure materially misleading.

Companies should keep in mind that pure omissions can still trigger liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, and the SEC can bring enforcement actions for violations of Item 303.

Delaware judge reminds companies that good board minutes may reduce risk Former Chief Justice of the Delaware Court of Chancery Leo Strine, Jr. reminds companies that, in a time when many plaintiffs are requesting books and records in connection with breach of fiduciary duty and securities law claims, good board minutes are paramount.

Justice Strines article highlights some instances where having sufficient corporate records helped companies facing challenges in the Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court.

This includes cases where having formal board documents prevented petitioners from accessing informal information, like texts and emails, and where having corporate records that show directors attempted to address a compliance risk allowed Caremark complaints to be dismissed.

In addition to highlighting the benefits of good corporate recordkeeping, the article also provides suggestions for how to keep those corporate records in good order.

Companies should consider implementing a specific protocol for recording minutes at meetings (ensuring that minutes cover key evolving issues and tie up loose ends), reviewing and approving minutes with an active, iterative and deliberative process (ideally no later than the next meeting), and using approved minutes to draft key disclosure documents, such as proxy statements and committee reports.

Cooley,"New License Exception Authorizes Exports of Previously Restricted Medical Devices and Related Items to Russia, Belarus, Occupied Ukraine","The US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added a new License Exception for Medical Devices (License Exception MED), effective April 29, 2024, authorizing exports, reexports and transfers of certain medical devices and related parts, components, accessories, and attachments for use therein to Russia, Belarus, and the Crimea, Donetsk Peoples Republic, and Luhansk Peoples Republic regions of Ukraine (collectively, the subject countries).

License Exception MED likely will be a welcome change for clinical research, pharmaceutical and other medical device exporters who remain active in the subject countries, and is anticipated to reduce licensing volume for BIS significantly.

In response to Russias February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, BIS expanded license requirements for exports to the subject countries of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

Notably, BISs license requirements previously applied to a broad range of medical devices and related items classified for export control purposes as EAR99  a classification that typically does not trigger a country-based license requirement for Russia or Belarus.

License Exception MED effectively eliminates these licensing requirements, subject to certain conditions.

For purposes of License Exception MED, medical devices are defined with reference to section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and include  without limitation  medical supplies, instruments and equipment.

To reduce the risk of diversion to industrial or military end uses, only parts, components, accessories and attachments that are necessary for replacement or maintenance in or with EAR99 medical devices are authorized.

Importantly, License Exception MED does not authorize: Exports of covered medical items to restricted parties, including Entity List parties or military end users.

Exports to a production facility with knowledge or reason to know that the device is intended to develop or produce items (for purposes of this restriction, the assembly in a hospital or other healthcare facility of a finished medical device produced entirely outside the subject countries for the sole purpose of using that medical device at the same hospital or healthcare facility does not constitute production).

Further, parties relying on License Exception MED must maintain a system of distribution to ensure that covered items are not delivered to restricted parties or used in production.

Compliance verifications may involve obtaining documentation and affirmations from consignees and conducting periodic onsite spot-checks.

Parties must maintain records of verifications for a period of five years (in addition to the standard recordkeeping requirements of the EAR).

Although License Exception MED provides relief to medical device exporters, exports to and other dealings with the subject countries remain considerably restricted.

Importantly, US persons are prohibited from new investment and providing various services  including management consulting, accounting, and trust and corporate formation services.

Accordingly, all activities involving the subject countries should be closely evaluated to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Cooley,Sunsetting Enforcement Discretion for CLIA-Certified High-Complexity Tests – FDA Presses Ahead With LDT Final Rule,"On May 6, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its final rule to overhaul FDAs approach for laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).

The final rule  issued seven months after the proposed rule was published 1  amends FDAs regulations to make clear that in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) include LDTs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).

The final rule also sets forth FDAs policy to phase in enforcement of the FDCA requirements for most LDTs.

FDA will host a webinar on the final rule on May 14, 2024.

Main elements of the final rule The final rule amends the definition of in vitro diagnostic products, 2 which states that [t]hese products are devices as defined under section 201(h) of the [FDCA].

To emphasize that the IVD definition includes LDTs, FDA adds to the end of this definition the phrase including when the manufacturer of these products is a laboratory.

3

A key component to implementing the final rule is sunsetting FDAs current LDT enforcement discretion policy 4 over the next four years as follows:

Thus, at the end of four years, FDA will generally expect FDCA compliance for the majority of LDTs, including companion diagnostics used in oncology.

9

But the final rule also outlines certain categories of LDTs for which FDA will follow a different approach  requiring full and immediate FDCA compliance, continued exercise of full enforcement discretion, or a hybrid approach, namely, not requiring compliance with premarket review and quality system requirements except recordkeeping.

This last category includes currently marketed LDTs that were first marketed before May 6, 2024.

Such tests will be exempted from the new program, though they will have to comply with requirements other than premarket review and quality system requirements (except recordkeeping).

10 LDTs carved out from the four-year sunsetting In addition, FDA does not intend to enforce premarket review requirements with respect to LDTs approved by the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program, although these tests are still subject to requirements other than premarket review requirements.

Moreover, along with this final rule, FDA issued contemporaneously two new draft guidance documents to outline FDAs policy on how it will approach tests responding to an emergent situation, such as the outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health emergencies.

A word about enforcement discretion Enforcement discretion is not the same as a full carve out from FDAs oversight, as we saw with certain categories of software in the 21st Century Cures Act.

Thus, for all LDTs subject to enforcement discretion, it is important to remember that FDA retains jurisdiction over the products as medical devices, particularly in light of the final rules changes to the IVD definition.  

For a product subject to enforcement discretion, FDA may enforce the FDCA and pursue enforcement action for violations of the FDCA at any time it deems appropriate.

What comes next?

This final rule implements some of the policies the agency already had in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as requiring immediate compliance with the FDCA for tests intended for actual or potential emergencies or material threats declared under section 564 of the FDCA, and the continued exercise of enforcement discretion with respect to premarket review requirements for LDTs approved by the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program.

This enforcement discretion approach for the state of New York begs the question of whether other states were considered for this policy, or entities approved by other state clinical laboratory evaluation programs will challenge the rule.

As discussed in our November 2023 alert on the proposed rule, for this and other reasons, we anticipate litigation as FDA begins to enforce this new rule."
Cooley,Sunsetting Enforcement Discretion for CLIA-Certified High-Complexity Tests – FDA Presses Ahead With LDT Final Rule,"As discussed in our November 2023 alert on the proposed rule, for this and other reasons, we anticipate litigation as FDA begins to enforce this new rule.

Interestingly, the timing of this new rule coincides well with FDAs rollout of the new Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR), which becomes effective on February 2, 2026.

Therefore, LDT developers can focus on aligning their quality systems to the QMSR, without the uncertainty of whether it will be in effect when LDTs and LDT developers will be expected to comply with the quality system regulations.

Cooley,CFPB Study Finds Consumers Pay More When Pricing Is Complex,"On April 30, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published a report on a study investigating the effects of complex pricing structures and increased competition on consumer choices.

The CFPB found that consumers were more likely to choose higher-priced products when pricing structures were complex, such as when consumers were shown various fees separately in connection with a transaction rather than being given an upfront, single all-inclusive price.

In its press release announcing the studys publication , the CFPB stated that complex pricing generally led to more detrimental outcomes for consumers.

Key findings and highlights To conduct the study, the CFPB had participants interact in basic markets as buyers and sellers in a series of transactions.

Sellers all offered the same or similar products, effectively creating only one difference between the transactions  the price of the product.

In some instances, the sellers described the products they were offering using a single all-inclusive price and in other instances, the sellers described products using up to eight or 16 sub-prices (i.e., several prices that added up to one total price).

The CFPBs experiment led to the following findings.

Complex pricing structures lead consumers to pay higher prices: The CFPB found that the overall asking prices from sellers were 60% higher in markets with 16 sub-prices than those with one price and, on average, buyers ultimately paid more.

Buyers have difficulty comparing prices when products have complex structures: The study showed that buyers were 15 times more likely to select a product with a higher price in markets with 16 sub-prices than in those with one price.

Increasing competition does not mitigate the problems associated with complex pricing:

On average, the CFPB found that although an increase in the number of sellers generally improved the negative effects of pricing complexity, it did not eliminate those effects.

CFPB continues to sound alarm on junk fees The research underscores the continued focus on junk fees from the CFPB and, more generally, the Biden administration.

In its press release, the CFPB highlighted that using complex terms and pricing can pose challenges for consumers, stating that the findings contribute to a growing consensus of research and real-world observations showing that junk fees increase overall prices beyond what a fair and competitive market would allow.

Although the study was not tied specifically to a given consumer financial product or service, in announcing the study, the CFPB attempts to link the findings to its concerns across credit cards, deposit accounts, mortgages and auto loans.

For example, the CFPB appears to point out that credit card pricing often includes interest rates, late fees, balance transfer fees and annual fees, while mortgages pricing is determined by interest rates, loan type, credit score, or down payment.

Notably, the CFPB concludes its announcement of the study by inviting consumers to submit complaints about financial products through the CFPBs website and employees to submit whistleblower complaints to the CFPB."

Cooley,"Q1 2024 Venture Financing Report – Invested Capital Increases at All Stages and Median Pre-Money Valuations Increase for Early Rounds, While Percentage of Down Rounds Reaches New High","Cooley handled 202 reported venture capital financings in Q1 2024, representing $6.1 billion of invested capital.

While the deal count remained about the same as last quarter, invested capital increased from the $4.3 billion seen in Q4 2023, aligning with invested capital seen earlier in 2023.

In Q1 2024, deal volume remained the same or saw a slight increase across all stages of financing  except for Series Seed deals, which had a downtick from 83 reported deals in Q4 2023 to 66 reported deals in Q1 2024.

Despite the relatively flat overall number of deals in Q1 2024 versus Q4 2023, the number of transactions per month in Q1 decreased sequentially.

Invested capital increased across all stages of financing in Q1 2024, as compared to Q4 2023, with the biggest growth noted in Series D and later rounds, which increased from $451.7 million in Q4 2023 to $1.2 billion in Q1 2024.

Median pre-money valuations increased for early- and mid-stage financings, with the most significant increase seen in Series B rounds, which rose from a median of $130 million in Q4 2023 to $165 million in Q1 2024.

Median pre-money valuations for Series C, Series D and later rounds decreased in Q1 2024, continuing the downward trend that started in 2023 for later-stage rounds.

The percentage of deals with pre-money valuations greater than $100 million (at all stages) increased to 35% of deals  the highest percentage noted since Q2 2022.

The percentage of down rounds continued to increase during Q1 2024, reaching 32% of deals, the highest witnessed since the 2014 inception of this report.

The percentage of deals representing up rounds decreased slightly to 65% in Q1 2024.

Only Q3 2023 saw a lower percentage of up rounds, and the last three quarters are the only quarters in this reports history when up rounds represented under 70% of transactions.

Perhaps unsurprisingly in light of the high percentage of down rounds, the percentage of deals with a recapitalization remained relatively high at 2.5% of deals for Q1 2024.

Before Q2 2023, the percentage of deals involving a recapitalization had not risen above 2.5% of deals since Q4 2014.

The percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision increased to 8% of deals in Q1 2024, after dropping to 4.5% of deals in Q4 2023.

This represents only the fourth time in this reports history that the percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision has exceeded 7% of deals.

The percentage of deals with nonparticipating preferred stock remained very favorable to companies, representing 93% of deals for Q1 2024.

Despite the overall economic terms demonstrating continued strain, approximately 94% of transactions still had 1x nonparticipating preference, indicating other terms remained fairly neutral.

In PitchBooks annual Global League Tables for 2023 , for the fourth consecutive year, Cooley was named the #1 law firm in the US and globally for representation of companies in venture capital financings.

PitchBook also designated Cooley as the most active firm  in the US and globally  for representing companies in all deals, inclusive of venture capital, mergers and acquisitions, and private equity.

In addition, Cooley was named the second-most active law firm in the US and globally for representation of investors in venture capital financings and was ranked #1 overall for representation in venture financings in the industry sectors of pharma and biotech and healthcare services and systems.

Spotlight on technology The deal volume and invested capital for tech company venture financings saw an increase in Q1 2024.

The Q1 2024 numbers for tech company financings were in line with the numbers seen in Q1 2023, but still remained below the highs observed in 2021 and early 2022.

Similarly, the average reported deal size of venture financings for tech companies rose to $26.1 million for Q1 2024, up from just under $17.7 million in Q4 2023."
Cooley,"Q1 2024 Venture Financing Report – Invested Capital Increases at All Stages and Median Pre-Money Valuations Increase for Early Rounds, While Percentage of Down Rounds Reaches New High","Similarly, the average reported deal size of venture financings for tech companies rose to $26.1 million for Q1 2024, up from just under $17.7 million in Q4 2023.

The Q1 2024 average was comparable with the averages seen in Q3 2022 through Q3 2023, but still lagged behind the high average deal sizes witnessed in 2021 and the first half of 2022.

Spotlight on life sciences In Q1 2024, the deal count for life sciences company financings remained about the same compared to last quarter, but invested capital increased from the $1.4 billion reported for Q4 2023.

Reported deal sizes for venture financings of life sciences companies also increased in Q1 2024 to an average deal size of $45.7 million, compared to only $30 million in Q4 2023.

Despite having the same deal count as was reported in Q1 2023, the invested capital and average deal size both increased compared to one year ago, when invested capital was just more than $1 billion and the average deal size was only $20.9 million.

The percentage of life sciences company venture financings structured in tranches continued a downward trend in Q1 2024 to 17% of reported financings for life sciences companies  down from the 23% noted in Q4 2023."
Cooley,New US Law Doubles Statute of Limitations for Sanctions Violations,"On April 24, 2024, President Joe Biden signed into law HR 815 , which primarily provides supplemental emergency appropriations relating to ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

Although principally focused on an emergency foreign aid package, HR 815 also extends the statute of limitations for civil and criminal violations of sanctions regulations from five to 10 years  a notable change that is likely to be profoundly impactful in the investigations, transactional and compliance contexts.

The primary statutory authorities for most US sanctions programs are the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Trading With the Enemy Act.

Previously, violations of regulations based on these authorities were subject to a five-year statute of limitations period.

HR 815 doubles that statute of limitations to 10 years going forward, which is likely to significantly expand the number of violations that can be enforced and  because penalties are assessed per violation  increase penalty exposure.

Other notable implications of this change may include: Broader  and likely more time-, cost- and resource-intensive  diligence in connection with certain corporate transactions, including mergers and acquisitions and private equity investments.

Revisions to representations and warranties in various transactional, commercial, and financing documents.

Expansion of internal record-keeping requirements.

Adjustments to internal compliance programs and best practices, including with respect to internal investigations and voluntary self-disclosures.

Importantly, these changes may impact other IEEPA-based regulations, such as the US Office of Foreign Assets Controls forthcoming outbound investment program and the US Department of Commerces information and communications technology and services program .

Cooley,Takeover Panel Proposes to Refocus Takeover Code on Companies Registered and Listed in the UK,"On 24 April 2024, the UKs Takeover Panel proposed reforms aimed to narrow the scope of companies to which the Takeover Code applies.

The Panel suggests establishing a core principle that only companies that are, or were recently, both registered and listed in the UK should be subject to the Code.

In pursuit of this core principle, and among a number of other matters set out for consultation, it is proposed that: UK-registered companies that have securities listed (only) on an overseas market, such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, should no longer be subject to the Code  to be implemented through the abolition of the current residency test.

The run-off period for application of the Code to a company that has delisted in the UK will be shortened to three years (from the current 10-year period).

A three-year transition period will apply to companies that would otherwise fall outside the scope of the Code under the new rules.

In this alert, we explore these aspects of the proposed changes to the Code.

We look forward to engaging with interested clients and others regarding these proposals during the consultation period, which ends on 31 July 2024.

Abolition of the residency test The proposed reforms would abolish the residency test  relevant to UK-registered companies that have recently delisted securities from a UK-regulated market (delisted companies) and/or have securities listed solely overseas (UK companies listed overseas)  under which such companies can be subject to the Code if the place of central management and control of the company is in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.

Based on the established current practice of the Panel, the residency test is considered to be satisfied if a majority of the companys directors are resident in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.

This gives rise to potential uncertainty, given that composition of boards and the residency of individuals may change from time to time, with the consequence that the application of the Code to a company also may fluctuate.

Relevant companies, working with their advisers, may carefully monitor the composition of the board to ensure they are outside the scope of the Code.

Nevertheless, there may be ambiguity for shareholders and other market participants in understanding whether the Code applies to such companies at any point in time.

Based on preliminary discussions with interested stakeholders, the Panel currently understands that in many cases, UK companies listed overseas do not necessarily expect or wish to be subject to the Code.

The Panel suggests that such companies should be subject to provisions of the overseas market (if any) in relation to the conduct of takeover offers.

Transitional arrangements At the same time, the Panel notes the potential value of the protections of the Code to companies, including UK companies listed overseas.

The Panel proposes transitional arrangements through which UK companies listed overseas would have a three-year period from implementation of any new rules (transitional arrangements) in which to take steps to implement appropriate measures, such as adopting Code-like protections.

A typical way for a company to benefit from Code-like protections, as noted by the Panel, is to amend its articles of association to introduce near-equivalent provisions for key stipulations of the Code, such as the requirements of Rule 9 in relation to mandatory offers.

The suitability and practical efficacy of such measures for UK companies listed overseas is an area of interest to the Panel within the consultation.

The Panel also suggests that shareholders of UK companies listed overseas might seek  and companies may wish to offer such shareholders  opportunities to exit their investment during the three-year transition period, if they do not want to be shareholders in a company without the protections afforded by the Code."
Cooley,Takeover Panel Proposes to Refocus Takeover Code on Companies Registered and Listed in the UK,"The effect of the transitional arrangements is that the residency test will continue to apply to delisted companies and UK companies listed overseas for a three-year period following implementation of any new rules.

Delisting and ceasing to be a Code company Currently, there are a range of circumstances in which a UK company will continue to be subject to the Code even if it has delisted from a UK exchange and re-registered as a private company.

In the consultation, the Panel proposes to both significantly reduce the circumstances in which the Code would continue to apply to delisted companies and shorten the run-off period for the application of the Code from the current 10-year rule to a three-year period.

Under the transitional arrangements, a company that delists from a UK exchange prior to the implementation date of a revised Code will have a run-off period ending on the earlier of three years from the implementation date or 10 years from the date the company delisted.

Nevertheless, the proposed abolition of the residency test (discussed above) alongside the proposed adoption of a three-year run-off rule means that the Code will continue to apply to delisted companies for a period of three years from delisting, whether or not such companies satisfy the residency test.

Currently, a delisted company is potentially subject to the Code for a period of up to 10 years but, as described above, can plan and take active steps to take itself outside the scope of the Code by establishing a board that does not meet the residency test.

Under the proposed new arrangements, it will be possible for a delisted company to apply to the Panel for a waiver, disapplying some or all of the provisions of the Code  usually, at the time of an offer or other action that would otherwise activate the Code.

The Panel has proposed retaining its discretion to grant such waivers.

Certainty regarding application of the Code Overall, the proposals made in the consultation are aimed to refocus the application of the Code and the Panels jurisdiction on companies registered and listed, or recently listed, in the UK .

This core principle will be underpinned by the following two concepts: A company is UK-registered if it has a registered office in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.

Being UK-listed (or having been UK-listed at any time during a three-year period prior to a proposed or possible offer, or other event that activates the Code) means having securities admitted to trading on: A UK-regulated market  currently, the London Stock Exchange Main Market or the Acquis Main Market.

A multilateral trading facility (MTF)  currently, the AIM market operated by the London Stock Exchange or the Acquis Growth Market.

A stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man  currently, the International Stock Exchange in Guernsey (TISE).

Further, a revised Code would clarify that an MTF does not include matched-bargain facilities (such as Asset Match or JP Jenkins), intermittent multilateral trading by private companies to a selective (nonpublic) market on platforms, such as PISCES, [1] or, in usual circumstances, trading on secondary markets of crowdfunding platforms (such as Seedrs or Crowdcube).

Next steps The consultation is open for comments until 31 July 2024, and the Panel is interested in hearing from companies affected by the changes and their advisers.

Following this, the Panel expects to publish its response statement in autumn 2024.

Any changes made to the Code as a result of the consultation would take effect approximately one month after the publication of the response statement  subject to the transitional arrangements, currently proposed to last for three years.

Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"On April 12, 2024, the US Department of the Treasury and the IRS published proposed regulations ( 89 FR 25980 and 89 FR 25829 , the Proposed Regulations) on the application of Section 4501, 1 which imposes a 1% excise tax 2 on certain repurchases of stock of publicly traded US corporations (the Excise Tax).

The Proposed Regulations generally follow the same approach as the interim guidance under Notice 2023-2 (the Notice), which was summarized in this January 2023 Cooley M&A publication .

3 Like the Notice, the Proposed Regulations generally would apply to stock repurchases occurring after December 31, 2022, and stock issuances during taxable years ending after December 31, 2022, except that certain specific rules not addressed in prior guidance would be effective only for transactions after April 12, 2024, the publication date of the Proposed Regulations.

The Proposed Regulations adopt a broad approach to application of the Excise Tax, with limited exceptions.

As a result, the Excise Tax applies to transactions that are not conventionally regarded as stock buybacks, and companies may have Excise Tax liability or tax return filing obligations in myriad circumstances.

This client alert summarizes the basic framework of the Excise Tax, as implemented by the Proposed Regulations, and discusses key implications in a variety of contexts.

Background and general rules The Excise Tax Base and the Netting Rule Consistent with the Notice, the Proposed Regulations impose the Excise Tax on a corporations stock repurchase excise tax base (the Excise Tax Base).

The Excise Tax Base is the aggregate fair market value of all stock repurchases and economically equivalent transactions in a taxable year, reduced by the aggregate fair market value of any such transactions covered by a statutory exception, and further reduced by the fair market value of all stock issuances, subject to certain exceptions, during the same taxable year.

The reduction for the fair market value of stock issued during the same taxable year is hereinafter referred to as the Netting Rule.

The Proposed Regulations provide rules for calculating and paying the Excise Tax and reporting transactions that are relevant to those determinations.

The Excise Tax is not deductible and cannot be offset by tax losses or other income tax assets.

Notably, corporations subject to the Excise Tax generally must file Excise Tax returns in any taxable year in which a repurchase occurs, even if there is no net Excise Tax liability because of the statutory exceptions or because application of the Netting Rule zeroes out the Excise Tax Base for that taxable year.

The scope of Covered Corporation and timing rules The Excise Tax applies to Covered Corporations, which are domestic corporations whose stock is traded on an established securities market.

The definitional scope of an established securities market includes both regulated stock exchanges (such as Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or analogous foreign exchanges) and interdealer systems that regularly disseminate buy or sell quotations by identified brokers or dealers (such as the over-the-counter, or OTC, market).

Notably, the Proposed Regulations do not provide a safe harbor for private corporations whose stock is not listed on any regulated exchange, but for which price quotes are regularly available, regardless of whether the corporation plays a role in establishing or facilitating the quotation system.

Therefore, private companies for which stock price quotes are readily available may be subject to the Excise Tax and/or required to file Excise Tax returns.

The Proposed Regulations clarify the time at which a corporation becomes and ceases to be a Covered Corporation subject to the Excise Tax."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"The Proposed Regulations clarify the time at which a corporation becomes and ceases to be a Covered Corporation subject to the Excise Tax.

Generally, a corporation will be a Covered Corporation at the beginning of the date on which stock of the corporation begins to be traded on an established securities market, and it will cease to be a Covered Corporation at the end of the date on which stock of the corporation ceases to be traded on an established securities market (the cessation date).

However, all repurchases pursuant to a plan in which a corporation ceases to be a Covered Corporation are subject to the Excise Tax, regardless of whether the repurchases occur before or after the cessation date.

Valuation methods For purposes of the Excise Tax, repurchased stock generally is valued based on its fair market value at the time of the repurchase, rather than based on the purchase price of the stock.

The Proposed Regulations follow the Notice in requiring taxpayers to utilize one of four methods for valuing publicly traded stock for purposes of computing their Excise Tax Base: daily volume-weighted average price on the date of the repurchase or issuance; daily closing price on the date of the repurchase or issuance; daily average high-low price on the date of the repurchase or issuance; and trading price of the stock at the time it is repurchased or issued.

The chosen method must be applied consistently by the Covered Corporation for all repurchases and issuances in the taxable year.

Special rules apply for purposes of valuing contributions of stock to employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) and similar plans.

Economically similar transactions The Excise Tax generally applies to: (a) transactions that are treated as redemptions under Section 317(b) for US federal income tax purposes and (b) any transaction that the US Department of the Treasury determines is economically similar to a redemption.

To reduce uncertainty regarding which transactions will be considered economically similar to redemptions, the Notice provided an exclusive list of economically similar transactions, such as exchanges of target stock in acquisitive reorganizations and E and F reorganizations, split-offs, and certain liquidations.

The Proposed Regulations generally follow the Notice in providing that economically similar transactions will be clearly identified on an exclusive list, but the preamble to the Proposed Regulations (the Preamble) reserves for the possibility that additional items added to the list could be applied with retroactive effect.

As a result, there is no guarantee that engaging in a transaction that is currently not identified as economically similar to a redemption will be exempt from the Excise Tax.

Implications for M&A transactions Acquisitive reorganizations under Section 368(a) Consistent with the approach taken in the Notice, and contrary to the views expressed by most commentators, the Excise Tax applies under the Proposed Regulations to the extent of any boot received by the stockholders of a Covered Corporation in a reorganization under Section 368(a) in which the Covered Corporation is the target, including forward and reverse triangular mergers and asset acquisitions.

Boot generally means cash, certain preferred stock and other property that is not permitted to be received in a reorganization without the recognition of gain or loss.

No special rules were proposed with respect to troubled companies, so the Excise Tax applies even to G reorganizations in bankruptcy.

Further, the Excise Tax applies regardless of whether gain is recognized in the acquisitive reorganization and regardless of whether the boot is sourced from the acquirer or the Covered Corporation."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"Further, the Excise Tax applies regardless of whether gain is recognized in the acquisitive reorganization and regardless of whether the boot is sourced from the acquirer or the Covered Corporation.

Under the narrow interpretation of the statutory reorganization exception adopted by the Proposed Regulations, the Excise Tax will apply to an acquisitive reorganization unless the Covered Corporations stockholders receive solely acquirer stock (excluding certain preferred stock) and cash in lieu of fractional shares.

The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares generally is not treated as a repurchase for purposes of the Excise Tax, whereas cash paid to dissenting shareholders may be subject to the Excise Tax, depending on whether it is sourced from the target or the acquirer.

Notably, under the so-called no double benefit rule, acquirer stock issued in an acquisitive reorganization is not taken into account for purposes of the Netting Rule.

Taxable acquisitions and leveraged buyouts The Proposed Regulations retain the approach of the Notice with respect to taxable acquisitions, under which the source of the consideration determines the application of the Excise Tax, with consideration sourced to the acquirer treated as not being a repurchase subject to the Excise Tax.

The Preamble indicates that longstanding US federal income tax principles and guidance will apply to determine the source of consideration, including debt funding.

Thus, a taxable acquisition of a Covered Corporation that is funded in whole or in part by the Covered Corporations cash or debt  including debt of a merger subsidiary assumed by the Covered Corporation in a taxable reverse triangular merger  will be treated as a stock repurchase by the Covered Corporation that is subject to the Excise Tax.

In contrast, a taxable acquisition financed entirely with acquirer cash, apparently including debt financing incurred at the acquirer level, generally will not implicate the Excise Tax.

In this respect, taxable acquisitions are treated more favorably than tax-free reorganizations, where the source of any boot is irrelevant to application of the Excise Tax.

Constructive specified affiliate acquisitions

The Proposed Regulations introduce a new concept of a constructive specified affiliate acquisition, which is relevant to both tax-free reorganizations and taxable acquisitions.

An example of a covered specified affiliate acquisition described in the Preamble is where a Covered Corporation enters into an agreement to acquire all of the equity of a private target, and prior to the acquisition, the target uses cash on hand to purchase stock of the Covered Corporation in the market.

If the purchase of the Covered Corporation stock had occurred after the acquisition, it would have been treated as a repurchase by a specified affiliate that was subject to the Excise Tax.

The Proposed Regulations extend the Excise Tax to this situation if the target corporation or partnership becomes a specified affiliate of a Covered Corporation when the target owns stock acquired after December 31, 2022 that represents more than 1% of the fair market value of the target.

The repurchase is treated as occurring when the target becomes a specified affiliate, including as a result of redemptions by a target corporation of its own shares.

As a result, Covered Corporations should assess the Excise Tax implications of an acquisition of a target that owns stock of the Covered Corporation.

Post-closing purchase price adjustments M&A transactions often include purchase price adjustments under which consideration paid or issued at closing is subject to below-market repurchase or forfeiture by the target stockholders."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"For example, the target stockholders may be required or permitted to forfeit consideration to pay post-closing indemnity obligations, or they may be entitled to additional consideration if certain financial or event-based milestones are achieved (or required to forfeit consideration if such milestones are not achieved).

Stock of a Covered Corporation generally is treated as issued for purposes of the Netting Rule when ownership of the stock transfers to the recipient for US federal income tax purposes.

Under the Proposed Regulations, forfeiture of shares of a Covered Corporation would be taken into account as a repurchase if issuance of the shares was taken into account for purposes of the Netting Rule.

The amount of the repurchase would be equal to the market price of the stock on the date of forfeiture (and not, for example, zero (because no consideration was paid) or based upon a negotiated below-market price).

Notably, stock issued in an acquisitive reorganization that is disregarded by the acquirer for purposes of the Netting Rule because of the application of the no double benefit rule described above generally should not be treated as repurchased for purposes of the Excise Tax upon forfeiture or repurchase.

Implications for capital markets transactions Definition of stock For purposes of calculating the Excise Tax Base, the Proposed Regulations retain the broad approach of the Notice under which stock includes any instrument that is, or is treated as, stock for US federal income tax purposes at the time it is issued.

There are no categorical exceptions for nonparticipating preferred stock, mandatorily redeemable stock, or other similar types of stock that have debt-like features.

4

The redemption of such stock (including pursuant to its terms) generally will constitute a repurchase subject to the Excise Tax.

Similarly, the repurchase or cash settlement of non-stock instruments that are treated as stock for US federal income tax purposes, such as pre-funded warrants or deep-in-the-money options, generally also is subject to the Excise Tax.

For purposes of the Netting Rule, however, the Proposed Regulations generally limit stock to instruments that in legal form are stock.

If a non-stock instrument was treated as stock for US federal income tax purposes, its value is not includable for Netting Rule purposes unless and until the instrument is repurchased or cash-settled, and its value is limited to the lesser of the fair market value of the instrument at issuance or repurchase.

The issuing corporation also must satisfy several tax reporting and consistency requirements with respect to accounting for such non-stock instruments in calculating its Netting Rule offset amount.

Convertible debt and related transactions

The Proposed Regulations provide that instruments treated as debt at issuance for US federal income tax purposes are not stock for purposes of the Excise Tax, and this characterization is not retested while the debt remains outstanding for US federal income tax purposes.

Therefore, the redemption or cash-settled conversion of convertible debt generally will not give rise to Excise Tax liability (even if the convertible debt has become deep in-the-money by the time of conversion).

If a corporation physically settles conversion by issuing stock, the shares issued generally are includable in its Netting Rule offset amount for the taxable year of the conversion, based on the fair market value of the shares at the time they are issued.

A common transaction in the convertible debt market is a tax-integrated offering, in which a corporation issues convertible debt and simultaneously enters into a derivative (e.g., a capped call or bond hedge).

In a tax-integrated offering, the debt and derivative are treated as a single debt instrument for US federal income tax purposes."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"In a tax-integrated offering, the debt and derivative are treated as a single debt instrument for US federal income tax purposes.

However, the Proposed Regulations provide that the tax integration is disregarded for Excise Tax purposes, so stock subsequently issued or received with respect to the debt and derivative components are evaluated separately.

Options The Proposed Regulations provide that stock issued in physical settlement of an option is treated as an issuance or repurchase at the time of settlement.

The amount of such issuance or repurchase is based on the stocks fair market value at the time of settlement, regardless of the strike price of the option.

By contrast, the Proposed Regulations clarify that cash settlement of an option is not treated as an issuance or repurchase.

These rules generally apply to call and put options on a Covered Corporations stock, as well as other derivatives containing embedded call and put features.

The Excise Tax implications for compensatory options and for options treated as stock at the time of issuance (e.g., penny warrants) are discussed elsewhere in this alert.

Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) programs The Proposed Regulations follow the approach of the Notice for application of the Excise Tax to ASR programs.

In the typical ASR, a corporation enters into a forward contract with a financial institution under which the corporation makes an upfront cash payment and receives a certain amount of its stock at the outset.

Depending on the trading price of its stock on the later settlement date, the financial institution may deliver additional shares, or the corporation may make an additional cash payment to the financial institution.

For Excise Tax purposes, each delivery of shares to the corporation under the ASR constitutes a repurchase.

The repurchase occurs at the time legal ownership of the shares is transferred, and the amount of the repurchase is based on the fair market value of such shares at the time of transfer.

Implications for foreign-parented groups Funding rule Although the Excise Tax is primarily focused on repurchases by US corporations, it also can apply to repurchases of the stock of a publicly traded foreign corporation by certain US affiliates.

The Notice included an expansive application of this rule, which treated a purchase of a publicly traded foreign corporations stock as a repurchase subject to the Excise Tax if the purchase was directly or indirectly funded by any means (including through distributions, debt, or capital contributions) by a US affiliate of the foreign corporation and a principal purpose of such funding was to avoid the Excise Tax.

Moreover, a principal purpose was per se deemed to exist if the funding and purchase occurred within two years of each other.

The expansive scope of the funding rule and per se presumption in the Notice were criticized by commenters as an overbroad extension of the Excise Tax that could apply to ordinary course intercompany transactions, including cash management activities, of multinational groups.

The Proposed Regulations retain the general structure of the Notices funding rule, including the principal purpose inquiry, but narrow its scope in several respects.

The per se rule of the Notice has been replaced by a rebuttable presumption that downstream fundings, in which a US entity directly or indirectly provides funds to its 25%-owned (by vote or value) foreign affiliate to fund a purchase within two years of the stock of their public foreign parent corporation, have a principal purpose of avoiding the Excise Tax.

This presumption may be rebutted if the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the downstream funding does not have a principal purpose of avoiding the Excise Tax."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"This presumption may be rebutted if the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the downstream funding does not have a principal purpose of avoiding the Excise Tax.

Outside of the downstream funding context, whether any purchase of a foreign parent corporations stock has been funded by a US affiliate with a principal purpose of avoiding the Excise Tax is determined under general US tax principles based on all of the facts and circumstances.

Thus, foreign-parented groups with US entities in their organizational structure will need to balance all relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether purchases of the foreign parents stock (particularly, but not limited to, purchases by members of the group in which a US entity has a material direct or indirect ownership interest) will be subject to the Excise Tax.

Implications for corporate distributions and liquidations Dividend exception Section 4501 contains a statutory exception (the Dividend Exception) for repurchases to the extent the repurchase is treated as a dividend for US federal income tax purposes.

Transactions that are in form repurchases (such as a pro rata redemption of stock from all shareholders) could be treated as dividends that are potentially eligible for the Dividend Exception in certain circumstances, and otherwise would be treated as repurchases subject to the Excise Tax.

The Proposed Regulations impose a rebuttable presumption that the Dividend Exception does not apply.

Rebutting this presumption requires, among other things, obtaining a certification under penalties of perjury from each applicable shareholder containing information necessary to establish that the repurchase will be treated as a dividend and reported as such on the shareholders US federal income tax return.

Nonredemptive distributions The Proposed Regulations clarify that distributions by a Covered Corporation that are not in form repurchases (such as pro rata distributions to stockholders where no shares are surrendered or redeemed) are not subject to the Excise Tax, even if the distribution is treated as a return of basis or taxed as gain from the sale or exchange of the underlying shares under Section 301(c)(2) or (3).

Complete liquidations The Proposed Regulations follow the approach of the Notice in providing that distributions by a Covered Corporation made in complete liquidation, as well as other distributions by the Covered Corporation in the taxable year of its complete liquidation (regardless of whether such distributions are made pursuant to the plan of liquidation), are not repurchases subject to the Excise Tax.

This exemption does not apply if the Covered Corporation has a corporate shareholder that owns at least 80% of the Covered Corporation (by vote and value) along with other minority shareholders.

In such a case, liquidating distributions made to the minority shareholders generally will be treated as repurchases subject to the Excise Tax.

Following the Notice, commenters had expressed uncertainty about whether the complete liquidation exception would apply to a dissolution of a Covered Corporation if some classes of the stock do not receive a distribution.

The Proposed Regulations clarify that redemptions of a Covered Corporation are not subject to the Excise Tax if they are pursuant to the Covered Corporations plan of dissolution that is reported on the original (but not a supplemented or an amended)

IRS Form 966 (Corporate Dissolution or Liquidation), or are pursuant to a deemed dissolution of the Covered Corporation for US federal income tax purposes (such as, e.g., deemed dissolutions resulting from check-the-box changes in an entitys classification).

Partial liquidations If a corporation operates multiple lines of business and makes a distribution to its shareholders in connection with its ceasing to conduct one of its lines of business, such distribution may be treated as a partial liquidation."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"Noncorporate shareholders receiving a distribution in partial liquidation generally will be treated as having received payment in redemption of their stock for US federal income tax purposes.

The Proposed Regulations provide that distributions made in partial liquidations of a Covered Corporation also are treated as repurchases subject to the Excise Tax, regardless of whether any stock is actually repurchased in connection with the partial liquidation.

Implications for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)

General Several commenters had requested special modifications or exceptions to the Excise Tax rules for SPACs.

The Proposed Regulations generally declined to provide any such exceptions.  

As a result, the rules and issues summarized elsewhere in this alert generally apply in the SPAC context, some of which are discussed further in this September 2022 Cooley M&A publication .

De-SPAC redemptions and Netting Rule implications SPAC shareholders typically have the right to cause the SPAC to redeem their shares in advance of a de-SPAC combination with a target corporation.

Such redemptions are subject to the Excise Tax under the general rules described above, but the Netting Rule may reduce or eliminate the SPACs Excise Tax liability to the extent of the value of SPAC shares issued in the same taxable year, including issuances to target shareholders in the de-SPAC or in any related private investment in public equity (PIPE) financings.

However, certain de-SPAC combinations utilize transaction structures in which the SPAC is not the acquiring entity.

These include double dummy structures in which a new corporation acquires both the SPAC and the target, as well as reverse merger structures in which the SPAC is the target.

If the SPAC is not the acquiring corporation, the value of stock consideration issued in the business combination generally will not be available under the Netting Rule to offset the SPACs Excise Tax Base.

The Proposed Regulations declined to provide any special exceptions for SPACs or any expansion of the Netting Rule for these types of transactions.

SPAC liquidations Prior to the Proposed Regulations, there was concern that the exception for complete liquidations might not apply to SPAC liquidations if specific classes of stock held by the SPAC sponsors did not receive any liquidating distributions.

As discussed above, the Proposed Regulations clarify that the liquidation exception applies to distributions pursuant to the plan of dissolution reported on IRS Form 966.

Thus, distributions made in connection with the dissolution of a SPAC generally should be exempted from the Excise Tax, even if a sponsor waives rights to any distribution with respect to its stock.

Inbound and outbound reorganization transactions Often in advance of a de-SPAC combination with a target corporation, the SPAC will undertake a redomicile transaction in which it becomes, or ceases to be, a US corporation.

For US federal income tax purposes, the redomicile transaction typically qualifies as an F reorganization.

The Proposed Regulations provide that a publicly traded foreign corporation that domesticates in an inbound F reorganization will not become a Covered Corporation until the day after the domestication.

Thus, repurchases by a foreign SPAC that domesticates to the US prior to combining with a US corporation should not be subject to the Excise Tax, so long as the repurchases occur on or before the date of the domestication.

Implications for compensatory transactions Restricted stock Under the Proposed Regulations, the Excise Tax implications of the issuance and forfeiture of restricted stock depend on whether a valid election under Section 83(b) (Section 83(b) election) is made with respect to the restricted stock."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"If a timely Section 83(b) election is made for restricted stock, the shares are treated as issued and the fair market value of such shares at issuance is included in the corporations Netting Rule offset amount for the year of issuance.

A subsequent forfeiture of such shares is treated as a repurchase subject to the Excise Tax, with the fair market value of the shares at the time of forfeiture includable in the corporations Excise Tax Base for the year of forfeiture.

Because of changes in the fair market value between issuance and forfeiture and the absence of any carryover of excess Netting Rule credit, the forfeiture of restricted stock may result in Excise Tax liability without a corresponding Netting Rule offset.

If a valid Section 83(b) election is not made, restricted stock generally would not be considered issued, and would not be taken into account for Netting Rule purposes, until such time as the restricted stock vests.

The subsequent forfeiture of any such unvested restricted stock would not constitute a buyback subject to the Excise Tax.

Clawbacks Stock received by a corporation due to the application of a clawback policy or agreement (i.e., an arrangement requiring an individual to return vested stock due to the occurrence of an applicable clawback event) is treated similarly to restricted stock forfeited to the corporation due to a failure to vest.

As such, the rules described above would apply.

If the stock was treated as issued under the Netting Rule, then the stock would be treated as repurchased on the date of the clawback in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on that date.

Exercise of compensatory options and related tax withholding When an option is exercised, a corporation often will satisfy tax withholding and/or the option exercise price by reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable (net settlement) or selling a portion of the deliverable shares (sell to cover).

The Proposed Regulations provide that shares reduced pursuant to a net settlement transaction are disregarded for purposes of the Netting Rule.

However, shares sold pursuant to a sell to cover transaction are treated as issued for Netting Rule purposes.

Stock contributed to retirement plans or employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) The Excise Tax contains a statutory exception for stock repurchases if the repurchased stock, or an amount of stock equal to the value of the repurchased stock, is contributed to an ESOP or similar plan.

The Proposed Regulations provide rules for determining the timing and value of such stock contributions and the universe of eligible plans (including special rules for leveraged ESOPs), and procedures for reporting such contributions for purposes of claiming the statutory exemption.

Procedural aspects The Proposed Regulations provide rules for reporting and paying the Excise Tax on Form 720 (Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return).

Following the IRS announcement in June 2023 which postponed the requirement to report or pay the Excise Tax until guidance was provided in regulations, the Proposed Regulations stipulate that corporations do not need to report or pay the Excise Tax until the Form 720 due date for the first full calendar quarter after the publication date of final regulations (see further discussion in this July 2023 Cooley alert ).

For example, if the Proposed Regulations are finalized on September 16, 2024, a calendar-year corporation that makes repurchases subject to the Excise Tax during its 2023 tax year would be required to report and pay the Excise Tax by January 31, 2025, the due date for its fourth quarter Excise Tax returns."
Cooley,IRS Publishes Proposed Regulations on Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"The Proposed Regulations clarify that Covered Corporations must comply with Excise Tax reporting requirements, including the filing of Form 7208 (Excise Tax on Repurchase of Corporate Stock), in any year in which a repurchase subject to the Excise Tax occurs, even if the corporation does not have any Excise Tax liability, e.g., because of the Netting Rule or statutory exception.

Thus, while the extension of time to file Excise Tax returns and pay the Excise Tax provides taxpayers and their advisers time to further analyze the Excise Tax, the scope of the filing requirements under the Proposed Regulations remains broad.

Notes References to Sections are to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Note that President Bidens 2025 budget proposal contemplates quadrupling the rate of the Excise Tax to 4%.

Previous Cooley publications have addressed general and SPAC-specific implications of the Excise Tax, as well as the interim procedural rules for reporting and paying the Excise Tax.

The Proposed Regulations provide a narrow exception for additional tier 1 preferred stock required to be issued and repurchased by banks and other regulated financial institutions, due to the unique regulatory requirements in that context."
Cooley,"New SEC Requirements for Form 13F Filers Effective July 1, 2024","In late 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rule changes that will require institutional investment managers who file Form 13F to annually file a Form N-PX disclosing the manner in which they have voted on certain pay-related proposals held by the companies whose securities they hold.

In this alert, we summarize these requirements and provide practical takeaways for investors to consider when voting this proxy season and preparing their initial Form N-PX filings under the new requirements.

Background: Form 13F Form 13F is a quarterly report that certain institutional investment managers must file if they exercise investment discretion with respect to accounts holding Section 13(f) securities (generally US publicly traded securities) having an aggregate value of at least $100 million.

Form 13F requires these institutional investment managers to report basic information about their holdings of Section 13(f) securities, including the name of the issuer, the class of security held, the number of shares owned, and the fair market value of the securities held, in each case as of the end of the most recently completed quarter.

The determination of whether an investor is required to file reports on Form 13F can be complex and is beyond the scope of this alert.

What does new rule require of Form 13F filers?

The new rule implements a mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act and requires each Form 13F filer to publicly report on an annual basis on Form N-PX the manner in which it voted on all pay-related proposals, which are advisory proposals presented by most public companies to their stockholders for consideration at stockholder meetings.

Below, weve outlined the three types of pay-related proposals covered by the new rule.

1.

Advisory votes on executive compensation Sometimes referred to as say-on-pay proposals, these allow stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the compensation paid to the companys named executive officers.

These votes generally are held annually at the companys annual meeting of stockholders, but some companies hold them less frequently.

2.

Advisory votes on frequency of executive compensation votes Sometimes referred to as say-on-frequency proposals, these allow stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes.

These proposals are required to be held at least once every six years and generally are held at the companys annual meeting of stockholders.

3.

Advisory votes on golden parachute arrangements Sometimes referred to as say-on-parachute proposals, these allow stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the compensation payable to a companys named executive officers as a result of a change-in-control event (e.g., a merger or acquisition).

These proposals generally only arise in connection with the vote on the change-in-control transaction.

Effective dates The new requirements go into effect on July 1, 2024 , and Form 13F filers will be required to file their first reports on Form N-PX by August 31, 2024 .

The first report will cover all pay-related proposals presented at any stockholder meeting held between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024.

Form N-PX will require Form 13F filers to disclose, on an issuer-by-issuer basis, the number of shares voted, and how they were voted on the pay-related proposal(s) submitted to stockholders (e.g., for, against or abstain or, in the case of say-on-frequency proposals, every one, two or three years).

If Form 13F filers cast votes in multiple manners for a particular company (e.g., both for and against a proposal), they should report how many shares they voted in each manner.

It is important to note that there is no de minimis exemption to reporting the manner of voting, meaning that Form 13F filers will be required to report all pay-related proposal votes regardless of the number of shares of the issuers stock they own or the fair market value of the shares."
Cooley,"New SEC Requirements for Form 13F Filers Effective July 1, 2024","For Form 13F filers who engage in share lending, Form N-PX will require the Form 13F filer to report the number of shares they loaned out and did not recall for voting.

For any Form 13F filers who have a disclosed policy of not voting proxies, and who did not in fact vote their shares during the relevant period, Form N-PX will include a designation box to indicate this fact.

Transition matters Only Form 13F filers who filed Form 13F during 2023 and 2024 will be required to file Form N-PX by August 31, 2024.

For institutional investment managers who have been subject to Form 13F filings only for a portion of the 2023 to 2024 time period, the SEC has provided transition guidance on the Form N-PX filing requirements, which weve outlined below.

Form 13F filers for 2024, but not 2023 Form 13F filers are not required to file a Form N-PX during the first calendar year in which their initial Form 13-F was required, so these Form 13F filers will not be required to file Form N-PX until 2025.

Form 13F filers in prior years, but not during 2024 These institutional investment managers are not required to file a Form N-PX this year, and they will not be required to file an initial Form 13F until the calendar year following their next required Form 13F filing.

Form 13F filers who cease filing Form 13F during 2024 Current Form 13F filers who do not trigger a filing obligation for 2025  i.e., those who do not own an aggregate of $100 million of Section 13(f) securities as of the end of any calendar month of 2024  will be required to file a stub period Form N-PX next year.

That filing will cover all pay-related proposals presented at stockholder meetings held between July 1, 2024, and September 30, 2024, and will be due on March 1, 2025.

What to do now Form 13F filers should begin tracking the annual meeting dates of their public portfolio companies, including determining whether pay-related proposals will be, or have been, presented.

Similarly, Form 13F filers should monitor and record the manner of voting on pay-related proposals for all their public companies during the period covered by this filing requirement.

Finally, Form 13F filers should begin to aggregate this information for provision to outside counsel who can assist in preparing the Form N-PX by the filing deadline.

Practical considerations It is important that institutional investment managers recognize that their voting decisions on pay-related proposals now will be made public.

Executive compensation matters recently have been the focus of heavy public criticism, so, to the extent there are sensitivities to the institutional investment managers voting practices on these matters, they should consider whether and how these new requirements may impact their voting decisions.

Additionally, public companies generally are very sensitive to the degree of stockholder support that they receive on say-on-pay proposals.

Companies that receive below 80% support from stockholders on their say-on-pay proposals often undertake an investor outreach program to engage with their largest stockholders to seek feedback on their executive compensation programs.

Accordingly, Form 13F filers should be mindful of the possibility of receiving outreach from management of these companies  and be prepared to engage in these discussions, particularly when their ownership position is relatively large (e.g., greater than 1%).

More information on the new rule is available in the SECs November 2022 press release and fact sheet ."
Cooley,"CFPB Reports on Recent Mortgage Servicing Examination Findings, Continues to Highlight ‘Junk’ Fees","On April 24, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published a new edition of its Supervisory Highlights focused on findings from recent mortgage servicing examinations.

Although the reports publication emphasizes continued instances in which servicers are assessing junk fees, the report actually details what appear to be operational issues that may result in the assessment of fees, or other technical violations of the Regulation X servicing requirements.

The report also indicates that the CFPB continues to utilize noncompliance with investor guidelines as the basis for findings related to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP), or technical Regulation X violations.

Regulatory violations stemming from operational errors The Supervisory Highlights detail a host of operational errors that examiners determined led to violations of Regulation Xs loss mitigation rules.

These errors included failing to waive fees and charges for borrowers under COVID-19 hardship loan modifications, failing to include the required verbiage on acknowledgment and evaluation letters, failing to make outreach to delinquent borrowers in violation of the early intervention live contact and written outreach requirements, and failing to retain records demonstrating compliance with these requirements.

In addition, the CFPB found that a servicer failed to maintain reasonable policies and procedures when it neglected to follow investor guidelines for evaluating loss mitigation applications by automatically denying certain consumers for particular loss mitigation options.

Other findings noted in the Supervisory Highlights relate to fees charged to borrowers, escrow disbursement and adequacy of notices to borrowers.

Fees charged to borrowers Examiners found a number of regulatory and UDAAP violations related to fees that servicers charged to borrowers.

In particular: Property inspection fees:

It was unfair to charge property inspection fees where prohibited by investors.

Late fees: It was unfair to charge late fees exceeding the amount permitted by the note or in connection with a loss mitigation agreement that should have prevented the assessment.

Periodic statements: It was a violation of Regulation Zs periodic statement requirements to have inadequate fee descriptions  such as using the term service fee to cover 18 different fee types, with no additional information.

Escrow disbursement Examiners noted one Regulation X violation related to escrow disbursements: Late disbursements: Servicers violated Regulation X when escrow disbursements failed to reach the intended payee, and the payments were resent only after borrowers complained and fees incurred.

Adequacy of notices Examiners noted several categories of deficiencies and violations related to how servicers engaged with delinquent borrowers and borrowers entering the loss mitigation process: Evaluation notices: Certain streamlined loss mitigation option offers were deceptive because they misinformed borrowers they were approved for the option (when in fact some were later denied).

The conclusion was based on the fact that consumers could have made budgeting decisions on the false assumption they had been approved, or were discouraged from taking additional steps to complete a loss mitigation application or cure their delinquency.

Delinquency notices: It was deceptive to send a delinquency notice informing customers they had missed a payment when they were in fact current, in a trial modification or had an inactive loan.

Whats next?

This report is only the latest in a series of issuances promoting the CFPBs junk fees initiatives  most recently evidenced in its final rule to reduce credit card late fees , a proposed rule regarding overdraft fees and a circular on junk fees charged on international money transfers ."
Cooley,"CFPB Reports on Recent Mortgage Servicing Examination Findings, Continues to Highlight ‘Junk’ Fees","In comments released with the Supervisory Highlights, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra noted that servicing is an area of particular concern because homeowners cannot just simply switch providers if their mortgage servicer charges them illegal junk fees, and that since mortgage borrowers are captive to a company they never chose to do business with, we are working hard to detect and deter violations of the law.

Servicers should take particular note of the fact that the CFPB continues to incorporate an assessment of compliance with investor requirements into its reviews and has claimed that noncompliance with investor requirements can be the basis for a UDAAP finding."
Cooley,EU Adopts Mandatory Rules on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence That Will Apply to Many US Companies,"On 24 April 2024, the European Parliament voted to adopt the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), meaning it will now become law and necessitate a shift in corporate attitudes to responsible business conduct.

The CSDDD will apply to European Union (EU) and non-EU companies with activities in the EU meeting the thresholds outlined below.

For the first time, it will introduce comprehensive mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence obligations, with significant financial penalties and civil liability for companies that do not fully comply.

It also will create a new obligation for companies to adopt and put into effect a climate transition plan, as well as a requirement for companies to report on their due diligence processes.

This will likely be a heavy lift for most in-scope businesses, as these requirements reframe existing international soft laws [1] as mandatory obligations.

Companies not in scope but in the value chains of businesses that are in scope also will feel the effects of the law, and can expect increasing sustainability-related information requests, contractual requirements and climate-related transition requests.

The new due diligence obligations created by the CSDDD will apply in addition to other more specific due diligence obligations introduced under the EUs Conflict Minerals Regulation , the EUs Batteries Regulation , the EUs Deforestation Regulation and the new procedures companies will have to adopt to ensure compliance with the EUs ban on products made with forced labour , which also was approved by the European Parliament this week.

Which companies does the CSDDD apply to?

The CSDDD applies to EU and non-EU companies, including most regulated financial undertakings, that satisfy the turnover and employee thresholds.

It also applies to ultimate parent companies of groups that satisfy the same thresholds on a consolidated group basis.

The EU has adopted a phased-in approach for the CSDDD with the obligations applying between three and five years from the date the law enters into force.

The CSDDD only applies to those companies that meet the relevant thresholds for two consecutive years.

We also will be closely tracking national implementation of the CSDDD into the laws of the EU member states, since EU member states are permitted to bring additional companies in scope of the CSDDD and/or require compliance sooner.

Franchisors and licensors Lower financial thresholds apply to companies that rely on franchise or license models where the companys or groups agreements with third parties ensure a common identity, a common business concept and the application of uniform business methods.

What does the CSDDD require in-scope entities to do?

Mandatory climate transition plans The CSDDD will require all in-scope companies to adopt and put into effect a climate transition plan which aims to ensure, through best efforts, that the business model and strategy of the company is compatible with all of the following: Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in line with the Paris Agreement.

The EUs objective of achieving climate net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, including all related interim targets for 2030 (i.e., a reduction of net GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels) and 2040.

A transition to a sustainable economy.

A companys climate transition plan must include, amongst other things, science-based, time-bound targets covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions for 2030  and every five years after until 2050.

The transition plan needs to be updated annually and must contain a description of the progress the company has made towards achieving its targets.

For those companies in scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), their plan will be subject to audit."
Cooley,EU Adopts Mandatory Rules on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence That Will Apply to Many US Companies,"For those companies in scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), their plan will be subject to audit.

The 2030 emissions target will, in practice, require many companies to take steps to comply before the CSDDD fully applies to them, otherwise they risk not being able to achieve the target set.

Critically, this is an obligation of means and not of results.

While the CSDDD recognizes that specific circumstances may lead to companies not being able to reach their targets, for traded companies, in particular, there remains a risk of securities litigation where targets disclosed in regulated filings go unmet.

Even for nonlisted companies, there are risks of claims being brought under new EU green claims rules if reported targets are known to be unachievable (and therefore potentially misleading).

Mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence Under the CSDDD, companies also will be required to identify and, where necessary, prioritize, prevent, mitigate, bring to an end, minimize and remediate potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts whilst engaging in stakeholder consultation throughout.

Companies will need to refresh their mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence assessments at minimum every 12 months and, where not already required to report on their processes under the CSRD, they will be required to publish an annual statement on their due diligence processes.

In-scope companies due diligence efforts must cover their own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries, and operations carried out by direct and indirect business partners in their chain of activities.

A companys chain of activities covers the upstream activities connected to a companys product or service  including design, extraction, sourcing, and manufacture of raw materials and products.

It also covers certain downstream activities, including the distribution, transport and storage of products, but not their disposal or end use.

As the downstream impacts of services are entirely excluded, regulated financial undertakings are therefore only subject to due diligence obligations for the upstream part of their chain of activities.

However, the CSDDD envisages the possible introduction of sustainability due diligence requirements for the financial services industry as early as 2026.

What does mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence require in practice?

In practice, this means companies will need to: 1. Integrate mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence into their policies and risk management systems at all relevant levels of operation.

These policies must be developed in consultation with the companys employees and representatives and must be updated periodically.

2. Identify and assess actual and potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts.

Adverse human rights and environmental impacts include, for example, forced labour, pollution and biodiversity loss, and must be assessed throughout a companys own operations, those of its subsidiaries and, where related to its chain of activities, those of its business partners.

This will require companies to map their chain of activities and carry out in-depth assessments in those areas where adverse impacts are most likely to occur and/or are most severe.

Mandatory stakeholder consultation is a critical part of this identification and assessment process.

3. Prevent  or, where not possible, mitigate  potential adverse impacts and where impacts are identified, bring them to an end.

The CSDDD provides for risk-based due diligence, aligned with the UNGPs focus on severity and likelihood.

These obligations are not obligations of result but obligations of means (i.e., companies are not expected to guarantee that adverse impacts will never occur or that they will always be stopped)."
Cooley,EU Adopts Mandatory Rules on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence That Will Apply to Many US Companies,"These obligations are not obligations of result but obligations of means (i.e., companies are not expected to guarantee that adverse impacts will never occur or that they will always be stopped).

Companies must nevertheless take appropriate measures that are capable of effectively addressing adverse impacts identified in a manner commensurate to the nature of the adverse impact.

Measures might include cascading contractual clauses or targeted support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the form of training or even targeted financial aid.

As a last resort, where efforts to prevent or mitigate have been unsuccessful, companies may be required to terminate their business relationship.

Stakeholder consultation will play an important role in each instance to inform and support a companys decisions and actions.

4. Provide remediation where the company causes or causes jointly with subsidiaries or business partners (e.g., by facilitating or incentivizing) an actual adverse impact.

Remediation here means the restitution of affected persons, communities or the environment to a situation equivalent to or as close as possible to the position they would have been in had the adverse impact not materialized.

Where a company neither causes nor contributes to the impact arising in its chain of activities, the company is nevertheless expected to use its influence to bring to an end or minimize the extent of the impact.

5. Prioritize where necessary.

Companies should prioritize adverse impacts based on their severity and likelihood without regard to business-related factors, such as the companys potential liability or the leverage the company might have.

Once the most salient adverse impacts have been addressed, companies must then address those less salient.

6. Engage in stakeholder consultation.

The CSDDD mandates meaningful stakeholder engagement throughout the due diligence process.

Stakeholders include individuals and communities whose rights or interests are or could be impacted, as well as civil society organizations.

Companies are expected to pay particular attention to the needs of vulnerable stakeholders and must address barriers to engagement.

7. Establish and maintain a notification mechanism and complaints procedure.

These processes must be publicly available and transparent, and they must enable impacted persons, trade unions and civil society to submit legitimate concerns regarding actual or potential adverse impacts.

8. Do more than rely on contractual assurances alone.

Companies will not be able to rely on cascading contractual assurances alone to satisfy their due diligence obligations under the CSDDD.

Where used, contractual assurances must be accompanied by appropriate measures to verify compliance and should be designed to ensure that responsibilities are shared appropriately by the company and the relevant business partner and avoid the complete transfer of due diligence obligations.

The European Commission is expected to publish voluntary model contract clauses before the end of 2026.

Enforcement Fines

The CSDDD will be enforced nationally by the authorities of the EU member states.

Companies that do not comply with the CSDDD may face sanctions from national administrative authorities  including fines of up to 5% of their global turnover.

New civil liability regime The CSDDD introduces a civil liability regime whereby companies could be liable for damages where they intentionally or negligently failed to prevent, mitigate, bring to an end or minimize an adverse human rights impact which led to damage.

The civil liability is subject to a five-year limitation period and excludes damage caused solely by the activities of a companys business partners.

Civil society and nongovernmental organizations will be able to bring claims for collective redress on behalf of victims.

National courts also are expected to implement mechanisms to address procedural barriers for claimants."
Cooley,EU Adopts Mandatory Rules on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence That Will Apply to Many US Companies,"National courts also are expected to implement mechanisms to address procedural barriers for claimants.

Exclusion from public tenders It also is possible that national authorities will make compliance with the CSDDD a criterion for the award of public contracts and concessions.

Next steps?

The CSDDD enters into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.

Prior to publication, the CSDDD will need to be formally approved by the European Council (expected 23 May).

This means that the CSDDD will likely enter into force during Q3 2024.

Member states will have two years after entry into force to transpose the legislation into national law, and the requirements will start to apply to companies three, four and five years after entry into force, depending on the size of the company.

We will be closely tracking national implementation of the CSDDD and how it impacts existing national due diligence regimes in the EU  e.g., the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) and the French law on the duty of vigilance  already in force, along with proposed regimes  e.g., the Dutch Child Labour Due Diligence Act.

Member states have discretion under the CSDDD to expand the scoping thresholds, the downstream activities in scope and the measures available for remediation.

If you have any questions or would like support understanding the implications of this new regime, please contact a member of Cooleys international ESG and sustainability advisory team .

Cooley,FTC Passes Sweeping Noncompete Ban,"On April 23, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted 3  2 in favor of banning all post-employment noncompete agreements.

The rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on May 7, 2024, making the effective date of the rule September 4, 2024, barring any injunction or court ruling extending the date.

According to the briefing schedule in the lawsuit filed by the US Chamber of Commerce in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, we expect the court to hear argument on an injunction and the merits of the case in late June or early July 2024.

In January 2023, the FTC published a proposed version of the noncompete ban.

The final rule is substantially the same as the initial rule.

Below are the key provisions of the final rule.

Broad application of categorical ban on noncompetes All post-employment noncompete agreements with workers will be prohibited beginning on the effective date of the ban.

In its final rule, the FTC noted that it determined that noncompetes constitute an unfair method of competition, violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).

Among other things, the agency noted that the case-by-case and State-by-State approaches to non-competes have proven insufficient to address the tendency of non-competes to harm competitive conditions in labor, product, and service markets.

Moreover, the FTC posits that noncompetes restrict the freedom of American workers, suppress wages, and stifle new business and innovation.

The FTC estimates that banning noncompetes would create new businesses and increase American workers earnings by $400  488 billion over the next decade.

As with its proposed rule, the final rule broadly defines a noncompete clause as a term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from (1) seeking or accepting work in the United States with a different person where such work would begin after the conclusion of the employment that includes the term or condition; or (2) operating a business in the United States after the conclusion of the employment that includes the term or condition.

In addition, as with the proposed rule, the final rule broadly applies to noncompete agreements affecting virtually all workers  including employees, independent contractors, externs, interns, volunteers, apprentices or sole proprietors.

There are narrow exceptions, including for existing agreements with senior executives, as detailed below.

Significantly, employers should note this broad definition of a noncompete clause includes certain provisions that are commonly thought to constitute alternatives to noncompetes.

As such, the FTCs final rule indicates that these alternatives also violate its noncompete ban  for example, if they penalize a worker for seeking or accepting other work or for starting a business after the worker leaves their job.

These covenants include forfeiture-for-competition clauses, which the FTC describes as similar to [an] agreement with liquidated damages  

[that] imposes adverse financial consequences on a former employee as a result of the termination of an employment relationship, expressly conditioned on the employee seeking or accepting other work or starting a business.

In addition, the FTC also notes that a severance agreement in which the worker is paid only if they refrain from competing also would violate the rule.

As the FTC states, The common thread that makes each of these types of agreements non-compete clauses, whether they prohibit or penalize a worker, is that on their face, they are triggered where a worker seeks to work for another person or start a business after they leave their jobi.e.

, they prohibit or penalize post-employment work for another employer or business.

Exception for existing agreements with senior executives The rule does not ban existing noncompete agreements with senior executives."
Cooley,FTC Passes Sweeping Noncompete Ban,"Exception for existing agreements with senior executives The rule does not ban existing noncompete agreements with senior executives.

However, after the effective date, new noncompete agreements with senior executives will be subject to the ban.

The final rule defines senior executives according to a two-pronged test, with an earnings threshold and a job duties requirement.

These workers must earn more than $151,164 annually and be in policy-making positions.

A policy-making position is defined as a business entitys president, chief executive officer or the equivalent, any other officer of a business entity who has policy-making authority, or any other natural person who has policy-making authority for the business entity similar to an officer with policy-making authority.

The rule further defines an individual with policy-making authority as one who has final authority to make policy decisions that control significant aspects of a business entity or common enterprise and does not include authority limited to advising or exerting influence over such policy decisions or having final authority to make policy decisions for only a subsidiary of or affiliate of a common enterprise.

Employers should note that this class of workers should be very narrowly construed, as the FTC states that it expects less than 1% of workers to qualify as senior executives under this definition.

Notice requirement Unlike the proposed rule, formal rescission of existing noncompete agreements is no longer required.

Instead, employers will be required to issue a notice to all nonsenior executive workers who have existing noncompete agreements explaining that those agreements will no longer be in effect and will not be enforced upon the effective date of the rule.

To assist employers, the FTC published a model notice on its website.

Notably, the model notice contains language stating that the employer will not enforce any noncompete clause against the employee, the employee may seek or accept a job with any company or any person (even if competitive), the employee may run their own business (even if competitive), and the employee may compete with the employer following their employment.

The model notice also refers employees to the FTCs website to learn more about the ban.

Exceptions The rule does not apply to the following entities and contexts: Nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements  

The rule excepts nonsolicitation agreements and nondisclosure agreements.

However, employers should note that restrictive covenants that effectively prevent a worker from working in the same field would violate the rule, because they functionally operate as a noncompete clause.

In-term noncompete agreements  

The rule also does not apply to noncompete agreements prohibiting competing against an employer during employment.

Certain employers excepted from the FTC Act  Certain employers also are excepted from the laws application, because they are not subject to the FTC Act.

These employers include banks, insurance companies, nonprofits, transportation and communications common carriers, air carriers and some other entities.

Franchisee/franchisor contracts  

The ban does not apply to contracts between franchisees and franchisors themselves, although it does apply to employees working for a franchisee or franchisor.

Sale of business exception  As proposed originally, the ban also includes a sale of business exception.

However, unlike the proposed rule, the final rule adopts the exception permitting noncompetes for the bona fide sale of a business, without requiring that the seller have at least a 25% ownership interest in the business entity, as originally proposed.

Violations Violations of the rule will be deemed a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce."
Cooley,FTC Passes Sweeping Noncompete Ban,"Violations Violations of the rule will be deemed a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.

The FTC, however, cannot obtain civil penalties or other monetary relief against parties for using an unfair method of competition.

The agency can instead pursue adjudication under Section 5(b) of the FTC Act or seek an injunction in federal court against a party that has engaged in an unfair method of competition.

The agency can obtain civil penalties in court if a party is ordered to cease and desist from a violation and fails to do so.

Complaints regarding suspected violations also may be sent to the agency by email or mail.

Next steps The final rule is expected to face immediate legal challenge.

Indeed, a lawsuit filed on April 23, 2024, by Ryan, LLC in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas challenges the FTCs rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act  and alleges that the rule constitutes an unauthorized, unconstitutional attempt to eliminate a long-established private economic arrangement.

In addition, the US Chamber of Commerce announced its intent to file an immediate lawsuit with a request for an injunction as early as Wednesday, April 24.

According to the Chamber of Commerce press release , the rule constitutes a blatant power grab that will undermine American businesses ability to remain competitive.  

Since its inception over 100 years ago, the FTC has never been granted the constitutional and statutory authority to write its own competition rules.

Noncompete agreements are either upheld or dismissed under well-established state laws governing their use.

Yet, today, three unelected commissioners have unilaterally decided they have the authority to declare whats a legitimate business decision and whats not by moving to ban noncompete agreements in all sectors of the economy.

This decision sets a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business and can harm employers, workers, and our economy.

Chamber officials stated that their concern lies principally with what this decision would mean for the FTCs power to regulate unfair methods of competition.

Objections to the agencys rulemaking authority also were raised by the two FTC commissioners voting against the rule on April 23.

In particular, Commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew Ferguson both expressed that the noncompete rule exceeds congressional authorization, and that the agency does not have the authority to undo millions of existing contracts and existing noncompete laws in many states.

In light of imminent legal challenges, the future of the rule is uncertain.

It is possible that the rules effective date will be extended while litigation plays out in courts.

In the meantime, employers should take proactive steps now to carefully evaluate their use of noncompete agreements  including the business justifications and goals for imposing such restrictions and the range of employees for whom such covenants are imposed.

Cooleys employment team will continue to follow developments relating to the FTC rule.

Employers with questions about the use of restrictive covenants should contact their Cooley employment lawyers."
Cooley,CFPB Emphasizes Voluntary Nonbank Consent to Supervision in Updated Procedural Rulemaking,"On April 16, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a final rule revising its procedures for establishing supervisory authority over nonbank financial institutions on the basis that the institution poses a risk to consumers.

In 2023, the CFPB initiated its first round of supervisory designation procedures under the old rules, and in February 2024 made public the order stemming from its first contested proceeding .

Although this update seeks to make the designation process more efficient based on the CFPBs recent experience in exercising its authority, it also promotes voluntary consent to CFPB supervisory authority by keeping such decisions confidential.

The rule also highlights a forthcoming structural change at the CFPB creating separate, stand-alone supervision and enforcement divisions, both of which will report to the CFPB director.

New rule promotes voluntary consent, efficiency The rule does not significantly change the substance of the overall designation process, but makes a few key adjustments to it.

1. Voluntary consent excluded from public release Institutions noticed by the CFPB that voluntarily consent to its supervisory authority will not have the consent made public.

In light of the characterizations made in the CFPBs February 2024 release, this could be a powerful incentive for institutions to voluntarily submit to supervision.

2. Duration flexibility for voluntary consent The rule gives the CFPB flexibility to establish the duration of its supervisory authority, as opposed to setting forth a default two-year period.

3.

Supplemental briefings in contested designations The rule gives the CFPB director additional flexibility during a contested process to request a supplemental briefing prior to making a final determination as to whether to issue the order.

A supplemental briefing was utilized in the first contested designation but was not expressly contemplated in the prior procedural rule.

4.

Organizational changes According to the updated rule, the designation process will now fall under the purview of a single person  the CFPBs new supervision director.

This change is necessitated by what appears to be, according to the preamble of the rule, a new structural shift at the CFPB to create independent supervision and enforcement divisions  CFPB functions that previously came under the single division of Supervision, Enforcement and Fair Lending.

5. Express exhaustion provision The procedural updates include an express issue exhaustion provision, which would require that for any argument that a nonbank financial institution has to support its position  including setting aside an action by the CFPB  the entity must raise it with the CFPB prior to filing a lawsuit.

Looking ahead In 2022, the CFPB made a big splash when it promised to utilize its dormant authority to supervise high-risk nonbanks not otherwise subject to its automatic supervisory jurisdiction.

After two years of utilizing that authority, its refined procedural rules reflect learnings from approaching nonbank institutions with high-risk designations.

While the new process preserves procedural protections for institutions seeking to challenge the assertion of CFPB supervisory authority, the cost and risk associated with challenging such an assertion will need to be balanced with the commitment of confidentiality where the institution gives its voluntary consent."
Cooley,Address Complainants Before They Become Whistleblowers,"Editor's note: Authored by Rebekah Donaleski, Miriam Petrillo and Erika Brigantti Abraham, this article was originally published in Law360 .

Prosecutors and regulators haverecently offered significant financial rewards to whistleblowers to come forward in an effort to spur corporate enforcement.[1]

But whistleblowers aren't made overnight  many times they are persuaded to act by the perception that management is ignoring their complaints.

In light of increased efforts by prosecutors and regulators to encourage whistleblowing, it is more important than ever that companies establish strong processes to take in, review and resolve internal complaints.

The facts alleged in a recent whistleblower retaliation case  which survived a motion to dismiss exemplify the pathway from internal complainant to whistleblower.

On March 18, theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied a motion to dismiss a whistleblower retaliation claimagainstHSBC Securities(USA) Inc. after finding that the plaintiff met the ""relatively low bar"" for pleading that his internal complaints contributed to his termination.

Steven Callahan, a former trader for HSBC Securities, alleged that he was terminated because he reported illegal front-running by traders at HSBC both internally and to a regulator.

U.S. DistrictJudge J. Paul Oetken found in Callahan v. HSBC Securities that HSBC's termination of Callahan and its filing of a negative post-termination Form U5 qualified as adverse employment actions under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Further, Judge Oetken determined that Callahan had adequately pled that his protected activity was a contributing factor to these adverse actions based on the temporal proximity between his reports and the actions, ""indications of pretext"" in the company's explanation for his termination, and the company's ""inconsistent application of policies and its differential treatment of Callahan compared with that of other employees.""

The court also sustained certain promotion, suspension and bonus claims that were effectively time-barred under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act but still viable under state law.

Before reporting observations of front-running to theU.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Callahan allegedly reported his concerns directly to company managers and supervisors on multiple occasions over the course of six months  which the company allegedly ignored.

That is to say, Callahan did not become a whistleblower overnight.

Ignored complaints to management combined with financial incentives from theU.S. Department of Justiceand other federal regulators  including theCFTC create the perfect conditions for a concerned and disgruntled employee to make the jump to federal whistleblower.

Effectively Managing Employee Complaints Investigations by the DOJ, theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionand other federal agencies sparked by whistleblower complaints are an ever-present threat to employers that appear to be on the rise.

Employers must pay close attention to their protocols for managing internal complaints to minimize the risk that such complaints will escalate into government investigations.

Proactive measures for receiving and responding to complaints of workplace misconduct are crucial for minimizing and curtailing potential whistleblower complaints.

Companies can help protect themselves  and their business interests  by following best practices for receiving and responding to complaints of workplace misconduct.

1. Adopt whistleblower complaint policies.

Companies should establish complaint management policies that provide secure and efficient channels for employees to submit workplace complaints, including whistleblower-related concerns.

These policies should establish confidential and anonymous channels for employees to bring their concerns to their employers' attention.

The instructions given to employees who wish to avail themselves of these channels should be clear and accessible."
Cooley,Address Complainants Before They Become Whistleblowers,"The instructions given to employees who wish to avail themselves of these channels should be clear and accessible.

Processes for managing complaints after initial reporting should be fair and transparent as to the company's procedure for evaluating claims and providing timely responses.

Concerned employees also should receive assurances that they will be protected against retaliation for raising concerns.

Beyond formal complaint management policies, nurturing a company culture that emphasizes open-door policies can help prevent escalation of workplace complaints.

Providing employees informal, trusted and accessible outlets to raise workplace concerns will not only help employees feel supported, but also will often facilitate earlier identification of potential employee-related concerns.

Regardless of approach, it is critical to have a system in place that facilitates appropriate intake and resolutions to complaints of workplace misconduct.

2. Train personnel to respond appropriately.

Managers and supervisors should be adequately trained to recognize whistleblower complaints and to appropriately escalate and respond to those complaints.

Without such training, complaints of workplace misconduct might not be treated or even viewed as whistleblower complaints.

To that end, companies should train managers on the relevant company policies and give them the tools to field complaints with professionalism and without skepticism.

Employees will be more likely to participate in the company's internal investigation if their complaint is received by well-trained individuals who take them seriously and help them effectively navigate the complaint management processes, while providing assurance that such complaints will be promptly addressed and retaliation will not be tolerated.

These middle managers will often be the ones interfacing most with whistleblowers  and their preparedness could mean the difference between an effective internal response and a full-blown federal investigation.

3. Conduct thoughtful investigations.

A workplace investigation should be conducted when there exists a credible allegation of workplace misconduct or breach of ethical practices.

Any investigation should be structured to effectively address the issues identified while still being mindful of business imperatives.

A thoughtful internal investigation that detects misconduct, ensures compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and identifies areas of improvement in the company's internal operations will always aid in the protection of the interests of the company and its shareholders.

4. Implement remedial efforts as appropriate.

At the conclusion of an internal investigation, it may be appropriate to implement policy or personnel changes to address the underlying causes of misconduct or prevent future instances of wrongdoing.

Additionally, a company that uncovers potential wrongdoing during an internal investigation should consult outside counsel to determine whether and when to self-report to the relevant regulatory body.

Even where no remedial steps are deemed necessary, employers must be thoughtful about their communications with the complainant, including closing the loop on the result of the investigation.

Employees should be thanked for raising issues of potential workplace misconduct and encouraged to come forward if they become aware of misconduct in the future.

And, of course, it should be emphasized that retaliatory actions against the complaining employee will not be tolerated and should be reported to the company immediately.

Following well-conceived policies and procedures for workplace complaints may often be enough for a whistleblower to feel heard and to ensure that any misconduct is addressed and remediated minimizing the risk that whistleblowers will escalate their allegations to the government.

Cooley,UK Antitrust Enforcer Outlines Growing Concerns for AI Foundation Model Markets,"Following an almost yearlong review into artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, and the publication of its initial report in October 2023 , the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published an updated report and a fuller technical report , outlining its growing concerns that competition in AI is not working as it should.

In a speech delivered 11 April 2024, CMA CEO Sarah Cardell further announced that the CMA is commencing a program of work in the space.

We have summarized the key concerns identified by the CMA below, together with a summary of the principles that the CMA encourages AI companies to adopt in their business practices.

We expect that the CMA will be markedly stepping up its activity in this space, making use of the full regulatory toolbox  stretching from merger control and competition to consumer enforcement actions, market investigations and digital regulation.

We also expect that the CMAs report will serve as a precursor to increased scrutiny and enforcement activities from European Union (EU) and US agencies.

AI partnerships and acqui-hires move into the CMAs spotlight The CMAs findings In its report, the CMA identified a web of partnerships and strategic investments (including so-called acqui-hires, where the main focus of an acquisition is to acquire talent) within the foundation AI chain involving digital firms, which the CMA believes already have strong positions in critical inputs for foundation model development and/or key access points or routes to market for foundation model release and deployment.

The CMA has noted that these partnerships and investments result in deepened relationships among firms at different levels of the AI supply chain, and that they may entail direct financial investment and provision of key inputs, such as data or compute, as well as distribution agreements on an exclusive or priority basis.

The CMA is concerned that these partnerships may allow these large digital firms to exert control and influence over multiple parts of the AI value chain and entrench what the CMA believes is an already strong market position (or extend this into new adjacent markets).

The updated report also observes the possibility that incumbent firms may try to use such partnerships to quash competitive threats.

In this context, the CMA has noted that it could be particularly concerned if a partnership has one or more of the following features:

Either party has existing power upstream over a critical input in AI development and/or existing power downstream where the models might be deployed.

The models involved have significant future potential.

Either party gains influence over the others development of models and/or deployment downstream, especially where there is information exchange and scope to align on incentives.

Noting its concern that some investments may have been structured to avoid merger control rules, the CMA has announced that it will step up the use of its merger control powers to assess whether such partnerships (and potentially also acqui-hires) can be categorized as mergers, and if so, whether they give rise to competition concerns.

Other agencies can be expected to do the same or use other available tools to conduct reviews.

The CMA has materially sharpened its tone with regards to relationships within the AI stack, but what is notable from the updated report is the limited recognition by the CMA of the wider investment context.

The CMA makes only a passing comment that partnerships are a necessary part of the investment ecosystem and can bring pro-competitive benefits, but does not explore these issues further.

What does this mean?

The CMA states in its report that it is tracking some of the most significant partnerships (more than 90) in the sector using publicly available information, explaining that it has looked at investments both with and without an equity stake."
Cooley,UK Antitrust Enforcer Outlines Growing Concerns for AI Foundation Model Markets,"A number of these partnerships and parties are clearly identified in the CMAs report.

It is to be expected that they will now keep these under close and constant review, and the companies involved shall need to be mindful of this.

In general terms, we can expect significantly enhanced monitoring by the CMAs merger intelligence team of non-notified acquisitions and strategic investments in the sector.

Dealmakers in the AI space should be aware of potential CMA scrutiny of investments and acquisitions, even where those investments may be limited and/or where the normal merger thresholds are not met.

The CMA has broad flexibility to intervene in investments.

All that is needed to trigger the UK merger control framework is the acquisition of material influence which can result not only from a small minority investment, but also from board representation rights, as well as commercial or financial arrangements between companies.

Other jurisdictions have similar powers to assess below threshold mergers.

Where merger control powers cannot be invoked, we anticipate the CMA and other regulators will look to examine partnership-type agreements under the normal competition law framework for assessing agreements.

Therefore, while we expect that investment into the AI segment will remain vibrant , companies seeking funding or contemplating a strategic investment should conduct a regulatory risk assessment early and consider whether the deals characteristics are likely to pique the interests of European regulators, particularly those with more flexible jurisdictional requirements, such as the EU, Germany, Austria and the UK.

The outcome of this assessment also should be reflected in the risk allocation provisions of the transaction documents.

In conducting this assessment, it will be important to consider the rationale of the partnership or transaction; if scrutinized by regulators, it will be critical that the pro-competitive effects of the investment are clearly articulated.

Dealmakers also will have to remain cognizant of the evolving substantive trends and be aware that the CMA and other regulators will continue to consider the competitive impact of a merger on a long-term time horizon, potentially stretching many years into the future.

Such an analysis will typically involve a close examination of internal documents  in particular, any discussions of the deal rationale or a partys future plans in the relevant sector.

Regulating critical inputs and the impact of the AI talent wars The CMAs findings The updated CMA report also expresses a concern that a small number of large digital firms control critical inputs  such as compute, data and employee expertise  for AI foundation model development.

The CMA believes that these large digital firms may be able to use this control to restrict access and prevent challengers from building effective competing models.

In addition, the report sets out that some of these firms have strong positions in one or more critical inputs for upstream model development, while also controlling key access points or routes to market for downstream deployment.

The CMA believes that this creates a particular risk that large digital firms could leverage power up and down the value chain and extend this into new markets.

The CMA has illustrated how these concerns might materialize in the following graphic:

Source: CMA

In this context, the CMA has specifically highlighted t ongoing AI talent wars and their potential impact on competition.

The updated report specifically characterizes AI technical expertise as a key input for building competitive AI models and notes that large technology companies will typically have greater means of attracting and retaining key AI researchers and engineers.

What does this mean?

In addition to its merger control powers, we expect that the CMA will make use of its full range of tools to address its perceived concerns."
Cooley,UK Antitrust Enforcer Outlines Growing Concerns for AI Foundation Model Markets,"What does this mean?

In addition to its merger control powers, we expect that the CMA will make use of its full range of tools to address its perceived concerns.

In particular, the CMA already announced that it would expand its ongoing cloud computing market investigation to include a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact of AI foundation models on competition in the provision of cloud services.

Further, the incoming Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill (see our April 2023 alert ) will allow the CMA to designate certain digital companies as having strategic market status (SMS), with each designated SMS firm subject to its own bespoke set of regulatory obligations, including potentially on AI.

With ongoing CMA investigations covering labor market issues and no-poach agreements, further enforcement action involving access to talent in the AI space also is not off the table.

Companies in the sector can expect increased scrutiny of nonsolicitation and noncompete restrictions affecting employees.

We also expect that the CMA will seek to cooperate with its counterparts in the EU and US, and that enforcement action in the AI space will be characterized by cross-agency alignment.

For example, beyond enforcement of the EUs general antitrust rules, the top antitrust official at the European Commissions Directorate-General for Competition, Olivier Guersent, recently said that the EUs new Digital Markets Act would take into account the impact of AI on the designated core service of a gatekeeper and hinted that the EU may impose interim measures to freeze developments where anti-competitive conduct is suspected.

In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry to scrutinize corporate partnerships and investments with AI providers, with FTC Chair Lina Khan publicly committing not to permit a handful of firms to concentrate control over key AI tools.

The Department of Justice also has recently launched an AI initiative and announced its intent to pursue harsher penalties for AI-facilitated crimes .

Consumer choices and consumer enforcement The CMAs findings While the CMA acknowledges that AI foundation models may benefit consumers by providing higher-quality, lower-priced, and more personalized products and services, the CMA believes that there are several consumer-specific risks in the current landscape.

For one, the updated report is concerned that choices of people and businesses would be shaped by current familiarity or preference for digital products and platforms, like mobile, search engines, productivity software or cloud-based developer platforms, and that a small number of large firms could use their strong positions in those consumer- and business-facing markets to control how AI models are deployed and what choices are available to customers.

In addition, the CMA is concerned that AI models have the potential to facilitate unfair consumer practices, such as subscription traps, hidden advertising and fake reviews.

What does this mean?

Whilst the CMAs competition law powers will clearly be an important focus in its regulatory approach to AI, we anticipate that exercising its consumer powers will be an equally important priority for the CMA.

In this context, the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill, once in force (anticipated to be later in 2024), will grant the CMA extensive new enforcement powers for breaches of consumer protection law, including the imposition of fines.

Importantly, the bill will give the CMA the flexibility to choose whether to use its existing competition law powers, its digital regulation powers and/or its consumer law enforcement powers to tackle any consumer issues it identifies in relation to AI foundation models.

In a shifting technical and regulatory landscape, companies with consumer-facing AI UK activities should therefore ensure that their compliance processes are both robust and adaptable."
Cooley,UK Antitrust Enforcer Outlines Growing Concerns for AI Foundation Model Markets,"In a shifting technical and regulatory landscape, companies with consumer-facing AI UK activities should therefore ensure that their compliance processes are both robust and adaptable.

Importantly, any regulatory assessment of proposed strategies should place equal weight on both competition and consumer impacts, and those risks should be considered holistically.

The CMAs AI principles The CMAs findings In its 2023 report, the CMA put forward draft principles for companies in the AI sector to adopt when designing business practices and commercial strategies.

Having undertaken significant engagement with the sector, the CMA has finalized these.

These principles, designed to ensure positive market outcomes and effective competition, are as follows: Ongoing ready access to inputs.

Sustained diversity of business models and model types.

Sufficient choice for businesses and consumers, so they can decide how to use foundation models.

Fair dealing and no anti-competitive conduct.

Transparency so that consumers and businesses have the right information about the risks and limitations of foundation models.

Accountability by foundation model developers and deployers to foster the development of a competitive market.

Further detail of what each of these means is provided by the CMA in its report.

What does this mean?

Whilst the above principles are not mandatory, the CMA calls on companies in the AI sector to align their business practices with these principles.

Thus, in articulating how they expect markets and companies to operate, we expect these will be used by the CMA as a yardstick against which the behavior and performance of AI companies will be measured in any enforcement actions and market reviews.

In practical terms, AI companies are therefore advised to look to these principles when planning and executing commercial strategies.

Next steps The CMA expects to take several further steps off the back of this updated report: The CMA will likely step up its monitoring and investigating of AI partnerships and acqui-hire deals involving large digital firms.

The CMA has announced that it will examine the competitive landscape in AI accelerator chips as part of its next phase of its review of the industry.

The CMAs ongoing review of the cloud infrastructure sector will be expanded to consider the potential impact of AI foundation models on how competition works in the provision of cloud services .

The CMA will likely use the powers given to it by the upcoming Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill to designate key AI players as having SMS  giving the CMA very broad powers to regulate their conduct and activities in the market.

Together with several other UK regulators (including the UKs data protection regulator), the CMA will conduct further research on consumer understanding in the use of AI foundation model services, along with issuing a joint statement on the interaction among competition, consumer protection and data protection in AI foundation models."
Cooley,US Supreme Court: Pure Omissions Not Actionable Under Rule 10b-5(b),"On April 12, 2024, the US Supreme Court reversed the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuits decision in Macquarie v. Moab Partners and held that a pure omission cannot form the basis of a securities fraud claim under Rule 10b-5(b).

SCOTUS made clear that an omission is only actionable if it renders an affirmative statement materially misleading.

Its ruling reiterates its 2011 holding in Matrixx v. Siracusano that 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.

Disclosure is required under these provisions only when necessary to make  statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

As noted by Macquarie, had the Supreme Court ruled the other way, it could have open[ed] the floodgates to potentially crippling private class action liability.

The Supreme Courts decision resolves a circuit split regarding whether a company can be held liable under Rule 10b-5(b) solely for failing to make a disclosure required by a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule  Item 303 of Regulation S-K. Item 303 requires companies to disclose, in the managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections of their periodic SEC filings, any known trends or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations.

The Second Circuits ruling, which had held that a failure to disclose information required by Item 303 can amount to an actionable omission under Section 10(b), conflicted with rulings by the Third, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, which held that it cannot.

The decision by SCOTUS also limits Rule 10b-5(b) liability in certain circumstances  and is a reminder that silence is generally not actionable under Rule 10b-5.

It is worth mentioning, though, that pure omissions can still trigger liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, so companies should keep in mind that a failure to include disclosure required by Item 303 in one or more reports that are incorporated by reference into a registration statement can still trigger liability under Section 11 with respect to a securities offering under that registration statement.

Additionally, the SEC can bring enforcement actions for violations of Item 303.

Background This case began as a putative class action complaint filed in and later dismissed by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York .

The plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated Rule 10b-5(b), which bars knowingly false or misleading statements.

The defendant company, through a subsidiary, operates large bulk liquid storage terminals.

The plaintiff claimed that the defendants failed to disclose the impact that pending regulations restricting the use of a certain refined petroleum product would have on the companys business.

Although the plaintiff did not allege that this omission rendered any of the companys affirmative statements false or misleading, the plaintiff claimed that the omission violated Item 303 and served as an independent basis for liability.

The district court disagreed.

It found that the plaintiff had failed to allege that the defendants failure to discuss the impact of the fuel oil regulation was material and, more importantly, had failed to show that any impact had taken effect before the class period began, and so had failed to allege a violation of Item 303.

A panel of the Second Circuit reversed the district courts decision , finding that the plaintiff had adequately alleged a violation of Item 303.

Moreover, it found the plaintiff sufficiently alleged the defendants knowingly misled the market in large part because they were required to, but did not, discuss the oil regulations potential impact in their Item 303 disclosures.

The court revived the plaintiffs claims, including its Rule 10b-5(b) claim, largely on this basis."
Cooley,US Supreme Court: Pure Omissions Not Actionable Under Rule 10b-5(b),"The court revived the plaintiffs claims, including its Rule 10b-5(b) claim, largely on this basis.

Supreme Courts decision Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court, holding that pure omissions are not actionable under Rule 10b-5(b).

The ruling explained that a pure omission occurs when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence.

In contrast, half-truths, which can form the basis of a Rule 10b-5(b) claim, are representations that state the truth only so far as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying information.

The Supreme Court heavily relied on the statutory language of Rule 10b-5 to reach its decision.

The rule prohibits omitting a material fact necessary to make the statements made  not misleading.

In contrast, Section 11 imposes liability for failure to speak because it prohibits a registration statement that omit[s] to state a material fact required to be stated therein.

The ruling found that the difference in language signaled intent to impose liability for pure omissions under Section 11, but not under Rule 10b-5(b).

SCOTUS also addressed its 1988 decision in Basic v. Levinson , which held that [s]ilence, absent a duty to disclose, is not misleading under Rule 10b-5.

The Supreme Court clarified that a duty to disclose does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b).

A violation of Item 303 can only support a Rule 10b-5(b) claim if the omission renders an affirmative statement misleading, consistent with the rules plain language.

Finally, the Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that without liability for pure omissions, there will be broad immunity any time an issuer fraudulently omits information Congress and the SEC require it to disclose.

It explained that the SEC can still investigate and enforce violations of its regulations.

Significance There is no liability under Rule 10b-5(b) based solely on an omission of information required to be disclosed under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, where such omission does not render the existing disclosure misleading in any material respect.

As such, companies and individuals across the US are protected from Rule 10b-5(b) liability  though not, as discussed above, Section 11 liability or SEC enforcement actions  where they do not expressly or impliedly speak on a topic.

The decision emphasizes the importance of assessing whether statements could be construed as being misleading by omission.

Such analysis is often a complicated process that is greatly assisted by seeking the advice of experienced counsel."

Cooley,"CFPB’s Spring Supervisory Highlights Report Reinforces Focus on Consumer Reporting, Furnisher Activities","On April 8, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) published the 32nd edition of its Supervisory Highlights report .

As discussed in more detail below, the report highlights consumer reporting issues identified in examinations completed from April 2023 through December 2023.

It also sets forth recent supervisory program and enforcement developments concerning furnishers and consumer reporting agencies (CRAs).

The Supervisory Highlights focus on consumer reporting issues is unsurprising in light of the CFPBs recently published Consumer Response Annual Report , which reflects that consumer reporting, including credit reporting, was again the most-complained-about financial product or service in 2023  accounting for more than 81% of all consumer complaints sent by the CFPB to companies for review.

To that end, within the Supervisory Highlights, the CFPB emphasizes that [i]naccuracy in the credit reporting system is a long-standing issue that remains a problem today and that the CFPB would continue to prioritize examinations of consumer reporting companies  and furnishers going forward.

CFPBs key observations The CFPB identified deficiencies in CRAs and furnishers compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Regulation V. CRAs The CFPB identified certain issues with CRAs practices, as outlined below.

CRAs failed to block information after consumers submitted the requisite identity theft documentation.

The CFPB observed that CRAs failed to block the reporting of information after consumers provided them with the requisite identity theft documentation, and without otherwise making a reasonable determination that there was a statutory basis to deny the block.

In addition, the CFPB observed that CRAs failed to: Notify consumers, as required by the FCRA, within five business days after declining to block information, or rescinding a block of information, that consumers had identified as resulting from identity theft.

Provide consumers who contacted the CRAs to express a belief that they were victims of fraud or identity theft with a summary of rights containing all the information required by the CFPB in its model summary of rights form .

Issues with CRAs handling of identity theft claims also were recently highlighted in the CFPBs Consumer Response Annual Report, where the CFPB emphasized that consumers seemed to face many difficulties in addressing tradeline inaccuracies in their consumer report as a result of alleged identity theft.

CRAs failed to block adverse information resulting from human trafficking.

In 2022, the CFPB issued a rule under Regulation V, requiring that CRAs block adverse items of information identified by consumers or their representative as resulting from a severe form of human trafficking.

In its examinations, the CFPB observed that CRAs failed to block such information in response to a qualifying consumer request, either in whole or in part, or within four business days of receiving the consumer request, as generally required under the rule.

CRAs failed to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy by accepting information from unreliable furnishers.

The CFPB found that CRAs failed to follow procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information included in consumer reports where they failed to sufficiently monitor dispute metrics, such as those showing that, over several months, a furnisher had not responded to all or nearly all disputes or, alternatively, had responded to all disputes in the same manner, and still continued to include information from such furnishers in their consumer reports.

This is not the first time the CFPB has taken issue with CRAs monitoring of dispute trends."
Cooley,"CFPB’s Spring Supervisory Highlights Report Reinforces Focus on Consumer Reporting, Furnisher Activities","This is not the first time the CFPB has taken issue with CRAs monitoring of dispute trends.

In its summer 2021 Supervisory Highlights and a 2022 advisory opinion , the CFPB explained that CRAs failed to follow reasonable procedures for assuring maximum possible accuracy of consumer reports when they continued to include information in consumer reports that was provided by unreliable furnishers, meaning furnishers whose dispute response behavior suggested that they were no longer sources of reliable, verifiable information about consumers.

Furnishers The report also emphasizes key observations in the CFPBs examination of furnishers of information to CRAs, including the issues outlined below.

Furnishers failed to promptly update inaccurate or incomplete information.

The CFPB contends that furnishers are continuing to violate the FCRA by failing to promptly correct and update information reported to the CRAs after finding it is incomplete or inaccurate.

To underscore this point, the CFPB highlights that furnishers failed to update dates of first delinquency (DOFD) for several months after determining such were inaccurately reported.

Importantly, unaddressed DOFD issues also were a central focus of the CFPBs 2022 advisory opinion on the prevalence of what the CFPB called facially false data in consumer reports, as well as several furnisher enforcement actions brought by the CFPB.

In the Supervisory Highlights, the CFPB also spotlights specific bankruptcy, auto lease and deposit account inaccuracies which, according to the CFPB, were left unaddressed by furnishers.

The CFPB stated that, in response to these findings, furnishers were updating internal controls and/or conducting lookbacks to ensure that corrections or updates were made to impacted accounts.

Furnishers failed to provide required notifications/information to CRAs.

The FCRA requires that furnishers notify CRAs when an item of information provided to the CRAs by the furnisher is subject to a direct dispute and, also, that furnishers inform the CRAs of the DOFD associated with applicable accounts.

The CFPB observed that furnishers failed to communicate this information to CRAs consistent with their obligation under the FCRA.

In particular, the CFPB emphasized issues with reporting of the DOFD by auto loan furnishers, including that they inaccurately reported the DOFD as the first day of a statement cycle following a missed payment, rather than 30 days after the missed payment, and, also, that they changed the DOFD for accounts that continued to be delinquent month after month, where such should remain unchanged.

Furnishers failed to reasonably investigate direct disputes.

A theme throughout several editions of the CFPBs Supervisory Highlights, including the latest edition, is that furnishers are not meeting their obligation to conduct reasonable investigations of direct disputes.

In particular, the CFPB asserts that furnishers required consumers to provide additional information, beyond what is required under Regulation V, in order to initiate a direct dispute investigation.

This observation follows a 2022 CFPB circular warning furnishers that they are liable under the FCRA if they fail to investigate any dispute that meets the statutory and regulatory requirements.

In addition, the Supervisory Highlights report raises that debt collection furnishers were automatically deleting tradelines upon receipt of a dispute, rather than conducting a reasonable investigation  a practice that the CFPB previously said can harm consumers .

Furnishers failed to prevent furnishing of information upon receipt of an identity theft report.

Finally, the CFPB explained that furnishers were continuing to report information after receiving an identity theft report, reflecting that the information resulted from identity theft, at the address specified by the furnisher for receipt of such documentation."
Cooley,"CFPB’s Spring Supervisory Highlights Report Reinforces Focus on Consumer Reporting, Furnisher Activities","Although the FCRA allows furnishers to reinitiate reporting of such information if the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is, in fact, correct, the CFPB asserted such knowledge or information had not been obtained by furnishers in the scenarios it identified.

Looking ahead The Supervisory Highlights report reflects the CFPBs continued concern over inaccuracies in consumer reports.

Several of the issues identified in the latest edition are issues that the CFPB has previously identified as problematic.

CRAs and furnishers should take note  and consider reviewing their consumer reporting policies and procedures to ensure they align with CFPB expectations.

It may be particularly prudent to conduct such a review in advance of the CFPBs expected FCRA rulemaking proposal, which, as recently indicated by the CFPB, is expected later this year and likely will add to CRAs and furnishers obligations under the FCRA."
Cooley,FTC Enhances Scrutiny of Subscriptions and Negative Option Features Under ROSCA,"Recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) activities (see, e.g. , proceedings against Wealthpress , Publishers Clearing House and Amazon ) demonstrate that the FTC is pursuing alleged violations of the Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act (ROSCA), 15 USC 110.

These actions are part of an aggressive FTC agenda focused on negative option features or negative option offerings.

In September 2023, the FTC filed an amended complaint in a US district court alleging that Amazon violated ROSCAs negative option feature rule by enrolling consumers in Amazon Prime subscriptions without consent and by employing dark patterns.

The FTC alleges that Amazon designed a deceptive onboarding process intended to trick consumers into enrolling in subscriptions and a complicated cancellation process intended to make it exceedingly difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.

In the amended complaint, the FTC claims that [Amazon] and its leadership have knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service (Nonconsensual Enrollees or Nonconsensual Enrollment)  

[using] manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as dark patterns to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions, and that  the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them.

In October 2023, stemming from alleged violations of ROSCAs negative option feature rule, the FTC filed a proposed stipulated order in a US district court against F9 Advertising, its sole owner and affiliated companies.

The FTC alleged that the defendants, who offered monthly skin care product subscriptions, charged consumers a nominal trial cost without telling them they would be charged for the full cost of the product and for monthly auto-shipments unless consumers took action to cancel.

The FTCs proposed stipulated order requests that the court approve a $34 million penalty against the defendants and permanently restrain and enjoin them from offering any products or services pursuant to a negative option feature.

The FTC renewed its focus on ROSCA enforcement  and the inclusion of individuals in ROSCA complaints  in January 2024, filing a complaint and settlement order against FloatMe and the companys two co-founders.

The complaint alleges that FloatMe, a provider of cash advances, violated ROSCAs negative option feature rule by misrepresenting the availability of cash advances to induce consumers to enroll in subscription plans, as well as charging consumers without consent and employing dark patterns to thwart consumer attempts to cancel their subscriptions.

The settlement order includes $3 million in consumer redress, for which the company and the co-founders are jointly and severally liable.

These actions represent only a subset of the FTCs recent efforts to enforce ROSCAs negative option feature rule, and these efforts appear likely to continue in the coming year.

What is a negative option feature?

ROSCA incorporates the definition of negative option feature from the Telemarketing Sales Rule, which provides that a negative option feature is: [A]n offer or agreement to sell or provide any goods or services, a provision under which the customers silence or failure to take an affirmative action to reject goods orservices or to cancel the agreement is interpreted by the seller as acceptance of the offer 16 USC 310(w).

The FTC has treated this definition as including automatic renewals and free-to-pay or fee-to-pay conversions.

In an automatic renewal, a seller unilaterally renews a consumers subscription until that consumer takes affirmative action to cancel the subscription.

In a free-to-pay conversion, a seller offers a good or service for a trial period at no cost (or, in a fee-to-pay conversion, at a reduced cost)."
Cooley,FTC Enhances Scrutiny of Subscriptions and Negative Option Features Under ROSCA,"In a free-to-pay conversion, a seller offers a good or service for a trial period at no cost (or, in a fee-to-pay conversion, at a reduced cost).

Upon conclusion of the trial period, the seller automatically charges the consumer a periodic recurring fee until the consumer takes affirmative action to cancel the agreement.

How do companies comply with ROSCA?

Section 4 of ROSCA has three key elements.

Failure to comply with any one element is considered a violation of the statute.

Any person who charges or attempts to charge consumers for goods or services sold in a transaction effected on the internet through a negative option feature, must: Provide text that clearly and conspicuously discloses all material terms of the transaction before obtaining the consumers billing information (required disclosures).

Obtain a consumers express informed consent before charging the consumers credit card, debit card, bank account or other financial account for products or services through such transaction (express informed consent).

Provide simple mechanisms for a consumer to stop recurring charges from being placed on the consumers credit card, debit card, bank account or other financial account (simple cancellation mechanism).

Required disclosures The FTC has taken an expansive view of what constitutes a material

[term] of the transaction.

It has asserted that the material terms that must be disclosed go beyond purely transactional terms  such as price and the frequency of charges  and include the material terms of the underlying product or service.

The result is that, for negative option sellers, making inaccurate claims about material features of underlying products or services, or failing to disclose the material limitations of those products or services, could result in allegations of ROSCA violations by the FTC.

Informed consent The FTC also has contended that companies failed to obtain express informed consent when consumers were unknowingly enrolled in negative option features, such that their consent was not express, or when companies have failed to provide the required disclosures, including material disclosures relating to the underlying product or service, such that consumer consent was not sufficiently informed.

Simple cancellation The FTCs enforcement history and public guidance do not clearly set forth requirements for a simple cancellation mechanism.

The FTC has stated, however, that to provide a simple cancellation mechanism, sellers should provide cancellation mechanisms that are at least as easy to use as the methods consumers use to enroll in each negative option feature.

This can include making cancellation mechanisms available via the same medium (such as a website or mobile application) that consumers use to enroll and responding promptly to consumer inquiries related to cancellation.

The FTC further cautions that sellers should not impose unreasonable delays on consumer attempts to cancel negative option features.

FTCs focus on individuals and companies Both companies and certain individuals at those companies can be held jointly and severally liable for ROSCA violations.

To support a finding of individual liability for monetary relief pursuant to a ROSCA violation, an individual typically needs to have knowledge of the conduct giving rise to the violation, and either the authority to control that conduct or direct participation in the conduct.

In recent ROSCA matters, the FTC has taken an aggressive approach to holding individuals liable, irrespective of company size.

For example, in the September 2023 amended complaint filed against Amazon, the FTC named both the company and three senior executives as defendants.

Despite Amazons size and the dispersed responsibility that likely exists in a company of that size, the FTC alleged that the named executives were aware of and responsible for the conduct at issue in the complaint."
Cooley,FTC Enhances Scrutiny of Subscriptions and Negative Option Features Under ROSCA,"Individual risk can arise not only from violations of ROSCA, but also from failure to comply with FTC investigations into possible ROSCA violations.

In November 2023, the Department of Justice announced an indictment against Jason Cardiff for, among other things, witness tampering related to a ROSCA investigation.

The FTC had previously issued a civil investigative demand (CID) to Redwood Scientific Technologies, allegedly owned and operated by Jason Cardiff and Eunjung Cardiff, related to the companys marketing and sales practices for certain consumer health products.

The indictment alleges that Jason Cardiff engaged in witness tampering by ordering company employees to destroy documents responsive to the CID.

Public statements by FTC commissioners also affirm the approach that the FTC has taken toward individual liability in enforcement actions.

In an October 2022 statement , FTC Chair Lina Khan asserted that, Overseeing a big company is not an excuse to subordinate legal duties in favor of other priorities, and that by holding executives liable, the FTC can further ensure that firms and the officers that run them are better incentivized to meet their legal obligations.

Between recent enforcement actions and public statements, such as the one from Khan, the FTC appears to view pursuing individual liability as an important source of both general and specific deterrence.

What are the penalties for violating ROSCA?

Companies that violate ROSCA can incur steep civil monetary penalties and damages for consumer redress, as well as the imposition of nonmonetary obligations.

Consumer redress may, in part, be measured by the amount of money that has flowed from consumers to the company attributable to the ROSCA violation.

Therefore, depending on how central the conduct at issue is to a companys business, consumer redress can result in significant disgorgement of company revenue.

Why is the FTC increasingly pursuing ROSCA violations?

The ability to seek equitable monetary relief for ROSCA violations is a unique tool in the FTCs arsenal, which may help explain why it has shown increasing enforcement interest in this area.

In 2021, the US Supreme Courts decision in the matter of AMG Capital Management, LLC v. FTC significantly restricted the FTCs ability to seek equitable monetary relief.

Before this case, the FTC typically relied on Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 USC 53, to obtain equitable monetary relief for violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

In its decision on the AMG matter, the Supreme Court found that the FTC lacks the authority to seek equitable monetary relief under Section 13(b).

Rather, the Supreme Court found that Section 13(b) only permits the FTC to seek injunctive relief.

Traditionally, the FTC has heavily relied on the broadly construed provisions of Section 5 to provide the basis for enforcement against actors allegedly engaged in a wide range of unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including misleading advertising and false product claims.

Without the ability to obtain equitable monetary relief, however, the FTCs Section 5 enforcement powers have been significantly weakened.

By contrast, for violations of ROSCA, the FTC can obtain equitable monetary relief in civil actions by relying on Section 19 of the FTC Act, 15 USC 57b.

Whereas Section 19 remedies could, in theory, be available for Section 5 violations, obtaining Section 19 remedies for Section 5 violations requires additional procedural steps that often make this approach impractical.

For ROSCA violations, however, the FTC has contended that these additional steps are not required, and so it is significantly more empowered to obtain monetary relief.

Given this consideration, the FTC may be inclined to divert enforcement resources from Section 5 violations to ROSCA violations."
Cooley,FTC Enhances Scrutiny of Subscriptions and Negative Option Features Under ROSCA,"Given this consideration, the FTC may be inclined to divert enforcement resources from Section 5 violations to ROSCA violations.

Looking ahead The FTC has shown its intention to seek expanded authority to regulate negative option features, in a form that would provide it with the ability to obtain equitable monetary relief in the same manner as under ROSCA.

In April 2023, the FTC published a notice of proposed rulemaking that aims to consolidate its various rules on negative option features (that exist in ROSCA and elsewhere) into a single negative option rule.

Former FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson strongly critiqued this proposed rule , claiming that it would sweep in conduct currently regulated under Section 5 and unrelated to negative option features in order to enhance the FTCs ability to seek monetary relief where this ability was limited by the decision in the AMG matter.

According to Wilson, the proposed negative option rule attempts an end-run around the Supreme Courts decision in AMG to confer de novo redress and civil penalty authority on the Commission for Section 5 violations unrelated to deceptive or unfair negative option practices.

While the specific details of the final rule remain to be determined, companies should expect the FTC to continue exercising its enforcement powers to pursue violations of existing negative option feature rules.

Washington expands noncompetition restrictions Washington employers with noncompetition agreements with employees or independent contractors may need to modify those agreements to comply with the latest amendment, SB 5935 , to the states noncompetition laws, effective June 6, 2024 .

Since 2020, Washington has had a broad law that, among other things, imposes numerous restrictions on noncompetes, including: A minimum compensation threshold for entering into a noncompete (for 2024, $120,559.99 for employees and $301,399.98 for independent contractors).

An 18-month noncompete duration limit.

A requirement that employers pay the employee the equivalent to their base salary at the time of termination, for the period of enforcement, if they are seeking to enforce noncompete agreements against employees terminated as a result of a layoff, a term undefined under the law.

There also is a requirement that, during employment, employers may not restrict, restrain or prohibit an employee earning less than twice the applicable state minimum hourly wage from having an additional job, supplementing their income by working for another employer, working as an independent contractor or being self-employed.

The latest amendment strengthens the already robust restrictions, as outlined below.

Liberal construction At the outset, the amendment inserts language stressing that provisions of the law and the amendment facilitating workforce mobility and protecting employees and independent contractors need to be liberally construed and exceptions narrowly construed.

Presumably, then, courts will be expected to interpret the amendment in a manner that serves to provide limited exceptions and covers a broad scope of agreements, as detailed below.

Broadened definition of noncompetes The amendment expands on the laws existing definition of a noncompete, which presently includes every written or oral covenant, agreement, or contract by which an employee or independent contractor is prohibited or restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind.

Effective June 6, 2024, the definition of a noncompetition covenant will also include [any] agreement that directly or indirectly prohibits the acceptance or transaction of business with a customer.

Customer nonsolicitation exception limited to current customers Customer nonsolicitation agreements excepted from the laws requirements may only apply to current customers.

Employee nonsolicitation agreements are still excepted from the laws scope.

Sale of business exception narrowed Previously, the law excluded from the definition of a noncompete those agreements entered into by a person purchasing or selling the goodwill of a business or otherwise acquiring or disposing of an ownership interest.

The amendment narrows this sale of business exception to situations in which the person signing the covenant purchases, sells, acquires, or disposes of an interest representing [1%] or more of the business.

Other critical exceptions to the law  including exceptions for confidentiality agreements and covenants prohibiting the use or disclosure of trade secrets or inventions  remain unchanged.

However, as described above, these exceptions will now be narrowly construed.

Notice and consideration Previously, employers were required to present a noncompete to a prospective employee by no later than the time the employee accepted an offer of employment.

Under the amendment, employers must now ensure employees have notice of the noncompete no later than the time of the initial oral or written acceptance of the offer (emphasis added)."
Cooley,Noncompete Agreements: What’s New and What’s on the Horizon?,"Under the amendment, employers must now ensure employees have notice of the noncompete no later than the time of the initial oral or written acceptance of the offer (emphasis added).

The amendment does not change the laws existing requirement that employers must disclose noncompete agreements to employees who are not currently subject to them but who may be in the future upon meeting the minimum compensation threshold.

Employers are still required to provide current employees additional consideration in exchange for a noncompete, independent from continued employment, such as a pay raise or bonus.

Choice of law The amendment provides that a noncompete is void and unenforceable if it allows or requires the application of choice of law principles or the substantive law of any jurisdiction other than Washington.

Previously, employers were only prohibited from requiring disputes to be adjudicated outside of Washington.

Lawsuits The amendment expands standing to sue under the law, such that any person aggrieved by a prohibited noncompete covenant  regardless of whether the aggrieved person is a party to the noncompete  may recover damages and seek remedies available under the law.

This expansion could be interpreted to include future employers of a former employee.

Further, the amendment clarifies that a cause of action may not be brought for a noncompete signed prior to January 1, 2020 (the effective date of the law), unless the noncompete is being enforced or explicitly leveraged  (emphasis added).

Whats on the horizon in 2024?

FTCs proposed rule The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) leads the pack on the most sweeping proposal to date, by categorically seeking to ban all noncompete agreements.

This proposed rule ( described in this January 2023 alert ) is expected to be finalized in April 2024.

If finalized, the rule would become effective 60 days thereafter, though employers will have 180 days after publication of the final rule to comply.

Should the FTC adopt the proposed rule or even a narrower version of it that still includes a broad noncompete ban, the rule will be subject to significant legal challenges  including that the FTC lacks authority to engage in this type of rulemaking as asserted by former FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson.

Maine Following Minnesotas lead , which banned all noncompetes last year, Maine attempted to become the next state to prohibit noncompetes.

HP 951 proposed to amend the current noncompete law in Maine (which prohibits such agreements for employees earning at or less than 400% of the federal poverty level), to ban their use completely, subject to certain sale of business exceptions.

Although the bill passed both the House and Senate on March 19, 2024, it was recently vetoed by Gov. Janet Mills, who expressed that a complete ban was not appropriate and would ignore the fact that noncompete agreements can be critical tools to prevent employees from taking unfair advantage of their former employers.

New York

As we reported in October 2023 , New York proposed its own noncompete ban via Senate Bill S3100A, which would have prohibited employers from seeking or requiring anyone who is in a position of economic dependence on, and under an obligation to perform duties for, employers, from entering into a noncompete agreement, with limited exceptions.

Unlike other state noncompete laws, New Yorks proposal did not include a salary threshold or address the permissibility of certain sale of business exceptions to the law.

In a nod to some of these deficiencies, as echoed by Mills, Gov. Kathy Hochul vetoed the bill on December 22, 2023, stating that while she long supported limits on noncompete agreements for middle- and low-wage workers, the proposal constituted a one-size-fits-all approach that did not account for allowing New Yorks businesses to retain highly compensated talent in which companies have legitimate interests that are protected through noncompetes."
Cooley,Noncompete Agreements: What’s New and What’s on the Horizon?,"While no new measure has been introduced to date at the state level, the New York City Council has remained active in this space, having introduced three new bills aimed at limiting the use of noncompete agreements: Bill Int.

No. 140  

This bill would categorically ban all noncompetes, with such agreements broadly defined as an agreement between an employer and a worker that prevents, or effectively prevents, the worker from seeking or accepting work for a different employer, or from operating a business, after the worker no longer works for the employer.

The proposal generally extends such prohibitions to cover anyone who does work whether paid or unpaid for an employer, including individuals classified as independent contractors.

The proposal also requires employers to rescind any existing noncompetes and prohibits employers from representing to workers that they are subject to a noncompete where the employer has no good faith basis to believe that the worker is subject to an enforceable non-compete agreement.

Bill Int.

No. 146  This bill proposes a ban on noncompetes with any low-wage employee, defined broadly to cover those identified in Section 190 of the New York Labor Law, and provides an exception for certain bona fide executive, administrative or professional employees whose earnings exceed $1,300 per week.

Employers would be required to disclose to employees who do not meet the low-wage classification that they may be subject to a noncompete at the beginning of the hiring process, which presumably means that, at a minimum, it would have to be provided prior to making an offer of employment.

Bill Int.

No. 375  

This bill would ban noncompetes with freelance workers, subject to certain exceptions, such as lawyers and licensed medical professionals.

Such noncompetes would be prohibited unless the agreement requires the hiring party to pay a reasonable and mutually agreed upon sum to the freelance worker on either a bi-weekly or monthly basis for the duration of the noncompete.

Failing to provide this payment will render the noncompete null and void.

The proposal also provides for a private right of action, in which workers may obtain a declaratory judgment that the noncompete is void and recover attorneys fees and statutory damages of $1,000 per violation.

Next steps Washington employers should review their noncompete agreements now to ensure compliance with the amendment.

This review should include any nonsolicitation covenants to ensure compliance with the newly narrowed exception for nonsolicitation agreements and expanded definition of noncompete agreements.

Employers also should be sure to provide notice of the noncompete or the agreement itself with any offers of employment, including those made verbally.

Since the amendment is retroactive, employers with current or former employees subject to potentially noncompliant nonsolicitation and noncompete provisions should contact counsel to discuss next steps.

In the likely event the FTC rule is finalized, as mentioned, it will most certainly immediately face legal challenges.

However, employers should not wait by the sidelines for these legal challenges to play out.

Employers should take proactive steps now to carefully evaluate their use of noncompete agreements, including the business justifications and goals for imposing such restrictions and the range of employees for whom such covenants are imposed.

In particular, noncompetes should be narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests.

Employers also should consider alternative means of protecting sensitive or confidential business information or intellectual property.

Specifically, employers should identify their trade secrets and make sure that the appropriate steps are taken to preserve their secrecy, given the possibility that employers may not be able to rely on noncompete provisions as the primary measure to protect them."
Cooley,Noncompete Agreements: What’s New and What’s on the Horizon?,"Further, employers should identify their key employees and consider additional or alternative contractual protections (such as forfeiture for competition) to avoid unfair competition from competitors related to this top talent.

While the pendulum may be swinging toward more prohibitions on noncompete agreements, this trend may be running into some pushback, as seen in Maine and New York.

However, at the federal level, there appears to be continued efforts on this front.

For example, even the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has stepped into the fray.

On March 21, 2024, the agency proposed an update to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions , which would generally prohibit a selling institution from entering into or enforcing any existing noncompete agreements with any employee of a divested entity.

As more states and agencies seek to restrict the use of noncompetes, those using restrictive covenants should closely monitor developments in this space.

Employers with questions about the use of restrictive covenants should contact their Cooley employment lawyers."
Cooley,Court Instructs FCC to Amend Definition of ‘Critical Infrastructure’ in Equipment Authorization Order,"The US government has made efforts to combat national security threats found in technology.

Notably, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Congress worked in tandem to create a Covered List of communications equipment and services that pose a threat to US national security.

Companies on the Covered List cannot obtain new equipment authorizations required to sell new or updated products in the US.

Two companies  Hikvision USA and Dahua Technology USA  recently challenged the FCCs order that implemented a ban on their video surveillance equipment in the use of security critical infrastructure.

In a recent decision , the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the FCC order prohibiting authorization of Covered List equipment from being used for physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure.

However, the court instructed the FCC to change its definition of critical infrastructure in the order, because as currently written the definition is overbroad.

The following summary describes a history of the Covered List and a summary of the petitioners challenge to their equipment being placed on the Covered List.

History of the Covered List The Covered List is a list of communications equipment and services that are deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.

In 2020, Congress passed the Secured and Trusted Communications Networks Act (SNA), instructing the FCC to create the Covered List and publish the list on its website.

To adhere to the requirements of the SNA, the FCC issued the Supply Chain Second Order, which established procedures and criteria for compiling the Covered List.

The following year, the FCC published the Covered List and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to ban the authorization of equipment on the Covered List.

Congress subsequently passed the Secure Equipment Act (SEA) requiring the FCC to adopt the equipment authorization rules proposed in the NPRM and enact an equipment authorization ban for items on the Covered List.

The FCC issued the order banning equipment authorizations for covered equipment, which meant that companies on the Covered List no longer could put new products on the market in the US.

The FCC determined that Hikvisions and Dahuas video surveillance technologies would be included on the Covered List to the extent that they were used for the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes.

The appeal In their appeal, Hikvision and Dahua challenged the order, arguing that the FCC exceeded the scope of its statutory authority when it placed their equipment on the Covered List, and that the FCCs definition of critical infrastructure was overbroad and inconsistent with the law.

Statutory authority Hikvision and Dahua argued that the FCC misconstrued the SNA when placing their products on the Covered List, and that even though the Supply Chain Second Order no longer could be challenged, they could challenge the definition in this case because the FCC reopened the definition of covered equipment in the 2022 order.

However, the court noted that Congress was aware that the petitioners products were on the Covered List and set to be banned under limited purposes.

The court found that Congress intended for the FCC to prohibit the marketing and sale of Hikvisions and Dahuas products, holding that the SEA ratified the composition of the Covered List and did not permit Hikvision or Dahua to challenge the placement of its products on the list.

Definition of critical infrastructure The FCCs order banned the use of Hikvisions and Dahuas equipment when used for the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes."
Cooley,Court Instructs FCC to Amend Definition of ‘Critical Infrastructure’ in Equipment Authorization Order,"The FCCs order concluded that any systems or assets that are physically or virtually connected to various government systems could reasonably be considered critical infrastructure.

The FCC relied on the Patriot Acts definition of critical infrastructure and incorporated 16 sectors in Presidential Policy Directive 21 and 55 National Critical Functions from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency National Risk Management Centers risk management guide that could be considered critical infrastructure.

Hikvision and Dahua challenged the FCCs interpretation, arguing that it contravened congressional intent by treating nearly all aspects of the economy as critical infrastructure.

The court agreed.

It held that the FCCs reliance on prior government sources to define critical infrastructure was reasonable, but that the FCC did not explain or justify its use of the expansive words connected to, which made the definition arbitrarily broad.

The court vacated the portions of the FCCs order defining critical infrastructure and instructed the FCC to comport its definition and justification for it with the statutory text of the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act].

Implications of the decision The court decision makes clear that the petitioners video surveillance equipment will remain on the Covered List; however, the extent to which it will be prohibited may narrow when the FCC reconsiders its definition of critical infrastructure.

Moreover, Hikvision and Dahua will still require FCC approval of individual marketing plans mentioned in the decision, which is unlikely to occur until the FCC revises its definition of critical infrastructure.

Until then, the companies cannot obtain authorization for the types of equipment covered by the FCCs 2022 order.

This case adds to the FCCs numerous proceedings to develop new rules and programs to enhance the cybersecurity of consumer equipment in the US.

Cooley,"CFPB Highlights Financial, Privacy Risks of Consumer Transactions on Gaming Platforms","On April 4, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a report examining the growth and privacy risks of financial transactions in online video games and virtual worlds, noting that Americans spent approximately $57 billion on gaming transactions in 2023.

The report looks at these assets growing use and scale across the gaming industry, the associated consumer risks, and the evolution of games and virtual worlds into online marketplaces.

Gaming-specific services can resemble traditional financial products , and the CFPB expressed concern that the infrastructure supporting online transactions in nontraditional marketplaces lacks a similar consumer protection regime required of traditional markets.

The reports findings The CFPBs report analyzed the financial services aspects of the gaming marketplace, including using virtual currencies in games and virtual worlds.

The bureaus three key findings  and the risks facing consumers in gaming marketplaces  are listed below.

1. Gaming products and services resemble conventional financial products but often lack the same protections.

Online ecosystems, including games and virtual worlds, enable players to store and transfer assets (e.g., in-game currencies and virtual items).

The bureau considers these online ecosystems and their financial products increasingly indistinguishable from real-world marketplaces.

As evidenced by newly embedded financial offerings in the gaming industry , companies provide services and products that resemble traditional financial instruments such as loans and proprietary payment systems to facilitate online financial activity.

2. Gaming companies provide little customer support when consumers experience financial harm.

As the value of in-game assets increases, a parallel rise in scams, phishing attempts and account thefts has followed.

The CFPB says it has received numerous consumer complaints about hacking attempts, theft and unauthorized forfeiture of gaming assets.

Consumers contend they have little recourse with gaming companies when they suffer losses, and game publishers assert no duty to compensate players for financial losses, including when service to a game is suspended or when players request unused virtual content or points after their account is closed.

3. Gaming companies are collecting and using large amounts of players personal information, including sensitive personal information, in ways that trigger privacy and consumer protection concerns.

Publishers handle large amounts of data on players, including sensitive personal information such as health data (e.g., heart rate or symptoms that suggest medical conditions), biometric data (e.g., iris scans, gait or movement patterns), geolocation data and behavioral data (e.g., purchasing history and responses to personalized incentives).

Publishers may correlate this personal data with information obtained from social media.

Players personal information may be used for profiling, misleading them about the availability of in-game goods, price discrimination, and highly targeted advertising or offerings.

The CFPB is evaluating publishers compliance with privacy regulations, and whether consumers are appropriately aware of how their personal information is collected and used across the industry.

Looking forward The bureau recognizes that the role of banks and consumer finance products within gaming is evolving, and the current trend indicates that traditional financial services will continue to be introduced on gaming platforms.

Accordingly, the CFPB indicates it is monitoring this nontraditional market where financial products and services may not comply with the criterion set by existing consumer protection laws applicable to traditional banking and payment systems.

Businesses in the virtual world providing financial services that potentially harm consumers finances and privacy may be subject to CFPB jurisdiction."
Cooley,"CFPB Highlights Financial, Privacy Risks of Consumer Transactions on Gaming Platforms","Businesses in the virtual world providing financial services that potentially harm consumers finances and privacy may be subject to CFPB jurisdiction.

Additionally, given that embedded financial services activities within games are becoming analogous to traditional regulated payment services, such activities also may be subject to state and federal regulatory oversight and, in some cases, licensing or registration.

For example, such activities could trigger obligations under state and federal money transmission and virtual currency laws and loss recovery statutes (as, in particular, exemptions from such laws for in-game virtual currencies are narrow and generally do not permit cash-out functionality or cross-game exchanges), as well as coverage under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E. Gaming companies and other industry participants should review relevant regulations to determine which laws apply.

The bureau also asserts that emerging trends in the gaming market will be of interest to policymakers and other government agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, to ensure consumers are adequately protected."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – March One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts rules governing climate disclosure, challenges lead to temporary stay of the rules On March 6, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted at an open meeting to adopt final rules that mandate climate-related disclosure by public companies .

The long-awaited rules will require qualitative disclosure on climate risk, risk management, governance and targets, as well as quantitative emissions reporting under certain circumstances.

Initial disclosures for large accelerated filers under the final rules will be due in 2026, with emissions and financial expenditures disclosures due in 2027.

Longer phase-in periods will be available for other filers.

In a departure from the proposed rules, almost all of the new disclosure requirements will be subject to a materiality determination, in line with other parts of Regulation S-K. Notably, the final rules limit Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reporting to material emissions and generally link climate expenditure, strategy, transition plans and targets disclosures to material risks and impacts.

The final rules do not include Scope 3 emissions reporting requirements and allow for significant phase-in periods for attestations of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.

For many US companies, the SEC rules supplement climate disclosure obligations in California and the European Union starting in 2026 , which may include full Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions obligations.

As a result, many companies planning for disclosure under the SEC rules will need to prepare for parallel California and EU disclosures  some of which may be more comprehensive and due earlier.

More details about the final rules are available in this Cooley key facts and considerations one-pager .

For additional information about the rules, please visit our environmental, social and governance (ESG) resources page , which houses longer-form alerts and webinars discussing the full scope of the rules.

As expected, several lawsuits have been filed in six different federal circuit courts regarding the recently adopted rules.

Due to the number of lawsuits, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation used a lottery system to determine which circuit court would hear the consolidated pending challenges to the rules.

The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit won the lottery and will hear the consolidated challenges.

In response to the challenges, the SEC issued an order on April 4, 2024, determining that it will exercise its discretion to stay the final climate disclosure rules pending the completion of judicial review of the consolidated Eighth Circuit petitions.

SEC and Forbes find 8-K cybersecurity disclosure lacking On January 5, 2024, the SEC issued its first comment letter on Item 1.05 of Form 8-K disclosure .

In the letter, the SEC found that the company disclosed an incident that had and was reasonably likely to continue to have a material impact on the companys business operations, but did not describe the potential effect on the companys financial condition or results of operation.

The SECs comment letter instructed the company to expand its discussion on the scope of operations that were impacted by the incident, in addition to describing the known material impact that the incident had and that is likely to continue.

In considering material impacts, the SEC stated that all material impacts should be considered  including vendor relationships and reputational harm stemming from an event.

Following this, on March 4, 2024, Forbes reported that many cybersecurity incident disclosures made under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K may not be compliant with the SECs rules.

The article argued that the reports reviewed by Forbes are lacking disclosure around the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of material impacts, or reasonably likely material impacts, of the cybersecurity incident."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – March One-Minute Reads,"Further, while the disclosures included qualitative information about the incident, most did not offer much additional information about the actual impact of the incident.

While companies are permitted to file an amended 8-K to report additional information if not all material information is known at the time of the initial filing, companies that choose this option must include a statement in the initial 8-K filing that not all material information is known at the time and an additional filing will be made.

Whether the SEC will begin issuing comment letters to more companies with respect to disclosure deficiencies is yet to be seen.

SEC approves Nasdaq proposal for additional amendments related to reverse stock splits On March 14, 2024, the SEC approved Nasdaqs proposal to further amend its listing standards with respect to notification and disclosure of reverse stock splits.

The amendments clarify Nasdaqs recent reverse stock split amendments ( as covered in our November One-Minute Reads ) by more clearly outlining: Nasdaqs process of using its material news halt to stop trading when an issuer effects a reverse stock split without meeting the reverse stock split listing standards in Nasdaq Rules 5250(b)(4) and (e)(7).

SEC charges Skechers with failure to disclose related party transactions On March 7, 2024, the SEC agreed to settle charges with Skechers for failing to disclose payments for the benefit of its executives and their immediate family members.

Skechers agreed to pay a $1.25 million civil penalty to settle the SECs charges that it violated reporting and proxy solicitation provisions of the Exchange Act.

These charges stem from Skechers failure to disclose: The employment of two relatives of its executive officers.

A consulting relationship with a person sharing a household with an executive officer.

Arrangements whereby two of its executive officers each owed more than $120,000 to the company for personal expenses.

According to the SEC order, the disclosure failure persisted from 2019 through 2022.

SEC chair warns of AI-related challenges Speaking at Yale Law School on February 13, 2024, SEC Chair Gary Gensler noted that although artificial intelligence brings opportunities, it also raises a host of issues that arent new but are accentuated by it.

Some of these issues, in Genslers view, include that AI models decisions and outcomes are often unexplainable, AI also may make biased decisions because the outcomes of its algorithms may be based on data reflecting historical biases  

[and] the ability of these predictive models to predict doesnt mean they are always accurate.

In these remarks, Gensler also outlined three different types of harm that he believes may be caused by AI  including programmable harm, predictable harm and unpredictable harm.

Gensler emphasized that he believes predictable harm may be the most relevant for companies incorporating AI models into their business, as predictable harm involves a reckless or knowing disregard of the foreseeable risk of your actions.

Given this view, companies evaluating potential risks should be asking: Did the actor act reasonably to prevent its AI model from illegal actions, such as front-running, spoofing or giving conflicted investment advice?

Were there appropriate guardrails in place?

Were the guardrails tested and monitored?

Did the guardrails consider the possibility that the AI model may be learning and changing on its own, or may hallucinate or strategically deceive users?

The SEC and Congress are continuing to evaluate the use of AI and how to protect against these predictable and unpredictable harms.

Cooley,FCC Requires ‘All-In’ Pricing for Video Service Bills and Marketing,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted new rules requiring all-in pricing for cable and satellite television services .

Under the rules, all consumer bills and all promotional materials for video services that mention pricing must prominently display a single price that includes any charges related to the cost of video services.

The rules do not limit the actual total charges for cable and satellite video services, but they do limit the ability of cable and satellite video providers to separately list charges for services that are sold in a single package.

The rules were adopted in response to concerns that video provider bills and marketing materials have increasingly separated the costs they incur for retransmitting broadcast TV stations and for regional sports networks from the costs for other programming, such as traditional cable channels.

The new rules do not apply to streaming services or non-video products offered by cable and satellite operators, such as broadband internet or home security services.

They also do not affect the FCCs broadband label rules for internet access services .

Under the rules, any time a cable or satellite video operator provides a price for its video services, that price must include any charges related to the programming that the customer or prospective customer will receive.

Only service-related charges are covered by the rule, so video providers can show prices for equipment separately, and they still can bill separately for government taxes and fees, such as franchise fees.

If promotional materials do not otherwise mention the price, they are not required to include all-in pricing.

The rules do not prohibit video providers from including an itemization of the elements of the price in either bills or marketing materials.

However, the all-in price must be displayed prominently, in way that is easy to understand and accurate, and any itemization must be complementary to the disclosure of the all-in pricing.

The all-in price for video service must be provided even when the customer is purchasing or being offered a multiproduct bundle, such as cable service plus broadband internet access.

The order also requires video providers to disclose additional information about promotional discounts.

This information includes when a discount will end and what price will be charged at the end of the promotional period.

Marketing materials being used regionally or nationally may disclose a range of all-in prices based on differing costs across the territory covered by the materials.

Whats next While the all-in pricing rule will not change the actual prices that cable and satellite TV providers can charge, most providers will have to adjust how they describe their pricing to account for the new requirements.

This decision is part of a broader initiative by the FCC to increase transparency in consumer disclosures, along with the broadband nutrition label requirements that go into effect in mid-April 2024, and the FCC may take further action to require service providers to offer more information to consumers about services and prices.

The rules will go into effect for most cable operators and satellite TV providers on December 19, 2024, or when they are approved by the federal Office of Management and Budget, whichever is later.

For more information on the all-in pricing rules and how they affect participants in the video service marketplace, reach out to one of the Cooley lawyers listed below."
Cooley,"Marketing Practices of Remittance Transfer Providers May Violate CFPA, CFPB Cautions","On March 27, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued Circular2024-02 warning remittance transfer providers that certain marketing activities may constitute deceptive practices and therefore violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA).

The CFPBs specific concerns pertain to representations about pricing and costs of remittance transfers  as well as the speed of transfers  that are inconsistent with the actual practices of such providers.

What types of remittance transfer representations create a risk of claims of deception?

The CFPBs concern that certain remittance transfer marketing practices may be deceptive stems from the fact that consumers are now increasingly comparison shopping online for remittance transfer services.

In particular, the CFPB is concerned that online marketing can inaccurately tout advantages  such as superior speed in delivering funds to recipients or lower costs for a service  that fail to meet actual practices.

The circular provides several specific remittance provider marketing practices the CFPB could consider deceptive.

For example, the CFPB notes that remittance transfers are often made for the purpose of sending money to family members abroad, and speed is particularly important for consumers.

Thus, representations that a remittance transfer will be delivered within a certain time frame, when in fact transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients (even if only in some instances), would be deceptive.

The circular also indicates that the CFPB has identified remittance transfer providers that represent that transfers are free, when in fact the provider charges fees or makes money through the exchange rate spread for the transfer  which would likely constitute a deceptive act.

Importantly, the circular also separately addresses companies that offer remittance transfers through digital wallets and other prepaid products.

The CFPB identifies potentially deceptive marketing practices of these companies, including that certain providers will tell customers that they offer free account-to-account transfers, or that receiving money from a friend is free, but then will charge a fee for currency conversion or for the recipient to withdraw funds.

Looking ahead The CFPB has in recent months focused its attention on online consumer financial services marketing activities, issuing both guidance and rulemaking governing the space.

In early March 2024, the CFPB warned online intermediaries (also via circular ) that steering customers to certain products based on counterparty payments, rather than based on what is in the interest of the consumer, could also potentially constitute an abusive practice.

Providers of remittance transfers should consider reviewing existing marketing materials  including marketing materials provided by authorized delegates at physical locations, as applicable  to ensure they accurately set forth fees and costs (including with respect to exchange rate spreads), as well as the speed of their services.

Providers also should keep in mind that an act or practice can be deceptive even if there is no harm associated with the representation.

Further, the circular highlights the CFPBs continued push to regulate digital wallet and payment app providers , following its November 7, 2023, notice of proposed rulemaking that would allow it to supervise such providers of domestic payments services as larger participants.

Companies that offer remittance transfers through digital wallets and peer-to-peer payments apps should accordingly pay special attention to developments in this space in light of the CFPBs interest in these services."
Cooley,NSD’s Revised Enforcement Policy for Business Organizations Incentivizes Voluntary Self-Disclosures in M&A Context,"Companies engaged in mergers & acquisitions activities should take note of the revised voluntary self-disclosure policy ( VSD Policy ) of the National Security Division (NSD) of the US Department of Justice, released on March 7, 2024, which affords prosecutorial leniency to acquirors who promptly disclose to NSD the criminal misconduct of acquired entities.

The VSD Policy expands upon a substantially similar prior version by adding a specific M&A Policy comprising various incentives to voluntarily disclose violations of national security laws and regulations  including export control and sanctions (trade controls)  discovered during the course of due diligence conducted in connection with corporate transactions.

Notably, trade controls carry successor liability, meaning that an acquiror will assume liability for violations (both criminal and civil) in which the acquired entity engaged prior to the transaction.

Against the backdrop of rising national security threats, NSD has increasingly prioritized trade controls enforcement.

These efforts have been complemented by civil enforcement actions carried out by US government agencies that administer the underlying regulations, including the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control and the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security.

To qualify for the M&A Policy protections, an acquiror must meet all of the following criteria: Complete a lawful, bona fide acquisition of another company ( as described in the M&A Policy ).

Voluntarily and timely ( generally no later than 180 days following the transactions completion or, as appropriate, at the earliest reasonable opportunity ) self-disclose to NSD criminal misconduct committed by the acquired entity.

Fully cooperate with NSDs investigation.

Promptly ( generally within one year after the transactions completion ) and sufficiently remediate the subject misconduct.

The M&A Policy provides that when an acquiror makes a qualifying voluntary self-disclosure, NSD generally will not seek a guilty plea from the acquiror.

Further, the acquiror will benefit from the presumption that it will qualify for a declination of prosecution (rather than merely a nonprosecution agreement).

In addition, the acquiror is assured that it will not be required to pay a criminal fine or forfeit assets, and that the disclosed misconduct will not negatively affect the acquirors record of recidivism in future matters involving the acquiror.

Importantly, the presence of aggravating factors at the acquired entity generally will not prevent the acquiror from eligibility for the M&A Policys protections, provided those factors do not continue to affect either of the transaction parties following a qualifying disclosure.

Although the foregoing protections are available only to the acquiror, the M&A Policy provides that if the acquired entity remains legally distinct following the transaction, then NSD will credit the acquirors qualifying self-disclosure to the acquired entity and may consider whether other mitigation credit also is merited.

If the acquirors self-disclosure does not qualify for the M&A Policys protections, then NSD nonetheless may consider whether that self-disclosure is eligible to receive mitigation credit pursuant to other provisions of the VSD Policy, which generally encourages prompt disclosure to and full cooperation with NSD.

NSDs attention to trade controls enforcement underscores the need for careful pretransactional due diligence aimed at uncovering historical and/or ongoing instances of criminal misconduct.

Importantly, acquirors seeking to avail themselves of the M&A Policys protections must meet the specific conditions set forth therein, or otherwise risk forfeiting prosecutorial leniency and potentially significant mitigation credit.

Cooley,FCC Adopts New Minimum Standards for Broadband Services,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in a Report to Congress , has adopted new standards for determining when internet services are fast enough to qualify as broadband services.

The report sets the speed threshold at 100 megabits per second (Mbps) for downstream traffic and 20 Mbps for upstream traffic for fixed services; 35 Mbps downstream and three Mbps upstream for mobile service; and one gigabit per second (Gbps) downstream per 1,000 students and staff for services provided to schools.

The report also sets a long-term goal of one Gbps downstream and 500 Mbps upstream for fixed broadband, but did not set a time when these new speeds would become the standard.

These new minimum speeds will be used going forward by the FCC and could influence other agencies.

The speed standards for fixed service and schools represent significant increases from the previous minimum service levels, which were 35 Mbps downstream and three Mbps upstream for fixed service, and 500 Mbps per 1,000 students and staff for schools.

The report also marks the first time that a mobile standard has been adopted.

However, some existing and planned federal programs already incorporate these speeds.

For example, the FCCs Rural Digital Opportunity Fund includes a service tier using the 100 Mbps/20 Mbps standard for fixed services.

The new mobile standard is the same that the FCC plans to use for its 5G Fund universal service program, and most schools already meet the one Gb standard.

The FCC standards are based entirely on speed, and the agency chose not to adopt minimum requirements for latency or reliability.

The new standards will be used by the FCC to determine whether broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, which it is required to do periodically by Congress.

Using these standards, the FCC determined in the report that there are deficiencies in deployment of broadband services today, particularly in rural areas and on tribal land.

If service is not being deployed appropriately, the FCC is supposed to act to address the deficiency, such as by providing universal service funding.

The new standards also are likely to influence other federal and state agencies as they design broadband-related programs, and the long-term goal of one Gbps/500 Mbps for fixed service may have an incremental impact on the standards other agencies set in their programs as well.  

While most US customers have access to service at the speeds set by the FCC (and often at much higher speeds), adopting these standards may accelerate rollout of services to underserved areas.

Cooley,District of Columbia Joins Pay Transparency Bandwagon,"On June 30, 2024, the District of Columbia Wage Transparency Omnibus Amendment Act of 2023 takes effect, paving the way for new pay transparency obligations for DC employers.

The amendment, which MayorMuriel Bowser signed on January 12, 2024, will require employers with at least one employee in Washington, DC, to disclose pay ranges in job postings and the existence of healthcare benefits before the first interview.

The amendment also will prohibit inquiries regarding employees wage histories.

We describe the main requirements and implications of the law below.

Pay range, healthcare benefits disclosures Like other pay transparency laws , DC employers will be required to provide the minimum and maximum projected salary or hourly pay in all job listings and position descriptions advertised.

The pay range provided must be based on a good faith belief of what the employer would offer for the role at the time of the posting.

The law applies to external and internal positions, which include promotions and transfer opportunities.

In a departure from other pay transparency laws, the amendment requires employers to disclose to prospective employees before the first interview the existence of healthcare benefits that employees may receive in connection with the role.

Although the amendments legislative history suggests that earlier versions would have required a broad disclosure of a schedule of benefits  including bonuses, healthcare and other wellness benefits, stocks, bonds, options, equity, and nonmonetary remuneration  the DC Legislature ultimately opted to narrow this obligation and require only a simple disclosure regarding the existence of healthcare benefits.

Wage history protections The amendment expands DCs protections against wage history inquiries by employers during the hiring process.

Specifically, employers will be prohibited from screening prospective employees based on their wage history, including by requiring that a prospective employees wage history satisfy minimum or maximum criteria or by requesting or requiring as a condition of being interviewed or as a condition of continuing to be considered for an offer  that a prospective employee disclose  [their] wage history.

In addition, employers will be prohibited from asking prior or current employers for a candidates wage history.

Notably, wage history is defined as information  related to compensation an employee has received from other or previous employment (emphasis added).

As such, though guidance has not yet been released, its possible the amendments prohibition on employer inquiries may extend beyond wages and salaries to other forms of compensation, including equity, bonuses and commissions.

Expansion of existing protections The amendment also expands existing laws relating to the discussion of wages by employees in the workplace.

Existing protections under DC law restricted employers from banning employees from discussing their wages or the wages of other employees  and protected such employees from discipline and other forms of retaliation.

The amendment replaces the term wages with compensation, which is broadly defined as all forms of monetary and nonmonetary benefits an employer provides or promises to provide an employee in exchange for the employees services to the employer.

As a result, these protections now extend to employee discussions of both monetary and nonmonetary benefits.

Notice requirement The amendment requires that covered employers notify DC employees of their rights under DCs Wage Transparency Act by posting a notice in a conspicuous place in at least one location where employees congregate.

The amendment is not clear as to the required contents of the notice, but we anticipate that the DC Department of Employment Services will provide a sample notice for employers to use after the law goes into effect."
Cooley,District of Columbia Joins Pay Transparency Bandwagon,"Enforcement and penalties Aggrieved employees will have no direct right to sue their employers for violations of the amendment, but the DC attorney general has authority to investigate violations and enforce the amendment.

The attorney general also can initiate a civil action against employers for violations, as well as seek injunctive, compensatory or other authorized relief for any individual or for the public at large.

In such actions, the attorney general can recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs, as well as statutory penalties equal to the administrative penalties provided by law.

Employers also may be subject to civil fines of $1,000 for the first violation, $5,000 for the second violation and $20,000 for each subsequent violation of the law.

Open questions The amendment leaves several open questions, including: Whether it applies to remote positions, including positions that could be filled in DC, or by an employee working completely remotely outside of DC for a DC employer.

Whether the salary range requirement applies to job listings and position descriptions posted by recruiting agencies or other third parties.

What obligations, if any, the employer has if a candidate voluntarily discloses their wage history during the hiring process.

Next steps While we expect additional guidance from DC on some of these open issues, employers can begin to prepare for the amendment by: Reviewing all job postings to ensure accurate pay ranges are included in all applicable external and internal postings.

Ensuring appropriate disclosure of healthcare benefits before the first interview.

(In addition, although not explicitly required under the amendment, employers may wish to consider including such disclosures in their job postings.)

Training HR and recruiting teams on the amendments requirements  including information regarding the requirements in other jurisdictions that have implemented or soon will implement similar laws ( such as Hawaii and Illinois ), if an employer operates in multiple jurisdictions.

Reviewing interviewing and hiring processes to ensure that employers are not requesting information relating to wage history from prospective candidates or prior employers.

Preparing and posting a notice compliant with the law.

The growing patchwork of pay transparency laws is a trend that will continue in 2024, as several states currently have already proposed legislation under consideration.

Even the federal government has jumped into the fray, proposing a rule in January 2024 that would prohibit federal contractors and subcontractors from seeking and considering information about job applicants compensation history when making employment decisions for certain positions, and requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to disclose compensation in job announcements for certain positions.

In light of this increased emphasis on pay transparency across the US and at the federal level, employers may consider conducting a pay equity audit, with the assistance of legal counsel, to ensure compliance with these new laws.

If you have any questions about pay disclosure requirements or pay equity issues, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,"Tri-Seal Compliance Note Highlights Broad Reach of US Trade Controls, Obligations of Non-US Persons","On 6 March 2024, the US Department of Commerce, Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice issued a Tri-Seal Compliance Note (compliance note) advising foreign-based companies and individuals to assess their obligations with respect to US export control and sanctions laws and regulations (trade controls) and implement appropriate measures designed to achieve compliance.

This compliance note follows a prior publication issued by the same three agencies in July 2023 that explained the benefits and urged self-disclosure of trade controls violations to US regulators.

Scope and application of US trade controls Grounded in national security laws, trade controls aim to restrict certain countries, territories, entities and individuals from directly or indirectly receiving or otherwise benefiting from certain US products, technologies and services.

Specifically: The Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered and enforced by the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), regulate exports, reexports, and transfers of commercial and dual-use tangible items, software and technology (each an item) subject to the jurisdiction of the EAR.

Such items are: Any item developed or produced in the US.

Items present in the US, regardless of their origin.

Certain items developed or produced outside the US that comprise relevant de minimis amounts of US-origin controlled content.

Items developed or produced outside the US that are the direct product of certain US-origin software or technology, or are produced using equipment that is the direct product of the same.

Trade and economic sanctions, administered and enforced by the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), prohibit or restrict US persons activities as they relate to certain countries, territories, entities, individuals and industry sectors.

For OFAC purposes, US persons are: US citizens and lawful permanent residents, wherever located.

Entities organized under the laws of the US and their foreign branches.

Any persons located in the US, regardless of nationality.

Certain OFAC programs also apply to foreign entities that are owned or controlled by US persons.

Notably, trade controls can have extraterritorial reach.

For example, non-US persons who reexport US-origin items or produce items subject to the EAR are obligated to comply with the EARs licensing requirements and end-user and end-use controls.

Similarly, the activities of foreign companies that employ US persons, leverage US-based resources such as servers, systems, and banking, or are owned or controlled by US entities are obligated to comply with applicable OFAC restrictions.

Heightened enforcement, including against non-US persons Against the backdrop of rising national security and foreign policy threats to the US, both BIS and OFAC have aggressively enforced their respective regimes, including with respect to violations by non-US persons.

Recent BIS actions have involved foreign person reexports of US-origin items and sales to restricted parties of foreign-produced items subject to the EAR.

OFAC has focused certain enforcement efforts on non-US persons deemed to have caused or induced US persons to violate sanctions through any of the following: The obfuscation or omission of references to sanctioned countries in transaction documents.

Routing of prohibited transactions through the US financial system.

Intentional misleading of US persons in connection with business transactions involving sanctioned countries or persons.

Civil violations of trade controls regulations are subject to a strict scrutiny standard, meaning that a person can face hefty penalties even if the person did not know or have reason to know that they were engaging in a prohibited transaction."
Cooley,"Tri-Seal Compliance Note Highlights Broad Reach of US Trade Controls, Obligations of Non-US Persons","Willful violations are punishable as criminal violations, which the US Department of Justice is authorized to pursue  including against non-US persons whose actions have a US nexus.

As noted, causing US persons to act can create a jurisdictional basis for enforcement actions involving non-US persons.

Further, liability for past violations is inherited by successor parties (e.g., purchasers of companies).

Conclusion The compliance note underscores that US trade controls can be broadly impactful, subjecting even non-US persons to US jurisdiction in sometimes nonobvious  but potentially significant  ways.

In an era of heightened enforcement, global businesses are advised to closely assess the extent to which their operations and activities may be subject to US trade controls and develop appropriate internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance and mitigate (possibly substantial) penalties.

Cooley,California Releases Workplace Violence Prevention Guidance,"Californias Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) recently published guidance to assist employers in complying with Senate Bill 553 ahead of the laws employer compliance date of July 1, 2024 .

As we reported in November 2023 , SB 553 requires virtually all employers to develop, implement, and maintain an effective written workplace violence prevention plan (WVPP), as well as train employees, and create and maintain extensive records regarding workplace violence.

The guidance includes a model WVPP for general industry (non-healthcare settings) , as well as fact sheets for employers and employees.

Employers must customize the model WVPP for their specific workforce.

Under the law, only certain healthcare facilities, employees teleworking from locations of their choice and not under the control of their employers, and places of employment with fewer than 10 employees and not accessible to the public are exempt from the laws requirements.

Although Cal/OSHA is not required to adopt workplace violence standards until December 31, 2026, it may begin enforcing the law on July 1, 2024.

Thus, it is critical that employers take steps now to draft, implement and train employees on their WVPPs.

Model WVPP

The WVPP must include a long list of required components , such as the identification of persons responsible for implementing the plan, as well as procedures to respond to reports of workplace violence, identify and correct workplace violence hazards, and conduct post-incident responses and investigations.

Employers are not required to use the states model WVPP and may also incorporate workplace violence prevention into any existing injury and illness prevention program (IIPP).

The states model IIPP does not yet appear to include sample workplace violence language.

Notably, the agency states that using the states model WVPP does not ensure compliance with the law.

While Cal/OSHA notes that its model WVPP was written for a broad spectrum of employers, and it may not match [an employers] exact needs, it provides helpful guidance by providing examples of how employers can meet the laws required components.

For example, in developing the required procedures to obtain the active involvement of employees and authorized employee representatives in developing and implementing the plan, the model suggests that management have monthly safety meetings with employees to discuss workplace violence related concerns and hazards, which could involve brainstorming sessions, discussions of recent incidents, and reviews of safety procedures.

The agency also suggests employers encourage employees to participate in designing and implementing training to accomplish this objective, by, for example, incorporating employee suggestions on new training scenarios into training materials.

On another required component of the plan, procedures to communicate with employees regarding workplace violence matters, the model suggests employers do more than just posting or distributing workplace violence prevention information and hosting regularly scheduled meetings addressing security issues.

The model refers to other methods of effective communication, which may include updating employees on the status of investigations and corrective actions through email and at safety meetings, providing updates during meetings with other employers in the building, discussing recent incidents, and sharing training materials and incident reports with other employers to ensure a coordinated response to incidents.

The model plan also includes examples of how employers can evaluate workplace hazards, which is another required component of the WVPP."
Cooley,California Releases Workplace Violence Prevention Guidance,"The model plan also includes examples of how employers can evaluate workplace hazards, which is another required component of the WVPP.

For example, the plan suggests analyzing factors such as the exterior and interior of the workplace for attractiveness to robbers and assessing whether employees have effective escape routes from the workplace, the adequacy of workplace security systems, and employees skill in safely handling threatening or hostile service recipients.

Training requirements In addition, the model WVPP expands on employers training requirements, which must be conducted when the plan is first established and annually thereafter, as well as when a new or previously unrecognized workplace violence hazard has been identified and when changes are made to the plan.

The model suggests employers include additional topics as part of this training, such as strategies to avoid/prevent workplace violence and physical harm, ways to defuse hostile or threatening situations, employee routes of escape, and how to seek post-event trauma counseling for employees desiring such assistance.

Notably, the model WVPP states that [e]mployers must use training material appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy, and language of employees.

Incident log requirements The model WVPP also includes a sample of the required workplace violence incident log.

The WVPP sample log includes the location of the incident, in addition to both a workplace violence type and type of incident.

These are two separate and distinct categories of information.

Specifically, the model states that the type of incident refers to the nature or characteristics of the incident being logged.

For example, a type of incident could include whether the incident involved physical attack with or without a weapon or object, sexual assault or threat, or animal attack, while workplace violence type refers to these four categories: Type 1: Workplace violence committed by a person who has no legitimate business at the worksite, including violent acts by anyone who enters the workplace or approaches workers with the intent to commit a crime.

Type 2: Workplace violence directed at employees by customers, clients, patients, students, inmates or visitors.

Type 3: Workplace violence against an employee by a present or former employee, supervisor, or manager.

Type 4: Workplace violence committed in the workplace by a person who does not work there, but who has or is known to have had a personal relationship with an employee.

Importantly, in filling out the incident log, employers should only include the classification of who committed the violence (e.g., whether the perpetrator was a client or customer, family or friend of a client or customer, stranger, etc.) for confidentiality reasons and exclude information that would identify any person involved in a violent incident.

Employer and employee fact sheets Cal/OSHAs employer fact sheet and an employee fact sheet serve as helpful primers in outlining employers responsibilities under the law by defining types of workplace violence, providing recommendations on preventing workplace violence, and explaining employees rights under the WVPP.

Next steps Employers should take steps now to establish their WVPP and train employees by July 1.

Multistate employers also should keep apprised of new developments imposing obligations in this area.

For example, Texas SB 240 requires certain healthcare facilities to establish workplace violence prevention committees, a workplace violence prevention plan and response protocols, and to implement training by September 1, 2024.

In addition, since September 1, 2023, all Texas employers have been required to post a notice in the workplace instructing employees to report instances of workplace violence or suspicious activity to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Other states may follow the lead taken by California and Texas."

Cooley,FCC Issues Framework for Consumer Internet of Things Cybersecurity Program,"Consistent with an announcement from the Biden-Harris administration in July 2023 , the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released an order establishing the framework for the new US Cyber Trust Mark program .

Under the voluntary program, qualifying consumer Internet of Things (IoT) products can display the new US Cyber Trust Mark logo, indicating that the product meets minimum cybersecurity standards.

The logo will be displayed with a QR code that will direct consumers to a database with detailed information about the particular IoT product.

The program is intended to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions, differentiate trustworthy products in the marketplace and create incentives for manufacturers to meet higher cybersecurity standards.

Along with the order, the FCC released a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether the FCC should prohibit participation in the US Cyber Trust Mark program when the customer data collected by a product, or the software/software updates for a product, could be sent to or come from a foreign adversary country as defined by the US Department of Commerce.

While the order establishes a general outline, the details of the FCCs IoT labeling program will be established in further decisions over the coming months.

Based on the timelines established in the order, the new program could be up and running by year-end 2024.

(For background information about the US Cyber Trust Mark program, see our August 2023 and September 2023 client alerts.)

Consumer IoT products only Initially, only consumer-focused wireless  not wired  IoT products will be eligible to receive the US Cyber Trust Mark designation.

Medical devices, motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, enterprise and industrial products, and communications equipment from certain foreign vendors are specifically excluded from the program.

To qualify for the program, a product must be internet-connected and capable of intentionally emitting radio frequency (RF) energy, and it must have at least one network interface, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

The FCC found that consumers expectations of security extend to the entire product they purchase.

Accordingly, the IoT labeling program will apply to IoT products rather than merely to IoT devices, so that the full functionality of all product components necessary to use the IoT device are considered.

Examples of the extra components beyond the IoT device itself include networking/gateway hardware, mobile apps for communicating with the device, and cloud services, data processing and storage.

The FCC also said manufacturers will be accountable for any third-party applications used with the device:

[W]here a manufacturer allows third-party apps, for example, to connect to and control their IoT product, such manufacturer is responsible for the security of that connection link and the app[,] if such app resides on the IoT product.

Products that are certified will be permitted to display the US Cyber Trust Mark logo, along with a QR code.

The QR code will take consumers to a registry with specific information about the product, including information about how to securely configure the device.

The details of which data elements will be included in the registry, and how and where the US Cyber Trust Mark logo and QR code will be displayed, will be determined in a further proceeding.

Two-step certification process The FCC has established a two-step process for product certifications.

Parties first will submit their products for testing by an accredited lab.

Labs will not certify products or issue authorizations  they will conduct the required tests and generate test reports.

Each test report will be reviewed by a cybersecurity label administrator (CLA) and, if a report demonstrates that a product complies with the IoT labeling programs requirements, a product will be certified and allowed to display the US Cyber Trust Mark logo."
Cooley,FCC Issues Framework for Consumer Internet of Things Cybersecurity Program,"Labs eligible for certification include independent labs, labs operated in-house by manufacturers, and labs run by CLAs.

To be certified, a testing lab must be accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 standards to conduct compliance testing, and it will have to meet specific standards that will be developed by the FCC in further proceedings.

Companies participating in the program will pay fees to the labs and to CLAs.

The fees to the CLAs will fund the costs of administering the program.

The FCC also will require manufacturers to renew the certifications, but it did not state how frequently renewals will need to be obtained.

Next steps The FCC will take applications for and appoint a lead CLA to oversee the entire program.

The lead CLA, in coordination with stakeholders, will develop and recommend specific testing standards, the design and placement for the US Cyber Trust Mark label, and the consumer education plan.

The FCC will review the recommendations and accept public comment before adopting the final requirements.

After the details of the program recommended by the lead CLA and approved by the FCC are released, the FCC and/or the lead CLA will open the application process for certifying labs and CLAs.

Parties wanting to have an impact on how the program will be implemented should consider monitoring or participating in the further proceedings that will establish the programs specific requirements.

Cooley,UK Introduces Export Controls for Emerging Technologies,"On 12 March 2024, the UK Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) announced that UK export control regulations would be amended to introduce new controls on the export of emerging technologies and provide a number of technical updates.

Implemented through the Export Control (Amendment) Regulations 2024, the amendments are set to come into force on 1 April 2024.

The Export Control Order 2008

The regulations introduce new export controls on military goods and dual-use emerging technologies.

They include a prohibition on the export to any country of: Certain types of semiconductors, equipment designed for dry etching, scanning electron microscope equipment, integrated circuits, parametric signal amplifiers, cryogenic cooling systems and components, extreme ultraviolet masks, cryogenic wafer probing equipment and certain advanced materials.

The export or transfer by electronic means of software and technology designed for the use, development or production of these items also is subject to export controls.

Quantum computers and components, as well as software and technology for the development or production of quantum computing.

Additive manufacturing equipment, as well as software and technology designed for the development or production of such equipment.

The export of these items from the UK to any country will now require an export licence.

The dual-use regulation The new regulations also amend Annex I of Council Regulation (EC) 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 (the retained European Union dual-use regulation), which lists dual-use goods, software and technology that are subject to export controls in the UK for which an export licence is required.

These changes include editorial amendments to the technical notes and definitions in certain entries, amendments to the control parameters for some items, and modifications to the decontrol note for commercial cryptography applications.

As the UK is a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement 1 and other multilateral export control regimes, the amendments also seek to bring UK export controls in line with like-minded countries.

Comments These amendments demonstrate the UKs alignment with other countries  such as the US  insofar as the export restrictions that are being applied to emerging technologies can have dual-use applications.

Businesses developing these technologies and operating in this space should ensure they follow robust compliance processes.

If you have any questions, please contact the Cooley authors listed below, who can advise you on the applicable export controls and how they affect you and your business.

Notes The Wassenaar Arrangement is a voluntary export control regime comprised of 42 member states, which seeks to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies."
Cooley,"Protested CFPB Supervisory Order Reveals Process, Priorities","Editor's note: Authored by Joshua Kotin and Michelle Rogers, this article was originally published in Law360 .

On Feb. 23, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau made public an order that established supervisory authority over installment lender World Acceptance Corp. after an eight-month proceeding over the contested designation.[1]

The order serves as a clear warning to nonbanks outside the CFPB's automatic supervisory jurisdiction, such as various fintechs, providers of alternative financial products and even digital comparison websites,[2] that it is monitoring the broader financial services market.

The order also provides insight into the procedural nuances of the CFPB's risk determination process and the standards it might use to assess whether an institution poses risk to consumers, and therefore warrants ongoing supervision.

Importantly, the order is also helpful reading for institutions already subject to supervision, as it sheds some light on the bureau's view of certain products and practices, including the risks tied to complaint management practices that could be viewed as weak by the regulator.

The CFPB's authorizing statute provides expansive supervisory authority over nonbank financial institutions.

Congress sought to create some parity between federal bank and nonbank supervision when it created the CFPB, but there were clear practical limitations to supervising the thousands of nonbank financial institutions operating throughout the country.

Congress therefore gave the CFPB authority to conduct regulatory examinations over only certain nonbanks.

First and foremost, Congress gave the CFPB automatic authority to examine mortgage lenders and servicers, private student lenders, and short-term small-dollar lenders.

Congress also permitted the CFPB to identify via rulemaking large participants operating in certain financial markets deserving of supervision.

As a result, the CFPB can today examine large participants in consumer reporting, debt collection, student loan servicing, international remittance, auto finance and, in the near future, digital consumer payment application providers.[3]

On April 25, 2022, the CFPB announced it would invoke its long-standing, but never before utilized, authority to supervise a new set of nonbanks: those it has reasonable cause to believe poses risks to consumers in the provision of consumer financial products or services.[4] Importantly, when the CFPB updated the procedural rule in connection with its announcement, it noted it would authorize the release of certain information about any final determinations it made.

The CFPB touted its release of details of these determinations as providing guidance to the marketplace, but industry members remained concerned that such disclosure would also have a potentially chilling effect on a nonbank's will to fight the initial determination.

A little more than one year after its initial announcement, the CFPB quietly noted in its summer 2023 ""Supervisory Highlights"" publication that it had issued several notices of reasonable cause to commence risk-based supervision, and that several entities voluntarily consented to the CFPB's supervisory authority.[5] Consumer complaints and product offerings drove the CFPB's supervisory determination.

The CFPB's determination that World Acceptance poses risks to consumers was purportedly based on a mixture of consumer complaints and the nature of the lender's products, services and operations."
Cooley,"Protested CFPB Supervisory Order Reveals Process, Priorities","The CFPB's determination that World Acceptance poses risks to consumers was purportedly based on a mixture of consumer complaints and the nature of the lender's products, services and operations.

Specifically, the CFPB said it has reasonable cause for concern based on: The manner in which the lender describes optional insurance products to consumers and incorporates them into loans; Debt collection practices, including claims of harassment and coercion that jeopardize consumer employment or cause stress; Accuracy in furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies, as reflected by the 210 consumer disputes and complaints on the subject over a three-year period; and The percentage of existing small-dollar loans that are refinanced with new small-dollar loans through so-called serial refinancing.

The CFPB's determination appears to rely heavily upon the content of consumer complaints.

This was despite pushback from the target company during the determination proceeding, where it argued that those unverified complaints may be inaccurate, contradicted by other evidence or not credible.

Interestingly, the CFPB sought to rebut this point by suggesting supervision is necessary because it allows the CFPB to learn more about the company's practices and resolve any factual uncertainty between reality and the conduct alleged in the complaints.

Thematic of recent CFPB focus on complaints, the agency also used the order to criticize the company's complaint response process, saying the institution's responses inappropriately disregard the substance of the complaint, offer a conclusory denial of wrongdoing or describe the relevant facts differently than those presented by the consumer without substantiating evidence.

The designation process took approximately eight months and required at least three submissions.

The order makes clear that a contested designation process will require significant institutional resources  though, of course, so does an exam.

The CFPB issued its official notice of intent to supervise World Acceptance on March 10, 2023.

The lender submitted a written response to the notice on April 12, 2023, then made an oral presentation to the CFPB on May 17, 2023.

The CFPB reviewed the file and the lender's briefings, collected additional information  including what appeared to be an in-depth review of consumer complaints  and permitted the lender to file a supplemental briefing on Oct. 16, 2023.

CFPB Director Rohit Chopra determined the CFPB would subject the lender to supervision on Nov. 30, 2023, although the order, which was lightly redacted, was made public three months after it was issued.

Looking Ahead This order serves as a reminder to nonbank institutions that the CFPB is always looking across the broader financial services marketplace for areas of risk to consumers.

Under the CFPB's procedural rule, nonbanks that receivea notice of reasonable cause to commence risk-based supervision have only 30 days to file a written response and challenge the CFPB's initial decision, if they choose to do so.

This requires speedy consideration of not just the potential substantive issues raised, but analysis of the effort that might go into challenging the CFPB's notice, and the attendant consequences of challenging or not challenging the CFPB.

The order also contains important lessons for institutions already subject to supervision.

For example, the significance of a well-functioning complaint management program within a compliance management system cannot be emphasized enough, given the bureau's reliance on not just the substance of complaints, but the alleged inadequacy of the company's responses.

Much like the CFPB's other supervisory statements, such as its periodic ""Supervisory Highlights"" publications, the order points to other bigger-picture risk discussions as well."
Cooley,"Protested CFPB Supervisory Order Reveals Process, Priorities","Much like the CFPB's other supervisory statements, such as its periodic ""Supervisory Highlights"" publications, the order points to other bigger-picture risk discussions as well.

Among other things, the CFPB's order reveals its thinking on several significant industry issues, and even explores potential legal theories were these to be factual and legal findings.

In the case of the serial refinancing claims, the CFPB explains how such conduct  if true  could be the subject of an abusiveness claim under the Consumer Financial Protection Act's prohibition on unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices.

In the case of allegedly harmful collection practices, the CFPB lays out allegations from complaints that describe the very types of purported coercive and harassing practices it would explore in the supervision process, including the frequency of calls and sharing of damaging information with third parties.

While the CFPB goes to great lengths to say in the order it has made no factual conclusions or findings that the potential practices violated the law, it also is clear to say it need not get that far to make its supervisory decision.

This, in the greater context of the order, is an important reminder that the determination to supervise is not the end, but rather the beginning, of a target entity's long journey to address the issues cited, as well as other issues examiners might identify during the supervisory process.

Cooley,"Comparing the SEC Climate Rules to California, EU and ISSB Disclosure Frameworks","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted its long-awaited climate disclosure rules on March 6, 2024.

(For more information, see our recent Cooley client alert , webinar and resource page .)

The final rules require US domestic companies and foreign private issuers (FPIs) to disclose qualitative and quantitative climate-related information in their registration statements and periodic reports in general alignment with internationally accepted disclosure frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.

Note on ongoing SEC climate rules litigation: On March 15, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a motion subjecting the SEC climate rules to an administrative stay pending review of the rules by the court.

In addition to litigation in the Fifth Circuit, cases are pending in the Sixth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuits seeking to block the new rules, as well as challenges from environmental groups in the Second and DC Circuits pushing for stronger rules.

The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation will consolidate the challenges before a single court of appeals, which may then dissolve the Fifth Circuits order.

While this temporary stay may be of limited long-term effect, companies may need to prepare for compliance with the SEC rules in the shadow of ongoing litigation uncertainty, an expected outcome similar to the conflict minerals rules.

The prospect of yearslong litigation likely is most unsettling for companies that do not already publish robust climate disclosures and would not plan to do so in the absence of the SEC rules, though many such companies may not necessarily have extensive disclosure obligations under the SECs materiality-focused framework in any case.

Litigation uncertainty may be less impactful on compliance planning for companies also subject to California or European Union rules, or that otherwise make extensive voluntary disclosures.

For many companies, however, the SEC climate rules will apply in addition to other mandatory sustainability reporting frameworks already in force or imminently applicable.

While the SECs climate rules touch on many of the same areas as the three 2023 California climate disclosure laws ( Senate Bills 253 and 261 and Assembly Bill 1305 ) and the EUs Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), there are points of significant divergence.

The reporting landscape is likely to become increasingly complex, with numerous jurisdictions, including Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom, planning to adopt, or having already adopted, legislation to integrate the climate-related disclosure framework developed by the International Sustainability Standard Board (ISSB)  

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and IFRS S2  into their corporate reporting.

As a successor to the TCFD, the ISSB also will be an influential framework for those companies wishing to continue to report sustainability information voluntarily, particularly as institutional investors, such as BlackRock , and other stakeholders integrate these frameworks into their policies and engagement priorities.

In addition, on March 15, 2024, the EUs Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) was approved by the Council of the EU.

Subject to final approval by the European Parliament, expected in April, the CSDDD will become law and will apply to certain companies as early as 2027.

For in-scope US companies, the CSDDD will generate additional climate-related obligations, including a mandatory requirement to adopt and put into effect a climate transition plan that aims to ensure, through best efforts, that their business models and strategies are compatible with the limiting of global warming to 1.5 C."
Cooley,"Comparing the SEC Climate Rules to California, EU and ISSB Disclosure Frameworks","In addition to potentially impacting SEC climate target and transition plan disclosures, these CSDDD obligations may also impact how companies analyse climate risk and emissions materiality in future SEC disclosure.

Key differences between frameworks Navigating these regimes can be arduous and companies will need to work to understand the differences to develop an effective cross-regulatory reporting strategy.

Later in this alert, weve provided a table with a detailed summary of the similarities and differences between these climate reporting frameworks.

Key differences include: GHG emissions While the SEC has scaled back on requirements for companies to report on their GHG emissions, limiting disclosures to Scopes 1 or 2 where material, the California climate disclosure laws, the CSRD and the ISSB standards all require disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions as well as Scopes 1 and 2.

While the California climate disclosure laws remain unique in that they require disclosure irrespective of materiality, companies in scope of the CSRD are likely to struggle to avoid disclosing GHG emissions, given the reporting regimes requirement for double materiality, its broader approach to decision usefulness, and its starting assumption that Scope 3 emissions are an important driver of a companys transition risk.

Governance, strategy, risk management and targets Outside of emissions and climate risk, the SEC rules include numerous qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to governance, strategy, risk management, and expenditures that are absent in the California laws and are more akin to those required under the CSRD and ISSB frameworks.

While Californias SB 261 also covers material risk disclosure, the SEC rules require additional disclosures of climate-related governance, strategy, transition plans to mitigate or adapt to material climate-related risks, and climate-related financial statement metrics.

These SEC qualitative disclosure requirements are consistently linked to material risks and material impacts, such that disclosure on these topics may be broader in certain circumstances under the CSRD and ISSB (or even the California rules with regards to target disclosure under AB 1305, which is not limited to targets expected to have a material impact on reporting companies).

This is particularly likely for those in scope of the CSRD, given that certain governance and risk management disclosures are mandatory irrespective of materiality, as well as the CSRDs broader materiality standard.

Materiality On paper, materiality standards under the CSRD and SEC and other climate frameworks remain a significant point of divergence.

While disclosures under the ISSB, the SEC climate rules and SB 261 are guided by financial or investor materiality (those factors affecting a companys performance or investor decision-making), the CSRD requires companies to undertake a double materiality assessment.

This means that companies subject to the CSRD must disclose information on the impacts of their business on the environment and society irrespective of the positive or negative effect of such impacts on companies financials.

It remains to be seen, however, whether in practice double materiality will significantly impact disclosures, as stakeholder impacts, such as significant environmental or negative community externalities, can often result in financial risks.

Unlike the SEC rule, the CSRD also requires companies to disclose how their quantitative and qualitative materiality thresholds have been set and applied.

Once a topic, such as climate, is determined to be material, disclosure of particular information under such a topic is defined by decision usefulness, which includes usefulness to users such as civil society, non-governmental organizations, governments, analysts and academics, representing a much broader standard than SEC materiality."
Cooley,"Comparing the SEC Climate Rules to California, EU and ISSB Disclosure Frameworks","Disclosures under Californias SB 253 and AB 1305, by contrast, are mandatory irrespective of materiality, though SB 253 reporting is expected to be clarified by future implementing regulations by the California Air Resources Board.

Looking beyond climate and the company Beyond materiality, the EUs CSRD is an outlier both in terms of the number of sustainability topics covered beyond climate, and its broad value chain reporting mandates, as companies must report not only on their own activities but also on the sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities in their upstream and downstream value chains.

While only those disclosure requirements for EU entities and their groups have been published to date, the sustainability topics covered include water and marine resources, biodiversity, workers in the value chain, and the circular economy.

(For more information, refer to our August 2023 client alert .)

Practical implications for SEC-registered companies As a result of the above-discussed differences, multiframework reporting will present important practical implications for SEC-registered companies, including: Emissions reporting will be unavoidable for many companies Scope 3 reporting will be required for companies subject to SB 253 and, in practice, is likely unavoidable under the CSRD, despite such disclosures being abandoned in the final SEC rule, and under SB 253, Scopes 1 and 2 reporting also will not be subject to materiality tests.

As a result, the changes to the SEC emissions reporting requirements may be much less consequential, even if companies may still avoid the added burden of including such disclosures in SEC filings.

In addition, even when emissions reporting is not subject to materiality tests, emissions reporting under the GHG Protocol, particularly Scope 3, is shaped by judgments as to the materiality of emission types.

Companies may adopt more rigor in California, CSRD or voluntary reporting Given overlap with SEC regulations, companies may approach California, EU, ISSB or other voluntary climate reporting with greater disclosure controls, including legal and internal audit oversight.

In addition to potentially influencing SEC reporting decisions, public disclosures in other reports on a topic covered by SEC rules may increase a companys exposure to SEC enforcement or inquiries, liability under the US federal securities laws, and general investor scrutiny.

Disclosures in California, CSRD or ISSB reports may impact SEC disclosure strategies Companies that otherwise may have attempted to treat their emissions or climate targets as nonmaterial may be less likely to do so if already required to disclose such matters under other regulations, though many companies may be reluctant to take on the added liability and other risks of disclosure in SEC filings.

CSRD disclosures also may impact how companies approach materiality for SEC purposes.

Although climate reporting under the CSRD is subject to a materiality test, the CSRD requires certain detailed climate-related disclosures irrespective of materiality.

It is mandatory to disclose a companys processes, including its use of scenario analysis, to identify and assess climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities.

In addition, under the CSRD if a company determines that it will not report on climate, it must nevertheless publish a detailed justification as to why the climate-related information is not material enough, from both a financial and impact perspective, to require reporting, including a forward-looking analysis of the conditions that could lead the undertaking to conclude that climate change is material in the future.

The combination of the CSRDs mandatory climate disclosures and its double materiality standard is expected to result in widespread decisions to fully report on climate, including emissions."
Cooley,"Comparing the SEC Climate Rules to California, EU and ISSB Disclosure Frameworks","The combination of the CSRDs mandatory climate disclosures and its double materiality standard is expected to result in widespread decisions to fully report on climate, including emissions.

The extensive disclosures required under the CSRD, including on the materiality analysis, may make it more difficult for companies to justify determinations that climate risks or emissions are nonmaterial, or to avoid SEC comments.

SEC implications may drive voluntary reporting strategies Companies that wish to minimize the inclusion of climate-related disclosures in SEC filings may now have an incentive to minimize voluntary actions that could attract SEC or investor scrutiny of materiality determinations, such as voluntary climate-related disclosures in voluntary sustainability reports under the ISSB or other frameworks, or the publicizing of climate-related targets and goals.

It is yet to be seen, however, whether rating agencies, institutional investors, corporate customers or other stakeholders, who often drive voluntary reporting strategies, will drop requirements for companies to provide disclosures under voluntary sustainability standards, such as Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

SEC implications may influence CSRD reporting strategies Most US businesses that are in scope of the CSRD will be filing reports first at their EU subsidiary level in 2026 and later at the level of the ultimate US parent company in 2029.

Many such companies are nevertheless considering early consolidated reporting at the ultimate parent-level for practical reasons.

The appeal of early parent-level reporting may be impacted by the publication of the SEC rules, to avoid publishing materiality, risk, emissions, or other parent-level disclosures that may influence SEC reporting or attract SEC scrutiny.

Nonetheless, there will not always be significant differences parent and subsidiary-level climate reporting under the CSRD, particularly with respect to Scope 3 emissions, so companies will need to make circumstances-specific judgements.

Disclosure framework comparison Below is a high-level comparison of the SEC climate rules, the three California climate disclosure laws, the CSRD* and ISSB.

*

The commentary on the CSRD is limited to the ESRS published to date, which apply predominantly to EU companies, their groups and those with securities admitted to trading on EU regulated markets.

Further sector-specific standards that also will apply are expected.

The reporting standards for ultimate non-EU parents required to report under the CSRD have not yet been published, but they are not expected to be as detailed as those described in this alert and are likely to be focused on sustainability impacts, rather than sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities.

Notes

The tables estimate filing dates based on FYB January 1 and present compliance dates for SEC LAFs, as these are the filers most likely to be subject to the CSRD, SB 253 and SB 261.

See the summary table at the end of our March 7 alert for more information on disclosure dates.

Entities that on an individual or, if a group, consolidated basis satisfy at least two of the following: (1) balance sheet total of more than 25 million euros; (2) net turnover of more than 50 million euros; (3) an average of more than 250 employees during the financial year.

Entities that are not large and on an individual or, if a group, consolidated basis satisfy at least two of the following: (1) balance sheet total of more than 450,000 euros; (2) net turnover of more than 900,000 euros; (3) an average of more than 10 employees during the financial year."
Cooley,"Comparing the SEC Climate Rules to California, EU and ISSB Disclosure Frameworks","To allow for additional time to prepare emissions data, disclosure of GHG emissions data may be incorporated into a companys second quarter 10-Q or filed in a 10-K/A by the filing deadline for the second quarter 10-Q. For FPIs, GHG emissions data is due in a 20-F/A no later than 225 days after the fiscal year-end.

In each case, to take advantage of this delay, the issuer must include a statement in its annual report on Form 10-K or 20-F, as applicable, to indicate its express intention to later amend its filing to make these GHG emissions disclosures."
Cooley,Ephemeral Messaging Isn’t a Fleeting Interest for Regulators,"Editors note: Reproduced with permission.

It has been one year since the Department of Justice announced updated guidance on use of ephemeral messaging platforms for corporate communications.

Since then, the DOJ and other regulators continue to sound alarms about these tools, which automatically erase conversations between parties.

Their stance is clear: Companies with strong policies will be rewarded, and companies that fail to act face potentially tougher penalties if those communications ever become relevant.

To mitigate risks, companies should implement clear policies on ephemeral messaging, offer alternative means to send company-related texts, and develop training programs for employees.

Regulatory Focus Government regulators see text messages, including those sent over ephemeral messaging platforms, as vital evidence.

While the DOJs guidance is easy to understand, it could be difficult to follow in practice.

Prosecutors would no longer accept at face value a companys failure to turn over ephemeral communications and noted that ""[a] companys answersor lack of answers [concerning ephemeral messages]may very well affect the offer it receives to resolve criminal liability.

The widely understood implication was that the DOJ expected companies to play an active role in guiding and monitoring employees use of messaging applications for company business.

Yet it was unclear how the policy would work in practice or if the DOJs focus would wane.

Regulators focus on ephemeral messaging didnt turn out to be a passing fad, and the DOJ has continued to broadcast how important it believes this type of evidence can be.

In January, the DOJ antitrust division and Federal Trade Commission announced that they are changing language in their standard preservation letters, grand jury subpoenas, and compulsory legal processes to specifically address increased use of ephemeral messaging platforms.

These changes ensure that companies can no longer feign ignorance when it comes to their need to monitor and preserve ephemeral messaging.

The DOJ even warned that, under this new guidance, the failure to produce such documents can result in criminal charges for the company, including obstruction of justice charges.

Companies with clear policies concerning ephemeral messaging have been rewarded.

For example, DOJ officials have consistently praised Corsa Coal Corp. for making voluntary disclosures to the DOJ that resulted in two former executives of the company being charged with offenses related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act .

In declining to prosecute the company, the DOJ cited Corsa Coals significant cooperation as one of the factors leading to the decision not to prosecute.

It also identified the case as an example of the need for companies to develop policies concerning these messaging applications and, where appropriate, retrieve and then produce such communications.

On the other hand, failure to adequately preserve messages can create additional risks for a company and its employees.

Issues concerning ephemeral messaging were front and center in the criminal trial of FTX Trading Ltd. co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Southern District of New York.

There, the jury heard evidence concerning the involvement of FTX lawyers in creation and implementation of document retention policies .

This included testimony that company policies allowed for certain communication applications to be set to auto-delete, as well as testimony that Bankman-Fried had discussed with counsel the fact that certain messaging applications were so configured.

Bankman-Fried was convicted of all charges and is awaiting sentencing.

Mitigating Risks"
Cooley,Ephemeral Messaging Isn’t a Fleeting Interest for Regulators,"Bankman-Fried was convicted of all charges and is awaiting sentencing.

Mitigating Risks

The past year has shown ephemeral messaging remains a source of significant peril for companies, particularly because regulators are unlikely to excuse companies inaction when their employees use these platforms.

In certain regulated industries, an employees use of ephemeral messaging can trigger an enforcement action for failure to abide with recordkeeping requirements.

For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2023 charged several broker-dealers and investment advisers with recordkeeping violations in connection with failure to preserve off-channel communications.

There are actionable steps companies can take to mitigate these risks.

Have a policy.

Implement a clear policy that bans the use of ephemeral messaging applications for company communications.

This policy should be harmonized with the companys acceptable use policies for technology.

Company policies should also clarify that, should an employee use ephemeral (or any non-sanctioned) messaging communications, the company has a right to collect relevant data from the employees phone and make any disclosures to law enforcement as necessary.

Offer an alternative.

In place of ephemeral messaging applications, companies should offer employees alternate messaging applications that are company-controlled and accessible for review, with practical retention policies that comply with applicable rules and regulations.

Companies should also design and use functional mobile device policies and software to manage applications on devices used for business purposes, including personal devices.

Use training to understand the risks.

Companies should develop training programs aimed at educating and empowering employees to understand their role in helping the company manage risks, including by using company-approved messaging applications."
Cooley,EU Reaches Provisional Agreement on Banning Products Made With Forced Labour,"On 5 March 2024, European Union legislators reached provisional agreement on new rules that, once formally adopted, will ban products made with forced labour from being placed or made available on the EU market or exported from the EU market.

The EUs ban on products made with forced labour regulation (FLR) will apply to products which in whole or in part benefited from forced labour.

The FLR supplements the existing EU rules combatting human trafficking.

The FLR will now be subject to formal approval and is likely to apply across all EU member states from mid-2027.

The potential impact of the FLR and the need for companies to achieve greater supply chain visibility is made clear by the recent impounding of thousands of vehicles at US customs over component parts linked to allegations of forced labour in violation of the US Forced Labor Prevention Act (House Resolution 6256).

The EUs ban would take effect in a similar way, but it would be broader than the US requirements, as it is not limited to forced labour in specific geographic areas.

FLRs key elements

The full text of the provisional agreement has not been published and is expected to become publicly available in the next few weeks.

In the meantime, based on what we know at this stage, we have listed below some highlights of the agreement.

Products subject to the FLR and the meaning of forced labour The ban is expected to apply to products used in whole or in part at any stage of the supply chain (i.e., whether extracted, harvested, produced or manufactured using forced labour).

It would not matter whether the occurrence of forced labour arose within the EU or outside, nor whether it was the final product or one of the product components that benefited from forced labour.

Prior versions of the FLR defined forced labour by referencing the International Labour Organization Convention  all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered [themselves] voluntarily.

In-scope companies The FLR will apply to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as large companies, placing products on the EU market, distributing products within the EU, or exporting products outside the EU.

Investigations and enforcement will follow a risk-based approach The provisional agreement sets out clear criteria to be applied by enforcement authorities when assessing risks and violations: The scale and severity of suspected forced labour, including the likely presence of state-imposed forced labour.

The quantity or volume of the noncompliant product made available on the EU market.

The proportion of parts within the final products likely to have been made with forced labour.

The proximity of the company to the suspect forced labour risks, as well as the companys leverage to address them.

Enforcement is likely to focus on high-risk areas and products According to the text, the European Commission (EC), at the European Parliaments insistence, will develop a list of high-risk areas and products which enforcement authorities will need to consider when assessing the likelihood of noncompliance with the FLR.

The EC, however, has the power to identify products or product groups for which importers and exporters will have to submit extra details to EU customs, such as information on the manufacturer and suppliers of these products.

Enforcement authorities Investigatory and decision-making powers will be divided between the EC and the competent authorities of the relevant member state, depending on whether the risks of forced labour were identified outside of the EU or within a particular member state.

The final decision of the lead investigatory authority will, however, apply in all member states.

Investigations will be supported by a new Forced Labour Single Portal, which will include information on bans, a database of risk areas and sectors, publicly available evidence and a whistleblower portal."
Cooley,EU Reaches Provisional Agreement on Banning Products Made With Forced Labour,"Third-country cooperation, in particular with countries with similar legislation, also should be expected, with cooperation and information-sharing agreements envisaged by the agreed text.

Risks of product seizures, disposal and fines If investigations conclude that forced labour has been used, the enforcement authorities can ban or require the withdrawal and disposal of the relevant goods from the EU market and online marketplaces.

Noncompliant goods also may be confiscated at customs.

The goods would then have to be donated, recycled or destroyed.

The provisional agreement clarifies that the requirement to dispose of the product only relates to the noncompliant component and not necessarily the product as a whole if it is possible to replace the individual noncompliant component.

However, if companies eliminate forced labour from their supply chains, banned products can be admitted back on EU market.

Companies that do not comply also can be fined.

Publication of guidelines Guidelines are to be published for companies and enforcement authorities to support compliance efforts and set out best practices.

These guidelines, which will include accompanying measures for micro-companies and SMEs, will be available through the Forced Labour Single Portal to be launched by the European Commission.

The FLR will not place specific due diligence requirements on businesses.

However, it is clear that businesses will need good supply chain visibility to mitigate potentially costly consequences of noncompliance.

Next steps Historically, a provisional agreement has provided near certainty that legislation will be adopted without significant further changes.

Recently, however, we have seen examples of provisional agreements not being formally adopted by the European Parliament and member states in the Council of the European Union.

EU member states and the European Parliament now need to adopt the FLR for the ban to take effect.

Following approval by the EU Council on 13 March 2024, the final step is for the European Parliament to approve the legislation during its April plenary.

Once the law has entered into force, EU countries will have three years to start applying the new rules."
Cooley,Playing Nice in the Sandbox: FDA (Finally) Harmonizes Medical Device Manufacturing Requirements With ISO,"On February 2, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a much-awaited final rule: the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR).

1

By issuing this rule, FDA amended the medical device current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements of 21 CFR Part 820  the Quality System Regulation (QSR)  to align more closely with the quality management system (QMS) requirements used by other countries.

The QMSR incorporates by reference the 2016 edition of ISO 13485, an international standard specific to device quality management systems set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

In addition, the QMSR incorporates by reference Clause 3 of ISO 9000:2015, Quality management systems  Fundamentals and Vocabulary (ISO 9000), which contains terms and definitions that are indispensable for the application of ISO 13485.

The QMSR establishes additional requirements that clarify certain expectations and concepts used in ISO 13485, which ensure consistency with other applicable requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations.

Moreover, the QMSR makes conforming edits to 21 CFR Part 4 to clarify that these device cGMP requirements apply equally to combination products.

The QMSR reflects FDAs continued efforts to align FDAs regulatory framework with that used by other regulatory authorities and promote consistency in the regulation of medical devices.  

ISO 13485  an independent standard  is used internationally by many regulatory authorities to inform or govern quality management system requirements for device manufacturers, and also is used in regulatory harmonization programs, such as the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).

FDA and regulatory authorities from four other countries participate in the MDSAP.

Recognizing that the requirements in ISO 13485 have become more closely aligned with the QSR requirements, FDA seized upon the opportunity for regulatory harmonization and amended Part 820 2 to replace the QSR with the QMSR.

FDA issued the proposed rule on February 23, 2022, nearly two years before the recently issued final version.

Important points to keep in mind while transitioning to the QMSR 1.

Although the QMSR is substantially similar to the QSR, there are some key differences.

FDA determined that the requirements in ISO 13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QSR and provide a similar level of assurance in a firms quality management system and in its ability to consistently manufacture devices that are safe, effective and otherwise in compliance with the FDCA.

Although there are many similarities between the QMSR and QSR, there also are some key differences that should be noted, as discussed below.

Similarities The QMSR retains certain definitions from the QSR.

These include the definitions for component, finished device, human cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue-based product (HCT/P) regulated as a device, manufacturer and remanufacturer.

In addition, all definitions in section 201 of the FDCA  such as device, label and labeling  shall  apply to and supersede the definitions in ISO 13485.

This is to ensure that the definitions in the QMSR are consistent with the FDCA (FDAs operative statute) and its implementing regulations.

The QMSR has the same scope as the QSR.

The QMSR, like the QSR, will apply only to manufacturers of finished devices, although, as was the case with the QSR, FDA has authority under the FDCA to extend QMSR requirements to manufacturers of components since components are part of the device definition under section 201(h) of the FDCA.

In addition, the QMSR, like the QSR, will not apply to manufacturers of blood and blood components used for transfusion or for further manufacturing, even though such products may meet the definition of device under the FDCA."
Cooley,Playing Nice in the Sandbox: FDA (Finally) Harmonizes Medical Device Manufacturing Requirements With ISO,"Rather, such manufacturers are subject to 21 CFR Parts 600  689, including the cGMP requirements for blood and blood components in 21 CFR Part 606.

The QMSR uses the definition of top management set forth in ISO 9000 rather than the term management with executive responsibility or its definition from the QSR.

FDA clarified, however, that this change in terminology does not change FDAs expectation that manufacturers, led by individuals with executive responsibilities, embrace a culture of quality as a key component in ensuring the manufacture of safe and effective medical devices that otherwise comply with the FDCA.

3 Differences The QMSR places more emphasis than the QSR on risk management throughout the life cycle of medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness.

The QMSR, unlike the QSR, includes a specific requirement that device manufacturers shall document one or more processes for risk management in product realization and shall maintain records of risk management.

4 Currently, risk management in the QSR is captured primarily in requirements concerning design controls in 21 CFR  820.30.  

According to FDA, the more explicit integration of risk management throughout ISO 13485 and incorporated into the QMSR will help best meet the needs of patients and users and facilitate access to quality devices along with the progress of science and technology.

5

The QMSR will no longer use certain terms that are in the QSR.

These terms include design history file, device manufacturing record and device history record.

Moreover, the terms safety and performance in ISO 13485 will be used in lieu of, and be deemed to have the same meaning as, safety and effectiveness in the FDCA.  

Although it is debatable whether performance has the same meaning as effectiveness  and FDA acknowledged in the preamble to the QMSR that these terms are not interchangeable  FDA was satisfied that the provisions of the QMSR collectively are intended to assure that finished devices will be manufactured to meet the statutory requirement for safety and effectiveness under the FDCA.

Thus, safety and performance shall have the meaning of safety and effectiveness in Clause 0.1 of ISO 13485.

Moreover, the QMSR explicitly stated that the phrase safety and performance does not relieve a manufacturer from any obligation to implement controls or other measures that provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

7

The QMSR uses the term and definition of customer set forth in ISO 9000.

Certain customer requirements in ISO 13485 are not grounded in the safety and effectiveness requirements of the FDCA.

Thus, FDA noted in the preamble to the QMSR that FDA does not intend to enforce any customer requirements (e.g., requirements relating to customer property in Clause 7.5.10 of ISO 13485) to the extent that they are interpreted to go beyond the safety and effectiveness of the devices being manufactured.

2. Device manufacturers must continue to comply with the QSR until the QMSR becomes effective on February 2, 2026.

FDA had initially proposed that the QMSR would become effective one year after its issuance.  

However, in response to public comments, FDA determined that one year would not be enough and agreed to a two-year transitional period in the final rule.

While the QMSR is intended to streamline QMS regulations and harmonize these requirements with international standards by reducing the administrative burden of complying with multiple regulatory schemes, the QMSR may initially create disproportionate burden on small manufacturers that do not operate on an international scale and will need to adjust to the rule.

Although device manufacturers must continue to comply with the QSR until the QMSR becomes effective, those unfamiliar with ISO 13485 should begin to become familiar with the QMSR, train their employees, and update their procedures and practices to ensure an effective transition."
Cooley,Playing Nice in the Sandbox: FDA (Finally) Harmonizes Medical Device Manufacturing Requirements With ISO,"Those who have not begun or are getting ready to launch their first medical device should begin transitioning to QMSR now.

8 3.

Although the QMSR incorporates by reference only ISO 13485 and Clause 3 of ISO 9000, other international standards may provide useful guidance.

ISO 13485 references ISO 14971 and other standards that are not incorporated by reference in the QMSR, but FDA noted that such standards may be helpful in understanding application of ISO 13485, and organizations may choose to incorporate concepts, processes, or other aspects of ISO 9000 into their organizations QS  so long as the resultant system is compliant with the QMSR established in this rulemaking.

9 4.

FDA should continue to accept MDSAP audits in lieu of FDA inspections, but FDA will not require or rely solely on ISO 13485 certificates for regulatory oversight.

ISO 13485 certificates from third-party auditing organizations are not substitutes for FDA inspections.

The MDSAP program is a voluntary certification program that allows for a single QMS audit based on ISO 13485, in addition to other applicable FDA device regulatory requirements.

FDA should continue to accept MDSAP audits  which may discuss the manufacturers certification to ISO 13485  in lieu of routine FDA surveillance inspections.

MDSAP audits are conducted by third-party auditing organizations that have applied for participation in MDSAP and received authorized or recognized status after having been evaluated by the participating regulatory authorities.

FDA uses the MDSAP audit reports as an additional tool for regulatory oversight of audited manufacturers.

While many device manufacturers undergo audits by third-party organizations outside of the MDSAP for compliance with ISO 13485, because FDA does not conduct oversight of non-MDSAP auditing organizations and does not evaluate the audit reports issued outside of the MDSAP, FDA will not require medical device manufacturers to obtain ISO 13485 certification and will not rely on ISO 13485 certificates to conduct its regulatory oversight of medical device manufacturers.

Thus, FDA inspections will not result in the issuance of a certificate of conformity to ISO 13485, and FDA will not accept certification to ISO 13485 in place of FDA inspections.

5.

The QMSR requires additional recordkeeping that had been exempted under the QSR regime.

In an effort to move toward global harmonization, FDA decided to forego certain exceptions, such as those for management review, quality audits and supplier audits, which are inspected by other regulators and auditing entities (e.g., MDSAP auditing organizations).

6.

The QMSR continues to require certain information concerning complaints, as well as device labeling and packaging, to ensure consistency with the FDCA and FDA regulations.

The QMSR retains some QSR provisions that are not in ISO 13485 to avoid conflict with the existing requirements in the FDCA and implementing regulations.

These include, for example, certain requirements for complaint records and device labeling and packaging controls.

From a practical standpoint, the complaint handling requirements under the QSR will continue to apply with respect to entities serving as US agents of foreign manufacturers of medical devices.

7.

FDA acknowledges the tension between ISO 13485 and provisions of the FDCA and/or its implementing regulations.

Acknowledging the conflicts between certain ISO 13485 provisions and the FDCA, FDA included in the QMSR an express preemption provision  namely, that any conflict will be resolved in accordance with the FDCA and/or its implementing regulations.

For example: The definitions of device and labeling in section 201 of the FDCA supersede the correlating definitions for medical device and labelling in ISO 13485.

The terms safety and performance in ISO 13485 shall be construed to mean the same as safety and effectiveness in section 520(f) of the FDCA."
Cooley,Playing Nice in the Sandbox: FDA (Finally) Harmonizes Medical Device Manufacturing Requirements With ISO,"The terms safety and performance in ISO 13485 shall be construed to mean the same as safety and effectiveness in section 520(f) of the FDCA.

The burden is on the manufacturers to comply with all relevant laws and regulations, so this is an issue manufacturers will need to be aware of as they make the transition to compliance with the QMSR.

Cooley,"Federal District Court Rules Corporate Transparency Act Unconstitutional, but Law Remains in Effect","Last Friday, a federal court in Alabama ruled in National Small Business United v. Yellen that the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting requirements established by the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) are unconstitutional.

These CTA provisions, implemented through the BOI reporting rule promulgated by the US Department of the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in September 2022, just started taking effect on January 1, 2024.

Pursuant to the CTA and the BOI reporting rule, unless exempt, any company formed in the US, or any foreign company that registers to do business in the US, by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office is a covered reporting company that must submit information to FinCEN about the company and its beneficial owners (as defined by the CTA and by rule).

The plaintiffs in the case argued that the CTA exceeded the Constitutions limits on the legislative branch and lacked a sufficient nexus to any enumerated power to be a necessary or proper means for achieving the policy goals of Congress.

The court rejected FinCENs arguments that the CTA was necessary and proper to carry out Congress foreign affairs, national security and taxing powers.

Additionally, the court held that the CTA did not regulate interstate commerce or purely economic intrastate activity as authorized by the commerce clause.

However, the ruling only enjoins FinCEN and the Treasury Department from requiring the plaintiffs to comply with the CTA.

FinCEN subsequently confirmed in a brief notice posted on its website late Monday, March 4, that it will comply with the courts order for as long as it remains in effect, and is not currently enforcing the CTA against the individually named plaintiff, reporting companies for which he is the beneficial owner or company applicant, the National Small Business Association, and members of the National Small Business Association (as of March 1, 2024).

In other words, it appears that the CTA is still in effect, and FinCEN may still enforce the CTA against individuals and entities other than the plaintiffs.

While the courts ruling and FinCENs response leaves the door open to future litigation (or a legislative change), at this time there is nothing concrete that would suggest that other covered reporting companies do not need to comply and file BOI reports by the applicable deadline.

While FinCEN or the Treasury Department also could appeal the district courts ruling and/or seek an injunction, as of March 6, 2024, the agencies do not appear to have done so or indicated that they will do so.

Covered entities should continue to monitor for updates or additional guidance, as we anticipate that the situation will continue to develop.

In addition, even leaving aside the CTA, companies should be mindful of other new BOI reporting obligations under new state laws based on the CTA, such as New Yorks LLC Transparency Act , which remain unaffected by the courts decision in this case.

Cooley associate Cailin Liu also contributed to this alert."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Climate Reporting Requirements,"On March 6, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted at an open meeting to adopt final rules to mandate climate-related disclosure by public companies.

The long-awaited rules will require qualitative disclosure on climate risk, risk management, governance and targets, as well as quantitative emissions and expenditure reporting requirements under certain circumstances.

Initial disclosures under the final rules for large accelerated filers will be due in 2026, with emissions and financial expenditures disclosures due in 2027.

Please see the summary table at the end of this alert for more information on disclosure dates, including for other filers.

This initial publication will be followed by subsequent articles exploring the final climate rules in more detail, including their relationship to the California and European Union (EU) rules.

Cooley also hosted a webinar on March 12 to discuss the final rules , as well as key questions and next steps for issuers, which you can view on demand.

For more resources related to the climate rules, please visit our ESG Resources page .

While the adopted qualitative disclosure requirements are broadly consistent with the proposed requirements, the final rules introduce numerous significant changes with respect to emissions reporting and attestations that are intended to reduce reporting burdens on many companies and provide increased breathing room for disclosure preparation.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler, in his prepared remarks, noted several times that the adopted rules are grounded in materiality, and almost all the new disclosure requirements will be subject to a materiality determination, in line with other parts of Regulation S-K. Of particular note, the final rules limit Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting to material emissions and generally link climate expenditure, strategy, transition plans and targets disclosures to material risks and impacts.

Additionally, the final rules do not include Scope 3 emissions reporting requirements and allow for significant phase-in periods for attestations of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.

The final rules also pare back the financial statement disclosure from the proposed rule by removing the requirement to disclose the impact of climate-related events on each line item of a companys financial statements.

The SEC published its initial climate rule proposal on March 21, 2022, which went on to generate more than 24,000 comments from the public, in addition to extensive congressional, media and industry coverage.

Adoption of the final rules was delayed several times, during which period other climate-related disclosure rules were published in the US and other jurisdictions.

These include three climate reporting laws in California ( SB 253, SB 261 and AB 1305 ) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) framework in the EU.

Although the SECs modified emissions reporting requirements will likely be met with some relief for many issuers, as well as nonpublic companies in issuers value chains, the impact of these changes will be significantly blunted due to the broad Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reporting requirements under the California and EU rules, which are expected to apply to thousands of US companies.

Disclosure will be required for both domestic and foreign private issuers in annual reports on Forms 10-K and 20-F, as applicable, as well as in registration statements under the Securities Act.

The climate rules will apply similarly to foreign private issuers, except that an issuer that files consolidated financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) would apply IFRS as the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement metrics rather than US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Climate Reporting Requirements,"Foreign private issuers that qualify to use the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) and file annual reports on Form 40-F are exempt from the final climate-related disclosure rules.

The table below provides a high-level summary of the emissions and qualitative disclosure requirements under the new Regulation S-K Item 1500, as well as the financial statement disclosure requirements under the new Regulation S-X Article 14.

Disclosure compliance dates Reporting requirements under the climate rules are based on fiscal years beginning in a given calendar year  or FYBs.

For example, FYB 2025 would include fiscal years beginning on January 1 through December 31, 2025.

*

All filing dates assume December 31 fiscal year-ends.

** To allow for additional time to prepare emissions data, disclosure of GHG emissions data may be forward incorporated into a companys second quarter 10-Q or filed in a 10-K/A by the filing deadline for the second quarter 10-Q. For foreign private issuers, GHG emissions data is due in a 20-F/A no later than 225 days after the fiscal year-end.

In each case, to take advantage of this delay, the issuer must include a statement in its annual report on Form 10-K or 20-F, as applicable, to indicate its express intention to later amend its filing to make these GHG emissions disclosures.

The new rules will become effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Companies will be required to comply with the new rules based on filer status.

For detailed information regarding filer status determination, refer to Cooleys Guide to Determining Securities Exchange Act Filer and Smaller Reporting Company Status .

Notes AFs that are smaller reporting companies or emerging growth companies are not required to provide GHG emissions disclosure.

Organizational boundaries refer to the companys determination of the boundaries that define the operations that it owns or controls for purposes of calculating GHG emissions.  

If such boundaries materially differ from the scope of entities and operations included in a companys consolidated financial statements, the rules will require a brief explanation of this difference.

Operational boundaries refer to the boundaries that determine the direct and indirect emissions associated with the business operations owned or controlled by a registrant."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Final Rule to Reduce Credit Card Late Fees to $8 for Large Credit Card Issuers,"On March 5, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a final rule amending provisions in Regulation Z that govern credit card late fee charges.

The final rule follows the March 2023 release of the proposed rule related to credit card late fees and will take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

For credit card issuers with one million or more open accounts, together with their affiliates, the final rule: Adjusts the safe harbor dollar amount for late fees from up to $41 to $8 and eliminates a higher safe harbor dollar amount for late fees for subsequent violations of the same type.

Requires larger card issuers that want to charge late fees above the $8 threshold to prove that the higher fee is necessary to cover actual costs (but clarifies post-charge off costs cannot be included in the costs analysis).

Limits a larger card issuers ability to implement annual inflation adjustments for the safe harbor dollar amounts in connection with the late fee safe harbor amount.

The CFPB instead will monitor the market and make adjustments to the safe harbor amount as necessary.

The CFPB expects that the new $8 safe harbor amount will apply to the largest 30 to 35 credit card issuers, covering more than 95% of the total outstanding balances in the credit card market as of the end of 2022.

Who does the rule cover?

The final rule establishes different requirements for credit card issuers based on the number of accounts held by issuers and their affiliates.

In supplementary information accompanying the final rule, the CFPB indicates that applying the rule to smaller card issuers would result in a heightened compliance burden.

According to a statement issued by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, the CFPB did not find evidence [that] these smaller companies are employing the fee churning business model, and in fact they generally charge much lower fees overall.

As a result, smaller card issuers may continue to charge a higher safe harbor threshold for credit card late fees and automatically increase the safe harbor dollar amount based on the Consumer Price Index.

Note that under the final rule, if a smaller card issuer had fewer than one million open credit card accounts for the entire preceding calendar year but meets or exceeds that number of open credit card accounts in the current calendar year, the entity will no longer be a smaller card issuer as of 60 days after meeting or exceeding that number of open credit card accounts.

Highlights of the final rule Lowering safe harbor dollar amount for late fees to $8 Currently under Regulation Z, a card issuer may not impose a penalty fee (e.g., late fees, over-the-limit fees and insufficient funds fees) for violating the terms of a credit card account unless the issuer has determined that the amount of the fee is a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the issuer for that type of violation or complies with a safe harbor provision.

The current safe harbor for credit card issuers is $30 for the first violation and $41 thereafter for a violation of the same type within the next six billing cycles.

The final rule lowers this safe harbor threshold to $8 for larger card issuers in connection with late payment fees only.

The $8 amount also would apply to all other subsequent late payment violations that occur within six months of the initial violation.

The final rule permits larger card issuers to charge a fee greater than $8 if they can prove that the higher fee is necessary to cover their incurred collection costs.

Effective date The final rule will take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

The CFPB indicates that larger card issuers likely have the capacity and resources to comply with the revisions to Regulation Z within 60 days of the final rule being published."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Final Rule to Reduce Credit Card Late Fees to $8 for Large Credit Card Issuers,"The CFPB indicates that larger card issuers likely have the capacity and resources to comply with the revisions to Regulation Z within 60 days of the final rule being published.

Other penalty fees Pursuant to annual adjustments for safe harbor dollar amounts, the final rule increases the amount that smaller card issuers are permitted to charge for credit card late fees, as well as the amount that all card issuers may charge for all other penalty fees.

For the initial violation, the safe harbor amount increased to $32 and to $43 for subsequent violations of the same type that occur during the same billing cycle or in one of the next six billing cycles.

Again, these higher amounts do not apply to late fees charged by larger institutions.

This means that larger card issuers may continue to charge up to $43 for penalty fees (other than late fees), such as returned payment fees.

Still, the CFPB reiterated that it will monitor the market for any notable increases in the prevalence of other types of penalty fees, including over-the-limit fees.

Cost analysis The final rule also clarifies that with respect to all penalty fees (including late fees), for both smaller and larger card issuers, the cost analysis for determining whether a fee is reasonable may not include any collection costs that are incurred after an account is charged off pursuant to loan loss provisions.

In the supplementary information accompanying the final rule, the CFPB stated its belief that permitting issuers to recover losses  like post-charge off costs  through late fees is not consistent with the intent of credit card-related laws and regulations.

Rather, according to the CFPB, issuers have other means to recover these costs, including through upfront rates.

Rate and fee increases The CFPB indicates in its press release and in the supplementary information accompanying the final rule that card issuers have several tools at their disposal for deterring and managing higher risks posed by late payments  including increasing interest rates, raising annual and monthly fees, and reducing credit lines.

However, larger card issuers that consider increasing annual percentage rates in response to adjusting their late payment structure will be required to perform a rate reevaluation under Section 1026.59 of Regulation Z. Card issuers may charge late fees up to the amount of the required minimum payment The CFPB initially proposed a restriction on any late fee charge higher than 25% of the required minimum payment.

As currently permitted under Regulation Z, card issuers may continue to charge a late fee that is 100% of the required minimum payment owed by the cardholder, pursuant to any cost-analysis requirements under Regulation Z.

The CFPB received several comments from trade associations, banks and credit unions in opposition to the proposed 25% cap.

Among other things, these commenters expressed concerns that the 25% limitation would: Be an impediment to card issuers ability to cover current or future increased costs associated with late payments.

Increase the upfront costs that card issuers would incur due to a change in terms on all accounts.

Cause issuers to raise their minimum payment requirements to charge a higher late fee.

As a result, the CFPB declined to include this provision in the final rule.

No courtesy period requirement Under the proposed rule, the CFPB considered requiring card issuers to provide a 15-day courtesy period before assessing a late fee to consumers.

The final rule does not implement a courtesy period for late fees or any other penalty fees.

The CFPB indicates that the potential benefits of imposing a courtesy period were outweighed by the burden it could cause, such as the potential to cause consumer confusion regarding when a minimum payment would be due.

What does this mean for you?"
Cooley,CFPB Issues Final Rule to Reduce Credit Card Late Fees to $8 for Large Credit Card Issuers,"What does this mean for you?

Larger card issuers will need to assess their late fee policies, including whether to implement the $8 safe harbor or to employ a cost analysis to support imposing late fees that exceed $8.

Larger card issuers also may need to identify any disclosures impacted by the rule  including advertising disclosures, account-opening disclosures, periodic statements and renewal notices  and make changes accordingly.

The appendices included in the final rule provide revisions to model disclosures in Regulation Z.

Larger card issuers also may want to consider how they will notify consumers and credit card holders of any changes to late fees, if applicable.

Regulation Z does not require issuers to provide a change in terms notice when reducing the late fee amount.

All card issuers may want to continue to monitor penalty fee policies, particularly as the CFPB and other regulators have demonstrated a focus on regulating so-called junk fees, as well as unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices.

This means understanding what fees can be charged, how different types of fees interact with each other and the requirements for disclosing those fees.

We will be monitoring the implementation of the rule, particularly in light of the fact that certain lobbying groups and other stakeholders, including the US Chamber of Commerce, have indicated intentions to challenge the final rule.

A representative from the Chamber of Commerce issued a public statement , noting that the Chamber will be filing a lawsuit against the [CFPB] imminently to prevent this misguided and harmful [late fees] rule from going into effect."
Cooley,CFPB Warns Digital Marketers About ‘Abusive’ Steering Practices,"On February 29, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued Circular 2024-01 , warning operators of digital comparison-shopping tools and lead generators that they may be covered persons subject to CFPB jurisdiction and their activities may put them at risk of engaging in abusive acts or practices in violation of federal law.

Specifically, the circular describes in detail how certain advertising compensation models that incentivize the promotion of products in the operator or lead generators financial interest over that of the consumers may constitute an abusive act or practice.

In light of this circular  and the CFPBs recent push to expand jurisdiction over nonbank providers of financial services  operators, their affiliates, and other financial institutions using online product comparison tools should review their marketing practices and third-party relationships.

CFPB asserts jurisdiction over comparison-shopping websites Many consumers visit operators to compare costs, features, or other terms for a set of comparable financial products or services.

Similarly, lead generators may advertise financial products to consumers, and then sell information they collect through consumer engagement with these advertisements to third-party financial services providers.

The Consumer Financial Protection Act prohibits covered persons and service providers from engaging in any abusive act or practice.

As a predicate to its guidance, the CFPB describes how operators and lead generators can either be covered persons or service providers  and therefore subject to CFPB supervision and enforcement, depending in part on their business model.

The CFPB takes the position that certain operators or lead generators may be sufficiently engaging with consumers such that they are brokering a credit product  an activity that is expressly regulated by the CFPB.

However, even if the entity is not actually brokering loans, the CFPB also could claim the operator or lead generator is providing consumers with financial advisory services, another defined activity that brings an entity under the CFPBs purview as a covered person.

Failing that, the CFPB previously has indicated it considers certain of these businesses to be service providers to actual providers of financial services, and therefore subject to CFPB jurisdiction (as addressed in more detail in a 2022 interpretive rule ).

When is a digital comparison-shopping presentation abusive?

An act is abusive when, among other things, it takes unreasonable advantage of the consumers reasonable reliance on the institution to act in the interests of the consumer.

(For a refresher, check out our April 2023 client alert on the CFPBs abusiveness policy statement.)

As highlighted in the circular, operators of digital comparison-shopping tools may have a higher risk of being accused of engaging in allegedly abusive acts or practices where their stated goal is to help consumers make informed decisions about available financial products and services.

When an operator presents more expensive or less favorable products to consumers based on the operators own financial interests, the CFPB suggests there is risk of abusive conduct.

The CFPB also warns it considers an operator or lead generators ability to gather data as a benefit relevant to its abusive analysis.

The circular further indicates that the CFPB will carefully consider any affirmative (or implicit) representations made by operators to consumers about the nature of their services in evaluating potential abusiveness.

To illustrate its concerns, the CFPB details eight hypothetical abusive presentation models.

A number of the examples merely highlight the practice of promoting a particular product based on financial gain to the operator rather than the consumers interest, particularly when the consumer can identify product features of importance to them."
Cooley,CFPB Warns Digital Marketers About ‘Abusive’ Steering Practices,"However, the CFPB suggests that other presentation features intended to influence consumer choice, such as a dynamic user interface or requiring fewer clicks to access product information, also will be evaluated.

The circular also indicates that steering consumers to certain products to satisfy advertising volume allocations, or using dynamic bidding or a bounty system to determine the presentation of offers to consumers with certain demographic or other characteristics, could be abusive.

Looking ahead This circular is part of the CFPBs multiyear push to target dark patterns in the offering of financial products and services, and to make unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) concepts relevant to todays digital marketplace.

Importantly, one of the reasons the CFPB issues circulars is to promote consistency in approach across enforcement agencies.

To that end, the circular provides guidance specifically directed to other enforcement agencies  including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has aggressively pursued alleged dark patterns, and state attorneys general, all of which are empowered to enforce the CFPBs abusiveness standard (in addition to their independent enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive practices)."

Cooley,USPTO Offers Guidance on Inventorship for AI-Human Collaborations,"As global interest in artificial intelligence reaches a fever pitch, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has entered the conversation.

On February 13, 2024, the USPTO published Inventorship Guidance for AI-Assisted Inventions in the Federal Register, explaining how the USPTO plans to assess inventorship for inventions that were assisted by AI, and soliciting public comment through an ensuing 90-day comment period.

The guidance was prepared in response to the October 2023 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence , which required the USPTO to publish guidance to USPTO patent examiners and applicants addressing inventorship and the use of AI, including generative AI, in the inventive process, including illustrative examples in which AI systems play different roles in inventive processes and how, in each example, inventorship issues ought to be analyzed.

The USPTOs guidance is a reminder that patents serve to incentivize the ingenuity of humans (referred to as natural persons), and thus only humans  not AI  can be inventors.

The guidance qualifies a human as an inventor on an AI-assisted invention if that human provided a significant contribution to the inventions conception.

Although this significant contribution standard has historically been used in  joint inventorship (emphasis added) contexts  for example, where two or more people took part in the inventing  it is nevertheless possible for a human meeting this standard to be the sole inventor of an AI-assisted invention.

The guidance also cautions that the duty to disclose all known information that is material to patentability includes a duty to disclose information related to improper inventorship.

Patent applicants and others associated with prosecuting a patent application have an affirmative duty of disclosure, to disclose to the USPTO any information that is material to patentability.

As incorrect inventorship is a ground of rejection, information about inventorship being incorrect (regardless of whether the invention is AI-assisted or not) is material to patentability and must be disclosed to the USPTO.

So, the USPTO is reminding people that this obligation remains in place, as it is laying out an additional circumstance  human and AI collaborations  in which inventorship must be assessed.

Two hypothetical practical examples  Transaxle for Remote Control Car and Developing a Therapeutic Compound for Treating Cancer  were published on the USPTOs AI-related resources webpage in connection with the release of the guidance.

These examples illustrate guiding principles set forth in the guidance which, while not dispositive on their own, are intended to facilitate inventorship analysis.

Among these guiding principles are acknowledgements that the following may constitute significant contributions to an invention: Designing, building or training an AI system.

Constructing an AI prompt in view of a specific problem to elicit a particular solution.

Performing a successful experiment using an output of an AI system.

It is noted, however, that neither the ownership/oversight of an AI system nor the mere presentation of a problem to an AI system is itself sufficient to constitute a significant contribution to an invention."

Cooley,AI Regulatory Update: National Telecommunications and Information Administration Seeks Comments on Dual-Use Foundation Models,"The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced a request for comment regarding the potential risks and benefits of dual-use foundation models with weights that are widely available.

NTIA also asked for comment on potential regulatory models that could promote the benefits of dual-use foundation models while mitigating any associated risks from these models, or any others that fall outside the primary scope of the request for comment.

NTIAs request was mandated by President Joe Bidens October 30, 2023, executive order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence and regulatory approaches of those models.

The executive order charges NTIA to solicit comments from the private sector, academia, civil society, and other stakeholders through a public consultation process on the potential risks, benefits, other implications, and appropriate policy and regulatory approaches related to dual-use foundation models for which the model weights are widely available.

NTIA will review comments received and then collaborate with the secretaries of commerce and state to prepare a report to the president.

That report likely will provide specific policy and regulatory recommendations pertaining to dual-use foundation models.

In the request for comment, NTIA seeks public input on a number of questions regarding the issues impacting dual-use foundation models, including the following: How should NTIA define open or widely available when thinking about foundation models and model weights?

How do the risks associated with making model weights widely available compare to the risks associated with nonpublic model weights?

What are the benefits of foundation models with model weights that are widely available as compared to fully closed models?

Are there other relevant components of open foundation models that  if simultaneously widely available  would change the risks or benefits presented by widely available model weights?

If so, please list them and explain their impact.

Cooley,CFPB Executes on Promise to Utilize ‘Dormant’ Authority to Supervise High-Risk Nonbanks,"On February 23, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) made public an order establishing supervisory authority over a nonbank installment lender on the basis the institution poses risks to consumers.

The order gives insight into the procedural aspects of the CFPBs exercise of this never-before-used authority  and the standards it might use to assess whether an institution poses risk to consumers, and therefore warrants ongoing supervision.

While the CFPB has a long-standing nonbank supervision program in the mortgage, student lending, and short-term, small-dollar lending space, and can also examine larger participants in certain financial markets (e.g., auto and debt collection), the order sets forth the path for the CFPB to supervise smaller, yet risky, nonbank financial services providers, as well as fintechs offering novel products.

Consumer complaints, product offerings can drive CFPBs supervisory determination Consistent with the CFPBs April 25, 2022, announcement, the CFPBs determination that the installment lender poses risks to consumers was based on a mixture of consumer complaints and the nature of the lenders products, services, and operations.

Specifically, the CFPB said it has reasonable cause for concern based on: The manner in which the lender describes optional insurance products to consumers and incorporates them into loans.

Debt collection practices, including claims of harassment and coercion that jeopardize consumer employment or cause stress.

Accuracy in furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies.

The percentage of existing small-dollar loans that are refinanced with new small-dollar loans.

The CFPBs determination appears to rely heavily upon the content of consumer complaints  reliance the lender cautioned against during the determination proceeding because those complaints may be inaccurate, not credible or contradicted by other evidence.

Interestingly, the CFPB turned this argument against the lender during the proceeding, suggesting this is the very reason supervision is necessary  to learn more about the lenders practice and resolve any factual uncertainty between the conduct alleged in the complaints and reality.

The CFPB also uses the order to criticize the manner in which the lender responds to customer complaints, saying the institutions responses inappropriately disregard the substance of the complaint, offer a conclusory denial of wrongdoing, or describe the relevant facts differently than those presented by the consumer without substantiating evidence.

Designation process took approximately eight months, required at least three submissions by now-supervised lender The order makes clear that the designation process will take up significant institutional resources.

The CFPB issued the lender its official notice of intent to supervise on March 10, 2023  one year after it announced its intent to begin utilizing the authority.

The lender submitted a written response to the notice on April 12, 2023, then made an oral presentation to the CFPB on May 17, 2023.

The CFPB reviewed the file and the lenders briefings, collected additional information  including what appeared to be an in-depth review of consumer complaints  and permitted the lender to file a supplemental briefing on October 16, 2023, even though this is not required under the CFPBs procedures.

CFPB Director Rohit Chopra made his determination the CFPB would subject the lender to supervision on November 30, 2023, although the order, which was lightly redacted, was made public three months after it was issued.

Whats next?

This order serves as a warning to entities not subject to the CFPBs automatic supervisory authority that the CFPB is still monitoring the broader marketplace."
Cooley,CFPB Executes on Promise to Utilize ‘Dormant’ Authority to Supervise High-Risk Nonbanks,"Whats next?

This order serves as a warning to entities not subject to the CFPBs automatic supervisory authority that the CFPB is still monitoring the broader marketplace.

For those in need of a reminder, the CFPB has automatic supervisory authority over institutions engaged in mortgage lending and servicing, private student lending, payday lending, and larger participants involved in consumer reporting, debt collection, student loan servicing, international money transfers, and auto lending.

In November 2023, the CFPB also proposed establishing supervisory authority over digital wallet and payment app providers .

Institutions not subject to the CFPBs supervisory authority must still maintain comprehensive compliance management systems and properly resolve consumer complaints filed with the CFPB, as well as other regulatory agencies."

Cooley,FinCEN Proposes Rule Requiring Investment Advisers to Establish Anti-Money Laundering Programs,"On February 13, 2024, the US Department of the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would expressly include certain investment advisers in the definition of a financial institution under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations, which collectively establish the US anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regime.

The proposal would subject covered investment advisers to AML/CFT requirements  including implementing and maintaining a risk-based AML/CFT program, reporting suspicious activity to FinCEN, and meeting recordkeeping requirements.

FinCEN would have the authority to seek civil penalties for noncompliance.

FinCEN states in the press release that the proposed rule is part of a larger effort by the agency to combat illicit finance risks and add transparency to the US financial systems.

For example, FinCEN recently issued a proposed rule requiring increased reporting around all-cash real estate transactions.

Additionally, FinCENs beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule, which implements the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), took effect on January 1, 2024, requiring nonexempt companies created or registered in the US to submit BOI reports to FinCEN.

According to FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki, the goal of the proposed rule is to prevent criminals and foreign adversaries from exploiting the US financial system through investment advisers, which oversee tens of trillions of dollars.

The proposal revisits the substance of a 2015 notice of proposed rulemaking that similarly would have extended AML/CFT requirements to investment advisers.

The deadline to submit comments on the proposed rule is April 15, 2024.

Which entities are covered?

The proposed rule would revise the definition of a financial institution under the BSAs implementing regulations to include the following two types of investment advisers.

Investment advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also known as registered investment advisers (RIAs).

Investment advisers that report to the SEC as exempt reporting advisers (ERAs).

Under the proposed rule, the definition of an investment adviser would exclude state-registered investment advisers and non-US investment advisers that rely on the foreign private adviser exemption.

While the statutory BSA provisions do not include investment advisers in the definition of a financial institution, FinCEN has the authority to add businesses that engage in any activity similar to, related to, or a substitute for activities in which any of the enumerated financial institutions are authorized to engage.

FinCEN states in the commentary to the proposed rule that the asset management services provided by investment advisers are similar to or a substitute for those offered by other financial institutions already covered under the BSA, including broker-dealers, banks and insurance companies.

The proposed rule AML/CFT requirements The proposed rule would require that covered investment advisers comply with certain AML/CFT requirements, including the following:

1. Implement a risk-based AML/CFT program.

Investment advisers covered by the proposed rule would be required to implement a reasonably designed risk-based AML/CFT program to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism through the institution.

The AML/CFT program requirement would not be a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather the individual investment advisers program would need to be commensurate with the advisers specific risks, services and customer base.

As proposed, the AML/CFT program would be required to include, at a minimum, the following: The development of internal policies, procedures and controls.

The designation of a person or persons responsible for implementing and monitoring the operations and internal controls of the program (e.g., a compliance officer)."
Cooley,FinCEN Proposes Rule Requiring Investment Advisers to Establish Anti-Money Laundering Programs,"The designation of a person or persons responsible for implementing and monitoring the operations and internal controls of the program (e.g., a compliance officer).

Risk-based procedures for ongoing customer due diligence (CDD).

Risk-based procedures to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop customer risk profiles.

An ongoing employee training program.

An independent audit function to test programs.

FinCEN also expects investment advisers to maintain sufficient oversight of third-party service providers.

The proposed rule would require an investment advisers board of directors (or a similar body) to approve the AML/CFT program.

For investment advisers dually categorized as other financial institutions (e.g., banks and broker-dealers), there would be no requirement for separate AML/CFT programs to be established for each line of business.

Rather, in these instances, there should be a comprehensive AML/CFT program that covers all of the entitys business and activities that are subject to BSA requirements.

2. Submit suspicious activity reports (SARs).

Investment advisers would be required to submit SARs, replacing the joint FinCEN/Internal Revenue Service Form 8300 that investment advisers currently use to report suspicious activity.

Reportable suspicious transactions would be those that are conducted or attempted by, at or through an investment adviser and involve or aggregate at least $5,000 in funds or other assets.

Investment advisers would still be required to comply with all other reporting requirements imposed by the SEC.

SARs would be required to be kept confidential and submitted within 30 days of identifying acts that may be the basis of the suspicious activity.

According to the commentary on the proposed rule, identifying suspicious activity would be fact-specific, but could include activities such as potential fraud, manipulation of customer funds directed by the investment adviser, insider trading, market manipulation, transferring funds or assets involving third parties with no plausible relationship to the customer, or unusual wire transfer requests.

3. Recordkeeping and reporting.

Under the proposed rule, investment advisers would be required to comply with existing recordkeeping requirements under the BSA, including the Travel Rule, to the extent applicable.

The Travel Rule (31 CFR 1010.410(e),(f)) requires financial institutions to create and retain records for fund transmittals that equal or exceed $3,000 and include certain information (e.g., senders name and address, transaction information, and senders financial institution) with the transmittal order so that it travels to the next financial institution in the payment chain.

In at least some cases, transactions processed by investment advisers may be excluded from Travel Rule requirements, based on the definition of a covered transmittal of funds and the exemption for transfers between certain financial institutions.

Investment advisers also would be required to create and retain records for extensions of credit and cross-border transfers of currency, monetary instruments, checks, investment securities and credit.

Additionally, under FinCENs regulations, investment advisers are currently required to report transactions involving the receipt of more than $10,000 in cash and negotiable instruments using Form 8300.

Under the proposed rule, investment advisers would still have the obligation to report such transactions, but would be required to submit reports for transactions involving a transfer of more than $10,000 in currency by, through or to the investment adviser, unless subject to an applicable exemption, and submit relevant information using currency transaction reports (CTRs), as required under the BSA, instead of using Form 8300."
Cooley,FinCEN Proposes Rule Requiring Investment Advisers to Establish Anti-Money Laundering Programs,"Other obligations and considerations Investment advisers also would be required to implement risk-based procedures for customer due diligence pursuant to the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rule for covered financial institutions (currently banks, mutual funds, brokers or dealers in securities, futures commission merchants and introducing brokers in commodities).

The CDD Rule requires covered financial institutions to identify and verify the beneficial owners of legal entity customers as part of the covered entitys customer identification program (CIP).

The CDD Rule is currently subject to modification in connection with the recent implementation of the BOI Rule and, therefore, FinCEN is not proposing to impose the same CDD Rule on investment advisers that currently applies to banks and other covered financial institutions.

Instead, FinCEN is taking a partial step toward doing so by including investment advisers in the definition of covered financial institutions under 31 CFR 1010.605(e)(1) for purposes of the CDD Rule.

But, because the applicability of the CDD Rule is predicated on a financial institution having express CIP obligations, the CDD Rule will not  at least initially  be operationalized with respect to investment advisers.

To begin with, therefore, investment advisers would be required to establish AML programs that include risk-based customer due diligence procedures that include, but are not limited to, understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile, as well as conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and  on a risk basis  to maintain and update customer information.

However, the proposed rule would not impose a CIP requirement or, in turn, express requirements to obtain BOI.

FinCEN will instead collaborate with the SEC to develop such CIP and beneficial owner requirements, which also will be informed by future CDD rulemakings under the CTA and its implementing regulations.

Finally, to avoid redundancy under the proposed rule, investment advisers would not be required to apply AML/CFT program or SAR filing requirements to the mutual funds they advise.

Mutual funds are currently included in the definition of a financial institution and therefore have their own similar obligations under the BSA.

SECs examination authority As part of the proposal, FinCEN seeks to delegate examination authority for the rule to the SEC, given the SECs expertise with investment advisers and experience in examining other financial institutions with AML responsibilities and requirements.

FinCEN currently delegates to the SEC the authority to examine mutual funds, as well as brokers and dealers in securities, for compliance with the BSA.

Still, FinCEN retains its rulemaking and enforcement authorities in its administration of AML/CFT rules and requirements applicable to investment advisers.

Next steps Under the proposed rule, covered investment advisers would be required to comply with the rule on or before 12 months from the final rules effective date.

Investment advisers should review the rule to assess the potential impact and may wish to consider providing comments to FinCEN by the April 15 deadline."
Cooley,"New FCC Rules Limit When You Can Send Commercial Calls, Texts","As part of its long-standing effort to give consumers tools to limit unwanted commercial calls and texts, the Federal Communications Commission has adopted an order that clarifies the obligations of calling parties when consumers seek to opt out of receiving calls under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.

Process for opting out Under the order, these new requirements will apply to requests to revoke consent for calls and texts: A calling party that initiates calls and texts must honor any request made using an automated, interactive voice or key press-activated opt-out mechanism offered during a call.

If a called party replies to a text with a message that includes stop, quit, end, revoke, opt out, cancel or unsubscribe, the reply must be treated as a revocation of consent for future messages.

Even if a reply to a text does not use any of the specified words, the calling party must treat the called partys reply as revoking consent for future messages if a reasonable person would understand the called partys words to have conveyed a request to revoke consent.

If a text is sent via a mechanism that does not permit replies, the text must include a statement explaining that replies are not permitted for technical reasons, along with a clear and conspicuous description of reasonable alternative ways to revoke consent.

Any calling party must honor a valid request to revoke consent no later than 10 business days after the request is made.

Revoking consent for voice calls also revokes consent for texts and vice versa.

A calling party may not limit the ways that consumers can revoke consent to those listed in the rules, but instead must accept any reasonable method that a consumer chooses to use, including voicemail or email to any telephone number or address at which the consumer can reasonably expect to reach the caller, even if using that number or address has not been designated as a way to revoke consent.

The order establishes specific criteria that the FCC will use in determining whether a valid request was made, which will be evaluated based on the totality of evidence.

A calling party that sends text messages still is permitted to send a single text following the revocation request to acknowledge the request has been received.

Acknowledgments sent within five minutes of a request will be presumed to fall within the consumers previous consent, but the calling party must demonstrate why the delay was reasonable if the acknowledgment takes longer than that.

Other opt-out issues The FCCs order clarifies that consumers whose numbers are on the National Do Not Call Registry but have consented to calls from specific companies can revoke their consent.

In addition, the order concludes that consumers can revoke their consent to receive informational calls or texts, such as balance alerts from banks or notifications from delivery companies.

The order also clarifies that revocation of consent for calls or messages that require consent does not revoke consent for other calls or messages.

Consequently, if a consumer has consented to receive marketing messages from a caller but also receives informational messages that do not require consent, such as delivery notifications, revoking consent for the marketing messages will not revoke consent for the informational messages.

However, if a consumer revokes consent for informational messages, that revocation must be treated as also revoking consent for marketing calls.

In addition, if a consumer is receiving multiple types of informational messages from a single party, the FCC will permit the calling party to send a single text requesting clarification of whether the consumer meant to revoke consent for all or some of those messages, instead of an acknowledgment text.

These messages may not contain any marketing or promotional content.

If the consumer does not reply to the text, the calling party must treat the revocation of consent as covering all types of messages."
Cooley,"New FCC Rules Limit When You Can Send Commercial Calls, Texts","If the consumer does not reply to the text, the calling party must treat the revocation of consent as covering all types of messages.

This exception applies only to informational messages.

Implementation These rules will go into effect six months after the federal Office of Management and Budget has completed its review under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

This process typically takes six months to a year, and it cannot begin until the order is published in the Federal Register, which likely will occur in March 2024.

After the review is complete, the FCC will issue a public notice announcing the effective date of the rules."
Cooley,"FCC Proposes New Regulatory Framework for In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing Operations","In its latest effort to promote the commercial space industry, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) introducing a potential framework for licensing commercial in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing (ISAM) operations.

The NPRM aligns with the White Houses ISAM National Strategy released in April 2022 and the FCCs ISAM notice of inquiry released in August 2022.

The FCC asks for comment on proposed rules that ISAM industry participants would have to follow to obtain licenses.

To begin, the proposed rules define an ISAM space station as: A space station which has the primary purpose of conducting in-space servicing, assembly, and/or manufacturing activities used on-orbit, on the surface of celestial bodies, and/or in transit between these regimes and which are supported by radiofrequency operations.

Servicing activities include but are not limited to in-space inspection, life extension, repair, refueling, alteration, and orbital transfer of a client space object, including collection and removal of debris on orbit.

Assembly activities involve the construction of space systems in space using pre-manufactured components.

Manufacturing activities involve the transformation of raw or recycled materials into components, products, or infrastructure in space.

The proposed rules do not define the primary purpose of conducting ISAM activities, but the FCC asks whether it should define the phrase.

The proposal provides two potential application authorization paths for ISAM space stations  the regular part 25 licensing process or the streamlined processes for small satellites and small spacecraft.

Licensing modification for space stations affected by ISAM operations The proposed rules would require ISAM space station applicants to submit comprehensive proposals, so that the FCC can evaluate the impact of the ISAM operations, such as changes in orbital locations or orbital extensions, on other space stations authorized by the US or other nations.

The NPRM also proposes allowing ISAM space station operators to apply for US authorizations or grants of US market access.

If the proposed rules are approved, ISAM space station applicants must provide the following information in order to determine whether a license modification for any affected space station is necessary: For US-licensed operators, a list of FCC file numbers or call signs for any applications or FCC grants related to the proposed operations, including those of client space stations with which the applicant will seek to work or collaborate with in its operations.

For operators licensed outside the US, a list of the International Telecommunications Union filings and United Nations registration information for any space stations not licensed or granted market access by the US that are related to the proposed operations, the regulatory requirements that the operator and partners are subject to, and the status of any required regulatory approvals.

Exemption from processing rounds and first-come-first-served process In an effort to provide flexibility, the FCC proposes to exempt ISAM space station authorization applicants from the processing round rules for non-geostationary orbit space stations and the first-come-first-served process for geostationary orbit space stations, which is how most satellite licensing currently operates.

To obtain the exemption, the proposed new rules require ISAM space stations to submit a narrative description demonstrating spectrum-sharing capabilities, noting that operations will not materially constrain other ISAM operations in the requested frequency band.

The proposed new rules also require the exemption applicants to certify that they will be compatible with and will not constrain operations of future space stations."
Cooley,"FCC Proposes New Regulatory Framework for In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing Operations","The proposed new rules also require the exemption applicants to certify that they will be compatible with and will not constrain operations of future space stations.

Surety bonds ISAM operators would not be required to post surety bonds after licensing unless they do not meet the FCCs milestone requirements within the first year after license grant.

ISAM spectrum needs addressed individually Despite requests from the ISAM industry, the FCC did not propose a new spectrum allocation for ISAM operations.

However, the FCC seeks comment on its proposal to require frequency use authorization on a case-by-case basis, which would ensure that operations would be nonexclusive and could not cause interference to incumbent operators.

Orbital debris regulation The NPRM also proposes requiring ISAM space station operators to conduct debris remediation, comply with the current orbital debris mitigation rules applicable to non-ISAM operators and submit orbital debris mitigation plans on a case-by-case basis.

However, the FCC also asks whether ISAM operators should be required to undertake additional debris remediation to further minimize the risk of harm.

Comments and reply comments for the NPRM will be due 45 and 75 days, respectively, after publication in the Federal Register.

FCC Space Bureau staff is interested in hearing from any company that plans to engage in ISAM operations, and we encourage any such company to contact one of the Cooley lawyers listed below to determine how best to communicate its message to the FCC."
Cooley,"Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation Targeting Foreign Biotechnology Companies of Concern May Impact Recipients of Government Funding, Contracts","On January 25, 2024, bipartisan members of the US House of Representatives introduced legislation  the BIOSECURE Act  aimed at preventing certain foreign biotechnology firms deemed to present threats to US national security interests from obtaining US government funding and imposing related US government contracting restrictions (see House Bill 7085 ).

A substantively identical bipartisan bill also was introduced in the US Senate ( Senate Bill 3558 ).

Together, the House and Senate bills are related to ongoing congressional concerns, as well as an investigation by the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, which focuses on possible access by certain Chinese companies to American citizens genetic information and other sensitive health data.

As currently drafted, the BIOSECURE Act would prohibit federal agencies from contracting with the following: BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute), MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi Apptec, and any subsidiary, parent affiliate, or successor of such entities; or Any entity from China, Russia, Iran or North Korea designated on a list published by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Commerce, Director of National Intelligence, Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State (each of the foregoing a Biotechnology Company of Concern ).

Notably, the BIOSECURE Act also seeks to prohibit the US government from entering into, extending or renewing a contract with any entity that uses biotechnology equipment originating from  or services provided by  a Biotechnology Company of Concern.

This may cause companies receiving government funding to terminate the use of biotechnology equipment or receipt of services linked to a Biotechnology Company of Concern.

Preliminarily, biotechnology equipment is defined broadly to include equipment, instruments, apparatus machines or devices (including components and accessories thereof) designed for use in research, development, production or analysis of biological materials.

Examples of biotechnology equipment include genetic sequencers, mass spectrometers, polymerase chain reaction machines, and software, firmware, or other digital components specifically designed for use in  and necessary to operate  such equipment.

Biotechnology services are defined broadly to include any service for the research, development, production, analysis, detection or provision of information, including data storage and transmission related to biological materials.

Biotechnology services include advising, consulting or support services for the use or implementation of any biotechnology equipment and genealogical information.

Additional biotechnology equipment or services may be added to the scope.

Although the current House and Senate bills remain in the early stages of the legislative process, bipartisan support and textual similarities may increase the likelihood that some version of the bills may become law.

In anticipation thereof, life sciences companies should consider assessing the scope of their existing or contemplated federal contracts (including subcontractor arrangements with federal government contractors), understanding and possibly revising relevant termination provisions, and evaluating their equipment inventories and other activities relating to Biotechnology Companies of Concern.

Cooley will continue to monitor the progress of the House and Senate bills.

Cooley,FCC: AI-Generated Robocalls Illegal Under the TCPA,"In a unanimous, bipartisan decision, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a declaratory ruling to confirm that artificial intelligence-generated voices are artificial under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).

The FCCs decision comes on the heels of an FCC cease-and-desist letter issued to a company that originated robocalls to New Hampshire presidential primary voters using an AI-generated voice that sounded like President Joe Biden, and just a week after FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel issued a press release saying she had proposed to make AI voice-generated robocalls illegal.

FCCs AI inquiry The TCPA protects consumers from unwanted calls made using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party unless an exemption applies.

Recognizing that AI could be used to protect against or make illegal calls, the FCC opened an inquiry in November 2023 on how AI technologies impact the TCPA regulatory regime.

The FCC did not propose specific rules, but rather asked for general comment on the benefits and risks associated with AI technologies, including voice cloning, in the TCPA space.

Numerous parties filed comments in response to the FCCs inquiry, including on the issue of using AI technologies to simulate a human voice.

Commenters urged the FCC to confirm that AI technologies such as voice cloning fall within the TCPAs existing prohibition on artificial or prerecorded voice messages.

New Hampshire robocalls As was widely reported in the general press, a few days before the New Hampshire presidential primary, New Hampshire voters received recorded calls telling them not to cast their ballots.

The calls used a voice crafted to sound like Biden.

In addition to using an imitation of Bidens voice, the calls also used a spoofed telephone number to falsely suggest the call was sent out by a former chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.

The FCC, in coordination with New Hampshires attorney general and telecom industry trade groups, traced the calls back to Lingo Telecom and identified the party that allegedly initiated the calls.

Following its usual procedures, the FCC issued a cease-and-desist letter directing Lingo to stop carrying illegal traffic and alerted other telecom providers that they could lawfully block Lingos voice traffic if Lingo did not effectively mitigate its illegal traffic within 48 hours.

Because the spoofed telephone number was sufficient to deem the calls illegal, the FCC did not have to specifically address whether the use of an artificial voice in a call made for political purposes also was illegal, or whether it was permissible under a TCPA exemption.

Declaratory ruling The FCC typically cannot adopt new rules without going through a notice and comment rulemaking proceeding.

The FCC can, however, issue a declaratory ruling to issue guidance and clarify its existing rules.

Here, the FCCs November 2023 AI inquiry was not a notice of proposed rulemaking, so it could not be the basis for the FCC to adopt new rules.

Accordingly, while the FCC cited the November AI inquiry and the comments urging the FCC to find that AI-generated voices are artificial under the TCPA, the declaratory ruling stated that it was clarifying and confirming that current TCPA rules apply to AI technologies  it was not formulating new rules.

While the declaratory ruling itself does not reference the New Hampshire Biden robocalls, FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks discussed the calls in his concurring statement .

As the FCC was merely clarifying and confirming existing rules, the declaratory ruling is effective immediately.

Next steps Most parties agree with the FCC that the declaratory ruling did not change or expand the TCPA rules, as the use of AI voice cloning is just another means of simulating a human voice."
Cooley,FCC: AI-Generated Robocalls Illegal Under the TCPA,"Next steps Most parties agree with the FCC that the declaratory ruling did not change or expand the TCPA rules, as the use of AI voice cloning is just another means of simulating a human voice.

Further, because of the many exemptions under the TCPA, such as exemptions when calls are made for noncommercial purposes, it is not clear that the declaratory ruling will provide a basis to stop bad actors from spoofing voices in the context of a political campaign.

Parties should, however, take the FCCs actions as an indication of its concern about the use of AI to create or send robocalls.

Accordingly, any use of artificial voice technology to create telephone messages, or any calls made using a prerecorded human voice, should be reviewed by counsel."
Cooley,FFIEC to Lenders: Appraisal Bias Compliance Management in Focus,"On February 12, 2024, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued a concise statement on Examination Principles Related to Valuation Discrimination and Bias in Residential Lending .

Although the document is styled as a statement of principles, it sets forth a compliance management framework for which banks, credit unions and mortgage lenders will be examined as to their oversight of appraisals and property valuations.

The statement further indicates that evidence of valuation discrimination or bias may negatively affect an institutions safety and soundness, which will be reflected in examination ratings.

While the statement references appraiser independence requirements  which were established, in large part, due to concerns about risks in inflated appraisals and overvaluation post-financial crisis  its discussion of risk is tied exclusively to undervaluation, discrimination and bias, with the focus on lack of access to credit, credit offered on less favorable terms or steering to a narrower product offering.

According to the statement, lenders will have to apply the typical compliance management system framework to assessing and evaluating risk of discrimination in appraisal practices.

This includes: Policies and procedures designed to identify potentially discriminatory valuation practices or valuation results.

Training aimed at helping employees identify potential discrimination in lending and valuation programs.

Monitoring and testing to identify and address potential valuation-related discrimination.

Consumer complaint handling practices to address, track and monitor complaints  including, according to the statement, complaints via letter, phone call, in person, regulator, third-party service provider, email and social media.

A third-party risk management function facilitating both an upfront and ongoing assessment of processes and compliance with anti-discrimination laws for vendors that prepare valuation reports, appraisers and appraisal management companies.

The statement also indicates examiners will assess whether the board of directors and management are devoting sufficient resources to implementing, maintaining and overseeing the compliance management system as it pertains to real estate valuations.

Whats next?

The FFIEC statement is the most recent step in the federal regulators comprehensive initiative to address concerns of appraisal bias in residential lending and follows the June 2023 interagency proposal on quality control standards for automated valuation models and research by the Federal Housing Finance Agency regarding whether homes are more likely to be
underappraised in minority communities.

Interestingly, the statement appears to adopt the view that lenders can be held liable for relying upon discriminatory appraisals conducted by third parties under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.

The statement also indicates that discriminatory appraisal practices also may constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP), presumably notwithstanding the recent federal district court decision striking down the CFPBs proposed application of UDAAP principles to alleged discriminatory lending practices .

Given the growing regulatory interest in this space  this statement being only the most recent example  lenders should ensure that their compliance management systems and fair lending programs are operating as intended, including with an eye toward the evolving regulatory expectations in appraisal valuations."
Cooley,Inundated With Requests Under New Jersey’s Daniel’s Law?,"A flood of class action lawsuits have been filed against companies alleging violations of New Jerseys Daniels Law .

The statute  enacted after the son of a New Jersey federal judge was fatally shot by a disgruntled lawyer  is designed to protect judicial officials, law enforcement officers, child protective investigators and their immediate family members (described in the statute as covered persons) from the unauthorized disclosure of certain personal information.  

Over the past few days, plaintiffs attorneys have filed more than 100 complaints in New Jersey state court on behalf of covered persons, asserting that the defendant companies failed to fulfill nondisclosure requests made by the plaintiffs.

Defendants in these cases have received up to 20,000 nondisclosure requests from allegedly covered persons (who ostensibly have assigned their claims to Atlas Data Privacy Corporation, a named plaintiff).

Under the New Jersey law, companies that disclose on the internet or otherwise make available the home addresses or unpublished telephone numbers of covered persons are required to cease making such disclosures within 10 business days after receiving notice from a covered person or their authorized agent.

Although the law originally gave courts discretion in awarding actual damages or $1,000 in liquidated damages, under a 2023 amendment, New Jersey courts are required to award actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $1,000 for each violation of the law.

The plaintiffs in these suits are seeking substantial damages  the greater of actual damages or $1,000 in statutory liquidated damages per violation per defendant  as well as punitive damages for alleged willful or reckless violation of the law and attorney fees.

As such, potential exposure (assuming 20,000 violations  one per covered person) is at least $20 million plus punitive damages and attorney fees.

If your company has received nondisclosure requests (like the one below), we recommend the following steps that can help you ascertain and mitigate your risk: Look for deletion requests related to Daniels Law.

The plaintiffs have largely been using the same template language.

Here is a sample: Entities receiving these requests have 10 business days to satisfy them after receiving notice from the covered person or their agent.

As such, if you are still within the 10-business day time frame, we recommend taking steps to locate the covered person making the request and delete their information from your systems (and any systems of third-party service providers with whom you work).

Ideally, you also would want to ensure that the covered persons home address and/or unpublished telephone number is no longer made available on or through your services, such as deleting the data or suppressing these data fields within your systems to the extent technically feasible.

Continue to monitor for Daniels Law requests on a going-forward basis and respond to such requests within 10 business days.

If you think your company stores and/or makes available data about covered persons, please reach out to a member of the c/d/p team to discuss."
Cooley,EU Product Liability Reforms Represent a Major Shakeup,"Editor's note: Authored by Anushi Amin and Edward Turtle, this article was originally published in Law360 .

On Dec. 14, 2023, theEuropean UnionParliament and Council reached provisional agreement on the text for a new product liability regime in Europe.

The provisionally agreed text was published on Jan. 25.

The reforms represent a major shakeup, fully revising the EU's existing strict liability  no fault  regime under the Product Liability Directive for the first time in nearly 40 years.[1]

They will expand the scope of claims that can be brought, the range of damages that can be recovered and make it easier for consumers to prove their claims.

The reforms are driven by a concern that the EU's existing product liability regime was becoming outdated and not fit for purpose in the digital world, including in the context of risks posed by connected products, artificial intelligence, the circular economy and e-commerce.

While the remit for reform was fairly narrow, the changes agreed are broad and affect all product sectors.

Background The existing directive established a strict liability regime for product liability claims in the EU.

It was adopted in the 1980s, in the wake of high-profile cases such as Thalidomide, with the intention of making it easier for consumers to recover for damage caused by defective products.

As liability is strict, producers are responsible for defective products, regardless of whether the defect is their fault.

Claimants just need to show that: A product was defective; They suffered damage; and There was a causal link between the defect in the product and the damage they suffered.

As there is no need to establish fault, proving that a product was defective is usually the biggest hurdle to bringing a claim under the directive.

In a number of recent cases under the directive, claimants have failed to overcome this hurdle.

The revisions to the directive are likely to alter this trend and make it much easier for claimants to establish a defect in future cases.

Reforms to Product Liability Framework Key reforms include steps to: Expand the scope of claims, e.g., to cover not only hardware but also stand-alone software and AI systems for the first time; Expand the damages that can be recovered, e.g., to include destruction or corruption of data and medically recognized harm to psychological health; and Ease the burden of proof for claimantsby introducing presumptions of defect in certain circumstances and creating a new disclosure mechanism, similar to U.S. discovery.

This will be completely new in some EU jurisdictions, e.g., Germany, which have no existing mechanism.

The reforms also have implications for product safety and cybersecurity issues, including how long software updates should be provided to avoid potential liability.

The following summary provides a more detailed overview of the key reforms.

Expanded Scope of Application Definition of ""Product"" Under the revised directive, the definition of ""product"" will include software and digital manufacturing files.

Software includes operating systems, firmware, computer programs, applications, or AI systems, irrespective of whether the software is stand-alone or embedded in other products, with limited exceptions for certain free and open-source software developed or supplied outside of commercial activity.

The definition also extends to certain digital manufacturing files and product-related services that are integrated into, or interconnected with, a product, e.g., a voice assistant service that allows control of one or more products using voice commands.

Concept of Defect This will also be expanded to introduce strict liability for defects from software updates, AI and machine learning, among others.

Under the revised rules, a product may also be rendered defective on account of any cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including where the producer fails to issue software updates necessary to address these vulnerabilities."
Cooley,EU Product Liability Reforms Represent a Major Shakeup,"New Test for Defect Under existing rules, a product is considered defective if it does not provide the level of safety that a person is entitled to expect, taking all the circumstances into account.

In a significant change to this test, amendments introduced by Parliament and agreed during the three-way negotiations add an alternative basis for a product to be considered defective where the product does not provide the safety required under EU or national law.

Range of Economic Operators The range of economic operators that can be held liable for defective products has been expanded to include authorized representatives, fulfillment service providers and online platforms, in certain circumstances.

The intention of these changes is to ensure that there will always be an EU-based business that can be held liable for damages caused by a defective product.

According to the council's press release, this will ""strengthen the level-playing field between EU and non-EU manufacturers.

""[2] Further, in an effort to reflect the nature of the circular economy, those who substantially modify a product outside of the original manufacturer's control and make it available on the market or put it back into service will be considered the manufacturer of the modified product and can be held liable under the revised rules where the modification makes the product defective.

Expanded Scope of Recoverable Damages

The definition of ""damage"" under the revised directive will be extended to include medically recognized damage to psychological health as well as destruction or corruption of data.

At the same time, the reforms also remove minimum thresholds and maximum limits for compensation claims.

The impact of this change, particularly when combined with the introduction of the EU's new class actions mechanism, is likely be to a significant risk of mass claims for relatively trivial claims of data destruction or corruption.

Easier Burden of Proof To make it easier for claimants to succeed in their claims, the reforms reverse the burden of proof in certain circumstances, so claimants no longer need to prove elements of their case.

In particular, the revised regime introduces circumstances in which defect or causation can be presumed.

Two of these circumstances are: Where there is noncompliance with relevant EU product safety regulations; and If it is excessively difficult on account of the technical or scientific complexityof a product for a claimant to prove either that A product is defective; or There is acausal connection between the defect and the damage.

The recitals of the provisionally agreed text suggest that examples of products to which this could apply include medical devices and products that use AI technologies.

Extension of Claims Period Where symptoms are slow to emerge, the claims period is extended from 10 years following placement of the product on the market under the existing rules  the so-called long stop  to 25 years in certain cases.

For producers of certain products, particularly medicinal products and medical devices, this very long exposure period will significantly increase liability risks.

New Requirements for Discovery The revised directive provides for disclosure of necessary and proportionate evidence to both claimants and defendants during proceedings to correct any asymmetry of information between the parties.

As many EU countries have limited or no disclosure mechanisms under their national laws, this will be an important tool for claimant law firms seeking to make out their case.

It will also increase the importance for stakeholders to ensure that they are fully compliant from a regulatory perspective, and have appropriate document and internal communications procedures in place.

Next Steps The text of the provisional agreement will be formally approved by the full European Parliament at plenary, tentatively scheduled for April 10, and then by the council."
Cooley,EU Product Liability Reforms Represent a Major Shakeup,"Next Steps The text of the provisional agreement will be formally approved by the full European Parliament at plenary, tentatively scheduled for April 10, and then by the council.

Following this, it will be signed and published in the Official Journal of the EU and enter into force 20 days later.

A 24-month transition period has been agreed  meaning the laws look set to enter into force in the first half of 2024 and will start applying from 2026.

Looking to the Future A new, more claimant-friendly product liability regime in Europe has the potential to significantly change the risk of doing business in the EU.

Moreover, the reforms sit alongside parallel policy initiatives  such as the EU's class action mechanism, proposals for new AI regulation and liability rules, the circular economy and cybersecurity.

Taken together, these reforms are a fundamental shift in the European risk landscape.

Cooley,"Q4 2023 Venture Financing Report – Invested Capital Decreases Across All Stages of Financing, With Largest Decreases in Late-Stage Rounds; Percentage of Up Rounds Remains Below 70% of Deals","Cooley handled 195 reported venture capital financings in Q4 2023, representing $4.2 billion of invested capital, a decrease from 228 reported financings and $6.9 billion of invested capital in Q3 2023.

This ends the upward trend we witnessed over the past two quarters in both invested capital and deal volume and represents the lowest invested capital and deal volume since Q1 2017.

In Q4 2023, deal volume decreased across all stages of financing  except for Series C, which had a slight uptick from 13 reported deals in Q3 2023 to 18 reported deals in Q4 2023.

Series A deals had the largest decrease in deal totals, which declined from 84 deals in Q3 2023 to 63 deals in Q4 2023.

All stages of financing demonstrated decreased invested capital, with the biggest decrease noted in Series D and later rounds  decreasing from $2.2 billion of invested capital in Q3 2023 to only $451.7 million of invested capital in Q4 2023.

Median pre-money valuations decreased for most stages of financing, with only Series A and Series B rounds seeing increases  though the increase for Series A was slight.

Series C median pre-money valuations decreased to the lowest Series C median since Q3 2020.

While Series D and later rounds saw the largest decrease in median pre-money valuations, pre-money valuations greater than $100 million (at all stages) increased to 27% of deals, as compared with 24% of deals in Q3 2023.

The percentage of down and flat rounds remained relatively high during Q4 2023, with down rounds representing 25% of deals for the quarter and flat rounds representing 7%.

Except in Q3 2023, down rounds have not exceeded 25% of deals for the quarter in any quarter in the history of this report, and the percentage of flat rounds has been at 5% or below for most quarters.

The percentage of deals representing up rounds increased slightly to 68% in Q4 2023, but remains low  with Q3 and Q4 2023 representing the only two quarters in this reports history when the percentage of up rounds was below 70%.

Other (nonvaluation) deal terms in Q4 2023 remained generally favorable to companies.

After rising to 7% of reported deals in Q3 2023, the percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision decreased to 4.6% of deals in Q4 2023.

The percentage of deals with non-participating preferred stock remained high at 95% of deals for Q4 2023.

In contrast to these two favorable trends for companies, the percentage of deals with a recapitalization increased slightly in Q4 2023 to 2.6% of deals.

Before Q2 2023, the percentage of deals involving a recapitalization had not risen above 2.5% of deals since Q4 2014.

In PitchBooks Q3 2023 Global League Tables , Cooley was again named the #1 law firm in the US and globally for representation of companies in venture capital financings, as well as the second most active law firm in the US and globally for representation of investors in venture capital financings.

In addition, Cooley ranked as the most active law firm in venture financing deals in the industry sectors of pharma and biotech and consumer goods and services.

Spotlight on technology The downward trend in deal volume and invested capital continued in Q4 2023 for tech company venture financings.

In Q4 2023, Cooley handled 109 reported tech company financings, representing $1.9 billion of invested capital.

This represents the lowest deal volume for tech companies since Q3 2018, when Cooley handled 113 reported deals, and the lowest amount raised since Q1 2017.

Consistent with the numbers for financings across all combined industries, the deal count and invested capital for tech company venture financings were down significantly compared to one year ago, when Cooley handled 184 reported venture financing deals for tech companies, representing $4.7 billion of invested capital."
Cooley,"Q4 2023 Venture Financing Report – Invested Capital Decreases Across All Stages of Financing, With Largest Decreases in Late-Stage Rounds; Percentage of Up Rounds Remains Below 70% of Deals","The average reported deal size of venture financings for tech companies was just under $17.8 million in Q4 2023, which is the lowest average deal size for tech company venture financings since Q1 2018.

Spotlight on life sciences In Q4 2023, Cooley handled 47 reported venture financings of life sciences companies, representing $1.4 billion of invested capital.

The deal count remained about the same compared to last quarter, but invested capital decreased from $2.3 billion.

Reported deal sizes for venture financings of life sciences companies also decreased in Q4 2023 to an average deal size of $30 million, compared with $48.9 million in Q3 2023.

The number of venture financing deals for life sciences companies also was down compared to one year ago  in Q4 2022  when Cooley handled 61 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies.

However, despite the decrease in deal count, the invested capital and average deal size increased compared to one year ago, when invested capital was just more than $1.3 billion and the average deal size was $21.2 million.

The percentage of life sciences venture financings structured in tranches decreased in Q4 2023 to 23%  down from the 46% high of tranche-structured reported financings for life sciences companies seen in Q3 2023."
Cooley,"FCC Digital Discrimination Rules Will Affect Landlords, Building Owners, Contractors","Having access to reliable broadband internet service has become critical as consumers and small businesses rely on the internet for everyday tasks.

To help meet that need, Congress, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adopt rules to facilitate equal access to broadband internet services.

In response, the FCC has adopted sweeping new rules intended to identify instances of digital discrimination by any party that provides or facilitates access to broadband internet services to consumers or small businesses.

As drafted, these new rules apply to internet service providers  as well as building owners, contractors, infrastructure owners and landlords  to the extent that they affect consumer or small business access to broadband internet service (all of which the FCC references as covered entities).

The majority of the new rules will become effective on March 22, 2024, and FCC enforcement actions are expected to begin approximately six months later.

Digital discrimination is defined as providing certain customers or prospective customers differing access to broadband internet service based on certain personal characteristics.

While pricing disparities are one factor under the rules, speeds of service and availability also are significant considerations in the FCCs analysis of whether discrimination is occurring, and so the availability of broadband service from a landlord in one location and the unavailability of that service in another could trigger an FCC investigation.

Accordingly, a landlord or building owners offer of broadband facilities or services to some tenants but not others (even if the tenants are in different buildings), or offering those services on different terms, could violate the new rules.

The new rules, therefore, greatly expand the FCCs current rules that govern telecommunications access in multiple-tenant environments .

At least eight appeals of the FCCs orders have been filed in six federal appellate courts asking to vacate all or part of the FCCs digital discrimination rules.

However, none of those cases appear to include a request for the courts to stay  or delay implementation of  the FCCs order, so the new rules will still take effect.

While the courts may overturn aspects of the new rules, covered entities  including building owners  should evaluate how their policies, practices and existing broadband internet service infrastructure will be affected by the new rules, and then consider next steps, including whether to seek advisory opinions as discussed further below.

Overview of the new rules Broadly speaking, digital discrimination includes policies, practices or actions that disadvantage disfavored communities access to broadband.

The rules define digital discrimination of access as: Policies or practices, not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility, that (1) differentially impact consumers access to broadband internet access service based on their income level, race, ethnicity, color religion, or national origin, or (2) are intended to have such differential impact.

The rules cover individuals, groups of persons, organizations and businesses that are current or prospective subscribers of broadband internet access service.

The rules do not cover other types of broadband service  such as business data service or enterprise customer purchases.

Residential consumers and small businesses that are current or prospective subscribers to broadband internet access service are specifically covered by the new rules.

This definition covers both intentional discrimination, known as disparate treatment, and also acts that result in discrimination, even if there was no discriminatory intent, known as disparate impact."
Cooley,"FCC Digital Discrimination Rules Will Affect Landlords, Building Owners, Contractors","A determination that a covered entity engaged in intentional discrimination will lead to a finding of liability in most cases, as the FCC does not expect the discriminatory conduct will be justified on technical or economic infeasibility grounds.

For disparate impact claims, a statistical disparity alone will not establish liability.

Instead, claimants must show that a challenged policy or practice is causing the disparity.

Liability will be imposed only if the covered entity fails to prove that the challenged policy or practice is justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility.

The FCC did not establish feasibility presumptions or safe harbors, preferring to adopt a case-by-case approach.

Covered entities will have the burden of proof and will need to show that less discriminatory alternatives to the challenged policy or practice were not available due to genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility.

Once the FCC begins an enforcement inquiry on digital discrimination, the target will need to prove there were no actions it could have reasonably taken to prevent the disparate outcome.

Covered elements of service The rules cover all significant service quality metrics and all terms and conditions of service for broadband service.

The FCCs list includes, but is not limited to: pricing, technical terms and conditions of service  such as speed, capacity, latency and data caps, network infrastructure deployment (that is, availability of broadband in a particular area or differences in the speeds available in different places), network reliability, network upgrade, network maintenance, customer-premises equipment, installation, contractual terms, mandatory arbitration clauses, deposits, discounts, customer service, language options, credit checks, marketing or advertising, contract renewal, upgrades, account termination, and service suspension.

Enforcement The FCC will establish a new portal for consumers and organizations to submit digital discrimination complaints.

The FCC also can initiate formal enforcement reviews on its own based on any available information.

When conducting an investigation, the FCC will review documentation submitted by the entity under investigation, as well as publicly available materials.

The FCC also may ask for interviews and depositions of relevant personnel and could conduct audits.

Existing civil rights standards will be applied to determine liability, although exactly how the FCC will apply the standards remains to be seen.

Advisory opinions Recognizing that parties will have numerous questions about how the new rules will apply to existing policies and practices, the FCC will allow any covered entity to request an advisory opinion regarding the permissibility of its own policies and practices.

The FCC will not entertain requests for advisory opinions on hypothetical scenarios, and it may decline to issue an advisory opinion.

If a policy or practice currently in effect is found to violate the new rules, the affected party likely will be spared from enforcement action if the policy or practice is promptly corrected.

The FCC did not establish limits on the types of issues for which a covered entity can request an advisory opinion."
Cooley,How 2 CFPB Advisory Opinions Affect Reporting Agencies,"Editor's note: Authored by Joshua Kotin, Jessica Pollet and Margaux Curie, this article was originally published in Law360 .

On Jan. 11, theConsumer Financial Protection Bureauissued two advisory opinions addressing consumer reporting agencies' obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act related to information included in background check reports and consumer file disclosures.

The advisory opinions expand on a coordinated federal agency effort, initiated by the White House's January 2023 Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights,[1] and led, in part, by the CFPB, to ensure that the ""background screening industry adheres to the law"" and ""tenant screening companies do not illegally disseminate false and misleading information about tenants and that tenants can challenge erroneous information.""

The White Houseissued further measures in July 2023,[2] which included agency guidance communicating the Biden administration's ""expectations on informing renters of what information in their screening report is responsible for their application being denied.""

The advisory opinions, along with the accompanying press release,[3] also represent one more step toward the bureau's broad goal of ensuring that ""the consumer reporting system produces accurate and reliable information and does not keep people from accessing their personal data.""

Background Screening The first advisory opinion[4] solidifies the CFPB's position that, to comply with the FCRA's general requirement that consumer reporting agencies follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy, consumer reporting agencies furnishing background screening reports must have procedures in place to:

Prevent reporting information that is duplicative or that has otherwise been expunged, sealed or is legally restricted from public access; and Include any existing disposition information if it reports arrests, criminal charges, eviction proceedings or other court filings.

To the extent that adverse information is included in consumer reports, the opinion outlines when the reporting period for adverse items begins, and how subsequent events, such as the disposition of a criminal matter, affect how the item should be reported.

The advisory opinion is particularly focused on the use of background screening reports for tenant and employment screening, even though such reports may be used in a variety of contexts.

In the tenant screening context, the bureau highlights that the consequences of inaccurate reporting may preclude consumers from securing housing or may result in consumers paying more for housing than they otherwise would have.

In the employment context, the CFPB cites consequences such as inappropriate rejection of job applications, failure to obtain promotions or termination.

The opinion also reemphasizes the CFPB's commitment to working with other agencies to address the potential ill effects of inaccuracies in tenant and employment screening reports.

In November 2022, for example, the CFPB published two reports highlighting issues with tenant background checks and, in doing so, noted that it ""works closely with theFederal Trade Commission(FTC) to hold the tenant screening industry accountable.

""[5]

Further, in February 2023, the CFPB and the FTC jointly issued a request for information[6] aimed at gathering information on use of tenant screening reports.

Also notable is last year's announcement of an information sharing agreement between the CFPB and theNational Labor Relations Boardwith the goal of ""protecting American workers in labor and financial markets.

""[7]

Although the immediate focus of the agreement was on employer-driven debt and employer surveillance and sale of data, the CFPB also may leverage this agreement to scrutinize information included in background check reports and utilized by employers, including how such information affectsconsumers.

Consumer File Disclosure"
Cooley,How 2 CFPB Advisory Opinions Affect Reporting Agencies,"Consumer File Disclosure

In the second advisory opinion,[8] the bureau stresses consumer reporting agencies' obligation to deliver all information in a consumer's file to the consumer upon their request  an effort the bureau claims is necessary to address what it characterizes as ""sloppy credit file sharing practices.""

The opinion explains that the disclosure of a person's complete consumer reporting file, ""upon their request, is a critical component of a person's right to dispute false or misleading information.""

Accordingly, the CFPB clarifies that, in its view, individuals need not use specific language or industry jargon  such as ""complete file"" or even ""file""  when requesting their information, but rather only need to lodge the request and provide proper identification to access their complete file.

The opinion also explains that information presented to the consumer in response to a file disclosure request must be in a form that will ""assist them in identifying inaccuracies, exercising their rights to dispute any incomplete or inaccurate information, and understanding when they are being impacted by adverse information.""

The advisory opinion also reflects the CFPB's position that, in connection with a consumer's file disclosure request, a consumer reporting agency must: Provide the consumer with all information that formed the basis of any summarized information  e.g., a credit risk score or tenant screening score that the consumer reporting agency provided to the user, rather than the summary alone; and Disclose all sources of any item of information in the consumer's file, meaning the ""original source and any intermediary or vendor source (or sources) that provide the item of information from the original source"" to the consumer reporting agency.

Looking Ahead

The two advisory opinions are part of the CFPB's continued commitment to addressing inaccuracies in consumer reports, including through broad interpretation of the FCRA and demonstrated cooperation with other agencies.

Given the multiagency and White House interest in this issue  particularly as it relates to rental housing and employment  additional coordinated action is expected.

To that end, consumer reporting agencies, including background screening companies, should assess the adequacy of their procedures in light of the opinions, and continue to monitor activity around the CFPB's plan to expand the FCRA's reach through formal rulemaking, as reflected in the CFPB's outline of proposals and alternatives under consideration.[9] Given that one purpose of the planned rulemaking is to address ""issues that have arisen in the years since the FCRA's enactment, or that are areas of particular risk for consumer harm,"" it may be informed by issues identified in the CFPB advisory opinions and ultimately result in enhanced compliance responsibilities for consumer reporting agencies, as well as other participants in the consumer reporting ecosystem.

Cooley,"UK, EU Adopt Further Sanctions Against Russia","On 18 December 2023, the European Council adopted its 12th package of sanctions against Russia .

The comprehensive new package includes additional trade restrictions, stricter asset freeze obligations, energy restrictions and stronger anti-circumvention measures.

The UK also implemented similar changes as of 14 December 2023.

Below we set out the key measures.

The new package aims to impose additional import and export bans on Russia and make it more difficult to circumvent sanctions.

European Union sanctions New professional services restrictions The EU introduced a new prohibition related to the sale, supply, transfer, export or provision of software for the management of enterprises and software for industrial design and manufacture used in the areas of architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education and entertainment.

This new prohibition could have a material impact on the operation of Russian subsidiaries of Western companies that provide customer relationship management software.

The software items covered by this prohibition are listed in new Annex XXXIX to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and include: Enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), business intelligence (BI), supply chain management (SCM), enterprise data warehouse (EDW), computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), project management software, product life cycle management (PLM) and typical components of the above-mentioned suites  including software for accounting, fleet management, logistics and human resources.

Building information modelling (BIM), computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), engineer to order (ETO) and typical components of the above-mentioned suites.

Additionally, the EU will eliminate  following a six-month wind-down period expiring on 20 June 2024  the exemption for the provision of all business services (prohibited under Regulation 5n of EU Regulation 833/2014, like accounting, consulting, IT and legal services) to Russian subsidiaries of companies headquartered in EU Member States, US, Japan, UK, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.

Expansion of export restrictions The package adds 29 entities to the list of those entities which are military end-users, form part of Russias military-industrial complex, or which have commercial or other links with or otherwise support Russias defence and security sector.

EU companies will not be able to obtain licences to deliver restricted or dual-use goods and technology to these entities.

A total of 611 entities are now covered by the restrictions, and the additions include entities in Singapore and Uzbekistan.

The package also adds items to the list of goods forming part of Russias military-industrial complex or that have links to Russias defence and security sector, which are prohibited from being sold, supplied, transferred or exported to persons or entities in Russia or for use in Russia, including: Chemicals, metals and alloys.

Lithium batteries.

Thermostats.

Direct current (DC) motors and servomotors for unmanned aerial vehicles.

Machine tools and machinery parts.

The package adds further goods  whether or not they originate in the EU  to the EU export ban, which are prohibited from being supplied, transferred or exported to persons or entities in Russia or for use in Russia.

These include: Machinery and machinery parts.

Construction-related goods.

Processed steel.

Copper and aluminium goods.

Lasers.

Batteries.

New import restrictions From 1 January 2024, the EU has banned the import of diamonds and products incorporating diamonds originating from Russia or having transited via the Russian territory.

There also is an import ban on raw materials for steel production, processed aluminium products and other metal goods.

A new import ban on liquefied propane also has been introduced with a 12-month transitional period."
Cooley,"UK, EU Adopt Further Sanctions Against Russia","A new import ban on liquefied propane also has been introduced with a 12-month transitional period.

Asset freeze obligations The EU has sanctioned a further 61 individuals and 86 entities, bringing the totals to 1,645 and 335, respectively.

In addition, the European Council has agreed on a new listing criterion which includes individuals who benefit from the compulsory transfer of ownership or control of entities established in Russia, previously owned or controlled by entities established in the EU, where such transfer is made by the Russian government through laws or other actions of a Russian public authority.

These individuals and entities may now be designated by the EU and made the subject of asset freeze measures.

To improve detection of sanctions circumvention and breaches, the European Council has introduced an obligation on Member States to establish authorities to identify and trace the funds and economic resources owned or controlled by listed persons and entities in their jurisdiction by 31 October 2024.

Oil price cap The EU has introduced a requirement that businesses share price information for ancillary costs  such as insurance and freight  upon request throughout the supply chain of the Russian oil trade.

The new measures also include an obligation upon sale to any third country to notify the competent authorities of the Member State where the owner of the tanker is a citizen, resident or is otherwise established.

Anti-circumvention measures The transit ban that previously applied to dual-use items exported from the EU to third countries via the territory of Russia has been extended to additional industrial items.

Exporters also are now contractually required to prohibit re-exportation of sensitive items used in Russian military systems or critical to the development, production or use of those systems, as well as aviation items and weapons to Russia or for use in Russia.

EU legal persons or entities that are owned more than 40% by a legal person or entity established in Russia, a Russian national or a natural person living in Russia are  from 1 May 2024  required to report any transfer of funds out of the EU that exceeds 100,000 euros.

UK sanctions The UK has adopted similar measures to the EU via two new sanctions regulations  the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2023 and the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 5) Regulations 2023 .

The UK measures include: Export restrictions The UK has included a ban on the export, supply, delivery and making available of certain additional critical industry goods and technology, defence and security goods, and dependency and other goods to Russia.

These include chemicals, machinery, electrical goods and vehicles.

Import restrictions The UK has banned the import of certain metals  such as copper, nickel, aluminium, zinc and lead  consigned from, originating in or located in Russia, as well as on the supply or delivery of such metals from a place in Russia to a third country.

A new category of controlled iron and steel products also has been introduced.

Similar to the EU, the regulations introduce a ban on the import and acquisition of diamonds and diamond jewellery consigned from, originating in or located in Russia.

The provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering relating to luxury goods also is prohibited.

Correspondent banking The regulations amend the prohibitions on UK credit and financial institutions processing sterling payments indirectly from designated financial institutions.

The new measures expand the prohibition to payments in any currency and implement a new exception to enable UK credit and financial institutions to credit accounts for the purposes of compliance with the regulation."
Cooley,"UK, EU Adopt Further Sanctions Against Russia","Divestment licences The regulations introduce a new licensing ground for dealings with designated parties to support divestment from Russia, such as UK entities divesting of funds or economic resources in Russia subject to UK sanctions, as well as UK entities outside of Russia wishing to carry out divestment of investors who are the Russian government or designated persons.

Reporting obligations The UK has introduced an obligation on designated persons to report the assets they hold, and for firms holding assets that they know or suspect are subject to the restrictions on providing financial services to the Russian Central Bank, National Wealth Fund and Russian Ministry of Finance to report these assets to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).


New designations
The UK government has designated 26 banks which are now subject to the prohibition on correspondent banking relationships (these entities had previously only been designated for asset freeze and trust services restrictions).

It also has newly designated Novikombank as a sanctioned entity, which is subject to an asset freeze, correspondent banking prohibitions and trust services sanctions.

Comments These new UK and EU sanctions significantly broaden the scope of goods and services that are now subject to restrictions.

Businesses should therefore ensure sanctions compliance processes adequately encompass these changes.

Businesses also should ensure that their compliance efforts do not focus solely on Russia and Russian links, as entities and individuals in other jurisdictions are increasingly being included within the scope of sanctions.

If you have any questions, please contact the Cooley authors listed below, who can advise you on the applicable sanctions and how they affect you and your business."

Cooley,UPOV Releases Explanatory Notes Further Defining Protection for Essentially Derived Varieties,"On October 27, 2023, the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) released its third set of explanatory notes on essentially derived variety (EDV) protection.

In this alert, we provide a brief history of EDV protection and plant variety protection (PVP), and we describe how the new explanatory notes may affect the rights of US and international certificate holders.

PVP review PVP certificates provide patent-like protection for breeders of new, distinct, uniform, and stable plant varieties, PVPs  also known as plant breeders rights (PBRs) in other jurisdictions  are the most widely available legal tool for protecting plant inventions internationally  and in many geographies, they are the only form of protection available for non-genetically modified plants that are produced through traditional breeding techniques.

Registration and protection are coordinated by UPOV, which provides a framework for protecting plant inventions across its 78 member states.

In the US, PVPs are administered by the US Department of Agriculture  this form of IP protection is separate from the utility and plant patent protection that is available through the US Patent and Trademark Office.

(A more detailed comparison between these different rights can be found in this 2019 article .)

PVP certificate holders can exclude others from selling, importing/exporting, sexually or asexually multiplying the variety, or producing hybrid crops.

1 Holders also can prevent the unauthorized use of marked seed for propagation or stocking of a variety, or even dispensing of a variety without notice of its protection.

2 Breeders exemption to PVP PVP is, however, subject to certain important exceptions, including the research or breeders rights exemption, which permits the use of a PVP-protected variety for plant breeding or other research.

3

The research exemption was intended to strike a balance between breeder exclusivity of protected varieties, and breeder access of protected genetics for development of future varieties.

This initial attempt to simultaneously advance exclusivity and access, however, significantly limited certificate holders ability to enforce their rights against even minor variants of protected varieties, and it led to real and perceived commercial abuses.

Evolution of EDV protection In 1991, UPOV introduced structural changes to its proposed PVP framework that extended enforceability of PVP certificates beyond the initial variety to also cover  essentially derived varieties .

In the US, Congress adopted UPOVs guidance with the passage of the Plant Variety Protection Act Amendments of 1994 , which defined an EDV as a variety that: (i) is predominantly derived from another variety (referred to in this paragraph as the initial variety) or from a variety that is predominantly derived from the initial variety, while retaining the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial variety; (ii) is clearly distinguishable from the initial variety; and (iii) except for differences that result from the act of derivation, conforms to the initial variety in the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial variety.

4

Since its introduction, interpretation of this language, and hence the scope of the EDV protection, has been hotly debated.

Under pressure from the plant breeding community and UPOV members to provide guidance, UPOV has so far issued three explanatory notes on EDVs.

First explanatory note (2009) UPOV provided examples of how EDVs may be directly or indirectly obtained."
Cooley,UPOV Releases Explanatory Notes Further Defining Protection for Essentially Derived Varieties,"First explanatory note (2009) UPOV provided examples of how EDVs may be directly or indirectly obtained.

Using a hypothetical Variety A as the initial variety, the first explanatory note explains how Variety B and Variety C  which were predominantly derived from Variety A  would be considered EDVs if they also 5 : Retained expression of the essential characteristics of Variety A. Were clearly distinguishable from Variety A. Conformed to Variety A in essential characteristics, except for the differences from the act of derivation.

Second explanatory note (2017) UPOVs second explanatory note explained that the requirement for predominant derivation meant that a variety only could be essentially derived from one initial variety, suggesting that EDVs were limited to new varieties that retained virtually the whole genotype of the initial variety.

Along these lines, UPOV indicated that: The differences resulting from the act of derivation should be one or very few.

6

The differences must not be such that the variety fails to retain the expression of the essential characteristics of the initial variety (i.e., traits contributing to the principal features, performance or value of the variety).

7 Third explanatory note (2023)

The third and most recent explanatory note (EXN3), published by UPOV in October 2023, has at least two interpretive notes that notably expand or contradict prior guidance.

The first notable interpretative note relates to the requirement that an EDV be predominantly derived from the initial variety 8 : Mono-parental: In EXN3, UPOV indicated that varieties developed from a single parent (i.e., mono-parental varieties), such as those developed from mutations, genetic modification or genome editing, are considered per se predominantly derived from the initial variety.

9 Multi-parental: In contrast, EXN3 did not change UPOVs earlier proposed framework for evaluating multi-parental varieties based on predetermined 10 similarity thresholds between the proposed EDV and the initial variety.

11

The second interpretive note in EXN3 relates to the requirement that an EDV conform to the essential characteristics of the initial variety 12 :

No upper limit to number of genetic differences: In EXN3, UPOV indicated that there is no upper limit as to the number of genetic differences that an EDV may display, while still conforming to the essential characteristics of the initial variety.

Genetic differences in EDV can include essential characteristics:

EXN3 further indicated that genetic differences resulting from the derivation also may include those characteristics deemed essential to the initial variety.

13

These interpretive notes likely will be met with mixed reactions.

Clarification that mono-parental EDVs qualify as predominantly derived varieties per se may be welcome news to certificate holders of major crop varieties that undergo genetic modification prior to commercialization (e.g., the addition of popular herbicide or insect resistance traits via transformation and/or gene editing).

Industry groups generally have been content with UPOVs proposed similarity threshold framework for analyzing multi-parental EDVs, but they may be disappointed that EXN3 failed to provide any additional guidance for how these should be established across multiple species and jurisdictions.

The long-term effect of UPOVs proposed interpretive changes to essential characteristics is uncertain.

The removal of an upper limit on the number of genetic differences that can be introduced to EDVs arguably blurs the line between EDV protection and the breeders exemption.

This is particularly true for mono-parental varieties, which are considered to be per se predominantly derived from initial varieties, and therefore not subject to the natural limits that could be imposed by similarity thresholds used in evaluating multi-parent varieties."
Cooley,UPOV Releases Explanatory Notes Further Defining Protection for Essentially Derived Varieties,"The distinction between an EDV and a variety falling under the breeders exemption is further complicated by UPOVs indication that an EDVs genetic differences can extend even to changes of essential characteristics  features that arguably defined the initial variety in the first place.

When viewed together, the proposed interpretive changes could end up significantly limiting the scope of the PVP breeders exemption  and thus expanding the scope of a PVP holders EDV rights, particularly for those working primarily with mono-parental varieties modified via genetic and/or gene editing tools.

Effect on US applicants Changes in UPOV text do not automatically have the force of law in the United States.

The US is a member of the 1961 UPOV Convention, and adheres to the 1991 text, which includes the original expansion of protection for EDVs.

The UPOV convention text, however, is not self-executing, and had to be separately enacted by Congress via passage of the Plant Variety Protection Act, and its subsequent amendments.

Moreover, UPOVs explanatory notes make it clear that the only binding obligations on members of the union are those contained in the text of the UPOV Convention itself, and that the explanatory notes must not be interpreted in a way that is inconsistent with the relevant act, which is the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention.

14 UPOVs explanatory notes therefore have no current binding legal effect on US PVP certificates  however, in PVP litigation it can be expected that litigants may point to explanatory notes in support of arguments.

Enactment of UPOV recommendations into law would require either changes to the Plant Variety Protection Act and/or PVP regulations through legislation.

The US Department of Agricultures Plant Variety Protection Office has reviewed the explanatory notes, but it has not yet advanced any rule changes to effectuate them.

Other member states similarly will have to roll out legislation and rules implementing new EDV guidance.

UPOVs explanatory notes are thus unlikely to drastically affect US PVP rights in the short term, but they may ultimately result in broader protection and more predictable outcomes for PVP certificate holders, with a breeders exemption of reduced scope.

Cooley,"New Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filing Thresholds, Filing Fees and Interlocking Directorate Thresholds Announced","The Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act thresholds that govern which mergers & acquisitions must be reported to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will increase slightly more than 7% in March 2024.

The key minimum size-of-transaction threshold will increase from $111.4 million to $119.5 million.

The increases, which are based on changes in the US gross national product (GNP), will go into effect on March 6, 2024, thirty days after their publication in the Federal Register.

The HSR Act requires that parties to proposed mergers & acquisitions, including acquisitions of voting securities and assets, notify the DOJ and FTC and observe a statutory waiting period before closing if the transaction meets specified size-of-person and size-of-transaction thresholds  and does not fall within an exemption to the HSR Act.

The waiting period, which is 30 days for most transactions, historically has been terminated early when transactions do not present substantive issues, but the Biden administration has stopped granting early terminations for most transactions since February 2021 .

In addition to increasing the minimum size-of-transaction threshold, the most significant adjustments are the following: The size-of-person tests will increase from $22.3 million to $23.9 million and from $222.7 million to $239 million, with respect to the required level of annual net sales or total assets.

The larger size-of-transaction threshold, which is applicable even if the size-of-person test is not met, will increase from $445.5 million to $478 million, meaning that acquisitions valued at more than $478 million must be reported regardless of whether the size-of-person threshold is met (unless an exemption applies).

Adjustments also will be made to the six-tiered filing fee structure implemented last year by the agencies.

The adjustments made to the deal value thresholds and fees are based on changes in the Department of Labors Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the year ending September 30 over the previous year (unlike the HSR filing thresholds, which are adjusted based on changes in GNP).

The current and new HSR filing fees are as follows: Earlier this month, the FTC announced an adjustment to the maximum daily civil penalty for HSR violations, which is adjusted for inflation and calculated based on changes in the CPI for all urban consumers from October to October.

The current maximum daily civil penalty is now $51,744 per day, up from $50,120 and effective as of January 10, 2024.

The FTC also announced revised dollar thresholds applicable to the size criteria applied under Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which governs the legality of interlocking directorates and is adjusted based on changes in GNP.

Under the updated Section 8 thresholds, interlocks may be prohibited if each corporation has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $48,559,000 (up from $45,257,000), with an exception if the competitive sales of either corporation are less than $4,855,900 (up from $4,525,700).

The revised levels for these thresholds were effective as of January 22, 2024.

HSR filing analyses and determinations of which interlocking directorates may violate Section 8 of the Clayton Act are highly technical.

Cooley,Cooley Responds to Call for Evidence on Operation of the UK’s National Security and Investment Regime,"On 13 November 2023, the UK government published a call for evidence on the scope and operation of the UKs National Security and Investment (NSI) regime, with the aim of making it as pro business and pro investment as possible.

In this November 2023 Cooley alert , we summarised the key aspects of the consultation, which considers potential exemptions to the mandatory notification requirement and clarifications to the sectors in scope, as well as suggestions on how to increase communications and transparency throughout the process.

Based on our experience of advising on the application of the NSI regime, we recently submitted our response to the call for evidence.

Below are some of our key observations and recommendations on how the regime could be improved.

Narrowing the regime  small garden, high fence approach The current NSI regime casts a very wide net and captures a high volume of deals which raise no genuine national security concerns.

In 2022  2023, for example, there were 866 notified transactions.

Of these, more than 90% received clearance within 30 working days, and less than 2% resulted in final orders  i.e., prohibitions or remedial decisions (see our July 2023 alert on the NSI Annual Report 2022  2023 ).

In light of the expansive nature of the regime, we have suggested changes to scope to address the minority of deals that raise national security concerns, notably: Exemption for internal reorganisations We have recommended that internal reorganisations should be exempt from the mandatory notification requirement where the ultimate controlling entity remains the same.

Internal reorganisations are generally carried out in order to achieve a specific purpose (unconnected to national security considerations)  such as preparing for the sale of part of a business, expanding into new product or geographic markets, or achieving certain tax objectives.

In such instances, the ultimate controlling entity will typically remain the same, and so the restructuring should not present any national security concerns.

Clarify and narrow the sectors In a mandatory filing regime, it is paramount that filing criteria are clear and unambiguous, especially where a failure to file can result in civil and criminal penalties.

To avoid precautionary filings, which result in unnecessary costs to businesses and the government, we have recommended clarifying and narrowing the definitions in a number of sectors  notably, Advanced Materials, Artificial Intelligence, Synthetic Biology and Defence.

Pre-screening mechanism Where significant uncertainty remains as to whether a transaction is notifiable, we have recommended that the government considers a new fast-track pre-screening mechanism similar to those which exist in foreign direct investment (FDI) regimes in other jurisdictions.

Parties could present a short submission, which explains why a transaction is not caught by the NSI mandatory regime.

Following a short review period, the Investment Screening Unit (ISU) could either confirm that the investment does not fall within scope or that a mandatory NSI filing is required.

More guidance on investor structures In our experience, any follow-up questions from the government are often in connection with investor structure charts that are submitted as part of the notification.

In order to minimise the back-and-forth  and therefore any potential delay to the clearance process  we would welcome more specific guidance from the government on the presentation of investor structures, particularly as it relates unincorporated entities (i.e., those without shareholders), such as funds and partnerships."
Cooley,Cooley Responds to Call for Evidence on Operation of the UK’s National Security and Investment Regime,"Increase transparency and operation of the regime While we understand that the government has to balance transparency considerations with the need to protect UK national security, we believe that the following improvements could be made to make the review process smoother and more efficient for all involved parties: More detailed reasoning in final orders The NSI annual reports are a helpful source of information, yet they do not give clear insights into case-by-case decision-making  in particular, on how the government has assessed acquirer, target and control risk.

We would therefore welcome more detailed justifications in final orders for the governments reasoning.

Better communication between the ISU and the parties To allow parties to address potential concerns identified by the government, we would welcome more early engagement in the event that the government is considering either calling in a case for further review and/or publishing a final order.

Fast-track procedure for certain deals Additionally, or alternatively, to the above, we would recommend a fast-track procedure for low-value deals and/or pre-approved investors, whereby parties would not have to submit a full notification.

We would recommend that such transactions are expedited and reviewed within a shorter time frame (e.g., 10 working days).

Improve the online portal On several occasions, we have experienced technical issues within the government portal, particularly in relation to the firewall.

This has made the process of uploading supporting documents and submitting notifications less than straightforward and significantly more time-consuming.

We would therefore welcome a permanent solution to this recurring issue.

Next steps The call for evidence closed on 15 January 2024.

The government will now be reviewing the responses and may hold follow-up meetings with stakeholders who are willing to discuss their views in more detail.

While the government is not currently considering any reforms to the regime that would require primary legislation, it is anticipated that a more detailed consultation on some of the amendments will likely follow later in the year.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – January One-Minute Reads,"Reminder: New securities laws affect Form10-K With Form 10-K season rapidly approaching, here is a brief list of the new securities laws impacting the 2023 Form 10-K for calendar year-end companies: Items 106(b) and (c) of Regulation S-K require disclosure in Item 1C of Form 10-K of specified matters related to cybersecurity risk management and strategy, board oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, and managements role in assessing and managing the companys material risks from cybersecurity threats.

Item 408(a) of Reg S-K requires disclosure in Item 9B of Form 10-K on a quarterly basis of: Whether, during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, any director or officer has adopted, materially modified, or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 plan and/or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.

A description of the material terms of the Rule 10b5-1 plan or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, other than pricing terms.

Cover page check boxes require companies to indicate on the cover page of their annual report form: Whether the financial statements of the company included in the filing reflect correction of an error to previously issued financial statements.

Whether any of those error corrections are restatements that required a recovery analysis of incentive-based compensation received by any of the companys executive officers during the relevant recovery period.

Item 601(b)(97) of Reg S-K requires companies to file a copy of their clawback policy as Exhibit 97 to Form 10-K. Item 402(w) of Reg S-K requires disclosure in Item 11 of Form 10-K of specified information if during or after its last completed fiscal year a company either: Was required to prepare an accounting restatement that required a clawback under the companys clawback policy.

Had an outstanding balance of unrecovered excess incentive-based compensation under such policy relating to a prior restatement.

(As with the rest of Item 402, we expect most companies will incorporate this disclosure by reference from the proxy statement.)

Appeals court vacates share repurchase rules On December 19, 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Securities and Exchange Commissions share repurchase rules that were adopted in May 2023 .

As summarized in the December 2023 edition of the One-Minute Reads , the court previously held that the SEC violated the Administrative Procedure Act by acting arbitrarily and capriciously for failing to substantiate the share repurchase rules benefits and costs and by applying inconsistent logic.

The court did not vacate the rule, but instead remanded the rule back to the SEC to attempt to repair the defects by November 30, 2023.

On November 22, following the ruling, the SEC announced that it had issued an order to postpone the effective date of the rules and, as a result, the share repurchase rule had been stayed pending further SEC action.

On the same day, the SEC filed a motion for an extension of time to repair the defects.

The US Chamber of Commerce opposed the motion.

On November 26, the court issued an order refusing to grant the extension , after which the SEC conceded that it is unable to correct the defects in the rules by the court-imposed deadline.

Subsequently, the US Chamber of Commerce filed a motion to vacate the rules that was then granted by the court.

Considering the vacatur and subject to further guidance, the preexisting requirements in Item 703 of Reg S-K will remain in effect.

This requires issuers to provide certain information about their quarterly equity repurchases on an aggregated, monthly basis, in addition to other specified disclosures.

Likewise, foreign private issuers, who would have been required to file a form F-SR under the new rules, should follow their preexisting disclosure requirements.

Division of Corporation Finance offers further guidance on cyber incidents The December edition of the One-Minute Reads discussed three Form 8-K compliance and disclosure interpretations (C&DIs) issued by the SEC related to the requirement under new Item 1.05 of the Form 8-K to disclose specified information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days of a company determining that the cybersecurity incident was material.

More specifically, the C&DIs relate to the narrow allowance for a delayed filing under Item 1.05I in cases where the US attorney general has notified the SEC in writing that the disclosure poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety.

The SECs Division of Corporation Finance (Corp Fin) has added another new C&DI ( Question 104B.04 ), which states that merely consulting with the Department of Justice regarding the availability of this delay would not necessarily result in the determination that the incident is material.

This is because determining whether an incident is material and therefore subject to the requirements of Item 1.05 is based on all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the incident.

Accompanying the new C&DIs, Corp Fin Director Erik Gerding issued a statement on the new rules providing an overview of the cybersecurity disclosure rule and its rationale, delved into the cyber incident disclosure requirement and the related national security delay provision, and outlined next steps for companies to take.

SEC reviewing climate-related disclosures On January 2, Bloomberg Tax reported that more than a dozen large companies have received comments from SEC staff on their climate-related disclosures in their SEC filings over the past three months.

The focus areas of these comments were consistent with the sample letter issued by Corp Fin to companies in September 2021 that contained illustrative comments regarding their climate-related disclosures.

Several of the comments related to the inclusion of disclosures in sustainability reports that arent included in SEC filings, which is a highlighted focus area of the staff, while others focus on the impacts of severe weather and how climate risk impacts customer demand and competition.

SEC adopts final rules for SPACs On January 24, 2024, the SEC announced the adoption of final rules regarding the disclosure and other requirements relating to special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), shell companies and projections.

The final rules add new Subpart 1600 to Reg S-K, which requires specified robust disclosures about the SPAC sponsor, SPAC sponsor compensation, conflicts of interest, dilution and the target company.

This new subpart also requires disclosures in deSPAC transactions regarding any determination by a board or similar body as to whether the deSPAC transaction is advisable and in the best interests of the SPAC and its shareholders, if required by law, and any outside report, opinion, or appraisal received that materially relates to the deSPAC transaction.

In addition, under the final rules, the private operating company that is the target of the SPAC will be deemed a co-registrant when the SPAC files the registration statement on Form S-4 or F-4 for the deSPAC transaction, which would subject the private company and its signatories to liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

The final rules also: Require enhanced disclosure regarding projections presented in filings in deSPAC transactions and make the safe harbor in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for the use of projections unavailable in filings by SPACs."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – January One-Minute Reads,"Require that the registration statement filed in connection with the deSPAC transaction register not just the offering of shares to the target companys shareholders but also register an offering to the existing SPAC shareholders.

Include a number of technical changes to disclosure and procedural requirements for SPAC IPOs and deSPAC transactions, as well as technical reporting requirements for post-deSPAC companies.

In addition, the release provides guidance to assist SPACs in assessing when they may meet the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and to assist participants in deSPAC transactions in determining their statutory underwriter status under the Securities Act.

The release also includes updates to the SECs guidance regarding the use of projections in SEC filings more generally.

The final rules will become effective 125 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Compliance generally will be required upon effectiveness, while compliance with the structured data tagging requirements will only be required 490 days after publication in the Federal Register.

SEC denies no-action relief on AI proposals The December One-Minute Reads discussed the emerging trend of shareholder proposals relating to artificial intelligence, with most proposals urging companies to publish an AI transparency report on whether they have adopted any ethical guidelines to protect workers, customers and the public from harms related to the use of AI.

On January 3, the SEC denied a no-action request seeking to exclude this type of proposal from a company, noting that the proposal transcends ordinary business matters and does not seek to micromanage the company, and therefore is not excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).

This ruling may encourage additional shareholders to advance similar proposals in the future and sets the stage for gauging shareholder receptiveness to these proposals during this proxy season.

For more information, refer to this article from Reuters .

Increase in political contributions shareholder proposals expected in 2024 In a recent newsletter , the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) disclosed its plans to submit 40 shareholder proposals this proxy season, a significant increase for the CPA over recent years.

Per the newsletter, these will include corporate disclosure and accountability proposals and third-party spending proposals, which will request that companies require reports from any third-party groups to whom they make payments, detailing the groups political expenditures, and that companies post this information on their websites.

The newsletter also provides an overview of CPAs analysis of institutional investor support for its political disclosure proposals in the 2023 proxy season, finding that support dropped slightly to 71% from 75% in 2022.

Labor Department adopts independent contractor rule On January 10, 2024, the US Department of Labor announced the publication of a final rule to update the test for determining whether a worker is an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or an independent contractor.

For context, FLSA requirements relating to minimum wage, overtime and recordkeeping apply to employees, but do not apply to independent contractors, making the classification of a worker very consequential.

The final rule rescinds the former administrations business-friendly independent contractor test adopted in January 2021 , and purportedly restores an economic reality test applied during previous administrations that looks at the totality of the circumstances, allowing consideration of any relevant evidence to determine a workers classification.

More specifically, to analyze if a worker is an employee or independent contractor, the final rule provides six factors to consider when analyzing the economic realities of the working relationship."

Unlike the prior rule, which had emphasized two core factors (the nature and degree of the workers control over the work and the workers opportunity for profit or loss), no one factor is intended to be weighed more heavily than another when analyzing whether a worker is properly classified.

The economic reality test set forth by the final rule focuses more broadly on a workers economic dependence on an employer, considering the totality of the circumstances.

Differences from the proposed rule In response to receiving 55,400 comments, the final rule includes the following changes from the proposed rule: Opportunity for profit or loss factor This factor considers whether the worker has opportunities for profit or loss based on managerial skill, where a worker who has no such opportunity is likely to be considered an employee.

Some comments raised concerns that the proposed rule failed to consider that a workers ability to freely choose among jobs based on the workers assessment of their comparable profitability could indicate contractor status.

Thus, the final rule clarifies that some decisions by a worker that can affect the amount of pay that a worker receives, such as the decision to work more hours or take more jobs when paid a fixed rate per hour or per job , generally do not reflect the exercise of managerial skill indicating independent contractor status under this factor.

Where the hours or jobs are paid at a fixed rate, the DOL notes that the worker is more likely to not exercise managerial skill by taking such hours or jobs.

Degree of permanence factor Where the work relationship is indefinite, continuous or exclusive, the worker is likely to be considered an employee, whereas work that is nonexclusive, definite in duration, sporadic or project-based indicates that a worker is in business for themselves.

The final rule acknowledges that a lack of permanence may, in some cases, be due to the operational characteristics that are unique or intrinsic to particular businesses or industries.

Thus, the final rule clarifies that the overall question under this factor is whether short periods of work are due to workers acting independently to obtain business opportunities or due to operational characteristics of particular industries:

[w]here a lack of permanence is due to operational characteristics that are unique or intrinsic to particular businesses or industries and the workers they employ, this factor is not necessarily indicative of independent contractor status unless the worker is exercising their own independent business initiative .

Nature and degree of control factor The proposed rule stated that control implemented for purposes of complying with legal obligations may be indicative of employee status."
Cooley,US Department of Labor Issues Final Rule on Independent Contractor Status,"Nature and degree of control factor The proposed rule stated that control implemented for purposes of complying with legal obligations may be indicative of employee status.

Numerous comments expressed concerns that a hiring party cannot avoid certain legally required degrees of control because it is imposed by the government, not by a client or hiring party.

In response, the final rule states, Actions taken by the potential employer that go beyond compliance with a specific, applicable Federal, State, Tribal, or local law or regulation and instead serve the potential employers own compliance methods, safety, quality control, or contractual or customer service standards may be indicative of control.

Thus, actions taken by the potential employer for the sole purpose of complying with specific law or regulation would not indicate employer control.

Investments by the worker and the potential employer The final rule addresses comments concerning the DOLs proposal to consider the relative investments of the worker and the potential employer.

Investments that are capital or entrepreneurial in nature suggest contractor status.

The DOL explains that investments should be compared not only on a quantitative basis, but also qualitatively.

The final rule now states, consideration of the relative investments of the worker and the potential employer should be compared not only in terms of dollar value or size of the investments, but should focus on whether the worker is making similar types of investments as the employer (albeit on a smaller scale) that would suggest that the worker is operating independently.

In addition, in response to comments that some costs  which could be capital or entrepreneurial in nature  are posed unilaterally by potential employers on workers, the DOL also clarifies that such costs are not indicative of a workers capital or entrepreneurial investments.

Skill and initiative factor The DOL explains that the use of specialized skills is just one part of the inquiry, and workers who lack specialized skills may still be independent contractors.

Indeed, the critical question in applying this factor is whether the worker uses their specialized skills in connection with business-like initiative, rather than merely considering whether a worker has specialized skills, as that focus is probative of the ultimate question of economic dependence.

Employer implications The final rule is already being challenged in court.

For example, freelance writers and editors promptly filed a lawsuit in federal court in Georgia , alleging, among other things, that the rule is inconsistent with the FLSA, is so vague that it violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, and obscures the line between contractor and employee in an impenetrable fog.

While litigation is pending, however, employers should be prepared to face more challenges to their classification of workers, as the final rule will make it more difficult for certain workers to qualify as independent contractors under the FLSA.

Misclassifying employees as contractors can impose significant costs  including unpaid minimum wages and overtime, liquidated damages, and civil penalties.

As such, employers may consider conducting an audit of their independent contractors, including reviewing independent contractor agreements and work descriptions and correcting any misclassifications.

Employers also should ensure that their agreements with contractors are drafted in a way that will help establish that the individual is a contractor and not an employee.

To the extent that smaller employers reclassify large numbers of contractors as employees, they also should be aware of any coverage thresholds for employee benefits and leaves under federal, state or local law that they may now be obligated to provide as a result of having a higher employee population."
Cooley,US Department of Labor Issues Final Rule on Independent Contractor Status,"While the final rule has a significant impact on classification under the FLSA, employers should note that courts are not required to follow the DOLs interpretation of the FLSA.

Employers also should note that many states use different classification tests  such as the ABC test, which the final rule expressly declined to adopt.

As the DOL itself noted, The final rule only revises the Departments interpretation under the FLSA.

It has no effect on other lawsfederal, state, or localthat use different standards for employee classification.  

The FLSA does not preempt any other laws that protect workers, so businesses must comply with all federal, state, and local laws that apply and ensure that they are meeting whichever standard provides workers with the greatest protection.

As such, employers in states like California and Massachusetts must continue to comply with the ABC test and more stringent classification tests, despite the DOLs final rule.

Cooley,CFPB Issues Proposal to Eliminate Fees on Instantaneously Declined Transactions,"On January 24, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit financial institutions from charging fees on transactions that are declined instantaneously or near-instantaneously.

The rule states that assessing a nonsufficient funds (NSF) fee in connection with such covered transactions would be considered an abusive practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Acts prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, meaning that it takes advantage of consumers lack of understanding of the material risks, costs, or conditions of a consumer financial product or service.

The proposal would apply to all instantaneously declined transactions, regardless of the transaction method.

While many institutions have eliminated or reduced NSF fees for all transactions, the proposed rule would not apply to NSF fees charged on paper check or automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, as those denials are not instantaneous.

CFPBs impetus for the rule The CFPB suggests that declined transaction fees tend to disproportionately impact consumers with lower incomes and lower credit scores.

Specifically, the CFPB explains in the supplemental information accompanying the proposed rule that financially vulnerable populations often lack the financial resources to build an adequate cushion in their accounts to avoid NSF fees.

The CFPB believes that the rule would proactively combat abusive tactics by financial institutions that may try to take advantage of customers who do not understand the material risks, costs or conditions associated with their deposit accounts.

Furthermore, the CFPB states that declined transaction fees are not fees for a service provided to consumers, and profiting from transactions where the consumer receives no service in return raises concerns that a covered financial institution may be engaging in unreasonable advantage-taking by financial institutions.

The CFPB referenced its market monitoring that found the median NSF fee charged by the largest financial institutions was approximately $32.

However, the CFPB found that the service provided by the bank  the handling of an NSF account that does not have enough funds to settle an authorized debit card transaction between the time of authorization of that transaction and the settlement of that transaction  resulted in an $0.005 de minimis transaction cost for most financial institutions.

Definitions and interplay with Regulation E The CFPB suggests that to foster consistency with the existing regulatory framework, the proposed rule would incorporate several definitions from Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.

Account Under the proposed rule, an account has the same definition as in Regulation E. Pursuant to that definition, an account would include the following: A checking, savings, or other consumer asset account held by a financial institution (directly or indirectly), including certain club accounts, established primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

A prepaid account, as defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(b)(3).

An account would not include, for example: An account held by a financial institution under a bona fide trust agreement.

An occasional or incidental credit balance in a credit plan.

Profit-sharing and pension accounts established under a bona fide trust agreement.

Escrow accounts, such as those for payments of real estate taxes, insurance premiums, or completion of repairs or improvements.

Accounts for purchasing US savings bonds.

The proposed definition covers a broad range of consumer account types to maximize the number of consumers protected from potentially abusive practices.

Covered financial institution The proposed rule would provide that covered financial institution means a financial institution as defined in Regulation E, 12 CFR 1005.2(i)."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Proposal to Eliminate Fees on Instantaneously Declined Transactions,"Covered financial institution The proposed rule would provide that covered financial institution means a financial institution as defined in Regulation E, 12 CFR 1005.2(i).

Applying that definition, a covered financial institution would mean a bank, savings association, credit union, or any other person that directly or indirectly holds an account belonging to a consumer, or that issues an access device and agrees with a consumer to provide electronic fund transfer services, including certain peer-to-peer payment companies.

Adopting this definition also would incorporate related definitions and commentary, such as those for access device and electronic funds transfer.

Covered transaction Under the proposal, a covered transaction is defined as an attempt by a consumer to withdraw, debit, pay or transfer funds from their account that is declined instantaneously or near-instantaneously by a covered financial institution due to insufficient funds.

A declined transaction occurs instantaneously or near-instantaneously when the transaction is processed in real time with no significant perceptible delay to the consumer when attempting the transaction.

Under existing law, NSF fees currently may be charged on transactions that the financial institution declines within seconds after the payment request is initiated (e.g., debit card transactions), as well as on transactions that are rejected hours or days after the initial request to pay is made.

The proposed rule would only apply to the former category of transactions, not to NSF fees on transactions that do not occur instantaneously  for example, the proposed rule would not impact NSF fees charged on ACH and check transactions, which may take several hours or a couple of days to settle.

Transactions authorized in the first instance, even if they are later rejected or fail to settle due to insufficient funds, also would not be covered by the proposal.

Whats next?

The proposal is part of the Biden administrations broader efforts to combat so-called junk fees charged by financial institutions.

The proposed rule comes only a week after the CFPB issued a proposal to address discretionary overdraft services offered by large financial institutions .

Although the CFPB noted that in recent years most financial institutions have stopped charging NSF fees for instantaneously declined transactions, the CFPBs proposal suggests an intent to proactively prevent NSF fees and abusive practices as new forms of technology and instant payments through digital applications become more widespread.

Financial institutions that charge fees for instant payments should be mindful that the CFPB is focused on the charging of NSF fees and other fees as a potentially abusive practice."
Cooley,Copyright Ownership of Generative AI Outputs Varies Around the World,"Generative artificial intelligence tools produce a vast range of new content, including code, text, audio, images and video.

For the business user, the speed of output in response to a user prompt can deliver game-changing business efficiencies.

However, the appeal of generative AI content needs to be balanced against the implications of using that content within a business.

There are several dimensions to this, and one important question  with interesting potential outcomes  is the extent to which the user can own the output.

Superficially, this might seem to depend on the terms of service of the particular generative AI platform and the allocation of rights set out in its governing terms.

While this is indeed a part of the story, the user also needs to consider whether that output is even capable of being owned, by anyone, under applicable law.

Below, we explore the answer to that question around the world, based on law and guidance as of the date of this post.

US: No ownership The default position under US law is that copyrights in creative works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium vest in the author immediately upon creation (17 US Code 201).

However, US copyright law has repeatedly been interpreted to require human authorship for that ownership, such as in Naruto v. Slater , also known as the monkey selfie case, where the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in 2018 that a monkey does not own the copyright in a photograph it snapped of itself.

In 2023, the US District Court for the District of Columbia reaffirmed in Thaler v. Perlmutter the absence of ownership for works generated by an artificial intelligence tool that plaintiff Stephen Thaler developed, although in this fact pattern, Thaler intentionally limited any human creativity and emphasized the role of the machine.

Notably, the series of case law and guidance from the US Copyright Office, which is currently our primary source of guidance for individuals seeking copyright ownership of works they developed with the assistance of generative AI tools, establishes that, under current US law, there is no ownership of AI generated works by anyone  not by the authors of the AI tool, not by the tool itself and not by the individual who enters the prompts to generate the work.

As such, these works are currently considered to be in the public domain, without copyright protection.

The US Copyright Office issued further guidance explaining that a work containing AI-generated material will also contain sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim, where, for example, an author had made creative arrangement of AI-generated works, or substantially modified AI-generated works.

However, [i]n these cases, copyright will only protect the human-authored aspects of the work, which are independent of and do not affect the copyright status of the AI-generated material itself.

Thus, the US Copyright Office requires identification of AI-generated content and human-generated content in works submitted for registration, such that protection will be granted to the human-authored content only.

In its registration decision regarding the comic book Zarya of the Dawn, for example, the US Copyright Office denied protection for images created using the generative AI art platform Midjourney, but it allowed registration for the text, and the selection and arrangement of images and text, where the applicant, Kris Kashtanova, attested to sole responsibility for those elements.

In the same guidance statement , the US Copyright Office also reaffirmed that protection remains for underlying original works, even where theyre enhanced by technological tools.

The US Copyright Office noted in its guidance that it will continue to monitor this new technology and may issue further guidance in the future."
Cooley,Copyright Ownership of Generative AI Outputs Varies Around the World,"The US Copyright Office noted in its guidance that it will continue to monitor this new technology and may issue further guidance in the future.

As such, the current guidance around sufficient human authorship ultimately could support a future award of copyright protection for AI-generated works, or portions or variations thereof.

For now, however, there is no assurance of protection for AI generated works in the US.

European Union: Ownership possible EU copyright law is a patchwork of 13 directives and two regulations.

However, none of this legislation, nor the upcoming EU AI Act, directly addresses the ownership of AI-generated works, and, outside the legislation, there is little in terms of relevant EU-level case law.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) does provide some limited directional guidance in Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening (Case C-5/08), where it held that copyright will only subsist if there is originality flowing from the authors own intellectual creation.

This has been widely interpreted to mean that a significant form of human input is required.

Nevertheless, it will be for individual EU member states to determine whether the output of an AI-generative model can meet this requirement.

By way of example of the state of play, the German Copyright Act requires an authors own intellectual creation for the existence of a copyrightable work  and it is thought that neither a machine nor a computer program can be the author, so it is presupposed that an intellectual creation must be created by a human.

Likewise in France, the current presumption is that only natural persons can be considered authors, and originality requires the personal touch or intellectual effort of the author, whereas implementation of automatic and constraining logic without genuine personal effort will not qualify.

However, similar to the above discussion, it remains to be seen where there could be sufficient human input to generate a work with the assistance of an AI-generative model, such that the human could claim ownership of the work.

UK:

Ownership available The UKs position is similar to the EUs position, requiring a copyright work to be the authors own intellectual creation and exhibiting an authors personal touch.

As in other jurisdictions, copyright will exist where a human author uses a tool, such as a word processing package or a pen, to produce a work.

However, if all the creativity takes place within an AI platform, it might be concluded that  as with other countries  output from generative AI would not be protected in the UK.

Significantly, however, the UK under its copyright legislation  Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)  also extends copyright protection to computer-generated works.

Although theorists have challenged the idea that a non-human computer can generate a copyrightable work embodying creative skill, Section 9(3) of the CDPA clearly provides that the person who made the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work is the author of the resulting copyrightable work.

This position was recently ratified by the UK government, as well as the UK Intellectual Property Office  which in 2022 held an open consultation specifically on the application of Section 9(3) to generative AI, with the conclusion that Section 9(3) should remain.

So, while there is an open question as to who the person making necessary arrangements is in practice, it seems clear that, in the UK, copyright subsists in generative AI outputs.

China: Ownership possible The general rule in China is similar to the other jurisdictions that we have looked at in this post: A work eligible for copyright protection under the Copyright Law of the Peoples Republic of China (CL) must be an original intellectual achievement."
Cooley,Copyright Ownership of Generative AI Outputs Varies Around the World,"Although the CL does not specifically address the copyrightability of AI-generated content, two recent court decisions are instructive, and might provide a conceptual framework applicable in other countries.

In 2019, the Shenzhen Nanshan District Court found that generative AI output  or some output, at least  may be eligible for copyright protection.

In this case ( Shenzhen Tencent v. Shanghai Yingxun ), the court confirmed that AI-generated text generated using Tencents Dreamwriter writing AI software can constitute protectable works.

The court found that the work in question was not generated purely by AI, and that intellectual activity existed in the output because Tencents inputs, in areas such as arrangement and selection of data input and trigger condition setting, were key to the output generation process.

Although Dreamwriter did not have personhood, it was relatively straightforward for the court to find that multiple teams within Tencent were behind the work, and that Tencent therefore owned the copyright.

In a more recent case, the Beijing Internet Court ruled that an image generated by Stable Diffusion met the intellectual achievement and originality criteria because the user made an intellectual contribution by inputting prompt texts and setting parameters, with the result that the AI-generated image reflected a personalized expression of the user.

In the same case, the court held that the copyright owner of the AI-generated image was the user, rather than the platform developer, because the developer did not have the intent to create the image and also did not determine the inputs.

These decisions do leave open the question of whether a work generated purely by AI could be found copyrightable, but the general reasoning relating to arrangement and selection of inputs may provide a path toward copyright protection for at least some users of generative AI tools.

Conclusion In sum, copyright ownership of AI generated works varies jurisdictionally, where laws in some cases are still being settled.

If ownership and protectability is important to the user of a generative AI tool, it is therefore critical to consider the terms offered by the provider of the tool, the governing law of the agreement, the jurisdiction where the user seeks to enforce its copyrights, and other jurisdictional factors."
Cooley,Transitional Tax Reporting Guidance for Business Transactions Involving Digital Assets,"In Announcement 2024-4 , the IRS and the US Department of the Treasury stated that, until regulations are issued, taxpayers will not be required to treat digital assets received in the course of their trade or business as cash for purposes of determining whether the $10,000 threshold for reporting on IRS Form 8300 has been exceeded.

Under Section 6050I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, taxpayers that receive cash of more than $10,000 in the course of their trade or business generally are required to report such transactions on IRS Form 8300, which requires disclosure of identifying information with respect to the transferor, including the transferors taxpayer identification number; the form of identification used by the taxpayer to verify the transferors identity (e.g., drivers license or passport); any related identifying number (e.g., drivers license or passport number); and a description of the transaction.

The taxpayer also must provide written notification to the transferor that the information on Form 8300 was furnished to the IRS.

In 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) expanded Section 6050I to treat digital assets as cash for purposes of determining whether the $10,000 threshold has been exceeded.

This expansion of Section 6050I was scheduled to take effect beginning after December 31, 2023.

Failure to report transactions that are required to be disclosed on IRS Form 8300 can result in civil penalties and, in certain cases, criminal charges.

Announcement 2024-4 states that the IRS and the Treasury Department intend to implement the expansion of Section 6050I under the IIJA by publishing regulations that specifically address the application of Section 6050I to digital assets, as well as by providing forms and instructions for reporting that address the inclusion of digital assets.

Until such regulations are issued, taxpayers that receive digital assets (or digital assets and other cash) in a transaction or a series of related transactions in the course of their trade or business will not be required to treat the digital assets as cash for purposes of determining whether cash received with respect to those transactions has a value in excess of $10,000 for purposes of Section 6050I. Announcement 2024-4 does not change the information reporting requirements under Section 6050I for taxpayers that receive cash (excluding digital assets) in excess of $10,000 in a transaction or a series of related transactions in the course of their trade or business.

Announcement 2024-4 also does not affect the income tax obligations of taxpayers that receive digital assets or use digital assets to make any payments."
Cooley,US Investors Can Take Advantage of International Treaties to Structure Foreign Investments,"Investors typically consider structuring their foreign investments through jurisdictions that maximize their tax benefits.

But US investors also should consider corporate structures that take advantage of investment treaties granting access to international investment law protection and international arbitration, particularly in higher risk countries.

What are international investment agreements (IIAs)?

IIAs are international treaties between two or more countries.

They protect investors from one country (the investors home country) from unlawful interference with their investments in the other country (the host country).

The main purpose of these treaties is to mitigate political and legal risks associated with investing abroad by giving the investor the possibility to sue countries before impartial international arbitration tribunals.

IIAs could take the form of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between two countries, or they could be part of wider free trade agreement, such as Chapter 14 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) or Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Investment treaty protections and the dispute settlement mechanisms they contain are only available to qualifying investors and investments.

When should investors do investment treaty planning?

Under international investment law, you can structure a transaction to take advantage of investment protections.

Ideally, this is considered prior to an investment being made.

However, you also can restructure to take advantage of treaty protections for ongoing investments, although generally only before a dispute with the host country has arisen.

Advance planning is key.

When foreign governments have mistreated similarly situated investors or have taken some worrying first steps in the path toward unfair and arbitrary interference, it is time to consider structuring, if your company has not already done so.

It almost goes without saying that adverse country regulation is not limited to developing economies and should be pursued comprehensively.

Developed economies with a sophisticated regulatory apparatus have even greater power to regulate.

For example, dozens of cases have been brought against Spain and Italy for changing feed-in tariffs in the solar energy industry.

How can investors make the most of treaty protections?

Treaty protection is available to nationals of the country.

In the case of companies, nationality is often established by the place of incorporation.

Protections vary from treaty to treaty, and some treaties limit the applicability of protections to require actual physical presence in the jurisdiction or lack certain substantive protections that other treaties afford.

Investments can often be structured by incorporating companies in a jurisdiction that provides protections.

Sometimes, this can be done simply by interposing a holding company at any level of the corporate ownership structure.

The first step is to check whether your home country (for example, the US) has any investment agreement with the country where you want to invest  and that the agreement is in force.

If there is no such treaty, you should identify other jurisdictions that have treaty agreements with the country where you want to invest, and where you have or could have subsidiaries through which the investment could be made.

For example, lets assume that an investor is a national of country A with a subsidiary company in country B, and they wish to invest in country C.

If there are not investment agreements in place between country A and country B, but there is an investment agreement between countries B and C, then the investor could structure their investment in country C through their subsidiary in country B to obtain investment protections."
Cooley,US Investors Can Take Advantage of International Treaties to Structure Foreign Investments,"Finally, investments could be structured through new companies to take advantage of treaty protections, but you must take care, as some treaties contain provisions excluding protection for shell companies that have been incorporated only to obtain investment treaty benefits.

Where are good locations to incorporate holding companies?

Some jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, the British Virgin Islands, Jersey and the Isle of Man, combine tax advantages with a robust network of investment treaty protection.

However, these are not the only jurisdictions that you should consider  your preferred jurisdiction will depend on a range of commercial and legal factors."

Cooley,"IRS Clarifies Guidance on Treatment of Research, Experimentation Expenditures","The IRS recently released Notice 2024-12 , which provides some clarifications and modifications to prior IRS guidance relating to the tax treatment of specified research and experimentation (SRE) expenditures pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174.

For background information regarding SRE expenditures and IRC Section 174, please refer to our May 2023 and September 2023 Cooley client alerts.

Applicability date and consistency Notice 2024-12 reiterates statements in Notice 2023-63 (the subject of the September 2023 Cooley client alert) that it is anticipated that forthcoming proposed regulations consistent with Notice 2023-63 would apply for tax years ending after September 8, 2023, but until proposed regulations are issued, taxpayers may rely on the rules in Notice 2023-63 for expenditures paid or incurred in any tax year beginning after December 31, 2021, provided the taxpayer relies on them in a consistent manner.

To facilitate reliance on the rules in Notice 2023-63 in a more administrable manner, however, Notice 2024-12 modifies Notice 2023-63 to remove the requirement that a taxpayer must rely on all the rules in Notice 2023-63 if the taxpayer chooses to rely on any of them.

Notice 2024-12 similarly is effective as of September 8, 2023, and can be relied on for expenditures paid or incurred in any tax year beginning after December 31, 2021.

Contract research and experimentation Notice 2023-63 provided that taxpayers are required to capitalize amounts paid to any third party (a contract researcher) to perform laboratory science, software development or other qualifying research activities on behalf of the taxpayer or its affiliates.

A contract researcher that gets paid for research and experimentation work regardless of whether the research succeeds or fails generally is not required to capitalize its research costs.

However, a contract researcher will be required to capitalize its research experimentation costs to the extent that one or more of the following applies: The contract researcher bears financial risk in connection with the research.

The contract researchers compensation is contingent on the results of the research.

The contract researcher has a right to use or exploit the results of the research, or retains any rights to the intellectual property developed as part of the research (an SRE product right).

Notice 2024-12 clarifies the above rules to provide that if a contract researcher does not bear financial risk under the terms of the contract with the research recipient and the contract researcher obtains an SRE product right that is separately bargained for (i.e., arose from consideration other than the cost paid or incurred by the contract researcher to perform SRE activities under that contract) or was acquired for the limited purpose of performing SRE activities under that contract or another contract with the research recipient, but does not obtain any other SRE product right under the terms of such contract, then the costs paid or incurred by the contract researcher to perform SRE activities on behalf of the research recipient under such contract are not required to be capitalized.

Subsequent developments Proposed regulations are expected in the second quarter of 2024.

Congress is working on delaying the effective date of the change to IRC Section 174, but only for domestic research and experimentation costs.

If you have questions about how these changes may affect your company, we strongly advise you to contact a member of the Cooley tax team, your accountant or other tax adviser."

Cooley,"CFPB Issues Proposal to Limit Overdraft Fees at Large Banks, Treat Overdrafts as Credit Product","On January 17, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would treat discretionary overdraft services offered by banks with more than $10 billion in assets as credit, bringing them for the first time under Regulation Z, the implementing regulation of the Truth in Lending Act.

As a result, such products would be treated like credit cards, with consumers utilizing overdraft services receiving new disclosures and being evaluated for their ability to repay the obligation.

However, the proposed rule would create an exemption for courtesy overdraft services  which are services where the overdraft fee covered only the break-even cost of the service or fell within a CFPB-prescribed break-even cost.

The CFPB is requiring comments on the proposed rule by April 1, 2024, and hopes that a final rule will take effect by October 1, 2025.

Under proposed rule, large banks would need to significantly revise discretionary overdraft services fees or be subject to fee cap Overdraft fee restrictions The CFPB proposes to amend Regulation Z to include overdraft services offered by large banks, unless they are provided at or below costs and losses and, as referred to by the CFPB, as a true courtesy to consumers.

Large banks seeking to rely on the courtesy exemption could do either of the following: Calculate the fee by analyzing their own costs and losses.

Rely on the benchmark fee set by the CFPB.

The CFPB indicates it is considering a benchmark fee of $3, $6, $7 or $14, but did not specifically identify the amount and seeks comment on the appropriate benchmark.

Large banks offering overdraft services priced above either the calculated costs or the benchmark fee would be deemed to have offered credit subject to a finance charge.

As a result, these services would be subject to a host of Regulation Z requirements  including with respect to advertising, periodic statement delivery and account opening disclosure requirements.

The proposal would treat transfer fees and other related charges as finance charges imposed in connection with an overdraft credit feature.

Overdraft accounts The CFPB also proposes to require large banks to place overdraft services in a credit account separate from the asset account.

These accounts would be subject to the open-end credit provisions of Regulation Z. Overdraft services accessible by debit card also would be subject to the restrictions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009  such as the ability to pay provisions, rate reevaluation requirements, first-year fee restriction, payment allocation provisions, prohibition against declined transaction fees and penalty fee restrictions.

Overdraft accounts also would be subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, meaning the CFPB could examine overdraft practices for potential discrimination in the administration of the accounts.

Overdraft repayment methods Finally, large banks would be subject to the compulsory use provision under Regulation E, which prohibits requiring consumers to use preauthorized electronic fund transfers for repayment of overdraft credit.

As a result, large banks could not condition the provision of overdraft services on the consumers agreement to permit automatic payments from the consumers checking account.

While a consumer may still be given the choice to opt into automatic payments, the proposal would allow consumers to use at least one alternative method of repayment.

Interplay with Regulation E Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) currently provides that the term overdraft service does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit subject to Regulation Z including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit or overdraft line of credit."
Cooley,"CFPB Issues Proposal to Limit Overdraft Fees at Large Banks, Treat Overdrafts as Credit Product","The proposed rule would provide that covered overdraft credit, which includes the break-even overdraft services offered by large banks described above, is not an overdraft service under Regulation E because it is a credit subject to Regulation Z.

Accordingly, if large bank consumers are offered covered overdraft credit, that covered overdraft credit would not be subject to the Regulation E overdraft service opt-in requirements.

Whats next?

As noted above, the CFPB is requesting comments on the proposal by April 1, 2024, and hopes a final rule will take effect by October 1, 2025.

If implemented, the rule would undoubtedly change the manner in which large banks offer and administer overdraft programs.

Although the CFPB excluded banks with under $10 billion in assets from the rule, the proposal lays bare the bureaus policy priorities around deposit-related fee assessment, and all parties  particularly small banks and neobanks  should take note of the concerns the CFPB seeks to address through this rulemaking."
Cooley,EU Court of Justice Ruling on M&A ‘Gun-Jumping’ Sets 115 Million-Euro Fine,"Merger review has become an ever more critical path to successful M&A completion, as enforcement agencies, including the European Commission (EC), apply closer scrutiny to potential anti-competitive effects of M&A deals.

With closing timelines extended as a result, and because parties need to comply with mandatory standstill rules pending merger clearance, pre-closing integration planning and interaction have become more critical.

But the pressures to complete a signed deal swiftly, and to realize the investment value, must be balanced carefully so the parties avoid jumping the gun on the enforcers assessment.

The November 2023 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Altice v. European Commission provides critical guidance on permitted and prohibited pre-closing interaction between merging parties.

Background Altice is a multinational cable and telecommunications company based in the Netherlands.

Under a share purchase agreement (SPA) on December 9, 2014, it agreed to purchase PT Portugal, a rival telecommunications and multimedia company active in Portugal, from Oi.

The 7.4 billion-euro deal was notified to the EC for review under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR), and the EC cleared the transaction (subject to certain conditions) on April 20, 2015, following a Phase I review.

Three years later, on April 24, 2018, the EC adopted a second decision concerning the transaction.

In this decision, the EC concluded that, in the four-month period between signing of the SPA and the ECs clearance decision, Altice had breached two distinct obligations that the EUMR imposes on transaction parties, because: The SPAs pre-closing covenants afforded Altice the right to exercise decisive influence over PT Portugal.

In some instances, Altice had actually exercised decisive influence over aspects of PT Portugals business.

The rights accrued, and the conduct took place, before the EC had adopted its (conditional) clearance decision, so Altice was found to have breached the standstill obligation per Article 7(1) EUMR, which provides that a notifiable transaction must not be implemented prior to clearance.

In fact, some rights accrued, and some conduct took place, after the SPA had been signed but before the deal was notified for merger review; Altice therefore also was found to have breached the obligation per Article 4(1) of the EUMR to not implement such a transaction prior to its notification.

Altice was fined 62.25 million euros for each infringement  in total, 124.5 million euros.

Altice appealed against the ECs 2018 decision to the General Court of the European Union (GC), requesting an annulment of the decision or a reduction of the fines imposed.

In a judgment adopted on September 22, 2021 , the GC upheld the ECs findings regarding Altices breaches of the EUMR, but it reduced (slightly) one of the fines to 56 million euros, for a total of 118.25 million euros in fines.

The CJEU, in its November 9, 2023 , ruling on Altices final appeal, largely upheld the GCs judgment: The findings regarding infringements were upheld, but one fine was (slightly) adjusted on formal grounds, this time to 52.9 million euros.

The total fine of 115.16 million euros was the EUs second-highest fine for a gun-jumping violation, exceeded only by a highly contested 432 million-euro fine imposed in 2023 .

The CJEUs judgment includes several pointers that dealmakers should consider in order to avoid unnecessary exposure to severe fines in deal-critical pre-closing engagement and integration planning.

Unlawful deal implementation First, the CJEU confirmed that an M&A deal that is notifiable under the EUMR can be implemented prematurely if the acquirer has the possibility, prior to clearance, to undertake certain actions; it is not necessary that those actions are actually carried out."
Cooley,EU Court of Justice Ruling on M&A ‘Gun-Jumping’ Sets 115 Million-Euro Fine,"The CJEU anchored the analysis in its previous Ernst & Young P/S v. Konkurrencerdet ruling , holding that implementation arises as soon as the transaction parties implement operations contributing to a lasting change in the control of the target.

Under the EUMR, control involves the possibility of exercising a decisive influence over the target, and it may be exercised by one firm unilaterally or together with one or more others.

In other words, it is not necessary to actually take any action  it is sufficient that an acquirer has been afforded rights, contracts or other means that enable its exercise of decisive influence on the target.

The CJEU also held that partial implementation, even by conduct of limited duration, may involve implementation, as such conduct can contribute to a lasting change of control.

Pre-closing covenants involving premature implementation Second, the CJEU confirmed that the acquisition had been prematurely implemented already when the buyer and seller signed the SPA, as pre-closing covenants in that agreement afforded the buyer the possibility to exercise decisive influence over the target.

The EC had explained in the decision on appeal that it agreed with Altice that it was both common and appropriate to include clauses in an SPA aimed at protecting the value of the target business between signing and closing.

However, such pre-closing covenants could only be justified to the extent that they were strictly necessary to ensure that the value of the target was maintained and did not afford the buyer the possibility of exercising decisive influence over the target.

In its decision, the EC identified three classes of covenants which, in its view, allowed Altice to exercise decisive influence over the target by way of certain veto rights.

More specifically, according to the SPA, the seller had to obtain the buyers written consent regarding: The targets senior management structure: The buyers written consent was needed to appoint, dismiss, or make changes to contracts with the targets officers or directors, which gave the buyer powers to co-determine the structure of the targets senior management.

The targets pricing policy: The buyers written consent was in effect required for any decision on changes to the targets pricing and customer contracts, which gave the buyer the possibility to also co-determine those matters.

The targets contracts: The buyers prior written consent was necessary for all the targets material contracts, regardless of whether these were in the ordinary course of business, so in light of the commercial matters covered, and the low monetary thresholds set for consent, the buyer also was granted wide-ranging influence in this respect.

The EC (and the GC, on appeal) found that the veto rights over each item went beyond what was necessary to preserve the value of the target and afforded the buyer the power to exercise decisive influence over the target.

Before the CJEU, Altice argued that the nature of the rights it held had been misinterpreted.

The CJEU disagreed, and it also held that the fact that Altice was entitled to compensation, if the seller failed to comply with its obligations under the SPA, confirmed that these were indeed veto rights.

Because Altice was afforded these rights, which conferred the power to exercise decisive influence, under the SPA, the parties had implemented, at least in part, the acquisition prematurely on execution of that agreement.

Buyers involvement in targets commercial decisions Third, the CJEU confirmed that the transaction had been implemented prematurely also because the buyer actually had exercised decisive influence over the target.

In part, this had occurred as a function of the parties adhering to the SPAs pre-closing covenants."
Cooley,EU Court of Justice Ruling on M&A ‘Gun-Jumping’ Sets 115 Million-Euro Fine,"In part, this had occurred as a function of the parties adhering to the SPAs pre-closing covenants.

The EC had found that the seller or the target on seven occasions prior to merger clearance had requested the sellers instructions on commercial matters and acted in accordance with the instructions they received in return, and the GC agreed with this assessment.

Weve outlined those seven instances below.

Commercial campaign The target sought and received the buyers agreement concerning the main features of a commercial campaign for post-paid mobile tariff plans.

The buyer monitored the results of the implementation of the campaign to decide whether to continue with it or stop it.

Thus, the buyer was directly involved in the targets competitive strategy on the market through the decision-making process related to this commercial campaign.

Distribution contract 1

The target was evaluating whether to renew a contract regarding the distribution of a TV channel, Porto Canal, via the targets pay-TV service.

The buyer and the target discussed and agreed on the negotiation strategy, and the buyer consented to continued negotiations.

Consequently, the buyer was directly involved in setting the targets and the negotiating strategy regarding the renewal of the contract, and thus, in the targets competitive strategy on the market in which the buyer was itself competing via its subsidiaries.

Distribution contract 2

The target was in discussions with a video content supplier, Cinemundo, regarding agreements on content distributed via the targets pay-TV service.

The target sought guidance from the buyer regarding the terms.

The buyer provided guidance, with reference to its commercial policy.

Therefore, the buyer was directly involved in defining the terms for the negotiation of the supply agreement, and thus, in the targets competitive strategy on the market in which the buyer was itself competing via its subsidiaries.

Distribution contract 3

The seller sought the buyers instructions concerning the potential inclusion of a new TV channel, DOG TV, on the targets pay-TV service.

The buyer denied consent and requested further information.

The seller responded with granular details of the revenue sharing model foreseen.

Hence, the buyer was directly involved in such decision, which formed part of the targets competitive strategy on the market in which the buyer was itself competing via its subsidiaries.

Outsourcing contract The target won a tender to provide outsourcing services and solutions to a Portuguese agribusiness.

The seller sought the buyers approval for the investments required to provide the services.

The seller provided additional information requested by the buyer and, in parallel, the buyer and the target were in telephone contact regarding this contract.

Consequently, the buyer was engaged in the commercial policy of the target that formed part of the targets business strategy.

Supplier contracts The target was planning to reduce the number of radio access network (RAN) suppliers it used.

The target asked the buyer for instructions on whether it should continue the selection process or wait until the acquisition had closed, suggesting a preference for continuing with the selection process.

However, the buyer decided to wait until the acquisition was closed.

Therefore, the buyer was directly involved in establishing the targets selection process for RAN suppliers and, thus, in its competitive strategy.

Joint venture exit The target received a letter of intent concerning the sale of its shares in SIRESP, a joint venture (JV).

The seller informed the buyer that it did not intend to exit or increase its stake by exercising its preemptive rights, and it requested permission to formally reject the offer.

The buyer requested and received from the seller further information on the JVs business plan, on a JV service contract, and on the targets valuation of the shares."
Cooley,EU Court of Justice Ruling on M&A ‘Gun-Jumping’ Sets 115 Million-Euro Fine,"The buyer requested and received from the seller further information on the JVs business plan, on a JV service contract, and on the targets valuation of the shares.

The buyer confirmed that it was not willing to sell the targets stake in the JV, and that it wanted, instead, the target to make a counteroffer to acquire sole control of the JV.

The seller also requested to be involved in the negotiation process.

As a result, the buyer was directly involved in decisions related to M&A activity, which formed part of the targets competitive strategy on the market.

Before the CJEU, Altice argued that such consultation as had occurred between the parties did not amount to implementation.

The CJEU flatly rejected this argument, referring to its assessment of the SPAs pre-closing covenants and veto rights (as we explained earlier).

Commercially sensitive information exchanged between target and buyer Fourth, the CJEU confirmed that information exchanges contributing to the implementation of a concentration should be assessed under the EUMR, and not only under general EU law on anticompetitive conduct between firms ( Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ).

In addition to the seven instances discussed above, the EC found that the target and the buyer engaged in systematic and extensive information exchanges, where the target provided commercially sensitive information to the buyer.

According to the EC, these exchanges contributed to showing that the buyer exercised decisive influence on certain aspects of the target's business, as the buyer only would have been entitled to such granular, strategic and up-to-date data once it had become the targets shareholder.

The GC upheld the ECs findings.

Before the CJEU, Altice argued that the GC, in doing so, had unlawfully extended the standstill requirements of the EUMR to cover exchanges that ought to have been analyzed under the general competition law rules on restrictive practices.

The CJEU gave this argument short shrift.

Considerations for dealmakers Parties need to be conscious that unlawful implementation under the EUMR can arise prior to notification as well as after notification and prior to clearance.

These are two distinct offenses and even partial implementation of limited duration may cross the line.

ECs wide discretion The EC has a wide margin of discretion in identifying unlawful implementation under the EUMR.

It is not a question of whether competition has been distorted or was at risk of being distorted, but a formal assessment that centers on whether the buyer prematurely was given the possibility of exercising a decisive influence over the target.

Transaction agreements That possibility may arise from the transaction agreement, which must be drafted carefully to ensure that interactions between the parties do not cross the line.

The basic premise in this context is that, until closing, the parties remain independent, and should make decisions independently of one another prior to merger clearance.

Pre-closing covenants Pre-closing covenants should be scrutinized closely and justified by the strict need to preserve the value of the target and must not afford the buyer the possibility of exerting a decisive influence over the target.

This means that, for instance, operational control should remain with the seller pending completion of the merger review, matters subject to interaction should be calibrated carefully, and consent rights for the buyer should be avoided for issues pertaining to the targets business operations, the commercial policy and management structure.

Information exchanges The possibility of exerting decisive influence also can arise from integration planning, which should be focused on post-merger integration.

Information exchange after signing is not prohibited but should be subject to the same safeguards as pre-signing."
Cooley,EU Court of Justice Ruling on M&A ‘Gun-Jumping’ Sets 115 Million-Euro Fine,"Information exchange after signing is not prohibited but should be subject to the same safeguards as pre-signing.

In particular, exchanges of commercially sensitive information should be limited to what is strictly necessary and only occur with established guardrails, such as clean team arrangements  or the exchanges may be taken as evidence of premature implementation in breach of the EUMR.

In addition, if the firms are actual or potential competitors, the exchanges may also fall foul of the general competition law rules.

Larger gun-jumping fines Premature implementation under the EUMR entails serious financial exposure.

In the Altice case, the fines imposed exceeded 115 million euros.

That is a substantial amount, but the EC is entitled to impose gun-jumping fines of up to 10% of a firms aggregate worldwide turnover and, as mentioned, transgressions that take place before and after merger notification constitute separate offenses.

Advance analysis and planning The risks associated with premature implementation are avoidable.

In spite of the Altice judgment, it is possible for firms to agree on and protect the full value of M&A investments prior to merger clearance, and to plan for successful integration of the acquired firm for the future.

Careful advance analysis and planning, in light of the requirements of the EUMR (and other merger control regimes that may be applicable), is the key to success in this regard."
Cooley,"Immediate Obligations for Employers With Noncompete, Customer Nonsolicitation Provisions for California Employees","A new California law, Assembly Bill 1076 , requires employers to provide notice to certain current and former employees by February 14, 2024 , if their employment agreements contain provisions unenforceable under California law.

Employers with California employees should promptly take steps to assess whether any of their California employees need to be sent notice required under AB 1076, as described below.

AB 1076 Signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on October 13, 2023, and effective January 1, 2024, AB 1076 amends Section 16600 of the states Business and Professions Code to void the application of any noncompete agreement in an employment context, or any noncompete clause in an employment contract, no matter how narrowly tailored.

The law provides that Section 16600 should be read broadly, and, as such, its reach is not limited to noncompete provisions, but also includes customer nonsolicitation provisions and similar provisions unenforceable under California law.

Specifically, AB 1076 requires employers to send a notice to current and former employees for whom all of these conditions apply: They were employed by the company after January 1, 2022.

They are located in California.

They signed an employment agreement containing a noncompete provision, customer nonsolicitation provision or other similar provision that is unenforceable under California law.

The notice must inform employees that the provisions are void in California.

This requirement applies even if the provision was enforceable in another state at the time it was executed, such as in the case where an employee signed an enforceable noncompete agreement in New York and has since relocated to California without signing a new agreement compliant with California law.

The notice, which must be completed by February 14, 2024 , must be written and delivered to the employees last known postal address and email address.

Failing to provide such notice constitutes a violation of the states Unfair Competition Law, which carries civil penalties.

Next steps Employers with California employees should immediately review any applicable agreements signed by those employees, including any employee who may have relocated to the state after signing an enforceable agreement outside of California.

Cooley clients who may be affected by this law should consult with a member of Cooleys employment team or reach out to their primary contact at Cooley to determine whether any of their employees need to receive notice and, if so, to draft a compliant notice for affected employees."
Cooley,"CFPB Issues Background Screening, File Disclosure Advisory Opinions","On January 11, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued two advisory opinions addressing consumer reporting agencies' (CRAs) obligations, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), related to information included in background check reports and consumer file disclosures.

The advisory opinions expand on a coordinated federal agency effort, initiated by the White Houses January 2023 Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights , and led, in part, by the CFPB, to ensure that the background screening industry adheres to the law and tenant screening companies do not illegally disseminate false and misleading information about tenants and that tenants can challenge erroneous information.

The White House issued further measures in July 2023 , which included agency guidance communicating the Biden administrations expectations on informing renters of what information in their screening report is responsible for their application being denied.

The advisory opinions, along with the accompanying press release , also represent one more step toward the bureaus broad goal of ensuring that the consumer reporting system produces accurate and reliable information and does not keep people from accessing their personal data.

Background screening The first advisory opinion solidifies the CFPBs position that, to comply with the FCRAs general requirement that CRAs follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy, CRAs furnishing background screening reports must have procedures in place to:

Prevent the reporting of information that is duplicative, or that has otherwise been expunged, sealed, or is legally restricted.

Include existing disposition information if they report arrests, criminal charges, eviction proceedings or other court filings.

To the extent that adverse information is included in consumer reports, the opinion outlines when the reporting period for adverse items begins, and how subsequent events, such as the disposition of a criminal matter, affect how the item should be reported.

The advisory opinion is particularly focused on the use of background screening reports for tenant and employment screening, even though such reports may be used in a variety of contexts.

In the tenant screening context, the bureau highlights that the consequences of inaccurate reporting may preclude consumers from securing housing or may result in consumers paying more for housing than they otherwise would have.

In the employment context, the CFPB cites consequences such as inappropriate rejection of job applications, failure to obtain promotions or termination.

The opinion also reemphasizes the CFPBs commitment to working with other agencies to address the potential ill effects of inaccuracies in tenant and employment screening reports.

In November 2022, for example, the CFPB published two reports highlighting issues with tenant background checks and, in doing so, noted that it works closely with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to hold the tenant screening industry accountable.

Further, in February 2023, the CFPB and the FTC jointly issued a request for information aimed at gathering information on use of tenant screening reports.

Also notable is last years announcement of an information sharing agreement between the CFPB and the National Labor Relations Board with the goal of protecting American workers in labor and financial markets.

Although the immediate focus of the agreement was on employer-driven debt and employer surveillance and sale of data, the CFPB also may leverage this agreement to scrutinize information included in background check reports and utilized by employers, including how such information impacts consumers."
Cooley,"CFPB Issues Background Screening, File Disclosure Advisory Opinions","Consumer file disclosure In the second advisory opinion , the bureau stresses CRAs obligation to deliver all information in a consumers file to the consumer upon their request  an effort the bureau claims is necessary to address what it characterizes as sloppy credit file sharing practices.

The opinion explains that the disclosure of a persons complete consumer reporting file, upon their request, is a critical component of a persons right to dispute false or misleading information.

Accordingly, the CFPB clarifies that, in its view, individuals need not use specific language or industry jargon (such as complete file or even file) when requesting their information, but rather only need to lodge the request and provide proper identification to access their complete file.

The opinion also explains that information presented to the consumer in response to a file disclosure request must be in a form that will assist them in identifying inaccuracies, exercising their rights to dispute any incomplete or inaccurate information, and understanding when they are being impacted by adverse information.

The advisory opinion also reflects the CFPBs position that, in connection with a consumers file disclosure request, a CRA must: Provide the consumer with all information that formed the basis of any summarized information (e.g., a credit risk score or tenant screening score) that the CRA provided to the user, rather than the summary alone.

Disclose all sources of any item of information in the consumers file, meaning the original source and any intermediary or vendor source (or sources) that provide the item of information from the original source to the CRA.

Looking ahead The two advisory opinions are part of the CFPBs continued commitment to addressing inaccuracies in consumer reports, including through broad interpretation of the FCRA and demonstrated cooperation with other agencies.

Given the multiagency, and White House, interest in this issue  particularly as it relates to rental housing and employment  additional coordinated action is expected.

To that end, CRAs, including background screening companies, should assess the adequacy of their procedures in light of the opinions, and continue to monitor activity around the CFPBs plan to expand the FCRAs reach through formal rulemaking, as reflected in the CFPBs outline of proposals and alternatives under consideration .

Given that one purpose of the planned rulemaking is to address issues that have arisen in the years since the FCRAs enactment, or that are areas of particular risk for consumer harm, it may be informed by issues identified in the CFPB advisory opinions and ultimately result in enhanced compliance responsibilities for CRAs, as well as other participants in the consumer reporting ecosystem."

Cooley,Landmark Product Safety Prosecution May Signal Sea Change,"Editor's note: Authored by Daniel Grooms, Matt Howsare and Shawn Skolky, this article was originally published in Law360 .

In November 2023, a jury convicted two corporate executives of conspiracy and failure to report information about defective residential dehumidifiers, as required by the Consumer Product Safety Act.[1]

The jury verdict in U.S. v. Chu is groundbreaking because it is the first-ever criminal conviction of corporate executives for failure to report under the CPSA.

The judge's decision on sentencing for the two defendants will likely put an end to the yearslong series of civil and criminal enforcement actions involving multiple Gree companies relating to the recalled dehumidifiers.

The numerous actions over prior years were related to the companies' recalls of multiple dehumidifiers linked to over ""450 reported fires and millions of dollars in property damage.

""[2]

Under Section 15(b) of the CPSA, manufacturers, importers and distributors of consumer products are required to immediatelyreport information that ""reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard"" or ""creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.

""[3]

Though companies are required to immediately report to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission when Section 15(b) reporting thresholds are met, the government alleged that the Gree companies were aware of numerous incidents and significant property damage, but chose not to submit a Section 15(b) report to the CPSC.

The government alleged that the information in Gree's possession should have given rise to a reporting obligation sooner than when the company eventually reported.[4] In 2016, following a recall, the Gree companies agreed to pay a nearly $15.5 million civil penalty to settle CPSC staff charges of knowingly violating the CPSA's reporting requirement, using a false UL product certification mark and making material misrepresentations to the federal government.[5]

But that did not end the saga for the Gree companies.

In 2021, Gree USA Inc. agreed to plead guilty to a felony[6]  knowingly and willfully failing to report to the CPSC  and the other companies entered into a deferred prosecution agreement related to the same charge.[7]

The companies' criminal resolution included a $91 million penalty and represented the first corporate criminal enforcement actions ever brought for failure to report a product safety issue as required by the CPSA.[8]

At the same time the corporate prosecution was pending, the U.S. Department of Justice also individually indicted Gree USA's former chief administrative officer, Simon Chu, and former CEO, Charley Loh.

The March 2019 indictment,[9] which was sought and filed during the Trump administration, alleged that the two executives had ""received multiple reports that [the dehumidifiers] were defective, dangerous and could catch fire,"" but failed to disclose these hazards to the CPSC for at least six months while they continued to sell the defective products  all while allegedly knowing that they were required to report this information.[10] Following a six-day trial in November 2023, a jury in theU.S. District Court for the Central District of Californiafound both executives guilty of conspiracy and failure to immediately report required information under the CPSA.

This first-of-its-kind prosecution and guilty verdict against corporate officers reflects the CPSC's and the DOJ's increasingly aggressive approach to enforcing the CPSA and holding corporate executives accountable for misconduct.

Companies making or selling products subject to the CPSA should be mindful of the increased enforcement focus and potential for corporate and individual criminal exposure that, regardless of administration, appears poised to continue.

Read on for more about criminal enforcement under the CPSA.

Reporting Requirement Under the CPSA"
Cooley,Landmark Product Safety Prosecution May Signal Sea Change,"Read on for more about criminal enforcement under the CPSA.

Reporting Requirement Under the CPSA

The CPSA was enacted in 1972 to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury from consumer products.[11]

It imposes an affirmative reporting requirement on manufacturers, importers and distributors of consumer products, which also applies to the directors, officers and agents of those companies.

Information must be reported when it ""reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard"" or ""creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.""

In practice, the CPSC advises, ""when in doubt, report.

""[12]

Given the interplay with consumer product safety, Congress purposefully set a tight deadline for this reporting obligation in the CPSA.

Such information must be reported ""immediately""  meaning ""within 24 hours of obtaining reportable information,"" though CPSC's implementing regulations also allow companies time to conduct a reasonable investigation, not to exceed 10 working days.[13] Failure to timely report the information required under the CPSA can result in civil penalties, which are currently capped at $120,000 per violation and about $17 million ""for any related series of violations.

""[14]

With respect to civil penalties, companies may be subject to monetary penalties if they knowingly violate the law, which is not a particularly high bar because ""knowledge"" includes information that a reasonable company should have had while exercising due care.[15]

The CPSA also provides for criminal penalties  and imprisonment of up to five years  for not only knowing, but also willful, violations, i.e., where a company knew of its legal obligation to report but voluntarily and intentionally chose not to do so.[16]

For individual officers or directors of a company, the CPSA provides for criminal penalties for knowing and willful authorization of the violation of law.[17]

This provision of the CPSA had never been utilized by the DOJ for the CPSA's Section 15(b) reporting violations before  until now.

The Road Ahead: Increased Focus on Criminal Enforcement While the CPSC has not historically pursued criminal enforcement for violations of the CPSA, signs point to this being the leading edge of a potential sea change at the commission.

For example, the CPSC's fiscal year 2023 operating plan reflected an intention to review ""all civil penalty cases for potential criminal referral to the Department of Justice""[18]  a sentiment repeated within the fiscal year 2024 operating plan.[19] And a unanimous and bipartisan contingent of current CPSC commissioners have strongly voiced their intention to place more emphasis on the role of criminal penalties.

Chair Alex Hoehn-Saric, for example, noted that ""[f]ailure to report in a timely fashion will result in an investigation and CPSC will pursue significant civil and potentially criminal penalties.

""[20] Commissioner Richard Trumka also made clear that ""this Commission is serious about deterring corporate misconduct using every tool at our disposal, including the appropriate use of civil penalties and, where warranted, criminal referrals.

""[21] Commissioner Peter Feldman similarly noted in the wake of Chu and Loh's convictions that ""CPSC and its federal partners will use all available tools to keep consumers safe.

""[22]

And finally, Commissioner Mary Boyle stated that ""[c]ivil  and potentially criminal  penalties are essential to ensure that the interests of consumers are given their due.

""[23] While Gree is the first case involving corporate and individual criminal exposure for a violation of the CPSA, it assuredly will not be the last.

The DOJ Consumer Protection Branch, working alongside the U.S. attorney's offices, appears to have the appetite to pursue additional criminal investigations and prosecutions under the CPSA."
Cooley,Landmark Product Safety Prosecution May Signal Sea Change,"The DOJ Consumer Protection Branch, working alongside the U.S. attorney's offices, appears to have the appetite to pursue additional criminal investigations and prosecutions under the CPSA.

In fact, Generac Power Systems Inc. recently disclosed that in July 2023 it received a grand jury subpoena related to its failure to timely submit a report about defective portable generators.[24]

This criminal investigation follows Generac's May 2023 settlement with the CPSC, under which it agreed to pay a civil fine of $15.8 million and implement and maintain a compliance program and certain internal controls to ensure compliance with the CPSA.[25]

As Hoehn-Saric cautioned last year, ""companies should be on notice that the agency will be even more aggressive in the future.

""[26]

And, in the words of Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ's Consumer Protection Branch Arun Rao, ""holding corporations and those who act on their behalf (such as managers who attempt to conceal potentially dangerous problems from customers ... ) responsible for criminal wrongdoing has been, and remains, an important priority of the department.

""[27]

The writing appears to be on the wall that, where there are indications of a willful violation, CPSC already is, and will continue, closely scrutinizing a company's behavior through both a lens of civil penalty enforcement and referral to the DOJ for criminal prosecution.

What This Means for Companies Given the CPSC's increased focus on criminal referrals, companies should assess criminal exposure risk as part of regulatory investigations related to potential violations of the CPSA.

Corporate executives should also have it in the back of their mind when acting on recommendations of whether a product safety issue warrants a Section 15(b) report to the CPSC.

A realistic scenario in which a corporate executive should strongly consider the risk of potential criminal investigation is when an internal recommendation has been made to submit a Section 15(b) report, but the executive or a group of senior leaders chooses not to submit a report and instead takes other action.

In this situation, or in any situation in which a decision is made to forego a Section 15(b) report, strong consideration should be given to creating a contemporaneous record that documents the reasonable and good faith basis for choosing not to report at that time based on the factors outlined in CPSC's reporting regulations.

To ensure recommendations on product safety issues are timely identified and escalated to senior managers, companies should take proactive steps to enhance their regulatory compliance and Section 15(b) reporting programs.

This includes establishing clear policies and procedures for handling sources of potential product safety issues, regardless of whether those originate from customer service calls, online reviews, warranty claims, safety-related design changes, concerns raised within the company or other sources.

Companies should also train responsible employees on Section 15(b) reporting obligations and the appropriate identification and internal handling of product safety-related information.

Beyond the regulatory compliance and Section 15(b) reporting components, companies should have robust internal compliance mechanisms that focus on both risk mitigation and accountability.

As only one example, to promote robust compliance and accountability for employees at every level, companies should have policies in place governing employee communications.

Companies should also ensure those communications are appropriately preserved and maintained in accordance with internal document retention policies.

In the context of a government investigation or litigation, these communications will be produced and form the basis for reconstructing what happened during the time period being investigated."
Cooley,Landmark Product Safety Prosecution May Signal Sea Change,"In the context of a government investigation or litigation, these communications will be produced and form the basis for reconstructing what happened during the time period being investigated.

This includes managing the usage of ephemeral messaging tools that might not be captured by company systems and having policies regarding the appropriate use of personal devices, such as mobile phones.

Compliance is an ongoing process.

Effective compliance programs should be tested and modified over time.

Periodic audits should focus on areas of greatest compliance risk and look for opportunities to improve on existing policies and procedures.

Compliance also should be evaluated in real time, including immediate review of significant product safety issues that have recently concluded for any lessons learned prior to memories fading or key personnel departing.

Finally, compliance is a cultural issue.

Companies should establish a culture that expects compliance, and reinforce that expectation through the tone from the top and through all levels of the organization.

Cooley,FDA Greenlights Florida’s Proposal for Importing Prescription Drugs From Canada,"On Friday, January 5, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the Section 804 Importation Program (SIP) proposal of Floridas Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA).

1

The SIP is a pathway that allows importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada, if FDA determines that the importation poses no additional risk to public health and safety and achieves significant reduction in the cost of covered products for American consumers.

2

While Florida is the first state to receive authorization for importation under Section 804, its recent authorization may lead to renewed activity in this area from other states, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, but many questions remain unanswered.

Background on the SIP In 2000, Congress added Section 804 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), directing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promulgate regulations permitting pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs into the US from certain industrialized countries.

Section 804 was later amended by Congress in 2003 to limit the country of origin to Canada.

On October 1, 2020, FDA issued a final rule implementing the Section 804 provisions, and the following month, on November 23, 2020, the FAHCA filed its SIP proposal.

In August 2022, Florida and the FAHCA filed suit against FDA and HHS, alleging that FDA had unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed a decision on the proposal.

FDA indicated an expectation to issue a decision on the Florida SIP proposal by October 2023; 3 however, additional questions regarding the anticipated reduction in cost to the public and the location of the warehouse for imported products necessitated an amended proposal from the FAHCA, which in turn pushed FDAs decision to January of this year.

SIP approval does not mean immediate importation of all prescription drugs from Canada While FDAs authorization allows the FAHCA to operate its importation program for an initial two-year period, it does not give Florida carte blanche to import Canadian drugs over FDA-approved products, as Section 804 and its implementing regulations  not to mention Canadian law  limit the drugs that are eligible for importation.

To be eligible for importation, drugs must be approved by Health Canada and must meet the conditions for FDA approval apart from FDA-approved labeling.

Certain categories of drugs  including biologics, controlled substances and drugs subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in the US are ineligible for importation through a SIP. 4 Drugs that cannot be repackaged without breaching the container closure system also are ineligible for importation.

5 Section 804 and its implementing regulations also place additional requirements on individual shipments of eligible drugs, which may slow the flow of medication from Canada to Floridians.

The FAHCA must submit  and FDA must grant  a Pre-Import Request for each drug shipment.

6 Following entry into the US, eligible prescription drugs also are subject to examination.

Although the importer is required to submit a Pre-Import Request at least 30 days prior to the scheduled arrival of a drug shipment, FDAs authorization letter indicates that both review of the Pre-Import Request and subsequent examination of the shipment may each take longer than 30 calendar days.

The manufacturer or importer also must conduct testing of the prescription drugs to ensure compliance with specifications and standards, 7 and the drugs must be relabeled to conform to the labeling of the applicable FDA-approved product, with the exception of the national drug code (NDC), lot number, name of importer, and a disclaimer that the drugs were imported from Canada under a SIP and without the authorization of the applicable US New Drug Application (NDA) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) holder.

8"
Cooley,FDA Greenlights Florida’s Proposal for Importing Prescription Drugs From Canada,"8

Finally, Canadian regulations preclude shipment of drugs outside of Canada if the shipments would cause or worsen a shortage of that drug within Canada.

In a January 8 press release , Health Canada stated that it has reminded regulated parties of this obligation, and that it will take immediate action to address any noncompliance in order to safeguard Canadas drug supply.

Bulk importation from Canada into the US is likely to be met with high scrutiny from Health Canada, which, in turn, may deter Canadian manufacturers and wholesalers from shipping products to Florida.

Looking ahead Currently, sponsorship of a SIP proposal may only be submitted by states and tribes within the US.

Based on publicly available information, at least five other states have submitted SIP proposals to FDA.

New Hampshires proposal was denied by FDA in November 2022, while the proposals of Colorado, Maine, New Mexico and Vermont are still pending.

9 North Dakota introduced a bill, and Texas enacted a law, allowing for a state drug importation program, 10 but they have not publicly stated whether they have submitted a SIP proposal to FDA, nor have they issued any public comment on FDAs approval of the Florida SIP.

11 FDAs long-awaited decision may spur further activity from these or other states.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) have voiced vehement opposition to importation under Section 804 due to safety concerns and have indicated that they are exploring all options in response to FDAs announcement.

PhRMA previously filed suit against HHS for alleged violations of the Administrative Procedures Act and the First Amendment; however, the case was dismissed for lack of standing at the time, as there was no certainty that a SIP would be authorized and no indication of which drugs would be granted importation.

With Floridas authorization in hand, plaintiffs should be able to overcome such justiciability challenges.

The FAHCA has indicated that it intends to begin by importing a small number of drug classes targeting chronic health conditions  such as HIV/AIDS, mental illness, prostate cancer and urea cycle disorder  for individuals under the care of Floridas Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Department of Children and Families, Department of Corrections and Department of Health.

The agency intends to later expand the program to include Medicaid participants.

Cooleys life sciences and healthcare regulatory practice is continuing to monitor developments in this area.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to a member of your Cooley team if you have questions about the SIP process or implications of FDAs recent actions.

Cooley senior regulatory analyst Kelly Marco also contributed to this alert.

Notes There is a separate pathway for importation of unapproved drugs under section 801 of the FDCA.

Under this multi-market approved product (MMA) pathway, drugs manufactured and authorized for sale outside of the US may obtain marketing approval if the manufacturer has authorized and labeled the drug for marketing in the US and has labeled it for marketing in the US.

See 21 USC 381.

21 USC 384(l)  Requiring the HHS to certify to Congress that implementation of the importation program poses no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost reduction for the covered products.

Cooley,"New Year, New Merger Guidelines: What Dealmakers Need to Know","As a capstone on the Biden administrations aggressive 2023 antitrust enforcement, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jointly issued revised Merger Guidelines before the holidays, replacing the Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued by the Obama administration in 2010 and the Vertical Merger Guidelines issued by the Trump administration in 2020.

The 2023 Merger Guidelines reflect many of the aggressive and novel theories of harm that the DOJ and FTC have pursued under the Biden administration through enforcement actions and also enunciated in speeches.

This alert puts the 2023 Merger Guidelines in the context of the overall antitrust enforcement climate, describes the key changes from preexisting guidelines and discusses what the guidelines mean for the future of antitrust enforcement and dealmakers.

Guidelines issued against aggressive enforcement backdrop As discussed in Cooleys July 2023 alert on the draft revised merger guidelines, the Biden administration has called for more aggressive antitrust enforcement, including greater scrutiny of M&A activity.

The agencies have answered the call, pursuing broader and more novel theories of harm.

For example, in attempting to block Amgens acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics , the FTC filed suit in federal court alleging the transaction would enable Amgen to leverage its portfolio of medicines to entrench monopoly positions of Horizons rare disease medications, despite the parties having no horizontal overlap or vertical relationship.

The transaction was allowed to proceed after the FTC reached a settlement agreement with the companies.

The 2023 Merger Guidelines  which answer President Joe Bidens directive in his Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy to address concerns around market consolidation by issuing new guidelines  memorialize the tack that the agencies have been taking in enforcement actions and speeches and provide a roadmap of what parties should expect to see in future merger enforcement actions.

The agencies tout the guidelines as providing transparency and reflecting modern market reality, though it is clear that they also are aimed at supporting an aggressive merger enforcement agenda  potentially so much so that it deters dealmaking.

In touting the FTCs track record under her leadership, FTC Chair Lina Khan referenced a quote from an Evercore investor in a November 2023 letter to Congress : The new regulatory team  already have succeeded in dissuading a series of business combinations which would have gone ahead in a different environment.

Khan concluded that [t]he fact that the FTCs work is driving this type of deterrence is a real mark of success.

Key provisions and changes from preexisting guidelines The 2023 Merger Guidelines are organized as 11 guides, six of which describe frameworks for identifying concerns and five of which describe how to apply those frameworks in specific situations.

Some of the guides are consistent with historic practices, some are more aggressive applications of historic practices and others present novel principles in modern antitrust enforcement.

Key principles include: 1.

Lower concentration thresholds and introduction of a 30% combined share threshold to trigger a structural presumption that a merger is illegal.

The 2023 Merger Guidelines continue to measure concentration by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) used in the 2010 guidelines, but have reduced the level of concentration under which a transaction will be presumed to risk substantially lessening competition and violating antitrust law back to levels first announced in 1982.

While stating that the guidelines presumption of illegality can be rebutted or disproved, the agencies place more emphasis on the merging parties combined market share as a factor that independently supports a presumption."
Cooley,"New Year, New Merger Guidelines: What Dealmakers Need to Know","Anticompetitive presumption 2010 Merger Guidelines 2023 Merger Guidelines Indicator 1: Post-merger HHI HHI greater than 2,500 HHI greater than 1,800 and HHI greater than 100 Indicator 2: Combined firm's market share N/A Combined share greater than 30% and HHI greater than 100 2.

Entrenchment or extension of dominant firms and acquisitions of nascent competitors.

The 2023 Merger Guidelines indicate heightened scrutiny for mergers involving a dominant incumbent with durable market power that may create or enhance barriers to entry, whether the merger is characterized as horizontal or vertical.

The guidelines highlight concerns regarding transactions where a dominant firm may eliminate a nascent competitive threat, which, according to the agencies, includes firms that could grow into a significant rival [or] facilitate other rivals growth.

Such nascent threats, according to the agencies, could include firms with niche or only partially overlapping products.

3.

Structural inference for vertical transactions.

The 2023 Merger Guidelines reflect the agencies position that they will infer, absent countervailing evidence, that a vertical merger is anticompetitive because it will allow foreclosure, where a combined firm will hold more than a 50% share in a market for a product, service, or route to market that rivals use to compete (i.e., a related product or service)  though that 50% number is buried in a footnote in the guidelines.

The guidelines identify two primary theories of competitive harm for vertical transactions: Where the combined firm may have the ability and incentive to raise rivals costs, foreclosing or limiting rivals access.

Where the transaction would facilitate access to rivals nonpublic competitively sensitive information.

4. Roll-up strategies and serial acquisitions.

The guidelines suggest scrutiny where a firm engages in a pattern or strategy of multiple acquisitions in the same or related business lines.

If there is a pattern or strategy of acquisitions, the agencies will examine the impact of the cumulative strategy  including a review of the firms history and current or future strategic incentives.

The principle implicitly targets private equity roll-up transactions, which DOJ Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter has characterized as very much at odds with the competition

[the agencies are] trying to protect.

5. Assessing competitive harm in labor markets.

The guidelines advise that the agencies will challenge mergers that may substantially lessen competition for workers, creators, suppliers, and service providers  including through lower wages, slower wage growth, diminished benefits, or worsened working conditions or workplace quality.

The guidelines also assert that labor markets can be relatively narrow based on unique characteristics, such as high switching costs, search frictions and worker needs.

6.

Concerns raised by partial ownership and minority interests.

The guidelines focus on three principles in analyzing partial and minority acquisitions: Control or influence of the target firm through governance rights.

Incentive to compete with the target firm.

Access to nonpublic competitively sensitive information that may facilitate coordination.

The guidelines include notable expansions from previous guidelines: Even nonvoting interests may provide opportunities to prevent, delay, or discourage important competitive initiatives, or otherwise impact competitive decision making.

In addition to coordination, a partial owner may use nonpublic competitively sensitive information to preempt or appropriate a rivals competitive business strategies for its own benefit.

The guidelines also express concern about common ownership, in which investors hold noncontrolling interests in firms that have a competitive relationship that could be affected by those joint holdings.

7. Assessing competition in deals involving multisided platforms."
Cooley,"New Year, New Merger Guidelines: What Dealmakers Need to Know","7. Assessing competition in deals involving multisided platforms.

The guidelines focus on multisided platforms  i.e., firms providing different products or services to two or more groups or sides that may benefit from each others participation  for the first time in agency guidelines and suggest that harm to competition involving multisided platforms may occur in various ways, including: Elimination of competition between platforms, including acquisitions by dominant platforms of smaller or up-and-coming platforms with specialized technology or services.

The acquisition of platform participants that may deprive rivals of participants and network effects.

The acquisition of firms facilitating participation on multiple platforms.

The acquisition of firms providing inputs to platforms to deny rivals the benefits of those inputs.

Are the 2023 Merger Guidelines the new standard?

The 2023 Merger Guidelines memorialize the agencies current approach to evaluating mergers, including the theories the agencies are likely to pursue in investigating and challenging transactions.

They provide a framework for companies and their counsel to consider in assessing the antitrust risk of particular transactions, negotiating merger agreements and advocating before the government.

The 2023 Merger Guidelines do not have the force of law, however, and they are not binding on courts.

They do not impose new standards, unless they are considered to be persuasive and are adopted by the courts.

While courts have cited previous merger guidelines in analyzing challenges to transactions, judicial adherence to guidelines has varied.

Some courts have referred to previous guidelines as a  helpful tool  or  as persuasive authority  and have relied on them in certain respects.

For example, courts have relied on the market concentration thresholds reflected in the 2010 guidelines in determining whether the agencies were entitled to an initial structural presumption of harm.

Similarly, courts have availed themselves of the general approach and economic tools formulated in prior versions of the guidelines to define markets in which to evaluate the effects of a merger.

Significantly, however, earlier iterations of the guidelines were considered more neutral in approach, hewed more closely to case law and reflected incremental change from prior versions, arguably making them a more persuasive source of authority for the courts.

Even so, courts have declined to extend any particular deference to prior agency guidelines, especially where they lacked support or were inconsistent with the case law.

For example, in United States v. Anthem , in 2017, the acquiring company argued that a 2001 opinion holding that purported efficiencies must be merger-specific did not apply because the DOJ and FTC modified their standards through adoption of the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines.

In rejecting that position, the US District Court for the District of Columbia held that [n]o court has revised the legal test in the wake of the 2010 revision to the Guidelines.

In New York v. Deutsche Telecom AG , in 2020, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York declined to adopt the 2010 guidelines two-year time frame for analyzing potential entry by other firms, noting that the guidelines should not carry any talismanic force.

Courts also have declined to adopt the agencies standard for evaluating the sufficiency of remedies.

1

In contrast to prior iterations, the new guidelines represent a significant departure from prior guidance and read more like legal advocacy.

They cite extensively to old precedent that is widely viewed as outdated and include minimal discussion and cites to cases in which the agencies lost.

Against this backdrop, courts may give them less weight."
Cooley,"New Year, New Merger Guidelines: What Dealmakers Need to Know","Against this backdrop, courts may give them less weight.

In particular, it remains to be seen whether the agencies will get any traction with their lower concentration thresholds and new bases for structural presumptions based on market share  30% combined share for horizontal mergers and 50% for vertical mergers  particularly after years of encouraging judicial reliance on higher thresholds as the sole basis for a structural presumption of harm.

Similarly, the agencies may face challenges obtaining judicial buy-in on the novel and less-proven theories discussed above.

Courts also may discount the persuasiveness of the new guidelines as having become politicized.

The guidelines follow the publication of the 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines, which the FTC approved by a 3-2 party-line vote under the Trump administration.

The new 2023 Merger Guidelines also are the first merger guidelines adopted by the FTC in which all sitting FTC commissioners were of the same political party at the time of adoption.

While the FTC at full strength has five commissioners, no more than three from any one political party, two seats have remained vacant since 2022.

In short, the principles set forth in the new guidelines will inevitably be contested in court, and their persuasive value in litigated merger challenges remains to be seen.

Takeaways for dealmakers The 2023 Merger Guidelines continue the Biden administrations push to ramp up antitrust enforcement.

While their full impact remains to be seen, we expect the agencies to use the guidelines as leverage in bringing, or threatening to bring, aggressive enforcement actions.

Given the novel theories and more aggressive approaches to concentration reflected in the guidelines, these actions will likely push the boundaries of enforcement.

With this uncertainty, we expect to continue to see increased use of risk-shifting mechanisms, such as reverse termination fees.

Dealmakers should be prepared to work through less traditional theories of harm and use creative remedies to solve for potential concerns.

Additionally, parties should think carefully about litigation risk, as the agencies will be pursuing test cases to enshrine the guidelines through the courts and solidify their approach.

Note The agencies have historically insisted both in guidance and in courts that merger remedies must restore the pre-[merger] level of competition or negate the anticompetitive effects of the merger entirely.

But, in recent cases, courts have rejected this approach as too exacting and have held that requiring defendants to prove a remedy would preserve exactly the same level of competition that existed before the merger  

[and] would effectively erase the word substantially from Section 7, which prohibits only those mergers that are likely to substantially lessen competition."
Cooley,Year-End Reporting for ISO Exercises and ESPP Stock Transfers,"This alert serves as a reminder of certain year-end reporting requirements imposed under Section 6039 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to: Incentive stock option (ISO) exercises by current and former employees.

Transfers of stock acquired by current and former employees under a tax-qualified employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).

For each ISO exercise and ESPP stock transfer that occurred in 2023, a corporation must furnish an information statement to the current or former employee regarding such transaction no later than January 31, 2024, and it must file an information return with the IRS regarding such transaction no later than February 28, 2024, 1 if filing by paper, and no later than April 1, 2024, 2 if filing electronically.

These reporting requirements are intended to provide current and former employees with sufficient information to enable them to calculate their tax obligations.

Employee information statement Every corporation that in 2023 issued stock upon the exercise of an ISO  meaning a stock option as described in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code  must, on or before January 31, 2024, furnish to the current or former employee who exercised the option a written statement containing the information on Form 3921.

Copy A of Form 3921 is filed with the IRS, copy B is furnished to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained by the corporation for its records.

The reporting deadlines noted above and below may be extended for taxpayers eligible for IRS-announced disaster relief.

A full list of these extensions can be found on the IRS website .

Form 3921 is available on the IRS website , but a copy A downloaded from the IRS website should not be filed.

The official printed version of this IRS form is scannable, but the online version of it, printed from the IRS website, is not.

The official form may be ordered from the IRS website .

Corporations also should note: A penalty of $310 per information return may be imposed for failing to file a correct form by the due date.

The penalty is lowered to $60 if corrected within 30 days (by March 29 if the due date is February 28) and is lowered to $120 if corrected by August 1, 2024, up to an aggregate annual limit of $3,783,000, or $1,261,000 for small businesses.

Penalties will not apply to any failure that the corporation can show was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

Similarly, every corporation that in 2023 records or has recorded by its transfer agent a first transfer 3 by a current or former employee of stock acquired by such employee under an ESPP  meaning a plan that is established under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code  must, on or before January 31, 2024, furnish to the current or former employee who is transferring the stock a written statement containing the information on Form 3922 when the purchase price is either: Less than 100% of the value of the stock on the grant date.

Not fixed or determinable on the grant date.

Form 3922 is available on the IRS website .

Copy A of Form 3922 is filed with the IRS, copy B is furnished to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained by the corporation for its records.

As explained above, the copy A that is filed with the IRS needs to be scannable.

Form of employee information statement The employee information statement must either be: Contained on the appropriate form (i.e., Form 3921 for ISO exercises or Form 3922 for ESPP stock transfers).

Contained on a substitute form that meets the format and content requirements in Publication 1179.

A separate form must be filed for each transaction and, if an employee has more than one transaction during the year, each form must contain a unique account number, such as a number provided by equity tracking software.

However, if a substitute form is used, the company may aggregate transactions, providing a single form to each employee."
Cooley,Year-End Reporting for ISO Exercises and ESPP Stock Transfers,"However, if a substitute form is used, the company may aggregate transactions, providing a single form to each employee.

Delivery of employee information statement Employee information statements, either copy B of the applicable form or an acceptable substitute, may be mailed or delivered to the current or former employees last known address or may be sent electronically, provided that the person has given their consent to receive the statement electronically and the corporation meets certain other specified requirements.

IRS information return A corporation is required to file an information return with the IRS, in addition to providing information statements to employees.

For exercises and transfers occurring in 2023, the information returns must be filed no later than February 28, 2024, if filing by paper, and no later than April 1, 2024, if filing electronically (subject to extensions in certain declared disaster zones as noted above).

Companies filing 10 or more copies of Form 3921 or Form 3922 in a year (determined separately and not aggregated between them for purposes of this 10-form threshold) must file their information returns electronically.

This limit has been significantly reduced from the 250-form limit applicable in prior years due to the 2023 finalization of regulations pursuant to T.D. 9972

The information returns must contain the same information required by the Section 6039 regulations with respect to employee information statements.

Information returns for ISO exercises must be made on Form 3921, and information returns for ESPP stock transfers must be made on Form 3922.

It is possible to file Form 8809 to get an automatic 30-day extension to the due date for filing information returns.

Form 8809 is available on the IRS website , and the extension will only extend the due date for filing the returns with the IRS, not the due date for furnishing statements to recipients.

Information requirements As explained above, the information that corporations must provide to a current or former employee in an information statement is the same information that corporations must report to the IRS in an information return.

When reporting this information, corporations should use the applicable form for both the information statement and the information return.

Also, as described above, copy A of the applicable form is filed with the IRS, copy B is provided to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained for the corporations records.

Form 3921 for ISO exercises must contain: The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation transferring the shares.

The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the current or former employee to whom the shares were transferred pursuant to the exercise of the ISO.

The grant date, the exercise price per share, the date of exercise, the fair market value per share on the date of exercise and the number of shares transferred pursuant to the exercise of the ISO.

Form 3922 for ESPP stock transfers must contain: The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation whose shares were transferred.

The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the current or former employee who transferred the shares.

The date the purchase right was granted to the current or former employee and the fair market value per share on the grant date.

The purchase date, the fair market value per share on the purchase date and the purchase price paid per share on the purchase date.

The number of shares to which legal title was transferred by the current or former employee, the date the legal title of the shares was first transferred by the current or former employee and  if the purchase price was not fixed or determinable on the grant date  the purchase price per share determined as if the shares were purchased on the grant date."

Notes

Although there is a February 29 falling on a business day in 2024, the IRS publication setting forth 2024 filing deadlines has kept the February 28 deadline used in prior years.

In most years, this deadline is March 31, but as March 31 falls on a Sunday in 2024, the next business day applies.

The first transfer of ESPP stock from the employee/original owner includes a transfer to a brokerage account.

This means that, generally speaking, the tax reporting obligation is triggered when the stock is deposited into the employees brokerage account.

No transfer will be deemed to have occurred if the stock is issued directly to the employee (or held in book entry form by the company or a transfer agent).  

Instead, the reporting requirement will generally be triggered by the subsequent sale or transfer of the stock (including to a brokerage account)."
Cooley,FCC Adopts New TCPA Rules for Lead-Generated Communications,"Marketers that solicit sales or advertise products or services using robocalls or robotexts (i.e., calls or texts that are initiated using an automatic telephone dialing system 1 or voice calls made using an artificial or prerecorded voice) will need to comply with a new set of rules from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

In a December 2023 order , the FCC claims to have closed the lead generator loophole by adopting rules requiring marketers to obtain consumer consent to receive robocalls or robotexts one seller at a time.

Once the rules take effect, businesses and websites that generate leads, such as comparison shopping websites, will not be permitted to obtain a single consent to cover regulated calls or texts from multiple sellers.

Rather, prior express written consent must be obtained separately for each identified seller.

The new rules also require that one-to-one consent must come after a clear and conspicuous disclosure to the consenting consumer that they will get robocalls or robotexts from the designated seller.

Additionally, the rules will require robocalls and robotexts that result from consumer consent obtained on comparison shopping websites to be logically and topically related to that website.

The stated purpose is to ensure that consumers do not receive robocalls or robotexts that go beyond the scope of their consent, which can be reasonably inferred from the purpose of the website at which they gave that consent.

To illustrate the intent behind this change, the FCC stated that a consumer giving consent on a car loan comparison shopping website does not consent to get robotexts or robocalls about loan consolidation.

The new robocalling/robotexting rules will become part of a larger body of regulations that implement the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), a law that creates a private right of action for consumers to recover up to $1,500 in statutory damages for most calls or text messages that violate its requirements.

The TCPA already is a major source of class action litigation, and the new rules surely will provide new ammunition for an aggressive plaintiffs bar that is constantly pressure testing the marketplace looking for new targets.

National Do Not Call Registry To further the objectives of the TCPA, the FCCs order also formally extends the existing protections of the National Do Not Call (DNC) Registry that apply to voice telemarketing calls to marketing text messages.

The National DNC Registry framework overlaps with the TCPA rules governing robocalls and robotexts but is broader in reach because it governs almost all commercial telephone solicitations to consumers whose numbers are listed on the National DNC Registry, including telemarketing communications that are not initiated using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice.

Several courts have previously assumed that marketing text messages are already covered by the National DNC Registry framework as a subset of calls to wireless numbers.

However, the new rules expressly codify this principle.

The FCCs new order states that marketers can still reach consumers on the National DNC Registry using text messages, but to do so, [t]exters must have the consumers prior express invitation or permission.

This pronouncement unhelpfully injects ambiguity into the National DNC Registry framework by omitting any reference to an important exception in the current rules that permits most non-autodialed telemarketing calls to be made to consumers who have an established business relationship with the seller.

The question of whether the FCC intended to foreclose text message marketers from relying on the same long-standing established business relationship exception available to telemarketers making non-autodialed voice calls will need to be hashed out in future proceedings.

Below, weve summarized other notable aspects of the FCCs recent order."
Cooley,FCC Adopts New TCPA Rules for Lead-Generated Communications,"Below, weve summarized other notable aspects of the FCCs recent order.

One-to-one consent The FCC is concerned that consumers are receiving unwanted calls and texts when their numbers are shared or sold.

To protect consumers, the FCC will amend the existing requirements of prior express written consent for marketing robocalls and robotexts to require an agreement, in writing, that bears the signature of the person called or texted that clearly and conspicuously authorizes no more than one identified seller to deliver or cause to be delivered to the person called or texted advertisements or telemarketing messages using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice.

Calls and texts must be logically and topically associated with the interaction that prompted the consent and the agreement must identify the telephone number to which the signatory authorizes such advertisements or telemarketing messages to be delivered.

2 Specifically, the FCC will require marketers to obtain one-to-one consent before contacting consumers.

The FCC will prohibit certain practices, such as asking for consumers consent to share their information with partner companies or marketing partners, including when the lists of those entities are only available in small print or through a hyperlink.

Under the new order, sharing lead information with a daisy-chain of partners is not permitted.

Rather, texters and callers must obtain a consumers prior express written consent for calls or texts from a single seller at a time.

There are no explicit exceptions to the FCCs one-to-one consent requirement for affiliated companies operating under the same corporate ownership umbrella or that share a common brand.

In response to concerns raised about the new rule, the FCC says it does not restrain comparison shopping or prohibit parties from purchasing leads from lead generators.

The FCC believes the new rule will help callers and texters demonstrate compliance with the TCPA, since they will have an easy way to demonstrate that they have valid consent for the text or call.

While the FCC does not specify the details of what is and is not sufficient consent, the FCC does specifically contemplate the use of a check box list enabling consumers to separately choose each seller they wish to hear from.

Clear and conspicuous disclosure The new rules expand on the disclosure requirement, saying that that the disclosure must be clear and conspicuous (i.e., apparent to a reasonable consumer).

The FCC also asserts that if compliance with the E-Sign Act is required for the consumers signature, all the elements of E-Sign must be present.

Despite requests from commenters to specify what steps marketers must take to obtain valid e-signatures, the FCC chose to rely on its 2012 order permitting e-signatures as a method for obtaining consent without any additional clarification.

Logically and topically related The FCC is not limiting the number of telemarketers that a website can list for purposes of the prior express written consent rule as long as the consent is obtained separately for each identified seller.

However, as a practical matter, the parties listed must be similar because the content of any calls or texts must be logically and topically associated with the forum where the consumer gave consent.

As noted above, the language of the amended rule defining prior express written consent states that the consent given must be logically and topically associated with the interaction that prompted the consent.

The FCC declined to adopt a definition of logically and topically, saying only that texters and callers should limit content to what consumers would clearly expect.

Next steps Recognizing that the new rules relating to changes in the TCPA prior express written consent requirements for robocalls and robotexts will take time to implement, the FCC adopted a 12-month transition period."
Cooley,FCC Adopts New TCPA Rules for Lead-Generated Communications,"Accordingly, the new rules will not be effective until 12 months after they are published in the Federal Register or after Office of Management and Budget approval, if approval is required.

The FCC will announce the effective date when it has been determined.

However, the changes codifying the applicability of the National DNC Registry to marketing text messages will take effect 30 days after Federal Register publication.

Impact These developments impact a wide range of marketers and lead generation businesses, including most obviously: Companies that operate shopping comparison sites or other lead generation businesses that collect leads for multiple sellers.

Companies that purchase leads from shopping comparison sites or similar lead generation businesses.

Any company that relies on TCPA consents for autodialed calls or texts that were collected using consent forms that referenced multiple sellers (including corporate affiliates).

Companies that collect TCPA consents to market products or services that were not conspicuously offered or advertised on the website or other location where the consent was obtained.

Notes

The TCPA defines an automatic telephone dialing system as equipment which has the capacity  (A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.

The rules also require the agreement to include statements making it clear that (a) by executing the agreement, the consumer authorizes the seller to deliver to the signatory telemarketing calls or texts using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice; and (b) the consumer is not required to sign (directly or indirectly) or enter into an agreement to accept such calls or texts as a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or services."

Cooley,How to Prepare for a Successful JPM Conference,"Cooley partners Barbara Borden, Charity Williams, Rich Segal and Courtney Thorne sat down together on November 29, 2023, to discuss how to prepare for attending the JPM Healthcare Conference 2024 in San Francisco.

The group discussed current trends in the life sciences industry  including the choppy state of the M&A market globally and continued reverse merger activity, the increase in artificial intelligence discovery platform deals and the buyers market, macroeconomic challenges in the capital markets space, and the potential increase in initial public offerings next year.

Below are some tips for maximizing your time at the conference: Polish your nonconfidential deck.

Make sure it is up to date and accurate, with updated anticipated milestones.

Review it with your board and advisers, in addition to management.

Consider getting nondisclosure agreements in place as well.

Keep your elevator pitch to 15 minutes or fewer.

Clearly articulate what differentiates you from your peers, and keep your message succinct.

Highlight what is new with your story/platform.

Keep in mind Regulation FD.

Public companies will want to review with securities counsel any new material nonpublic information being shared, such as preliminary year-end cash, new milestones, clinical data, and whether the new corporate deck or information needs to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to meetings.

Come to meetings prepared.

Review recently announced transactions of the companies youre meeting with.

Understand where they have been focusing, what their M&A strategy is and what role the people attending the meeting play in the organization.

Utilize financial advisers to gain intel in advance of meetings.

Keep notes on your meetings and not just what was said.

You can tell a lot from who attended versus who was invited  along with insights from body language  in addition to topics covered during the meetings.

Dont discuss value.

From an M&A perspective, avoid discussing value on the sell side unless you have already confirmed an appropriate valuation range with your board.

Dont get ahead of yourself in terms of deal structure or terms until you have spoken with your advisers.

Keep the current antitrust environment top of mind.

Have some healthy skepticism about your counterparts reasons for the meeting, and be thoughtful about the information you share.

Consider asking about competitive programs to get a sense of what antitrust hurdles you might need to overcome.

Rely on your internal networks.

Ask board members and investors to help you make connections.

Lean into those who are already backing your company.

Attend what youre invited to.

External events and receptions are great ways to have conversations with those you may not have time to set a formal meeting with.

In-person meetings can be invaluable as you build relationships.

Dont forget to follow up after the week is over with the information you promised to share.

Cooley,Ownership and Control Test Under UK Sanctions Clarified Following Mints Judgment,"The UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) recently published important guidance on the meaning of ownership and control in the context of UK sanctions regulations, including the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (Russia Regulations).

The guidance comes following the controversial judgment in the case of Mints v. National Bank Trust and Bank Otkritie , 1 handed down by the UK Court of Appeal in October 2023.

The Court of Appeals decision in Mints The case concerned a claim brought by National Bank Trust and Bank Otkritie against Boris Mints and others, in which the defendants appealed against the refusal of their application for a stay of proceedings on the basis that the claimants were sanctioned or controlled by designated persons (DPs).

The Court of Appeals judgment considered the following three key issues: Whether judgment could lawfully be entered in favour of a DP following a trial at which it was established that they had a valid cause of action.

Whether OFSI could licence certain litigation-related payments  including the payment of a costs order in favour of a DP and the payment by a DP of an adverse costs order.

Whether a DP controls an entity within the meaning of Regulation 7 of the Russia Regulations, where the entity was not a personal asset of the DP, but they were able to exert influence over it by virtue of their political office.

In relation to issue (i), the court held that the Russia Regulations permitted the entry of judgment in favour of DPs, which did not constitute the making available of funds to a DP.

As to issue (ii), the court held that OFSI could licence such payments.

On issue (iii), while the court found in favour of the claimants on the first two issues, and so a ruling on the issue of control was nonbinding, the court commented obiter on the ownership and control test under UK sanctions legislation.

The court considered the two conditions for establishing ownership and control of an entity set out in Regulation 7 of the Russia Regulations  first, that a person must, directly or indirectly, hold more than 50% of the shares or voting rights in the entity, or have the right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors, and second, that it is reasonable, in the circumstances, to expect that the DP would (if they chose to) be able, in most cases or in significant respects, by whatever means and whether directly or indirectly, to achieve the result that the entitys affairs are conducted in accordance with their wishes.

The court noted that the second condition was drafted in wide terms and did not have any limit as to the means or mechanism by which a DP is able to achieve the result of control.

The second condition was, therefore, not limited to personal control, and the political office held by a DP was thus relevant to the control test.

The court commented that Regulation 7 applies to an entity if a DP calls the shots, or can call the shots and concluded that it could be said that Putin (Russian president and a designated person) could be deemed  in the context of him being at the apex of a command economy  to control everything in Russia under the terms of Regulation 7.

Aftermath Following the broad interpretation given to the ownership and control test by the court, the FCDO issued a formal statement confirming that it was considering the impact of the judgment.

It noted that the FCDO would look to designate a public body where possible when designating a public official if [it] considered that the relevant official was exercising control over the public body.

It also confirmed that it was looking to clarify the position further.

The guidance In light of the above developments, OFSI and the FCDO have sought to provide clarity by issuing new guidance concerning public officials and the ownership and control test.

The key points from this guidance are as follows:"
Cooley,Ownership and Control Test Under UK Sanctions Clarified Following Mints Judgment,"The key points from this guidance are as follows:

Examples The guidance sets out examples of what could amount to control  including having the right to exercise a dominant influence over an entity pursuant to an agreement or memorandum, or having the ability to direct another entity in accordance with ones wishes (e.g., where a DP has control of another persons bank accounts and is using them to circumvent financial sanctions).

Control of public bodies The FCDO does not generally consider designated public officials to exercise control over a public body in which they hold a leadership function.

Sanctions targeting public officials are not intended to prohibit routine transactions with public bodies.

If the FCDO considered that a designated public official was exercising control over a public body, it also would designate the public body, where possible.

Notwithstanding the above, if there was sufficient evidence to show that the DP exercises control over the public body, then the relevant legal test under UK sanctions regulations may be met, depending on the circumstances (e.g., where the DP derives a significant personal benefit from payments to the public body such that they amount to payments to that DP rather than to the public body).

Control of private entities There is no presumption that a private entity is subject to the control of a designated public official just because it is based or incorporated in a jurisdiction in which that official has a leading role in economic policy or decision-making.

Importantly, the guidance seeks to specifically clarify the position as regards the absurd consequence of the Court of Appeals judgment that Putin controls every Russian company.

It stipulates that the UK government does not consider that Putin exercises control over all entities in Russia just because he is the president of Russia.

A person will only be considered to exercise control over entities where this is supported by sufficient evidence on a case-by-case basis.

What does this mean in practice?

This guidance provides some clarity as to whether and when nonsanctioned Russian entities are caught by UK sanctions legislation, clearly seeking to narrow the scope of the interpretation of control given by the Court of Appeal.

In practice it means that, contrary to the obiter suggestion of the court, not all Russian businesses will be considered by the UK government to be controlled by Putin.

2

The determination of whether an entity will be caught by the UK sanctions regime instead follows a case-by-case and evidence-based approach.

Whilst this is welcome, and whilst the court recognised in Mints the absurd consequences of the suggestion that Putin controls everything, the case demonstrates the very broad nature of the ownership and control test under UK sanctions and the potential flexibility that it also affords regulators when applying and enforcing sanctions.

For companies considering their compliance with sanctions, in practical terms, it means that a careful and robust review of counterparties needs to be undertaken in each instance.

[2023] EWCA Civ 1132.

This approach also has been taken by the High Court in Litasco SA v. Der Mond Oil and Gas Africa SA , where the court held that just because Putin could place a company under his control did not mean that all companies were under his control, and the Russia Regulations were concerned with existing influence of a DP over a company."

Cooley,"Annual SEC Filing Deadline for Venture, Private Equity Funds Is February 14, 2024","Venture and private equity funds that own equity securities of public companies may have numerous Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing requirements, including filings based on the size of the holdings of a particular portfolio company, aggregate holdings of securities across all public portfolio companies, and filings triggered by the volume of sales and purchases of portfolio company equity securities.

These filing requirements may be annual or quarterly, and the filings are briefly described below.

Schedule 13G Funds  including their general partners and, in some cases, managing principals  that hold in excess of 5% of a class of public equity as of December 31, 2023, generally must file a Schedule 13G within 45 days of year-end.

Also, any fund that has previously filed a Schedule 13G with respect to a portfolio company must file an annual amendment to its Schedule 13G within 45 days of year-end if there have been any changes in ownership since the most recent filing  including an exit filing if the funds ownership has declined below 5%.

Form 13F Investment advisers who exercise investment discretion over Section 13(f) securities (generally equity securities of public companies) are required to file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter-end.

Subject to certain exceptions, if your funds collectively owned in excess of $100 million of Section 13(f) securities as of the last day of any month during the 2023 calendar year, you are obligated to file a Form 13F for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, within 45 days of calendar year-end.

This filing obligation continues for a minimum of three consecutive calendar quarters (i.e., March 31, June 30 and September 30), with filings due within 45 days of the relevant quarter-end.

It is important to note that even if you do not exceed the $100 million threshold as of December 31, the obligation to file a Form 13F for the quarter ending December 31 remains if the threshold was met as of the last day of any single month during the calendar year.

Form 13H Investment advisers who have previously filed a Form 13H to register as a large trader are required to file an annual update to the filing within 45 days of year-end.

Large traders who have completed a full calendar year without exceeding any of the Form 13H triggering thresholds  measured across all portfolio companies  may be eligible to elect inactive status and thereby suspend certain ongoing large trader obligations.

These triggering thresholds are daily trading of at least two million shares or $20 million in share value, or calendar month trading of at least 20 million shares or $200 million in share value, in each case aggregating purchases and sales of the securities of all portfolio companies during the relevant day or month.

In addition to the annual filing requirement, large traders have a quarterly obligation to promptly amend their Form 13H after any quarter during which any of the information in their Form 13H materially changes.

Looking ahead  Schedule 13G filing deadlines are changing As described in this October 2023 Cooley client alert , the SEC recently adopted comprehensive amendments to the Schedule 13G filing requirements.

Once effective, those rule changes will generally accelerate the filing deadlines for initial and amended Schedule 13Gs.

Beginning September 30, 2024, funds will be required to start assessing their Schedule 13G filing requirements on a quarterly basis, with the first of such filings due on November 14, 2024.

The recent rule changes do not in any way affect the filing requirements under Form 13F or Form 13H. Action required The determination of whether you have a Schedule 13G, Form 13F or Form 13H filing obligation is often complex.

Cooley,US Companies Can Use International Law to Reduce Foreign Investment Political Risk,"US companies operating abroad face regulation and interference from foreign governments.

The dark side of regulation can be arbitrary and protectionist measures, refusal to honor commitments made to attract investment, or even expropriation.


As the global economy has evolved, countries have turned their regulatory sights on new business models, assets and investments: Disruptive tech innovators have faced adverse national and local restrictions, some of it obviously intended to protect local competitors.

Social media platforms have faced restrictions on data collection through privacy regimes and otherwise.

Life sciences and big pharmaceutical companies have faced country refusals to license their drugs in order to protect local companies.

In turn, US companies operating in other countries should consider taking advantage of international investment law to mitigate political and legal risks associated with their investment.

International investment law grants you access to neutral international arbitration if a country unlawfully interferes with your investment.

This allows investors to avoid lengthy and sometimes partial and unpredictable domestic legal proceedings.

How does international investment law protect foreign investments?

There are three key mechanisms granting investors access to international arbitration to protect their investments.

1.

International investment agreements (IIAs) IIAs are international treaties between two or more countries protecting investors from one country (the investors home country) from unlawful interference when investing in another country (the host country).

They may be bilateral investment or trade treaties or multilateral treaties, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Importantly, investment treaties provide foreign investors with a private right of action to enforce these protections through international arbitration against the host country.

2.

National investment law Some countries have passed domestic legislation protecting foreign investors and giving them access to international arbitration in case of breach of these protections by the host country.

3. Investment contracts with international arbitration clauses In their contracts with investors, countries may agree to submit disputes to international arbitration tribunals to be decided in accordance with domestic or international investment law.

What protections do investors have under international investment law?

International investment law offers multiple protections to foreign investors.

Protection against discrimination Host countries must not give better treatment to domestic or other foreign investors than the one they give to your investment.

For example, a country that implements a tax that only applies to foreign investors could be in breach of this protection.

Protection against expropriation International investment law requires host countries to pay prompt and adequate compensation if they seize or nationalize investors assets.

Critically, the protection also covers indirect expropriation, which occurs when the country does not directly take the property, but rather takes measures that largely deprive you of the benefits or value of your investment.

This may include, for example, arbitrary denials of operating permits or new laws prohibiting or restricting your business.

Protection against unfair treatment Host countries must treat investors fairly and equitably.

This means a country should not treat investors arbitrarily or unreasonably, frustrate investors legitimate expectations, or abruptly introduce changes to the countrys regulatory framework.

Protection against insecurity Host countries must actively afford the investor and the investment physical and legal security to be able to fully develop the investments economic activities in the host country.

How can investors qualify for protection under investment instruments?"
Cooley,US Companies Can Use International Law to Reduce Foreign Investment Political Risk,"How can investors qualify for protection under investment instruments?

In order to be protected, you must be a qualifying investor  and you must have carried out a protected investment in the host country.

Investment treaties usually define protected investments and qualifying investors.

Critically, in order to take advantage of an investment treaty, the investor must be a national of the home country.

The nationality of companies is determined by the country where they are incorporated.

Investment definitions in international investment treaties are typically comprehensive, encompassing tangible and intangible assets (intellectual property, licenses, etc.)

in the host country.

Whether an investment qualifies for protection is often a key question.

When structuring investments, it is important to consider whether there are treaties or laws that you would like to protect you, usually alongside tax structuring.

How can international investment disputes be resolved?

Under international investment law, an investor can sue the country before an international arbitration tribunal.

Usually, these tribunals are composed of three arbitrators  one chosen by the investor, another by the country, and the parties agree on the appointment of the third, who will serve as president of the tribunal.

The decision of the arbitral tribunal is binding on the parties to the legal dispute and can be enforced against the country, if the claim is successful.

The awards are enforceable as local judgments.

There are various institutions that administer investor-country arbitral proceedings.

One of the most famous is the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), based in Washington, DC.

However, there are others, such as the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).

Conclusion International investment law gives you an effective process to obtain compensation if a country tries to interfere with your foreign investment.

But before making any foreign investment, consider what protections are available and how to obtain them."
Cooley,IRS Announces Voluntary Disclosure Program for Erroneously Received Employee Retention Credits,"Key takeaways The IRS has announced a voluntary disclosure program for businesses to return money received after filing erroneous Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claims.

The program may allow employers to avoid civil litigation, penalties and interest with respect to improper ERC claims.

To participate in the ERC voluntary disclosure program, an employer must meet several eligibility requirements and apply by March 22, 2024.

On December 21, 2023, the IRS announced (IR-2023-247) a voluntary disclosure program for employers to return payments received in respect of erroneously submitted ERC claims.

The IRS also provided a list of frequently asked questions to help employers understand the program.

To be eligible for the ERC voluntary disclosure program, an employer must meet all the following requirements: The employer is not under criminal investigation and has not been notified that the IRS intends to commence a criminal investigation.

The IRS has not received information from a third party alerting the IRS to the employers noncompliance, nor has the IRS acquired information directly related to the employers noncompliance from an enforcement action.

The employer is not under an employment tax examination by the IRS for any tax period(s) for which the employer is applying to the ERC voluntary disclosure program.

The employer has not previously received notice and demand for repayment of any part of the erroneously received ERC.

To apply for the ERC voluntary disclosure program, an eligible employer must complete and submit IRS Form 15434 , under penalties of perjury, on or before March 22, 2024.

If accepted into the program, the employer must, among other things, enter into a closing agreement with the IRS, repay 80% of the erroneously received ERC and, if a tax return preparer or adviser was involved in the ERC claim, disclose the name, address, and phone number of the preparer or adviser, as well as describe the services provided by such preparer or adviser.

An employer that fully repays 80% of the ERC before entering into the closing agreement will not be subject to penalties or interest.

Additional rules apply if the ERC was claimed through a third-party payer, such as a professional employer organization, using the third-party payers employer identification number.

The ERC voluntary disclosure program is the latest in a series of IRS initiatives to combat improper ERC claims submitted by ineligible businesses that were misled by aggressive promoters.

Previously, the IRS imposed a moratorium on processing new ERC claims, then announced a process for withdrawing pending ERC claims that have not yet been paid.

The moratorium and withdrawal process are described in further detail in our September 2023 client alert and our October 2023 client alert , respectively.

Note :

Acceptance into the ERC voluntary disclosure program and/or withdrawal of pending ERC claims does not shield an employer from potential criminal investigation and prosecution for willfully filed fraudulent ERC claims."
Cooley,US Tax Court: Limited Partners May Be Subject to Self-Employment Tax,"On November 28, 2023, in Soroban Capital Partners LP v. Commissioner , the US Tax Court denied the taxpayers motion for summary judgment, holding that whether a limited partner in a state law limited partnership qualifies for the limited partner exception from self-employment tax under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 1402(a)(13) depends on the functions and roles of the limited partner.

Concluding that Congress clearly intended the limited partner exception to apply only to a limited partner who is functioning as a limited partner, the Tax Court held that the limited partner exception in IRC Section 1402(a)(13) does not apply to a limited partner who is limited in name only.

The IRC imposes a tax on the self-employment income of individuals.

This includes gross income derived from any trade or business , less allowable deductions attributable to such trade or business, plus the distributive share (whether or not distributed) of income or loss from any trade or business carried on by a partnership of which such individual is a member.

However, IRC Section 1402(a)(13) provides an exception for the distributive share of any item of income or loss of a limited partner, as such  (emphasis added here and below), other than guaranteed payments for services provided to or on behalf of the partnership.

Although proposed US Treasury Department regulations exclude partners who significantly participate in a partnerships trade or business as limited partners for this purpose 1 ,  the proposed Treasury regulations were never issued in final or temporary form  and neither Congress nor the Treasury Department has defined limited partner, as such as used in the statute.

Before Soroban , the IRS successfully challenged the application of the limited partner exception to active owners of various types of pass-through entities, including partners in a limited liability partnership, in cases before the Tax Court; however, these cases did not involve limited partners in state law limited partnerships, leaving open the question of whether limited partners in such entities are eligible for the exception by virtue of the label limited partner accorded to them under state law.

The Tax Court in Soroban addressed this question, finding that a limited partners role and activities, and not its status as a limited partner in a state law limited partnership, determines whether the limited partner exception to the self-employment tax applies.

The Tax Court held that a functional analysis must be applied, and it concluded that Congress drafted the limited partner exclusion to refer to limited partners, as such  to distinguish limited partners in practice from limited partners in name only.

Given the ambiguity in the statute and the prior absence of direct case law, many limited partners of management companies formed as state law limited partnerships historically relied on a literal reading of the limited partner exception to exclude their distributive shares of management company income from the self-employment tax.

Following the Tax Courts decision in Soroban  and in light of the recent heightened focus on partnerships in the IRSs tax enforcement efforts  investment managers with limited partners claiming the limited partner exception from self-employment tax should apply a functional analysis to the limited partners roles and activities to determine whether the exception applies.

Further developments are expected in this area of law, which we will continue to monitor.

Cooley,US Tax Court: Limited Partners May Be Subject to Self-Employment Tax,"Note Proposed Treasury regulation Section 1.1402(a)-2.

Cooley,ISS and Glass Lewis Update 2024 Proxy Voting Policies,"Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, the two most influential proxy advisory firms, recently released updates to their voting policies for the 2024 proxy season.

The ISS US policy update will apply for shareholder meetings held on or after February 1, 2024.

The Glass Lewis US policy updates, included in its 2024 US Benchmark Policy Guidelines , will apply for shareholder meetings held on or after January 1, 2024.

This alert provides a high-level description of each firms key policy updates for the United States.

Following numerous substantive policy updates for the 2023 proxy season, ISS included only one US policy update for 2024.

Glass Lewis US policy updates for 2024 also are relatively light, with a continued focus on executive compensation and board composition and risk oversight.

Although ISS and Glass Lewis have a strong following of institutional shareholders, companies should consider, as a threshold matter, the composition of their shareholder base, the extent to which those shareholders look to ISS or Glass Lewis in determining whether to support a proxy proposal, and the areas with which their shareholders appear to be most concerned.

Some institutional shareholders follow ISS or Glass Lewis recommendations without exception, some consider the ISS or Glass Lewis recommendations as a factor, but not necessarily a determinative factor, in their voting decisions, and others are guided by their own policies, which may or may not overlap with ISS and Glass Lewis policies.

Even if ISS and Glass Lewis do not have a consequential influence on a particular companys shareholders, they are often viewed as standard-setters for best practices in corporate governance, and changes in policies often reflect investors changing expectations.

For this reason, ISS and Glass Lewis policies often are starting points for board and committee discussions on corporate governance.

ISS updates ISS adopted only one policy update for the US market for 2024, which relates to shareholder proposals concerning executive severance agreements and golden parachutes.

The update codifies the case-by-case approach ISS uses when analyzing shareholder proposals requiring that executive severance arrangements or payments be submitted for shareholder ratification, including by: Harmonizing the factors used to analyze both regular termination severance and change-in-control-related severance (i.e., golden parachutes).

Clarifying the key factors considered in such case-by-case analysis.

Glass Lewis updates Below, weve outlined the notable updates and clarifying amendments for the United States that Glass Lewis adopted for 2024.

Compensation Clawback provisions Glass Lewis believes, in addition to meeting listing requirements, that effective clawback policies should provide companies with the ability to recoup both time-based and performance-based incentive payments when there is evidence of problematic decisions or actions (e.g., material misconduct, a material reputational failure, a material risk management failure or a material operational failure), the consequences of which have not already been reflected in incentive payments and where recovery is warranted.

Where a company ultimately determines not to follow through with recovery, if the company does not provide a thorough, detailed discussion of its decision to not pursue recoupment, this lack of disclosure may play a role in Glass Lewis say-on-pay vote recommendation.

Executive ownership guidelines Glass Lewis believes companies should clearly disclose their executive ownership requirements in the compensation discussion and analysis (CD&A) and how various equity awards are counted or excluded from the ownership level calculation  counting unearned performance-based full value awards or unexercised stock options without a cogent rationale may be viewed as problematic by Glass Lewis."
Cooley,ISS and Glass Lewis Update 2024 Proxy Voting Policies,"Proposals for equity awards for shareholders With respect to proposals for shareholders to approve individual equity award grants, where the recipient of the proposed grant also is a large shareholder of the company whose vote can materially affect the passage of the proposal, Glass Lewis believes provisions that require a non-vote, or vote of abstention, from the recipient may help address potential conflicts of interest and will be viewed by Glass Lewis as a favorable feature.

Compensation based on non-GAAP metrics For companies that use non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) metrics in incentive programs, Glass Lewis believes clear reconciliations to GAAP results should be provided.

In situations where significant adjustments were applied to performance results to determine incentive payouts, the absence of a thorough, detailed discussion within the proxy statement of the adjustments akin to a GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation and their impact on payouts will impact Glass Lewis assessment of the quality of disclosure and, in turn, may play a role in Glass Lewis say-on-pay vote recommendation.

Impact of pay-versus-performance (PvP) disclosure Glass Lewis may use the PvP disclosures mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its supplemental quantitative assessments supporting its primary pay-for-performance grade.

Specifically, the compensation actually paid data presented in the PvP disclosures, along with other quantitative and qualitative factors, may give Glass Lewis cause to recommend in favor of a say-on-pay proposal, even when Glass Lewis has identified a disconnect between pay and performance from its proprietary pay-for-performance model.

Board oversight and composition Cyber risk oversight Glass Lewis believes all companies should provide clear disclosure concerning the boards role in overseeing cybersecurity-related issues, including how they are ensuring that directors are fully versed on this topic, and in instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyberattack, Glass Lewis believes the company should provide periodic updates to its shareholders regarding its ongoing progress toward resolving and remediating the impact of the cyberattack.

In the absence of material cybersecurity incidents, Glass Lewis generally will not make vote recommendations based on a companys oversight or disclosure concerning cyber-related issues, but in instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyberattack, Glass Lewis may recommend against appropriate directors where Glass Lewis finds the boards oversight, response or disclosures concerning cybersecurity-related issues to be insufficient or are not provided to shareholders.

Board oversight of environmental and social (E&S) issues For Russell 1000 companies, Glass Lewis will generally recommend voting against the nominating and governance committee chair where the company fails to provide explicit disclosure concerning the boards role in overseeing material E&S issues, such as climate change, human capital management, diversity, stakeholder relations, or health, safety and the environment, and also will track board oversight of such matters for Russell 3000 companies.

New for 2024, Glass Lewis believes that E&S oversight responsibility should be formally designated and codified in the appropriate committee charters and governing documents to determine if a company has maintained a meaningful level of oversight of and accountability for its material E&S impacts."
Cooley,ISS and Glass Lewis Update 2024 Proxy Voting Policies,"Board accountability for climate-related issues For (1) S&P 500 companies operating in industries where the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board has determined that the companies greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent a financially material risk, such as the energy and transportation industries, as well as others such as food retailers, semiconductors and healthcare distributors, and (2) companies where Glass Lewis believes emissions or climate impacts, or stakeholder scrutiny thereof, represent an outsized financially material risk, Glass Lewis may recommend against the chair of the committee (or board) charged with oversight of climate-related issues if the company has not (a) produced climate-related disclosures in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations and (b) disclosed explicit and clearly defined board-level oversight responsibilities for climate-related issues.

Board diversity Glass Lewis clarified that, when a companys board has insufficient diversity under its policies, it may refrain from issuing negative vote recommendations if the company discloses a timeline of when the board intends to appoint additional diverse directors, with such timeline being generally by the next annual meeting or as soon as reasonably practicable.

In addition, the definition of underrepresented community director has been revised to replace the reference to an individual who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender with an individual who self-identifies as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community.

Interlocking directorships Glass Lewis clarified its policy on interlocking directorships to provide that, on a case-by-case basis, it evaluates interlocking relationships other than interlocking directorships where CEOs or other top executives serve on each others boards, such as interlocks with close family members of executives or within group companies.

Other matters Material weaknesses Glass Lewis will consider recommending voting against all audit committee members who served on the committee during the time when a material weakness is identified if one of the following applies: The material weakness has been reported and the company has not disclosed a remediation plan.

The material weakness has been ongoing for more than one year and the company has not disclosed an updated remediation plan that clearly outlines its progress toward remediating the material weakness.

Board responsiveness In determining whether a proposal had significant shareholder opposition to managements recommendation, Glass Lewis clarified that its 20% opposition threshold means that 20% or more of votes on the proposal are cast as against and/or abstain.

Net operating loss (NOL) pills When assessing NOL pill adoption proposals, Glass Lewis now will consider two new factors: (1) the inclusion of an acting in concert provision and (2) whether the pill is implemented following the filing of a Schedule 13D by a shareholder or there is evidence of hostile activity or shareholder activism as two additional considerations informing its vote recommendation.

Control share statutes For closed-end investment companies and business development companies, Glass Lewis will generally recommend voting: (1) for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so would allow the completion of a takeover that is not in shareholders best interests, (2) against proposals to amend the companys charter to include control share acquisition statutes, and (3) against the nominating and governance committee chair in cases where the company received a public buyout offer and relied on a control share statute as a defense mechanism in the prior year, absent a compelling rationale as to why a rejected acquisition was not in shareholders best interests.

Cooley,FCA Consults Further on the New UK Listing Regime,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a consultation paper on 20 December 2023 (CP23/31), setting out its proposals to reform the UK listing regime with reference to feedback received in previous consultations.

Generally, the FCA has adopted the same approach and retained most of the proposals set out in its last consultation paper published in May 2023 (see our alert on the proposed reforms to the UK Listing Rules ).

The FCA presents the first tranche of the new Listing Rules in this consultation paper (the second tranche is to follow in Q1 2024), and if these changes are adopted, the FCA expects that the new Listing Rules will go live early in the second half of 2024.

Summary of the key proposals The FCA retains the majority of the proposals set out in its last consultation paper, with modifications which are in bold below: A single listing category for equity shares of commercial companies to replace the current standard and premium segments of the Official List, with a new transition category for certain existing standard listed companies.

The removal of eligibility rules requiring a three-year financial track record and a revenue earning track record as conditions for listing, and no longer requiring a clean working capital statement.

The removal of eligibility and ongoing rules requiring that an issuer has an independent business and has operational control over its main activities.

Retaining the current controlling shareholder regime for premium listed companies, which requires a written and legally binding controlling shareholder agreement to be in place.

A more permissive approach to dual-class share structures, where enhanced voting rights are only to be held by specified persons (not limited to just directors), but without mandated, time-based sunset clauses.

The removal of compulsory shareholder votes for significant transactions, with an enhanced market notification regime for transactions at 25% under the class tests, which is intended to provide key information  including financial information  but not mandating working capital statements or restated historical financial information.

The removal of compulsory shareholder votes for related party transactions, including where a controlling shareholder is involved.

A new international secondary listing for non-UK incorporated companies with more than one listing where the primary listing is on a non-UK market, which will replicate the current standard listing rules with targeted ongoing/continuing provisions tailored to a secondary listing.

Highlights of the key proposals Given the nature of the reforms, the FCA is proposing a completely new UK Listing Rules (UKLR) sourcebook.

The first tranche of the new Listing Rules, which are contained in CP 23/31, focuses on the proposals underpinning the new commercial companies category, and as such, this alert focuses mostly on the proposals relating to that new category.

A second tranche of the new Listing Rules for the other listing categories and remaining provisions will be published in Q1 2024, together with proposed revisions to key FCA Technical and Procedural Notes.

The commercial companies category and the transition category The FCA has retained its key proposed reform to create a new single commercial companies category to replace the current standard and premium segments of the Official List.

The FCA has confirmed that all companies in the commercial companies category must adhere to the UK Corporate Governance Code on a comply or explain basis.

The FCA proposes that existing premium listed issuers be automatically mapped to the new commercial companies category once the new regime goes live, while certain existing standard listed commercial companies would be mapped to a new transition category (as set out further below).

The FCA may also move existing standard listed issuers into the shell companies category or international secondary listing category, based on FCA analysis."
Cooley,FCA Consults Further on the New UK Listing Regime,"The FCA may also move existing standard listed issuers into the shell companies category or international secondary listing category, based on FCA analysis.

The new transition category would replicate the existing standard listing continuing obligations, but it would be closed to new entrants.

This transition category would have no fixed end date, and issuers could apply to transfer to other categories when and if they wish to do so.

Any transfer to the commercial companies category, or the shell or closed-ended investment funds category, would require a sponsor and be subject to targeted eligibility assessments.

The consultation paper also sets out details on the FCAs proposed separate listing categories for closed-ended investment funds, open-ended investment companies, shell companies  including special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)  and international secondary listings, as well as discrete categories for non-equity shares and non-voting equity shares, debt and debt-like securities, depositary receipts, securitised derivatives and warrants, options, and other miscellaneous securities.

The FCA proposes to have one set of listing principles to underpin a reformed listing regime for all of the above categories, which combines the current Listing Principles and Premium Listing Principles.

Removed, modified and simplified eligibility and ongoing rules for the new commercial companies category The general approach is to allow the commercial companies category to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate issuers with operational businesses that generate, or have the prospect of generating, revenue from their own activities, while being clear that the FCA is open to diverse business models and more complex corporate structures.

Removed eligibility requirements for new listings The FCA has retained its proposal to remove the eligibility requirements for three years of audited historical financial information that represents at least 75% of the issuers business, a revenue earning track record, and a clean or unqualified working capital statement that currently apply to the premium listing segment.

The prospectus regulation will still require a prospectus to include historical financial information and a working capital statement.

Sponsors still need to consider whether an issuer has a reasonable basis for making any working capital statement in a prospectus and provide declarations to the FCA to that effect.

Independence and control of business The FCA proposes not to mandate eligibility requirements and continuing obligations around independence of business (other than where an issuer has a controlling shareholder) and control of business in the commercial companies category.

It is proposed to retain the requirement that the boards discretion to make strategic decisions has not been limited or transferred to a person outside the issuers group.

The FCA is proposing to set the scope of the commercial companies category such that it is open to issuers that are able to meet the applicable eligibility requirements and continuing obligations and are not a type of issuer for which there exists a separate listing category.

For an issuer where there exists a separate listing category (e.g., a shell company or a closed-ended investment fund), it would have to meet the eligibility requirements of that separate category in order to be eligible for a listing.

The FCA has stated that it does not propose to restrict admission to the commercial companies category to issuers with specific business models, as long as their characteristics are fairly communicated to allow investors to conduct their own assessment and due diligence.

Controlling shareholders The FCA proposes to retain the current controlling shareholder regime for premium listed companies within the new commercial companies category."
Cooley,FCA Consults Further on the New UK Listing Regime,"Controlling shareholders The FCA proposes to retain the current controlling shareholder regime for premium listed companies within the new commercial companies category.

An issuer with a controlling shareholder must demonstrate that, despite having a controlling shareholder, it is able to carry on its main business activities independently from such controlling shareholder.

This includes the requirement to have a written and legally binding agreement with the controlling shareholder which includes certain specified undertakings.

The FCA also proposes to retain the current premium listing approach on approving the cancellation of listing and the election or reelection of independent directors when the issuer has a controlling shareholder.

Dual-class share structures Since 2021

, companies listing on the premium segment have been able to have a limited form of dual-class share structure.

The FCA is proposing a more flexible arrangement, as follows: No specified voting ratio or weighting limits: The FCA proposes removing limits on the maximum enhanced voting ratio that can be attached to enhanced voting rights shares and leaving it to the market to negotiate a suitable level.

Permitted holders: Enhanced voting rights shares may only be issued to the following persons at the time of the issuers first admission to listing (and constitutional arrangement should be put in place to ensure this): Directors of the issuer.

Natural persons who are investors in, or shareholders of, the issuer.

Employees of the issuer.

Persons established for the sole benefit of, or solely owned and controlled by, a person in (1), (2) or (3) above.

No further weighted voting rights shares would be able to be issued after listing.

This is a wider group than was set out in the prior consultation paper, but it would still not allow enhanced voting rights shares to be made available to all pre-initial public offering (IPO) shareholders, as is common in the US.

Sunset requirement: There will not be any mandatory time-related sunset period on enhanced voting rights (the FCA had proposed 10 years post-listing in the prior consultation paper).

The FCA notes that this is because there may be case-specific reasons to consider longer periods, or conversely could imply 10 years is an appropriate period when, for certain companies, investors may prefer and seek to negotiate a shorter period (e.g., three or five years).

Restrictions on transfer: A holder would not be permitted to transfer the voting rights associated with such shares except to a person established for the sole benefit of, or solely owned and controlled by, that holder.

Use of enhanced voting rights shares: In a change of approach from its prior consultation paper, the FCA is proposing that, other than in relation to approving a reverse takeover and the election or reelection of independent directors, if there is a controlling shareholder, enhanced voting rights would not be allowed to be exercised on matters that are subject to a vote under the new Listing Rules (which should be decided upon by a vote of the issuers listed class of shares only).

Significant transactions for the commercial companies category Class 1 transactions: For transactions meeting the 25% threshold on the class tests, the FCA proposes to carry over key aspects from premium listing requirements to the new commercial companies category, except for removing the following: The requirement to obtain shareholder approval (except for on a reverse takeover).

The associated obligation to produce an FCA-approved shareholder circular and to appoint a sponsor on the circular.

The profits test currently used to classify significant transactions.

The requirement to seek sponsor guidance (the issuer will still need to appoint a sponsor when it seeks individual guidance in relation to a significant transaction or requests an FCA waiver or modification of the Listing Rules requirements, including on the class tests)."
Cooley,FCA Consults Further on the New UK Listing Regime,"As a new proposal in this consultation paper, the FCA proposes enhanced disclosures in the class 1 transaction announcement, which includes some of the more detailed information included in the current class 1 circular and class 2 transaction notification disclosures.

This includes at least two years of historical financial information on the target and a statement of the effect of the transaction on the groups earnings and assets and liabilities.

A working capital statement and restated financial information would not be required.

The FCA would not require pro forma financial information to be published to prospectus standards, but clear disclosures would be required explaining the sources of any unadjusted financial information included in the announcement and the basis upon which the pro forma financial information is prepared.

These changes mean that the financial information would no longer be subject to mandatory third-party scrutiny from reporting accountants.

In addition, the FCA is not proposing to replicate the current requirements relating to profit forecasts and profit estimates.

These disclosure requirements would be supported by an overarching obligation on the issuer to include any other relevant circumstances or information necessary to provide an understanding of, or enable shareholders to assess, the terms of the transaction and its impact on the issuer.

In addition, the FCA is proposing new guidance on whether a transaction is to be assessed as within or outside of the ordinary course of business of the issuer.

This will clarify, for example, that transactions that are undertaken to support the existing business may be ordinary course, even if not regularly undertaken as part of the issuers day-to-day business activities.

Class 2 transactions: The FCA proposes to remove the class 2 notification requirement for transactions between 5% and 25% threshold on the class tests.

Related party transactions for the commercial companies category The FCA proposes for related party transactions with a percentage ratio of 5% or more based on the class tests, excluding transactions in the ordinary course of business, to require issuers in the new commercial companies category to: Adopt a board approval process that excludes any conflicted director from board discussion and approval of a transaction.

Publish an announcement of the key details of the transaction containing specific prescribed content (based on the current requirements for announcements of smaller related party transactions).

Include in the announcement a statement from the board that the transaction is fair and reasonable as far as its security holders are concerned, having obtained the same confirmation from a sponsor.

As such, the FCA has retained its proposal not to carry forward the current requirements under the premium listing segment around obtaining independent shareholder approval (and the associated requirement for a circular and sponsor confirmation) and seeking sponsor guidance when entering into a related party transaction above the 5% class test threshold.

The FCA also proposes to remove the market notification and sponsor fair and reasonable opinion for smaller related party transactions (0.25% but <5% based on the class tests).

The FCA is also proposing to: Increase the threshold at which a substantial shareholder becomes a related party from 10% to 20%.

As with significant transactions, issue new guidance on the exemption for transactions within the ordinary course of business.

Clarify when a related party transaction needs to be aggregated with earlier transactions, or when the issuer is required to comply afresh with the related party rules.

Confirm that Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) 7.3 will not apply to companies listed in the commercial companies category, addressing feedback that requiring issuers to be subject to two different related party transaction regimes is overly complex."
Cooley,FCA Consults Further on the New UK Listing Regime,"Other requirements retained for the commercial companies category The initial and ongoing obligations that currently apply both to the premium and standard segments would apply to the commercial companies category (e.g., the 10% minimum free float and the 30 million minimum market capitalisation requirement).

The FCA proposes to carry over the following premium listing requirements in relation to: Preemption rights.

Share buybacks at a premium.

Discounts to market price not to exceed 10% without prior shareholder approval.

Employee share schemes, long-term incentive plans and discounted options arrangements.

Cancellation of listing.

Matters relating to conduct of rights issues, open offers, vendor consideration placings, and offers for sale or subscription.

Ancillary matters relating to fractional entitlement to shares and ownership documentation.

The secondary listing category This new category seeks to accommodate non-UK incorporated companies where domestic company law or rules flowing from their primary listing venue may make meeting certain requirements proposed in the commercial companies category more difficult.

Issuers being mapped to the secondary listing category by the FCA could apply to transfer to the commercial companies category at any stage after implementation, potentially using the modified transfer process.

Unlike the transition category, this category will be open to new applicants.

Eligibility and continuing obligations for this category would largely replicate the standard listing requirements, subject to certain targeted additional requirements (e.g., the issuers place of central management and control must be located in either its country of incorporation or its primary place of listing).

The sponsor regime will not apply to this category.

For overseas issuers, the proposed secondary listing category would address concerns raised regarding non-UK incorporated issuers that follow the corporate governance code of another jurisdiction.

The FCA proposes to carry over the existing requirement to comply with DTR 7.2, where the obligation is to include a corporate governance statement in the directors report to confirm the corporate governance code that the issuer is subject to, along with all relevant information about the corporate governance practice applied over and above the requirements of national law.

Sponsor regime Consistent with the prior consultation paper, the FCA proposes that the sponsor regime applies to commercial companies, SPACs and other shell companies, and closed-ended investment funds at the stage of application for listing and on reverse takeovers.

The FCA expects that the sponsors role at the time of listing will remain largely unchanged from how it currently operates, but taking into account the proposed removal of certain of the existing eligibility requirements which sponsors would no longer need to assess as part of the requirements for listing in the commercial companies category.

After the initial listing, the FCA proposes that instances requiring sponsor involvement are targeted at circumstances where an issuer is facing fundamental change, as well as in certain narrow circumstances where it offers the most benefit to the FCA, the issuer and its shareholders.

As such, sponsors will continue to have an ongoing role in further issuance listing applications with a prospectus, sponsor fair and reasonable opinions for related party transactions, or where issuers seek guidance, modifications or waivers to FCA rules, as well as where the issuer is proposing to enter into a reverse takeover and for certain transfers between listing categories.

The FCA proposes to allow wider factors to demonstrate sponsor competency and to extend the lookback period for relevant experience from three to five years.

The consultation period for the rule changes in relation to sponsor competency closes on 16 February 2024, and the changes are expected to be implemented by mid-Q2 2024."
Cooley,FCA Consults Further on the New UK Listing Regime,"The consultation period for the rule changes in relation to sponsor competency closes on 16 February 2024, and the changes are expected to be implemented by mid-Q2 2024.

Next steps The consultation period for the new Listing Rules closes on 22 March 2024, and the FCA intends to publish the final Listing Rules at the start of the second half of 2024, followed by a very short period before the new Listing Rules come into force.

Once the rules are implemented, existing issuers will be mapped into the relevant category, and all new applications submitted for eligibility review will need to comply with the processes and requirements of the new Listing Rules."
Cooley,A‘green’ments Between Competitors: UK CMA Publishes Green Agreements Guidance,"The transition towards a net zero economy remains an important focus of the UK governments internal and foreign policy.

With the conclusion of COP28 (the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference), this client alert focuses on regulatory efforts in the UK to help companies develop and implement effective environmental policies  including through legitimate industry cooperation.

Specifically, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently published the final version of its Green Agreements Guidance (UK guidance).

The UK guidance explains how businesses can comply with UK antitrust law when entering into certain environmental agreements with their competitors.

The publication of the UK guidance is part of a recent trend among antitrust authorities seeking to help promote sustainable initiatives by setting out their position on what constitutes legitimate business collaborations to combat the negative effects of climate change.

While these guidelines generally pursue similar objectives, companies will have to be mindful of differences in scope and approach, especially when seeking to implement cross-border initiatives.

We have set out below the key features of the UK guidance and explain what they mean for businesses seeking to tackle environmental sustainability objectives through legitimate industry collaborations and/or bilateral agreements with their competitors.

What are the risks of making agreements with competitors?

Antitrust law prohibits businesses from entering into agreements which prevent, restrict or distort competition in the UK.

Typically, therefore, agreements between competitors carry significant antitrust law risks, and businesses have shied away from cooperating with other companies in their sector to achieve sustainability objectives.

However, antitrust regulators are now recognising that in certain circumstances, cooperation between competitors may be necessary in order to achieve sustainability goals, with competition potentially undermining these efforts.

Examples of where issues might arise include: The first mover disadvantage : where a business acting first on sustainability could suffer a competitive disadvantage  e.g., by switching to a more sustainable but more costly input, if its competitors do not do the same.

Lack of resources/capabilities : where a business may lack the resources and capabilities to achieve an environmentally sustainable outcome, which could be achieved collectively  e.g., by pooling knowledge, resources, and/or research and development (R&D) capabilities.

Lack of scale : where businesses individually possess the resources and capabilities to achieve more environmentally sustainable outcomes but acting collectively could realise the benefits more quickly and on the scale demanded by the risks of climate change .

Unhelpful duplication : where businesses could pool their efforts to reduce duplication which would be detrimental to consumers.

An example of this would be to set a common sustainability label rather than each business deciding on an individual one, potentially confusing end consumers.

The UK guidance has the aim of ensuring that UK antitrust law promotes environmental sustainability and helps regulators meet their objective of accelerating the UKs transition to a net zero economy.

Scope of the guidance: What are green agreements?

The UK guidance establishes a framework for cooperation among businesses in relation to environmental sustainability agreements, climate change agreements and mixed agreements.

Environmental sustainability agreements (ESAs) are agreements between competitors aimed at preventing, reducing or mitigating the adverse impact that economic activities have on environmental sustainability, or assisting with the transition towards environmental sustainability.

Climate change agreements are a subset of ESAs, which contribute to combating climate change."
Cooley,A‘green’ments Between Competitors: UK CMA Publishes Green Agreements Guidance,"Climate change agreements are a subset of ESAs, which contribute to combating climate change.

Mixed agreements are ESAs that generate both climate change and other environmental benefits.

What environmental sustainability collaborations are unlikely to raise concerns under the guidance?

First, the UK guidance sets out that there are certain categories of agreements which the CMA considers unlikely to infringe antitrust rules.

They include: Agreements which do not affect price, quantity, quality, choice or innovation  e.g., agreements to eliminate the use of single-use plastic on business premises.

Agreements to do something jointly which none of the parties could do individually  e.g., joint R&D projects with an environmental sustainability objective, after which the parties will independently implement any solution in their own production processes.

Cooperation that is required, rather than encouraged, by law .

Pooling information about suppliers or customers  e.g., evidence-based information about the sustainability credentials of customers, but without sharing competitively sensitive information.

Creation of industry standards , provided that the process for developing the standard is transparent, the standard is voluntary, and any business in the affected market can participate in the development of that standard and can implement the standard on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

Collective withdrawal/phasing out of nonsustainable products or processes , provided it does not involve an appreciable increase in price or reduction in product quality or choice for consumers.

Industrywide environmental targets  i.e., nonbinding short- or long-term targets (e.g., for reduction of CO2 emissions) across a whole industry, provided that participating business are free to independently determine their own contribution and the way in which targets are realised.

Agreements between shareholders to vote in support of corporate policies that pursue environmental sustainability .

When could environmental sustainability collaborations raise antitrust concerns?

Notwithstanding the above, the UK guidance is clear that not all sustainability agreements will be compliant with antitrust law, and companies have to keep the usual antitrust risks in mind.

This means that, for example, agreements involving price fixing, market sharing, customer allocation, or limits on output, quality, or innovation will continue to be prohibited.

In addition, agreements that, in practice, have the effect of restricting competition will have to be analysed on a case-by-case basis against the four criteria below: The agreement must have objective and verifiable benefits.

Examples include: Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

New or improved products which have a reduced environmental impact.

Introduction of cleaner technologies.

Reduction of production or distribution costs for sustainable products through achieving economies of scale.

An agreement between competitors must be indispensable to achieve those benefits .

If there is a less restrictive, but equally effective, alternative, the initiative will not be covered by the UK guidance.

Consumers must receive a fair share of the benefits of the agreement .

This means that the benefits of the agreement to UK consumers must outweigh the harm they suffer as a result of the reduced competition between the parties to the agreement.

The benefits to consumers can be direct (e.g., higher-quality products) or indirect (e.g., not contributing to deforestation by buying the product).

If all other criteria are satisfied, the agreement also must not substantially eliminate competition .

This condition will be satisfied where competition price, quality, and innovation remains, and/or where competition is reduced for a limited period of time only.

The criteria above apply specifically to ESAs."
Cooley,A‘green’ments Between Competitors: UK CMA Publishes Green Agreements Guidance,"The criteria above apply specifically to ESAs.

However, the UK guidance adopts a slightly more permissive approach to climate change agreements because of the exceptional nature of the harm posed by this threat.

While for ESAs, only benefits to the consumers that purchase the product are relevant to the application of the fair share test, benefits to all UK consumers can be taken into account in the case of climate change agreements.

For example, parties to an agreement between delivery companies to switch to electric vehicles to combat the effects of climate change can take into account the broad benefits that accrue to all UK consumers through a reduction in CO2 emissions when weighing this against the potential harm of such an agreement (e.g., higher prices to consumers ordering takeout or receiving delivery services).

This greater flexibility for the assessment of climate change agreements also is replicated by other authorities  including those in the Netherlands and Austria.

In contrast, the European Union (EU) guidelines published in July 2023 do not draw this distinction, and only benefits to consumers in the relevant market who are negatively impacted by the agreement can be taken into account.

While it is encouraging to see the CMA go further than the EU in its support for climate change agreements, for businesses, this unfortunately means that there is no one-size- fits-all approach.

What does this mean for businesses?

The UK guidance is a helpful step in providing greater legal certainty to businesses, and it provides them with the opportunity to explore collaborative means of engaging in environmental sustainability efforts and implementing effective environmental initiatives without the risk of falling foul of antitrust law.

This will be particularly relevant in the context of industry collaboration that is required or encouraged by other sector-specific rules, such as rules that encourage emissions pooling (see also the EUs recent proposal to introduce a pooling system which would allow beverage companies to form pools to achieve their re-use targets on a collective rather than an individual basis), or rules that require producers to join an extended producer responsibility scheme for handling waste.

Businesses operating in the UK that want to engage in collaborations with their competitors will need to determine whether their agreement is an ESA, climate change agreement or mixed agreement and adapt the proposal in line with the principles set out in the UK guidance.

In doing so, they will have to remain mindful of the general principles of competition law and avoid engaging in otherwise anticompetitive behaviour (e.g., by exchanging commercially sensitive information with their competitors).

Businesses that wish to implement cross-border environmental initiatives covering a larger number of jurisdictions also will have to ensure that their proposals comply with all applicable guidance.

Whilst some regulators (like the UK, Austrian and Dutch competition authorities) treat climate change agreements more favourably than other ESAs, others (such as the European Commission) make no such distinction and largely preserve the current status quo.

To gain additional comfort, businesses also can approach the CMA, as well as other European regulators, with their proposed initiatives and seek informal feedback.

The CMA has stated in this context that it does not intend to prioritise enforcement action against agreements which correspond clearly to the principles and examples set out in the UK guidance.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – December One-Minute Reads,"Share repurchase rules stayed, inching toward vacatur Our November One-Minute Reads addressed the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit holding that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) violated the Administrative Procedure Act by adopting final share repurchase rules.

The Fifth Circuit held that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously by adopting the new rules, failing to substantiate the new share repurchase rules benefits and costs, and applying inconsistent logic.

The court did not vacate the rules  instead, it remanded the rules back to the SEC to attempt to repair the defects by November 30, 2023.

Following the ruling, on November 22, the SEC announced that it had issued an order postponing the effective date of the share repurchase rules.

As a result, the rules have been stayed pending further SEC action.

On the same day, the SEC also filed a motion with the court for a time extension to repair the defects, with the plaintiffs opposing the motion.

On November 26, the court issued an order refusing to grant the SECs request for an extension, and on December 1, at the request of the clerk of the court, the SECs Office of the General Counsel submitted a letter to the court advising that the SEC would not be able to correct the defects by the court-imposed deadline.

On December 7,  the Chamber of Commerce filed a motion to vacate the SECs final share repurchase rules.

As recounted by the chamber, the SEC advised the chamber that it took no position on the chambers motion.

On December 19, acting by a quorum (with one judge recused), the court pulled the plug, issuing an opinion vacating the repurchase rules.

At this time, it is not known what action the SEC will take in response to the decision  including whether it will repropose new rules.

For the time being, public companies do not need to comply with the proposed share buyback rules included in the SECs adopting release.

Corp Fin releases proxy rules and Schedule 14A C&DIs In November, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance (Corp Fin) released new compliance and disclosure interpretations (C&DIs) addressing issues relating to the proxy rules, including the universal proxy rules in Rule 14a-19.

These new C&DIs can be found under the caption Proxy Rules and Schedule 14A .

In brief: Q132.03 relates to Rule 14a-12, which permits proxy solicitations before furnishing a proxy statement so long as, among other things, the written soliciting material includes the required participant information or a prominent legend advising shareholders where they can find that information.

The C&DI sets forth the content required in this legend in order to rely on this rule.

Q139.07 relates to universal proxy and notes that if a shareholder submits an overvoted proxy card, the soliciting party may not use discretionary authority to vote the shares in accordance with its own voting recommendations for director, though they can be voted on other matters and can be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.

Q139.08 builds upon the prior C&DI and states that if a shareholder submits an undervoted proxy card, the soliciting party may not use discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by the undervoted proxy card for the remaining director seats up for election.

Q139.09 also relates to universal proxy and says that if a shareholder submits a signed but unmarked proxy card, the soliciting party can use discretionary authority to vote the shares in accordance with the soliciting partys voting recommendations."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – December One-Minute Reads,"Q151.02 relates to a situation where a company has closed an acquisition in a transaction that involved partial consideration of convertible securities but did not require shareholder approval and is now seeking shareholder approval for the authorization of additional shares that could be issued on the conversion of the securities issued in the acquisition.

The C&DI concludes that the solicitation of shareholder approval for the authorization of the additional shares is an integral part of the acquisition because it is necessary for the registrant to meet its obligation under the convertible securities issued as consideration for the acquisition, and therefore that the proposal to authorize additional shares of common stock involves the acquisition and is a solicitation with respect to the acquisition itself under Note A to Schedule 14A. Corp Fin also revised Q126.03 relating to Rule 14a-6 to clarify the calculation of the 10 calendar days needed between providing copies of a preliminary and definitive proxy.

For more information, refer to this November 20 PubCo post .

Corp Fin posts more pay-versus-performance C&DIs Also in November, Corp Fin posted new and revised C&DIs addressing issues arising under the final pay-versus-performance rules , codified in Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K.

These rules required most public companies to provide a table and accompanying disclosure comparing executive compensation actually paid against specified measures of company financial performance beginning in 2023.

(See this September 2022 client alert and this September 2022 PubCo post for more information on these rules).

Some of the C&DIs revise responses that Corp Fin provided in the February and October pay versus performance C&DIs (see this February 2023 PubCo post and this October 2023 PubCo post ).

The new and revised C&DIs address: How to calculate peer group total shareholder return (TSR) when using different peer groups in different years ( Q128D.07 ).

How to treat stock and option awards that allow accelerated vesting if the holder becomes eligible for retirement ( Q128D.18 ).

Whether to include the dollar value of dividends or dividend equivalents in the calculation of executive compensation actually paid where stock awards entitle the holder to receive these on the underlying shares prior to the vesting date ( Q128D.23 ).

Which index companies are required to use for their TSR peer group ( Q128D.24 and Q128D.25 ).

AI shareholder proposals trending On October 31, Responsible Investor reported on the filing of the first shareholder proposals relating to artificial intelligence, in a sign of what may become wider practice.

Per the article, AI-focused shareholder proposals have been filed or are planned to be filed with six large companies for their next annual meetings.

Five of the six proposals submitted by the same shareholder urge companies to publish an AI transparency report on whether they have adopted any ethical guidelines to protect workers, customers and the public from harms related to the use of AI."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – December One-Minute Reads,"DOJ, SEC issue guidance on delaying cyber incident disclosure As previously reported, the SECs final cybersecurity rules include a requirement under new Item 1.05 of Form 8-K to disclose specified information about material cybersecurity incidents within four business days of the company making the determination that the cybersecurity incident was material.

The final rules include a narrow allowance for a delayed filing under Item 1.05(c) in cases where the US attorney general has notified the SEC in writing that the disclosure poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety.

Initially, this delay would only last for a period of time specified by the attorney general, up to 30 days following the date when the disclosure was otherwise required, though it may be extended for additional time if the attorney general determines that disclosure continues to pose a substantial risk and notifies the SEC in writing.

This led to a lingering question of how companies are supposed to bring this issue to the attorney generals attention.

Now, the Department of Justice and SEC have chimed in, with the DOJ publishing the Department of Justice Material Cybersecurity Incident Delay Determinations and the SECs Corp Fin issuing four Form 8-K C&DIs .

The DOJ guidelines outline the process that public companies  or federal agencies in coordination with public companies  may use to request that the attorney general authorize delays of cyber incident disclosures required on Form 8-K. The guidelines explore the limited circumstances for finding a substantial risk to national security or public safety, outline the procedures for companies to request a delay in public disclosure, including by contacting the FBI consistent with reporting instructions issued by the FBI, and other procedural matters relating to a delay or change in circumstance during a delay period.

To briefly summarize the C&DIs issued by Corp Fin: Q104B.01 states that if a company requests the attorney general to determine that disclosure of an incident would fall into this exception, but the attorney general declines to make such a determination, or does not respond before the Form 8-K otherwise would be due, the company must file the Item 1.05 Form 8-K within four business days of its determination that the incident is material.

Merely requesting a delay doesnt relieve a company of its filing obligations.

Q104B.02 builds upon the prior C&DI and notes that if the attorney general determines and notifies the SEC that disclosure should be delayed, and the company subsequently requests the attorney general to determine that disclosure should be delayed for an additional time period, but the attorney general declines to make such determination, or does not respond before the expiration of the current delay period, the company must file the Item 1.05 Form 8-K within four business days of the expiration of the initial delay period provided by the attorney general.

Q104B.03 clarifies that if disclosure of an incident is delayed pursuant to this exception, but the attorney general subsequently determines during the delay period that the disclosure no longer poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety and notifies the SEC of this new determination, the company must file the Item 1.05 Form 8-K within four business days of the attorney generals notification to the SEC and the company that disclosure of the incident no longer poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – December One-Minute Reads,"Q104B.04 notes that merely consulting with the DOJ regarding the availability of a delay under Form 8-K Item 1.05(c) would not necessarily result in a determination that the incident itself is material and therefore reportable under the requirements of Item 1.05(a), as the determination of the materiality of an incident is based on all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the incident, including both quantitative and qualitative factors, and should focus on the traditional notion of materiality as articulated by the Supreme Court.

Cooley,10 Steps to Reduce Risks From AI Employment Tools,"Editor's note: Authored by Gerard OShea, Joseph Lockinger, Steven Zuckerman and Anna Matsuo, this article was originally published in Law360 .

On Oct. 30, the Biden administration issued a sweeping executive order on artificial intelligence, representing the most comprehensive guidance to federal agencies and AI developers to date.

The ""Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence"" directs the federal government to closely examine AI's impact and ""harness AI for good,"" while mitigating risks stemming from ""fraud, discrimination, bias, and disinformation.""

The executive order does not create any immediate mandates for employers using AI tools in connection with their employees, including as part of the employment decision-making process that is, decisions on who to hire, fire or promote.

Instead, it sets a road map for executive agencies to issue guidance concerning the use of AI tools that will directly affect employers, software development and federal contractors in the months to come.

While AI offers seemingly endless potential benefits in the workplace  including improvements in efficiency, cost-cutting and innovation  employers must balance those benefits with the legal risks of using AI tools in employment processes.

As the executive order warns employers, ""AI should not be deployed in ways that undermine rights, worsen job quality, encourage undue worker surveillance, lessen market competition, introduce new health and safety risks, or cause harmful labor-force disruptions.""

To meet this goal, employers using AI tools should align their use with existing guidance that has been issued by executive agencies and must also attempt to keep up with regulatory and technological developments in this rapidly evolving space.

We've outlined a 10-step plan for employers using AI-based tools in employment decision-making and related processes to best mitigate the risks of using such tools and prepare for future AI regulation stemming from the executive order.

We've focused on the broad umbrella of tools powered by AI, including those using machine learning or natural language processing, that are used in employment processes.

These tools have become the center of focus from agencies, such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , due to some tools' incorporation of software that uses algorithmic decision-making at different stages of the employment process.

1. Identify the technology.

As a preliminary matter, employers need to identify existing AI technology used in the workplace, including how they are using it and what technologies they may want to implement in the future.

According to EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows, more than 80% of employers use AI in some of their employment decision-making processes, but many employers might not realize the ubiquity and broad scope of tools that use AI technologies.

For example, AI technology may be used in sourcing and screening candidates; interviewing; onboarding; performance management; succession planning; talent management; diversity, equity and inclusion activities; and employee engagement/workplace monitoring.

Some examples include resume scanners, keyloggers and software that take screenshots or webcam photos during the workday, virtual training programs, virtual assistants or chatbots, video interviewing software, ""job fit"" or ""cultural fit"" testing software, and trait- or ability-revealing applicant gaming systems.

In identifying AI technology, employers should be mindful of the order's particular focus on tools used to ""monitor or augment employees' work,"" which includes the employee-monitoring software mentioned above.

For example, the order directs the secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor to issue guidance clarifying that employers using such tools need to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and other legal requirements requiring employees to be compensated for all hours worked."
Cooley,10 Steps to Reduce Risks From AI Employment Tools,"If an AI tool records keystrokes or calls made outside an employee's scheduled work hours, but an employer fails to pay the employee for such time and the employee is compensated on an hourly basis or eligible for overtime, this would potentially raise issues under the FLSA.

In addition, the order focuses on worker displacement caused by using AI tools that improve efficiency and automation.

These potential efficiency gains are an area of significant interest to members of the business community and are currently being tested to see if those gains can actually be achieved in practice.

For example, a working paper released in September by the Harvard Business School and the Boston Consulting Group found that the use of generative AI improved an employee's work performance by more than 40%, compared with a control group that did not use the technology.

As the order notes, however, such improvements are not without risks, and directs the secretary of labor to submit a report to the White House analyzing executive agencies' ability to ""support workers displaced by the adoption of AI and other technological advancements"" by the end of April 2024, as well as develop and publish principles and best practices for employers relating to job displacement.

2. Understand the role of human oversight.

It is critical for employers to understand the role of human oversight in the use of AI tools.

Employers should ensure that a tool does not replace human judgment and any final decisions, where tools are used in the employment decision-making process, continue to be made by HR or management.

Human oversight is not only advisable from a legal perspective, but it also may mitigate distrust and employee morale issues arising from concerns of overreliance on AI technologies in employment decision making.

Developing and deploying trustworthy AI technologies is a fundamental principle of the order, which broadly proclaims that both developers and users of AI should be held accountable to standards protecting against ""unlawful discrimination and abuse,"" as ""only then can Americans trust AI to advance civil rights, civil liberties, equity, and justice for all.""

3. Vet vendors, tools and data.

As the order demonstrates, the government is increasingly focused on preventing discrimination and bias resulting from the use of AI in the workplace.

For example, the order tasks the Attorney General's office to coordinate with and support agencies in enforcing discrimination laws related to AI use, including algorithmic discrimination.

In addition, the order focuses on developers' responsibilities in creating trustworthy, bias-free AI tools.

For example, the order requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop guidelines and best practices for developers in conducting ""red-team testing"" or ""AI red-teaming,"" which it defines as a ""structured testing effort to find flaws and vulnerabilities in an AI system.""

These flaws and vulnerabilities include ""harmful or discriminatory outputs from an AI system.""

In light of these broad directives focusing on preventing discriminatory outputs, employers should keep the below steps in mind when vetting AI vendors, tools and the data used by such tools.

Vet the vendor.

The explosion of AI tools designed for use in employment processes means that vendors will need to be carefully vetted as a threshold matter.

Employers may want to consider whether the vendor's developers receive any training on detecting and preventing bias in the design and implementation of such tools.

Employers also may wish to consider whether vendors regularly consult with diversity, labor or other outside experts to address and prevent bias issues.

Employers should be wary of any claims of ""bias-free"" or ""EEOC-compliant"" tools, as these representations have no legal effect."
Cooley,10 Steps to Reduce Risks From AI Employment Tools,"Employers should be wary of any claims of ""bias-free"" or ""EEOC-compliant"" tools, as these representations have no legal effect.

In addition, employers should take a close look at any purchasing contracts made with vendors, with particular focus on how potential liability in connection with the tool's use will be allocated.

Vet the tool.

Employers should thoroughly vet any tool they wish to implement, including learning how the tool works and how it makes any recommendations or conclusions.

As a preliminary matter, employers should consider the track record of the tool, including if and how long the tool in consideration has been used by other employers, and the purposes for which it has been utilized.

An important part of onboarding any new AI tool should be gathering sufficient information related to functionality to be able to explain to employees or applicants the role the tool might play in the employment decision-making process.

Employers also should understand if and how the tool was developed for individuals with physical and mental disabilities.

It's important to ask whether any interface is accessible to individuals with disabilities, whether materials presented are available in alternative formats, and whether vendors attempted to determine if using an algorithm disadvantages individuals with disabilities, such as when characteristics measured by the tool are correlated with certain disabilities.

Some tools may improperly screen out individuals with disabilities, including visual disabilities,[1] and employers should ask vendors how the tool mitigates or provides accommodations for that issue.

In addition, improper screening out can occur if tools, such as chatbots, are programmed to reject all applicants who have gaps in their employment history, as such gaps may have resulted from disability-based reasons.

Vet the data.

Understanding the data that the AI tool has been trained on is a critical part of vetting any AI tool.

Prior to using a tool, employers should mitigate any risk that a tool is a proxy for impermissible discrimination.

Such discrimination can occur where the data a tool is trained on is itself biased as might occur if there is a lack of diversity in an employer's existing employee population which can lead to potentially biased results.

Employers also may consider what statistical analyses have been run on the tools and how such analyses were selected.

4. Assemble the right team.

A joint statement released in April from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , U.S. Department of Justice , Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Federal Trade Commission asserted: Many automated systems are ""black boxes"" whose internal workings are not clear to most people and, in some cases, even the developer of the tool.

This lack of transparency often makes it all the more difficult for developers, businesses, and individuals to know whether an automated system is fair.[2]

The order echoes this black box sentiment by stressing that all workers, including unionized ones, ""need a seat at the table"" in developing and deploying AI technology.

To mitigate against this asserted black box problem in the workplace, employers should ensure that they assemble a multidisciplinary team tasked with implementing and monitoring any AI tool.

This team should not only comprise members from human resources, legal, communications, marketing and DEI functions, but also members of IT, including those with backgrounds in software or data engineering.

Assembling the right team with the appropriate experience will help ensure all players understand, are aligned on and are able to explain the business goals tied to using AI tools and how the tool reaches particular decisions or predictions.

This alignment will be key in responding to employee and applicant questions regarding the use of AI tools in employment processes."
Cooley,10 Steps to Reduce Risks From AI Employment Tools,"This alignment will be key in responding to employee and applicant questions regarding the use of AI tools in employment processes.

Employers may want to designate a team member tasked with monitoring trends and technology developments in this evolving space.

5. Know the applicable laws.

The order makes clear that federal government AI regulation and guidance are imminent.

In the meantime, however, employers using such technologies are already subject to numerous federal and state anti-discrimination, intellectual property, cybersecurity and data privacy laws.

In the employment space in particular, federal anti-discrimination laws  including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act  collectively prohibit both disparate treatment discrimination and disparate impact discrimination.

Disparate treatment is intentional discrimination against members of a protected class, whereas disparate impact discrimination consists of neutral policies that discriminate in practice against members of a protected class.

In addition, U.S. states and local jurisdictions may impose more protective anti-discrimination laws.

The use of AI tools in certain instances can trigger compliance risks under other federal employment laws, such as the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Federal contractors in particular should pay special caution, as the order requires the labor secretary to issue guidance regarding ""nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems"" by October 2024.

This focus on federal contractors follows the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs ' recent revisions to its scheduling letter and itemized listing to require employers to provide information and documents relating to the use of ""artificial intelligence, algorithms, automated systems or other technology-based selection procedures.

""[3]

Some jurisdictions specifically regulate certain AI technologies used in the workplace.

For example, New York City began enforcing its Automated Employment Decision Tools, or AEDT, Law in July.

The statute imposes several requirements for employers that use a qualifying AEDT, including conducting an independent bias audit of the AEDT and making available certain information about data collected by the tool.[4]

The Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act also imposes notification, consent, deletion and reporting requirements for jobs based in Illinois.

Maryland H.B. 1202 similarly requires applicant consent for employers to use facial recognition technology during preemployment job interviews.

Employers navigating this complex area will need to ensure that their use of AI tools complies with all applicable laws.

6. Have appropriate policies in place.

Employers should consider whether to implement policies identifying and addressing appropriate use of AI technologies in employment processes.

In a policy, employers should be transparent about how the tool operates, what data is being used and how  if at all  the tool assists with decision-making processes.

With clear language identifying how such tools are used, employees and applicants can be better informed, and employment decisions such as hiring and promotion can be perceived as more fair.

Any applicable policies should be communicated and updated regularly.

7. Implement training and education.

Any AI use policies should be communicated to employees, preferably through training and education programs.

Management-level employees also should receive education and training on AI tools, including applicable legal requirements regulating the use of such tools, the potential for tools to perpetuate bias or discrimination if used improperly, the importance of human oversight, and concerns regarding incorrect or misleading outputs.

8.

Ensure accommodations are available."
Cooley,10 Steps to Reduce Risks From AI Employment Tools,"8.

Ensure accommodations are available.

Employers using AI tools should prepare their managers and HR teams to recognize and evaluate accommodations requests from applicants and employees.

Even though some laws, such as New York City's AEDT law, do not explicitly require that employers provide accommodations, only that individuals are provided notice that they may request an accommodation or alternative selection process, accommodations are required under the federal ADA and New York City and state human rights laws.

The EEOC[5] and the White House[6] have cautioned employers to not screen out candidates by failing to provide applicants with human alternatives to AI tools.

9. Conduct regular testing and audits.

Once deployed, AI tools should be evaluated and regularly monitored to ensure that business objectives for using the tool continue to be met, that the tool is implemented in a fair and unbiased manner, and so any adjustments may be made.

Even if the tool has been subject to an audit prior to being used, employers should continue to conduct such audits at least on an annual basis, as the implementation of the tool in any particular workforce can result in unforeseeable issues.

For instance, the White House's Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights suggests that automated systems be regularly monitored for ""algorithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not accounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the context of use or associated data.

""[7] 10.

Pay attention to the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

Employers, especially those operating in multiple jurisdictions, need to stay up to date on potential laws and regulations regarding AI in employment processes.

For example, new laws similar to  or even more stringent than  NYC's AEDT law have been proposed in New York state, New Jersey, California, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, while other states have created task forces to advise on and propose regulations governing such tools in the employment context.

In California, a new state agency  the California Privacy Protection Agency  is tasked with addressing automated decision-making technology.

In addition to new federal guidance stemming from the order, employers can also expect to see increased coordination between federal agencies in addressing discrimination issues relating to AI use.

This approach builds on earlier interagency efforts on AI dating back to earlier this year between the EEOC, FTC, DOJ and CFPB.

This may be welcome news for employers challenged with complying with the current patchwork of AI laws.

Employers should also keep an eye on regulations and guidance affecting the federal government's own use of AI.

This guidance, while directed at federal agencies' use of AI, may provide others a framework for best practices for using certain AI technologies, including periodic accountability reviews, completing an AI impact assessment, testing the AI tool for performance in a real-world context, independently evaluating the AI through an AI oversight board or similar third party, and ensuring adequate human training and assessment so AI operators can interpret and act on outputs and combat any risks.

Conclusion AI tools will continue to revolutionize the workplace.

Employers should keep on top of these rapid developments and implement best practices for mitigating legal risk in using such tools.

1. Review and revise your employee handbooks and policies The beginning of the year brings many new compliance obligations for employers, who should ensure their policies and handbooks are reviewed and updated for compliance with new employment laws, such as those in California and in New York .

When reviewing and updating employee handbooks, employers should take special note of the August 2, 2023, decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in Stericycle, Inc. , 372 NLRB No. 113 , which adopted a new legal standard in evaluating whether an employers work rule expressly restricts employees protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

The new standard interprets work rules from the perspective of an employee who is economically dependent on the employer and who also contemplates engaging in activity protected under Section 7 of the NLRA.

If an employee could reasonably interpret the rule to have a coercive meaning, the work rule is presumptively unlawful, even if a contrary, noncoercive interpretation of the rule also is reasonable.

Employers may then rebut that presumption by proving that the rule advances a legitimate and substantial business interest and that it is unable to advance that interest with a more narrowly tailored rule.

If the employer is successful in proving this defense, the work rule will be found lawful.

Notably, the NLRB will no longer consider an employers intent in adopting or maintaining the work rule.

The new standard is a significant departure from the prior standard, which analyzed a rule from the perspective of an objectively reasonable employee who is aware of [their] legal rights and established a categorical approach to workplace rules by holding that certain types of work rules are presumptively lawful to maintain.

Employers should therefore carefully scrutinize rules, policies and procedures through the lens of the new Stericycle standard.

By establishing a case-by-case approach, under which the NLRB examines the specific language of particular rules and employer interests invoked to justify them, employers should expect more challenges to their workplace rules.

Employers should pay special attention to rules governing confidentiality, social media and technology use, employee monitoring and recording, anti-harassment, employee discipline, and complaint reporting.

Employers should be able to articulate the legitimate business reasons justifying the rules  and ensure that each rule is as narrowly tailored as possible in advancing those interests.

2. Review your restrictive covenants 2023 was a watershed year for employers using noncompete agreements and other restrictive covenants.

Employers should review their agreements for compliance with several new laws cracking down on these provisions, including in California and in Minnesota .

New York employers, however, can continue using their existing noncompete agreements and other restrictive covenants  for now.

As we reported in a client alert on October 31, 2023 , New York passed a proposed ban on noncompete agreements earlier in the year.

At the end of November 2023, Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected the proposed ban , but indicated that she may support such a ban if it included a wage threshold of $250,000."
Cooley,Year-End Tasks for US Employers Facing Compliance Obligations,"At the end of November 2023, Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected the proposed ban , but indicated that she may support such a ban if it included a wage threshold of $250,000.

In speaking with reporters, Hochul said, [w]hat Im looking at right now is striking the right balance between protecting low and middle-income workers, giving them flexibility to have mobility to go from job to job as they continue up the ladder of success  .

But those who are successful have a lot more negotiation power, and theyre at the industries that are an important part of our economy here in New York.

If a wage threshold is implemented for the proposed noncompete ban, New York would join several other locations that have enacted such bans for high-income earners, such as Washington, DC , Colorado and Washington state .

Beyond a wage threshold, a sale-of-business exception (allowing owners and partners to sign noncompetes in connection with a sale or merger involving their business) has been advocated for inclusion in a revised bill .

Adding such an exception would bring the revised bill more in line with what other states, such as California, have included in their own noncompete laws.

Employers should watch for a revised proposal soon.

3. Review your arbitration agreements Employers should review their arbitration agreements to ensure they contain appropriate language in response to the latest court rulings affecting arbitration of employment disputes.

PAGA claims Golden State employers in particular should take note of the California Supreme Courts recent ruling on California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claims.

In Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. , the court analyzed standing issues in the wake of the US Supreme Courts decision in Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana , 142 S. Ct. 1906 (2022), which held that an individual lacks standing to retain a representative PAGA claim once their individual PAGA claim is sent to arbitration.

In a departure from Viking River , the Adolph court held that an order compelling arbitration of an individual PAGA claim does not strip the plaintiff of standing to litigate the non-individual (or representative) PAGA claim in court.

Rather, the trial court will retain the discretion to issue a stay of a non-individual representative PAGA claim while the individual claim is arbitrated.

Employers with California employees should therefore review and revise their agreements to ensure that any non-arbitrable claim  which includes any representative PAGA claim  is stayed (i.e., suspended) pending the outcome of any arbitrable claim, including individual PAGA claims.

Ensuring that an individual PAGA claim is adjudicated first can help prevent a representative PAGA claim from proceeding in the event that the arbitrator finds that the plaintiff is not an aggrieved employee.

Employers also should ensure that their agreements contain a robust severability clause, including within any class or representative action waiver provision, so that properly arbitrable claims are compelled to arbitration.

Mandatory stay of proceedings In revising arbitration agreements, California employers should take stock of Senate Bill 365, which takes effect January 1, 2024.

As we reported in our November 7 client alert , this new law amends the California Code of Civil Procedure so that trial court proceedings are not automatically stayed when a party appeals an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration.

This law contrasts with the US Supreme Courts decision in Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski earlier in 2023, which held that a partys appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration triggers an automatic stay of the merits of the underlying federal court proceedings.

While SB 365 undoubtedly will be challenged on preemption grounds, employers can take steps in the meantime to mitigate against the risk that actions do not proceed while court decisions are challenged."
Cooley,Year-End Tasks for US Employers Facing Compliance Obligations,"For example, employers can ensure that their agreements are expressly governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).

SB 365 could suffer the same fate as Californias Assembly Bill 51 limiting the ability of employers to require mandatory arbitration of certain statutory employment claims, which was declared preempted by the FAA by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit earlier this year.

In addition, employers should be prepared for potential increased costs as a result of defending a case in trial court during the pendency of an appeal of an order denying a motion to compel arbitration, and they may want to consider, if possible, removing cases to federal court, which generally provides a more favorable forum.

Other possible arbitration developments All US employers should stay tuned, as the new year likely will bring further developments regarding arbitration.

For example, the Supreme Court will be hearing Bissonnette v. LePage Bakeries Park St., LLC , which may resolve a circuit split regarding the exemption under the FAA of transportation workers engaged in interstate transportation.

Legislation pending in Congress also may limit the arbitrability of certain claims, such as age discrimination and race discrimination claims.

4. Take stock of your relationships In October 2023, the NLRB issued a final rule on determining joint employer status under the NLRA.

The rule greatly expands the circumstances under which a business entity may be found to be a joint employer of another entitys employees.

Although the rule  originally slated to take effect on December 26, 2023  was delayed to February 26, 2024, due to legal challenges, employers should take the time now to review and assess their business relationships with any vendors, independent contractors, staffing agencies, professional employer organizations, or other third parties who may supply labor or services.

The rule establishes that two or more entities may be considered joint employers of a group of employees if each entity has an employment relationship with the employees, and if the entities share or codetermine one or more of the employees essential terms and conditions of employment.

It rescinds the 2020 rule, which established a joint employer relationship if the putative joint employer had direct and immediate control over an essential term or condition of employment.

The rule defines such essential terms and conditions of employment to include: Wages, benefits, and other compensation.

Hours of work and scheduling.

The assignment of duties to be performed.

The supervision of the performance of duties.

Work rules and directions governing the manner, means and methods of the performance of duties, and the grounds for discipline.

The tenure of employment, including hiring and discharge.

Working conditions related to the safety and health of employees.

Under the rule, a business is a joint employer even if the control over these essential terms and conditions of employment are not actually exercised.

The NLRB explained that including such reserved control accounts for situations in which an employer maintains authority but has not yet exercised such control because the reality is that an entity holding such control may step in at any moment to affect essential terms.

In addition, an employer now includes any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly.

The NLRB explained that this modification prevents an entity that has an employment relationship with employees from avoiding joint employer status by using intermediaries to implement decisions about essential terms and conditions of employment.

If the rule survives legal challenge, the implications are vast."
Cooley,Year-End Tasks for US Employers Facing Compliance Obligations,"If the rule survives legal challenge, the implications are vast.

For example, the final rule provides that a joint employer must bargain collectively with representatives of the employees that it possesses the authority to control or exercises the power to control (regardless of whether that term or condition is deemed to be an essential term or condition of employment under the rule).

Putative joint employers also could be held liable for unfair labor practices brought before the NLRB.

Employers should consider their relationships with third parties supplying services or labor, then review relevant agreements for language that could be construed as demonstrating an ability to control  even indirectly  an essential term and condition of employment over a third partys employees.

Although the final rule could look different as a result of legal challenge, this assessment will help employers get ahead and understand the range of control they exercise or retain the ability to exercise, and the kinds of terms and conditions over which they have such control.

( Note: The NLRBs joint employment rule only affects joint employment under the NLRA, and does not impact joint employment under other laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act.)

5. Audit your artificial intelligence

The end of the year is a great time for employers using AI-based tools that significantly contribute to employment decisions to audit their technology, in coordination with counsel.

Even though a bias audit may be required in some instances, such as under New York Citys Local Law 144, employers still should conduct regular audits of any tool used, because algorithms and data used in AI systems can continuously change and, as a result, the tool may require continuous tweaking.

Further, some laws, including NYCs Local Law 144, only require a bias audit to analyze certain selection criteria, such as race/ethnicity and sex categories.

Employers should consider conducting an audit of qualifying tools that examines all protected categories.

In addition, such audits can help ensure that the outputs of AI tools continue to meet business objectives.

Employers can expect that the new year will bring further legislation and guidance from the federal government regulating employers use of AI.

For example, in its October 2023 executive order on AI , the Biden administration tasked the US attorney generals office and civil rights offices within independent regulatory agencies to discuss preventing and addressing discrimination in the use of automated systems, including algorithmic discrimination.

In the meantime, employers can review our 10-Step Plan for Employers Using Artificial Intelligence in Employment Processes to learn more about best practices for using AI tools in employment processes.

Cooley,EU Reaches Political Agreement on Groundbreaking New Rules for Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Impacting US Companies,"On 14 December 2023, the European Union (EU) announced that it had reached political agreement on the new Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD or CS3D).

Once adopted, the CSDDD will create new and far-reaching mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence obligations for EU and non-EU companies operating in the EU.

For the first time, large companies also will be required to adopt and put into effect a plan ensuring that their business model and strategy are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 C.

This new legislation represents a significant shift from the voluntary regimes of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

The CSDDD establishes a civil liability regime for damages and introduces penalties for noncompliance  including fines of up to 5% of a companys global turnover.

While we are waiting for the full text of the provisional agreement to become available, we have listed some key highlights below.

Who does the CSDDD apply to?

The new diligence rules will apply to: EU companies with more than 500 employees and a net global turnover of more than 150 million euros, or which operate in specific high-impact sectors (e.g. manufacture, food, clothing and textiles) with more than 250 employees and a net global turnover of 40 million euros.

Non-EU companies meeting certain thresholds for turnover generated in the EU.

There remains some uncertainty as to exactly what EU presence (if any) is required for non-EU companies to come in scope.

Whether the financial services industry should be included in the scope of the CSDDD was a point of significant tension in the negotiation of the final text.

It has been reported that financial services will be temporarily excluded from the due diligence obligations in the CSDDD.

This is something, however, that European legislators have emphasized will be reviewed at a later date.

Notwithstanding, the financial sector will still be required to adopt and put into effect a climate transition plan ensuring their business model complies with limiting global warming to 1.5 C. We anticipate that the CSDDD also will indirectly impact many companies that are not themselves in scope.

If they are upstream or downstream of in-scope companies, they can expect to receive requests for information, contractual assurances and audits to verify compliance.

What are the main features of the CSDDD?

Due diligence obligation The CSDDD introduces a requirement for in-scope companies to identify and either prevent, mitigate or bring to an end actual or potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts.

In practice, this means companies will need to: Integrate human rights and environmental due diligence into their policies.

Identify actual and potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations and those of their subsidiaries and upstream and downstream business partners (e.g., child labour and exploitation of workers, pollution, and biodiversity loss).

Take appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate potential adverse impacts.

Bring to an end, minimize and remedy adverse impacts that materialise.

Establish and maintain a notification mechanism and complaints procedure.

Monitor the effectiveness of their due diligence policy and measures.

Publicly communicate due diligence procedures.

Mandatory climate transition plan The CSDDD requires companies  including those in the financial services industry  to adopt and put into effect a climate transition plan with time-bound targets for climate change mitigation to ensure that their business strategy is compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 C. Reportedly, it also will be a requirement for a companys director remuneration to be linked to the implementation of the climate transition plan."
Cooley,EU Reaches Political Agreement on Groundbreaking New Rules for Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Impacting US Companies,"The law is likely to require companies to revisit their current climate targets and associated disclosure practices.

Whether this obligation extends to non-EU companies operating in the EU is unclear, but clarity is expected on publication of the agreed text.

Value chain considerations The CSDDD will apply to the companys own operations, its subsidiaries, and their upstream and downstream business partners.

The exact definition of business partners is not yet known but will be clarified on publication of the agreed text.

Companies will be expected to use their leverage to engage and effect change throughout their value chains.

In extremis, companies will be required to disengage if the adverse impacts cannot be prevented.

Enforcement Fines Companies that do not comply with these rules may face sanctions from national administrative authorities  including fines of up to 5% of their global turnover if they fail to comply.

New civil liability regime The CSDDD introduces a civil liability regime whereby companies could be liable for damages if their failure to comply results in harm.

Concerned parties  including trade unions and civil society organizations  will have a five-year period to bring claims against a company, and claimants will reportedly benefit from reduced disclosure and procedural cost requirements.

Exclusion from public tenders Compliance with the CSDDD also could be qualified as a criterion for the award of public contracts and concessions.

Next steps?

The provisional agreement still needs to be formally approved by the European Parliament and European Council, and its possible there could be changes along the way (usually legal linguistic amendments, but theoretically other changes also could pass).

The text of the legislation will then be signed and published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force 20 days later to complete the lawmaking process.

In terms of timing, wed expect this lawmaking process to be completed between the first and second quarters of 2024, with the new requirements starting to apply beginning in Q1 or Q2 2026.

It is possible that a longer lead time will apply for non-EU companies.

These rules are part of the EUs broader push to promote a shift to sustainable international business.

Cooley,OCC Issues Risk Management Guidance for BNPL Lending,"On December 6, 2023, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a bulletin that provides guidance to banks on managing risks associated with certain buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans.

While the OCC notes that BNPL loans can provide consumers with a low-cost, short-term, small-dollar financing alternative to manage cash flow, it warns that BNPL lending can result in risks to consumers, as well as credit, compliance, operational, strategic, and reputation risks to banks, and that such risks should be mitigated.

The OCC bulletin specifically applies to loans that are repayable in four or fewer installments with no finance charges (i.e., no interest and no other finance charges).

The OCC clarifies that the guidance does not apply to traditional installment loans, meaning loans repayable in more than four installments, or loans that charge interest or have other finance charges.

Potential risks highlighted by the OCC The OCC highlights potential risks for borrowers and banks that stem from BNPL lending, including: Risk to borrowers Overextension risk: Borrowers may overextend themselves, because they may not fully understand BNPL repayment obligations  in part due to the lack of standardized disclosure requirements.

Secondary fees: Because borrower loan payments associated with BNPL lending are generally tied to a debit or credit card, there is a follow-on risk due to overextension that can result in secondary fees charged to the borrower, such as overdraft or late fees.

Other issues: Borrowers may experience issues with respect to returns associated with merchandise purchased by the borrower in connection with a BNPL loan.

In addition, resulting merchant disputes can be potentially troublesome for BNPL borrowers and banks, because disputes between a borrower and a merchant may not be resolved during the limited time period of a BNPL loan term.

Risk to banks Credit risk: Creditors may not know of a borrowers existing credit obligations and a borrowers actual ability to repay, because BNPL loans may not be fully captured in borrower credit histories.

Third-party relationship risk: Some banks contract directly with merchants to offer BNPL loans, while others may work with a third-party BNPL provider to intermediate with merchants.

Third-party relationships may pose operational and compliance risk in situations where the bank does not directly control third-party activity.

Default risk: Risk of default may arise, such as due to fraud.

OCC guidance for managing risk To manage risks from BNPL lending, the OCC notes that [b]anks engaging in BNPL lending should do so within a risk management system that is commensurate with associated risks.

Specifically, the OCC states that banks should maintain underwriting, repayment terms, pricing, and safeguards that minimize adverse customer outcomes and should ensure marketing materials include appropriate disclosures that are clear and conspicuous.

More specifically, the OCC suggests the following to assist banks in mitigating risk: Credit risk management Banks should establish policies and procedures for BNPL lending that  among other elements  cover loan terms, underwriting criteria and fees.

Specifically, BNPL underwriting criteria and repayment assessment methodologies should provide reasonable assurance that the borrower can repay the debt.

Operational risk management Banks should address operational risk in a number of ways, including: Establishing processes for handling merchandise returns and merchant disputes.

Maintaining ongoing monitoring and reporting for BNPL loans.

Considering developing BNPL-specific fraud detection and mitigation systems.

Incorporating third-party models into the banks risk management process.

Third-party risk management Banks should remain cognizant of the compliance liabilities stemming from violations made by third-party partners and monitor their partners appropriately."
Cooley,OCC Issues Risk Management Guidance for BNPL Lending,"Third-party risk management Banks should remain cognizant of the compliance liabilities stemming from violations made by third-party partners and monitor their partners appropriately.

The OCC expects a bank to have risk management processes to effectively manage the risks arising from its activities, including from third-party relationships, and a bank that partners with a third party, including a merchant, to offer BNPL loans should incorporate that relationship into the banks third-party risk management processes.

The OCC instructs banks to refer to recent interagency guidance on managing risks associated with third-party relationships.

Compliance risk management Bank management should determine the applicability of consumer protection-related laws and regulations to the banks specific BNPL offerings, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.

Banks should consider whether and how consumer protection laws  including with respect to product delivery methods, marketing and advertising  apply to BNPL loans, and review all aspects of marketing, advertising and consumer disclosures to ensure that they clearly state a borrowers obligations under the loan agreement.

Banks also should review billing dispute and error resolution rights and policies and procedures surrounding automatic payments, multiple payment representments and fees (including late fees).

Finally, BNPL lending should be included in the banks compliance management system.

Industrywide credit reporting The OCC suggests that industrywide, consistent credit bureau reporting would help banks manage credit risk while allowing borrowers who make payments on time to build credit history.

Continued regulatory focus on BNPL loans The OCCs guidance demonstrates continued regulatory focus on BNPL lending.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) also has been active in reviewing the BNPL market  including by releasing September 2022 and March 2023 reports on BNPL products  and Director Rohit Chopra has instructed CFPB staff to identify potential interpretive guidance or rules to issue with the goal of ensuring that Buy Now, Pay Later firms adhere to many of the baseline protections that Congress has already established for credit cards.

Parties involved in BNPL lending should continue to review their policies and procedures for compliance in this evolving space and expect continued scrutiny of  and the potential for further federal regulation of  BNPL products."
Cooley,"FinCEN Beneficial Ownership Rule Effective January 1, 2024 – But With Reporting Deadline Extension","The beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule implementing Section 6403 of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) was finalized by the US Department of the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in September 2022.

The BOI rule starts taking effect on January 1, 2024, and, as a general matter, sets a 30-day deadline for covered companies formed after January 1, 2024, to submit required reports.

However, on November 30, 2023 , FinCEN granted a partial reprieve by finalizing a rule that extends the time frame for submitting required reports from 30 days to 90 days.

This extension, which applies only to companies created in 2024, means that a covered company created on or after January 1, 2024, must submit a report of its beneficial owners and related company information  a BOI report  within 90 days of receiving notice of the companys creation or registration.

Non-exempt companies in existence as of December 31, 2023 (i.e., the end of this year) still must submit a BOI report by January 1, 2025.

A reporting company that is created on or after January 1, 2025, must submit a BOI report within 30 days after receiving notice of the companys creation or registration.

Such companies should note, however, that the deadline reverts to 30 days on January 1, 2025, meaning that a company created late in 2024 can avail itself of the 90-day filing deadline extension only until the end of the year, then must complete the filing by the end of January (if the filing is not already due before then).

Even with the extension to the filing deadline for 2024, companies still should consider how the BOI rule may apply and what steps they need to take to meet its requirements.

Below, weve provided an overview of some of the key elements of the BOI rule that can serve as a starting point for developing an action plan to address this new reporting regime.

What makes a company a covered reporting company?

A reporting company is any company formed in the US, or any foreign company that registers to do business in the US, by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office, unless it comes within the scope of an exemption.

There are 23 categories of exemptions from the BOI rule.

Companies that qualify under any of these exemptions will not be reporting companies and will not need to file BOI reports (unless they later become non-exempt).

Some of the exemptions likely to have broad relevance are noted below, and additional detail on each exemption, including the specific criteria, is provided by FinCEN in Section 1.2 of the Small Entity Compliance Guide .

In spite of the breadth of the exemptions, however, many newly and recently formed privately held companies are not likely to qualify for an exemption, and thus will be subject to the BOI rule.

Additionally, holding companies or other similar vehicles may in some cases not be within any of the categories of exemptions, though a detailed analysis may be required based on the specific facts and circumstances of a particular organizations structure.

Key exemptions likely to exclude many companies from the BOI rules reporting requirements include exemptions for the following types of entities: Large operating companies, which the BOI rule defines to include any company that employs more than 20 full-time employees in the US, has more than $5,000,000 in gross receipts or sales in the US, and has an operating presence at a physical office within the US.

Public companies, based on the BOI rule definition of a securities reporting issuer.

Certain types of regulated entities, such as insurance companies, banks and credit unions, brokers or dealers in securities, and money services businesses (MSBs).

Entities involved in private equity and venture capital  specifically, investment companies, investment advisers, pooled investment vehicles and venture capital fund advisers  subject to certain criteria."
Cooley,"FinCEN Beneficial Ownership Rule Effective January 1, 2024 – But With Reporting Deadline Extension","Subsidiaries of certain exempt entities, including larger operating companies, public companies, regulated entities such as banks (but not MSBs), and the exempt private equity and venture capital entities, are also exempt from BOI reporting, provided in each case that the subsidiarys ownership interests are controlled, or wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the exempt entity.

What do reporting companies need to do?

A reporting company must submit a BOI report to FinCEN that includes three types of information: Company information, such as full legal name (and any trade names), address, jurisdiction of formation, and taxpayer identification number (or equivalent issued by a foreign jurisdiction).

Beneficial owner information, including the full legal name, date of birth, address, and the unique identifying number and image of a US passport, state drivers license, or other eligible identification document for each individual identified as a beneficial owner.

Company applicant information, for companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, which is the same information required to be provided for beneficial owners.

Companies must collect the required information and submit BOI reports through FinCENs Beneficial Ownership Secure System (BOSS).

The final form of the BOI report has not yet been made available as of the date of this alert, and FinCEN is not yet accepting BOI reports.

A reporting company must file an updated BOI report to communicate changes to company or beneficial owner information (including the beneficial owners identities and previously submitted information for them)

no later than 30 days after the date on which the change occurred

.

BOI report data also must be updated within 30 days after the date the company becomes aware of an inaccuracy in a previously filed BOI report or had reason to know of such inaccuracy.

Company applicant information does not need to be updated on a reporting companys BOI report in the event the information changes (e.g., a change in address of a company applicant), but a reporting company does need to file an updated BOI report if there are inaccuracies in previously reported company applicant information.

Companies are not otherwise required to submit BOI reports on an annual or other periodic basis as a matter of course.

What is a beneficial owner?

Under the BOI rule, a beneficial owner is any individual who, directly or indirectly exercises substantial control over a reporting company or owns or controls at least 25% of the ownership interests of a reporting company.

The BOI rule describes four categories of substantial control: The individual is a senior officer (e.g., CEO, chief financial officer, general counsel).

The individual has authority to unilaterally appoint or remove any such senior officer or a majority of the board of directors of the reporting company.

The individual directs, determines or has substantial influence over important decisions made by the reporting company.

The individual has any other form of substantial control over the reporting company.

Ownership interests for purposes of the BOI rule can include equity, stock or voting rights; a capital or profit interest; convertible instruments; options or other nonbinding privileges to buy or sell any of the aforementioned types of interests; or any other instrument, contract or other mechanism used to establish ownership.

To determine whether an individual owns or controls, directly or indirectly, at least 25% of the ownership interests of the company, a reporting company may need to first identify the types of ownership interests, then calculate whether any single individuals interests exceed 25%."
Cooley,"FinCEN Beneficial Ownership Rule Effective January 1, 2024 – But With Reporting Deadline Extension","FinCENs Small Entity Compliance Guide provides additional information, including checklists, for identifying individuals who are beneficial owners based on the substantial control and ownership interests prongs, but companies with more complex ownership and/or governance structures may need to conduct a more detailed and nuanced analysis to identify beneficial owners.

What is a company applicant?

Reporting companies created after January 1, 2024, are required to identify and report company applicants.

Each such reporting company will have at least one and a maximum of two company applicants.

Under the BOI rule, a company applicant is defined as: (1) the individual who directly files the document that creates a domestic reporting company or first registers a foreign reporting company to do business in the US; and, if applicable, (2) the individual primarily responsible for directing or controlling the filing of the creation or registration document.

Reporting companies created or registered on or before December 31, 2023, do not have to report company applicants when they start reporting by January 1, 2025.

What is a FinCEN identifier and why does it matter?

A FinCEN identifier is a unique identifying number that FinCEN will issue to an individual upon request.

An individual may directly apply for a FinCEN identifier by providing the same information that a reporting company would submit on behalf of the individual as a company applicant or beneficial owner.

(In certain instances, a reporting company may wish to obtain a FinCEN identifier and can request the issuance when filing its BOI report.)

A reporting company may report an individuals FinCEN identifier in place of the required four pieces of information about the individual in BOI reports.

An individual who is either a beneficial owner or a company applicant of a reporting company will therefore not need to provide personal information directly to the reporting company if the individual has obtained a FinCEN identifier and provides it to the reporting company instead.

An individual must keep the information provided to FinCEN to obtain a FinCEN identifier (e.g., address information) updated.

Similar to the BOI report, FinCEN has not yet made public the final form of the FinCEN identifier application, and FinCEN is not yet accepting FinCEN identifier requests.

What are the penalties for noncompliance?

Any person who willfully provides, or attempts to provide, false or fraudulent BOI data to FinCEN  or willfully fails to report complete or updated BOI data to FinCEN  may be subject to civil or criminal penalties of up to $10,000 and up to two years in prison.

A person fails to report complete or updated BOI data to FinCEN if, with respect to a reporting company, the person causes the failure, which could include an individuals refusal to provide or submit required information for a reporting companys BOI report.

Next steps Companies currently in existence have time to determine if the BOI rule applies, because it does not take effect until January 1, 2025, for companies created or registered on or before December 31, 2023.

Nevertheless, such companies may wish to start developing processes to determine whether the BOI rule applies and to be able to evaluate whether newly created entities within the corporate family (e.g., subsidiaries, special purpose vehicles) are subject to the rule.

Newly formed companies, and persons or entities that are involved in or create such companies  such as entrepreneurs, venture funds, and other investors and investment vehicles  will need to determine whether the BOI rule applies and, if so, how they will address reporting requirements.

All covered companies should continue to monitor for updates from FinCEN regarding the reporting process generally, including the availability of the FinCEN reporting forms and access to the BOSS."

Cooley,UK Government Consulting on National Security and Investment Regime,"Just shy of two years since the UK National Security and Investment (NSI) Act entered into force, on 13 November 2023, the UK government published a Call for Evidence on the functioning, scope and performance of the regime.

While the UK government is not anticipating any changes to the primary legislation (such as the thresholds for mandatory notification), the government is keen to hear views on: Whether targeted exemptions to the mandatory filing thresholds may be appropriate.

Whether there are activities within the 17 specified sectors that are unlikely to create national security risks.

How it can improve the operation of the NSI Act, particularly regarding the transparency of the process and communications between affected parties and the Investment Security Unit, the body responsible for administering the NSI regime in the UK.

Interested parties also are encouraged to give NSI-related feedback beyond the areas specified in the Call for Evidence.

There is a free text box within the survey designed to allow respondents to provide their additional views and suggestions.

The governments desire to further improve and refine the operation of the UK NSI regime is to be welcomed, particularly at a time when other governments are looking to strengthen their foreign direct investment regimes.

It also shows that the UK government is taking a dynamic and forward-looking approach to managing national security risks in light of geopolitical and economic challenges.

All interested stakeholders have until 15 January 2024 to share their views .

Below, we summarise the main areas under consideration and how interested parties can make their views known.

Hundreds of deals reviewed but very few interventions  current mismatch explained The NSI Act 2021 came into force on 4 January 2022 and allows the UK government to scrutinise and  if necessary  intervene in a very broad range of deals and investments on UK national security grounds.

While the regime casts a very wide net, with more than 850 notifications reviewed between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023, the vast majority of notified transactions cleared within 30 working days, with only a handful subject to conditions or ultimately blocked.

The Call for Evidence is therefore an opportunity for the government to hear views on how the NSI regime could be more business-friendly, while maintaining and refining the essential sectors needed to protect UK national security.

This is consistent with the governments approach to the consultation which advocates for a small garden, high fence approach  with a view to capturing only a small number of deals which genuinely raise UK national security concerns.

The Call for Evidence also coincides with the publication of the Harrington Review of Foreign Direct Investment on 22 November 2023, which seeks greater clarity from the UK government on its foreign investment strategy and a firmer commitment to various strategic measures intended to boost investor confidence in the UK.

Together, these initiatives illustrate how the UK is entering a critical period, as it tries to position itself as an attractive destination for foreign investment while at the same time managing potential threats to its national security.

Overview of the Call for Evidence The Call for Evidence is divided into six sections.

Importantly, respondents do not have to complete all sections of the survey in order to submit their views, and they also can start, save and resume their response as needed.

Key sections worth noting are: Section 4: This section asks respondents about the impact of the NSI regime on their investments and their approach to investments.

In particular, the government is keen to hear from investors and businesses on whether they have changed their investment strategy as a result of the NSI Act.

Section 5:

This section seeks input on the scope of the NSI regime."
Cooley,UK Government Consulting on National Security and Investment Regime,"Section 5:

This section seeks input on the scope of the NSI regime.

In particular: Targeted exemptions: The government is considering whether some targeted exemptions to the mandatory notification regime may be appropriate; for example, where the transaction tends to give either minimal levels of control or does not present any real change in control, such as internal reorganisations .

Currently, internal reorganisations require mandatory notification even where there is no change in the ultimate beneficial owner.

The government is considering whether to exclude low-risk internal reorganisations from the scope of the mandatory notification regime, whilst ensuring that it remains aware of certain higher-risk reorganisations that warrant government scrutiny.

To this end, stakeholders are being asked to provide input on how different types of reorganisations influence control.

Refining the sectors in scope : The government has asked for feedback on whether there are aspects of the 17 mandatory sectors which are very unlikely to create national security risks  or where compliance with mandatory notification places substantial burdens on businesses and investors.

Respondents are invited to provide feedback on the following mandatory sectors, amongst others: Clarifying the scope of Advanced Materials and Critical Suppliers to Government .

Simplifying the definition of Synthetic Biology .

Refining the scope of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and moving certain AI activities which do not present national security risks out of scope.

At the same time, the government is asking for views on whether to include new areas such as generative AI.

Expanding the scope of Communications to cover smaller networks with less than 50 million in UK turnover.

Clarifying and expanding the scope of Data Infrastructure to cover colocation data centres.

Refining and clarifying the scope of Defence to reduce the likelihood of capturing acquisitions that do not raise national security concerns and further increasing the understanding within the sector of what activities are captured.

Updating Energy to add multipurpose interconnectors in line with the Energy Act 2023.

Clarifying and expanding the scope of Suppliers to the Emergency Services  in particular, whether subcontractors providing sensitive services to the emergency services or requiring access to sensitive locations should be brought within scope of mandatory notification.

Additional sectors: The government also is considering adding Semiconductors and Critical Minerals as new mandatory stand-alone sectors.

Interestingly, both sectors are currently caught under the regime, but the government is considering whether stand-alone sectors would provide further clarity.

Section 6:

This section is focused on the operation of the NSI Act and how the government can improve transparency and communications with parties.

Next steps The consultation closes on 15 January 2024.

The government will assess the responses received and expects that  at least for certain proposals  a more detailed consultation will follow.

This will likely entail sharing iterative drafts at the consultation stage and working with sector experts to ensure that any proposed changes are correct.

In this context, the government also is looking to hold follow-up conversations with any respondents who are willing to be contacted to discuss their views, and respondents can leave their contact details in the survey for this purpose.

Although no definitive timeline has been provided, we would expect any additional consultations in the second half of 2024, as the government will be working towards publishing its review of the 17 sectors before 4 January 2025.

Outlook The responses to this Call for Evidence will be used to inform the governments review of the 17 mandatory sector definitions, with a view to refining and supplementing them as needed."
Cooley,UK Government Consulting on National Security and Investment Regime,"Outlook The responses to this Call for Evidence will be used to inform the governments review of the 17 mandatory sector definitions, with a view to refining and supplementing them as needed.

The Call for Evidence also will assist the government in identifying opportunities to improve and streamline the NSI notification and assessment process to minimise burdens for businesses.

The terminology employed by the government in launching the consultation is notable and demonstrates how the government is well attuned to the activities in the US and European Union in this dynamic and evolving area.

In particular, in the opening paragraph, there are three references to economic security, which is at the heart of the EUs new European Economic Security Strategy (see our related October 2023 alert ).

Also, similar to how US officials have described their method to outbound investment screening rules, the government referred to the UKs investment screening regime as a small garden, high fence approach.

Whatever the motivation behind this timely consultation, now is a time to shape the future of the UKs NSI regime.

It is vitally important that the government hear from as many different stakeholders and interested parties as possible.

The deadline for submitting responses to the Call for Evidence is 15 January 2024.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – November One-Minute Reads,"Appeals court orders SEC to repair share repurchase rules Our May 2023 One-Minute Reads discussed the Securities and Exchange Commissions adoption of final rules regarding share repurchase disclosures.

In response, the US Chamber of Commerce brought a suit in the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit against the SEC to prevent implementation of these new share repurchase rules.

One argument proffered by the petitioners in the case was that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in adopting the final rules by not considering comments or conducting a proper cost benefit analysis.

On October 31, the three-judge panel issued its opinion and granted the petition, holding that the SEC violated the Administrative Procedure Act by acting arbitrarily and capriciously for failing to substantiate the rules benefits and costs and applying inconsistent logic.

Importantly, the court did not vacate the rule  it instead remanded the rule back to the SEC for 30 days to attempt to repair the defects.

Now we wait and see whether the SEC can adequately repair the defects or if the court ultimately will vacate the rule.

For more information on the rules, see this May 8 Cooley client alert and this May 8 Cooley PubCo blog post .

SEC charges CISO in enforcement action In June, SolarWinds filed an 8-K in which it announced that certain of its current and former executive officers and employees, including its chief information security officer (CISO), received Wells Notices from the SEC in connection with the investigation into the prominent Russian cyberattack against the company.

Then, on October 30, the SEC announced charges against the company and its CISO for fraud and internal control failures relating to allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.

Per the press release, the SECs filing alleges that during the two-year period between the companys October 2018 initial public offering and the December 2020 announcement of the cyberattack, SolarWinds allegedly misled investors by disclosing only generic and hypothetical risks at a time when the company and [the CISO] knew of specific deficiencies in SolarWinds cybersecurity practices as well as the increasingly elevated risks the company faced at the same time.

The filing is the latest SEC enforcement action highlighting the use of hypothetical risk factors when a risk has come to fruition, as well as yet another action in which the SEC has focused on inadequate controls.

SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal noted that the enforcement action underscores [the SECs] message to issuers: implement strong controls calibrated to your risk environments and level with investors about known concerns.

Notably, the complaint implies the SEC found it important that the CISO was an officer at the time of these events and signed sub-certifications attesting to the adequacy of the companys cybersecurity internal controls.

Gensler talks climate after California representatives request Scope 3 reporting requirements On October 26, SEC Chair Gary Gensler spoke with the US Chamber of Commerces Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness on recent climate disclosure developments.

In his introduction to the conversation, the center's president and CEO highlighted his concern that climate requirements being imposed by several different jurisdictions will result in companies facing duplicate, differing, overlapping and even conflicting requirements.

In responding to this critique, Gensler noted the SECs remit to improve the capital markets for investors and issuers, not to regulate climate, and repeatedly hammered home that the SEC is focused on US law as interpreted by US courts, not other jurisdictions."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – November One-Minute Reads,"The discussion then turned to the SECs proposal, with Gensler discussing the contents of the 16,000 comment letters the SEC has received on it, followed by some back-and-forth on the benefits of certain aspects of the proposal, including the Scope 3 reporting requirement.

For a detailed summary of the discussion, refer to this October 30 Cooley PubCo blog post .

On the topic of the Scope 3 requirement included in the SECs proposal (but separate from the discussion), 26 California representatives in Congress sent a letter to Gensler in mid-October urging inclusion of Scope 3 reporting requirements in the final rules, reasoning that the additional cost of compliance for companies subject to Californias new climate disclosure laws will be negligible.

SEC approves Nasdaq proposal regarding reverse stock splits Our August One-Minute Reads discussed Nasdaqs filing of a proposed rule change with the SEC to establish listing standards related to notification and disclosure of reverse stock splits.

On November 1, the SEC issued an order approving the proposal.

Under existing Nasdaq listing rules, a reverse stock split qualifies as a Substitution Listing Event, which previously has required companies to notify Nasdaq no later than 15 calendar days prior to implementation of the event.

Companies also had been required to make prompt disclosure of any material information that would reasonably be expected to affect the value of its securities or influence investors decisions, which, Nasdaq states, includes reverse stock splits.

Under the approved listing rules, a reverse stock split no longer qualifies as a Substitution Listing Event, and a company conducting a reverse split is required to notify Nasdaq about certain details of the reverse split by submitting a complete Company Event Notification Form at least five business days (no later than 12:00 pm Eastern Time) before the anticipated market effective date.

The new listing rules also require public disclosure about the reverse stock split in a Regulation FD-compliant manner at least two business days (no later than 12:00 pm ET) before the anticipated market effective date, while additional provisions would require timely notice to Nasdaqs MarketWatch Department, as with other news.

These changes will be reflected in new Rules 5250(b)(4) and 5250(e)(7), new Rule IM-5250-3, and amended Rule 5250(b)(1).

Compliance with these notification and disclosure requirements will be required for Nasdaq to process a reverse stock split.

In addition, Nasdaq notes that if a company attempts to effect a reverse stock split while failing to satisfy these requirements, or provides incomplete or inaccurate information, Nasdaq will halt the stock in accordance with the procedure set forth in [Nasdaq] Equity 4, Rule 4120(a)(1), which provides Nasdaq with the authority to halt trading to permit the dissemination of material news.

SEC settles charges for unauthorized stock repurchase program On November 14, the SEC announced settled charges against Charter Communications for violating internal accounting controls requirements relating to its stock repurchase program.


Per the press release, the SEC claims that Charters board authorized certain buybacks using trading plans conforming to SEC Rule 10b5-1, but the SEC found that from 2017 to 2021, Charter used plans that included accordion provisions, which company personnel described as giving Charter flexibility allowing them company to change the total dollar amounts available to buy back stock and to change the timing of buybacks after the plans took effect.

According to the order, because Charters trading plans did not meet the conditions of Rule 10b5-1, the companys buybacks did not comport with the boards authorizations."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – November One-Minute Reads,"According to the order, because Charters trading plans did not meet the conditions of Rule 10b5-1, the companys buybacks did not comport with the boards authorizations.

The order further found that Charters use of trading plans that did not conform to Rule 10b5-1 resulted from insufficient internal accounting controls to analyze whether the discretion the accordion provisions provided was consistent with the boards authorizations.

As with the SolarWinds action described above, this is another in a long list of recent enforcement actions that have applied the internal control provisions of Section 13 of the Exchange Act expansively as the basis for charges.

Charter agreed to pay a $25 million penalty to settle the charges.

Dissenting from the order , SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda argued that the controls found to be lacking were not accounting controls, but, rather legal controls, which are not covered by the section of the Exchange Act used as the basis for the charges.

Corp Fin announces new intake system for no-action requests On November 7, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance announced a new intake system for no-action requests from companies seeking to exclude a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.

Under Rule 14a-8(j), a company intending to exclude a shareholder proposal must file its reasons with the SEC no later than 80 calendar days before it files its definitive proxy statement with the SEC.

Per the announcement, Rule 14a-8 submissions and related correspondence must be submitted using an online shareholder proposal form .

This marks a departure from past practice, which includes emailing no-action requests and related correspondence to a monitored account, and also requires disclosure of the companys anticipated proxy print date.

Notably, submission of the new online form is not effective to transmit the correspondence to the proponent, as required by Rule 14a-8(j), and a separate email or message will be needed.

For more information on the new intake system, refer to this November 8 Cooley PubCo blog post .

Report highlights trends in cybersecurity breach disclosures In October, Audit Analytics published an informative report on trends in cybersecurity breach disclosures based on a review of data from 2011 through 2022.

In addition to providing an overview on the state of cyber breach disclosures over this 12-year period, the report provides information on the method of disclosure, types of cyber breaches, information compromised, records lost, cyber time frame and cyber costs.

Among many others, some highlights include: In 2022, 125 cyber breaches were disclosed by public companies, compared to 195 in 2021, marking the sharpest decline over the 12-year period.

Only 34% of cyber incidents initially were disclosed in an SEC filing, most commonly in a Form 8-K or Form 6-K. The percentage of disclosed cyber breaches related to unauthorized access increased to 69% in 2022 from 48% in 2021, followed by cyber breaches related to ransomware as a distant second at 17%.

On average, companies took 96 days to disclose a breach after it was discovered in 2022, up 2.5 weeks from 2021.

Of course, this data precedes the SECs new cybersecurity rules imposing specific requirements for the disclosure of cyber incidents.

Cooley,Beyond the UK AI Safety Summit – Outcomes and Direction of Travel,"The UK hosted more than 100 representatives from across the globe at its AI Safety Summit in early November 2023.

Leading up to the summit, we outlined the UK governments objectives and its current approach to artificial intelligence (AI) regulation.

We have now reflected on the outcomes of the summit  along with recent developments in the global regulatory landscape  and have summarised our key takeaways below.

Outcomes of the AI Safety Summit Bletchley Declaration on AI safety  Twenty-eight countries, including the US and China, as well as the European Union, reached a consensus on the need for sustained international cooperation to combat the risks posed by frontier AI. 1

Under the Bletchley Declaration, these nations have agreed to work together to ensure the development and deployment of human-centric, trustworthy and responsible AI.

The declaration emphasises the need to build a shared scientific and evidence-based understanding of the risks posed by frontier AI and respective risk-based policies across countries to ensure safety.

It also signifies that the global conversation on AI safety is far from over.

Indeed, the Republic of Korea is set to co-host a mini virtual summit on AI in May 2024, and France will host the next in-person summit in November 2024.

AI Safety Institute The UK announced the creation of its AI Safety Institute, tasked with researching the most advanced AI capabilities and testing the safety of emerging types of AI.

Separately, the US government announced the formation of its own AI Safety Institute, which will work together with the UKs institute.

In addition to collaborating with its international counterparts and like-minded governments, the UKs AI Safety Institute is expected to partner with domestic organisations  including the Alan Turing Institute and private companies.

AI testing and research  According to government materials , leading AI companies have recognised the importance of collaborating with governments, including the UK, on testing the next generation of AI models both before and after they are deployed.

The UK government also announced that it has invested 300 million in its national AI Research Resource.

The governments aim is to provide enhanced AI infrastructure for research projects to maximise the benefits of AI, while supporting critical work into frontier AI risk mitigation.

Frontier AI State of the Science Report  Countries represented at the summit agreed to develop a State of the Science Report on the capabilities and risks of frontier AI.

The report will summarise existing scientific research on risks and identify priority areas for further research.

According to government materials, the report will be published ahead of the mini virtual AI summit in Korea and will inform and complement other international initiatives.

Accelerating safe AI development globally  According to a government press release, the UK will work with Canada, the US, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and partners in Africa to fund safe and responsible AI projects for development around the world.

Global AI regulation beyond the AI Safety Summit The summit facilitated a global conversation on AI safety and established forums intended to promote international collaboration on AI regulation.

However, divergent views remain on exactly what type of regulation is required for AI, with multiple processes running in parallel  both nationally and internationally.

Just a few days before the summit, G7 leaders and the US government progressed separate efforts to regulate AI  with the G7 releasing a set of guiding principles and a voluntary code of conduct, and the Biden administration issuing an executive order on safe, secure and trustworthy AI.

In addition, the UN recently launched a new Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which will issue its own preliminary recommendations on building scientific consensus and making AI work for all of humanity by the end of 2023."
Cooley,Beyond the UK AI Safety Summit – Outcomes and Direction of Travel,"While these initiatives may be helpful in establishing principles and promoting knowledge-sharing, it remains to be seen whether there will be an alignment of international standards for regulating AI.

The risk of divergence has the potential to make this a challenging area for businesses to navigate.

At the EU level, disagreements on the regulation of foundation models may have potentially slowed the progress of negotiations on the draft EU AI Act.

France, Germany and Italy have reportedly released a joint paper advocating for more limited regulation of foundation models.

This contrasts with the position of other EU countries, such as Spain, which are in favour of more strict regulation of foundation models.

The joint paper reportedly proposes an innovation-friendly approach to regulating foundation models based on mandatory self-regulation.

Whats next for the UK?

In relation to the UKs domestic policy, there was no mention of an AI bill in the Kings speech on 7 November 2023, despite continued pressure from the House of Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee.

Indeed, the government confirmed in its post-summit response to the committees interim report on AI governance that it is committed to maintaining a pro-innovation approach and will not rush to legislation.

This response echoed UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks acknowledgement at the summit that binding requirements will likely be necessary to regulate AI in the future, but sufficient testing is needed to ensure legislation is based on empirical evidence.

The UK government is expected to issue the much-awaited response to its March 2023 AI white paper consultation later this year, and we will continue to monitor developments.

Notes The UK government defines  frontier AI  as highly capable, general purpose AI models  including foundation models  that can perform a wide variety of tasks and match or exceed the capabilities present in todays most advanced models.

Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is resolute in its quest to phase out its enforcement-discretion approach for laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).

On October 3, 2023, FDA published a proposed rule to confirm that LDTs are devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and to describe FDAs phase-out policy.

1

At the subsequent webinar on October 31, 2023, FDA reiterated its rationale for initiating this rulemaking and clarified certain issues.

Despite FDAs clarifications, uncertainty remains.

This alert provides a brief background on LDTs, discusses the proposed rule, summarizes FDAs recent clarifications and offers insights into the road ahead as FDA seeks to finalize the rule.

2 Background on LDTs FDA regulation defines in vitro diagnostic products (IVDs) 3 but not LDTs.

4 FDA has viewed LDTs as a subset of IVDs and expressed that there is no legal distinction between test kits made by conventional manufacturers and LDTs made by laboratories for their own use or another laboratorys use.

5

In FDAs view, both IVDs and LDTs are devices under section 201(h) of the FDCA.

6 Circumstances at the time of implementation of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 led FDA to adopt a general enforcement-discretion approach for LDTs, such that FDA generally has not enforced applicable requirements for most LDTs.

7

Specifically, back then, LDTs were mostly manufactured in small volumes by local laboratories for use in diagnosing rare diseases or for other uses in the local patient population.

8

These tests demonstrated characteristics of well-characterized, standard tests with components legally marketed for clinical use and tended to employ manual techniques performed by specialized laboratory personnel.

9

Since 1976, the landscape for LDTs has changed significantly.

10 Todays tests often use automation and rely on complex, software-based systems to generate and interpret laboratory results.

11 Such tests are often used in laboratories outside the patient healthcare setting and are manufactured by laboratory corporations in high volume for diverse patients nationwide.

12 FDA believes that these LDTs are commonly manufactured with instruments or other components not legally marketed for clinical use and are more often used to inform or direct critical treatment decisions concerning a wide range of serious medical conditions.

13 FDA also believes that many laboratory-made test systems today are functionally the same as those made by conventional IVD manufacturers, and thus have a similarly significant impact on patient care.

14

Yet, according to FDA, there are serious concerns about whether patients can rely on IVDs offered as LDTs.

15

These concerns arose from information suggesting that laboratories have not been conducting adequate validation studies, and that there have been high rates of false positive and false negative results that have caused, or may cause, patient harm.

16 FDA also believes that more recent evidence  including scientific literature, allegations of problematic tests reported to FDA, FDAs own experience in reviewing IVDs offered as LDTs, news articles, and class action lawsuits  suggests that the situation is getting worse.

17

Given these changed circumstances, FDA is proposing to change its approach to regulating LDTs, and thus has initiated the current rulemaking.

Main elements of the proposed rule In essence, FDA proposes to amend the definition of in vitro diagnostic products in 21 CFR  809.3(a), which states, [t]hese products are devices as defined under section 201(h) of the [FDCA].

To make clear that LDTs are devices under the FDCA, FDA proposes to add to the end of this definition the language including when the manufacturer of these products is a laboratory.

18

In the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA articulates a proposed phase-out approach for its current enforcement-discretion policy."
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"18

In the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA articulates a proposed phase-out approach for its current enforcement-discretion policy.

This approach is designed to increase FDA oversight in five stages over four years, beginning on the date the final rule is published, as described in Table 1.

Table 1: FDAs proposed phase-out of enforcement-discretion approach Stage Time from when final rule (final phase-out policy) is published Requirements under which general enforcement-discretion approach will be phased out 1 One year Requirements for medical device reporting (MDR) and corrections and removals 2 Two years Requirements other than MDR requirements, correction-and-removal reporting requirements, quality system (QS) requirements, and premarket review requirements 19 3 Three years QS requirements

20 4 Three and a half years

(but not before October 1, 2027)

Premarket approval (PMA) application requirements for high-risk LDTs (class III devices) 21 5 Four years (but not before April 1, 2028)

Premarket review requirements for low-risk (nonexempt class I devices) and moderate-risk (nonexempt class II devices) LDTs that require premarket submissions (510(k) or De Novo) 22 Categories of tests excluded from general enforcement-discretion approach For the following categories of tests, FDA will continue to expect immediate compliance with the FDCA, Public Health Service Act and implementing regulations: Blood donor screening tests, or human cells, tissues, and cellular- and tissue-based product (HCT/P) donor screening tests, required for infectious disease testing under 21 CFR  610.40 and  1271.80(c), respectively, or tests for the determination of blood group and Rh factors required under 21 CFR  640.5.

Tests intended for actual or potential emergencies or material threats declared under section 564 of the FDCA.

Direct-to-consumer tests (i.e., tests intended for consumer use without meaningful involvement by a licensed healthcare professional).

Categories of tests not affected by the phase-out policy The proposed rule states that the following categories of tests are not affected by the proposed phase-out policy, meaning that FDA will continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to these tests: 1976-type LDTs, which have certain characteristics that were commonly associated with LDTs offered in 1976, including: Use of manual techniques (without automation) performed by laboratory personnel with specialized expertise.

Use of components legally marketed for clinical use.

Design, manufacture and use within a single CLIA-certified laboratory that meets the requirements under CLIA for high-complexity testing.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tests for transplantation used in histocompatibility laboratories that meet the regulatory requirements under CLIA to perform high-complexity histocompatibility testing, when used in connection with organ, stem cell and tissue transplantation to perform HLA allele typing, for HLA antibody screening and monitoring, or for conducting real and virtual HLA crossmatch testing.

Forensic tests (i.e., tests intended solely for law enforcement purposes).

Public health surveillance tests, which are intended solely for use on systematically collected samples for analysis and interpretation of health data in connection with disease prevention and control, and test results are not reported to patients or their healthcare providers.

FDA seeks comments on certain issues FDA highlighted certain topics on which it would like to receive comments, including: Whether specific enforcement-discretion policies would be appropriate for IVDs offered as LDTs for other public health scenarios (i.e., beyond immediate response to emerging outbreaks).

Whether IVDs offered as LDTs by academic medical centers (AMCs) should be treated differently."
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"Whether IVDs offered as LDTs by academic medical centers (AMCs) should be treated differently.

Whether a longer phase-out period should be applied to IVDs offered as LDTs by small laboratories (i.e., those with annual receipts below a certain threshold, such as $150,000).

What, if any, unintended consequences may result from the proposed phase-out policy to certain patient populations (e.g., Medicare beneficiaries and rural populations).

Whether currently marketed IVDs offered as LDTs should be exempted in some fashion, if no modifications to the LDTs are made.

To what extent FDA should leverage outside programs  such as the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program or those within the Veterans Health Administration.

FDAs clarification of certain issues at the October 31 webinar At the October 31, 2023, webinar, FDA made the following key clarifications based on questions submitted in advance.

Interplay between FDCA and CLIA.

FDA regulates devices, including IVDs, under the FDCA, whereas the CLIA program falls under the Public Health Service Act.

The FDAs device program focuses on the devices themselves, including IVDs, whereas the CLIA program focuses on laboratory operations.

The two frameworks are different in focus, scope and purpose, but are intended to be complementary.

FDA proposes to leverage CLIA where appropriate.

Specifically, FDA proposes to enforce a subset of QS requirements, rather than all, for laboratories, when all manufacturing activities within a single CLIA-certified laboratory meet the regulatory requirements to perform high-complexity testing and where the IVD is not distributed outside of that laboratory.

The proposed rulemaking would not change requirements for laboratory certification under CLIA.

Premarket review pathways for LDTs.

FDA estimates that only about 5% of LDTs would undergo review through the PMA pathway and expects that most LDTs subject to premarket review requirements would be eligible for either the 510(k) pathway or De Novo pathway.

Also, FDA has a breakthrough devices program, which is a voluntary program for certain devices meeting the criteria of breakthrough designation.

This program is intended to speed up development of certain devices and would be available to LDTs that now must go through premarket review.

Deadline for submitting comments.

FDA is firm on the December 4, 2023, deadline and will not extend it.

Applicability of proposed rule to screening tests.

The proposed rule applies to screening tests (e.g., cholesterol and diabetes screening tests), as FDA does not propose to exclude screening tests from the phase-out policy.

Bioinformatics and other software.

Bioinformatics and other software that meet the definition of device under section 201(h) of the FDCA must comply with applicable device requirements.

Examples of 1976-type LDTs.

These LDTs include various stains for cytology, hematology, and bacterial infections, cystic fibrosis sweat tests, certain colorimetric newborn screening tests, and certain tests that are based on immunohistochemistry or karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

Applicability of investigational device exemption (IDE) requirements.

LDTs used in clinical investigations are subject to the IDE requirements.

23

These include LDTs used for making treatment decisions about drugs or other medical products (e.g., LDTs used to evaluate pharmacodynamics or monitor for safety biomarkers).

However, in recognition that there has been some confusion about FDAs enforcement approach in this area, FDA will include compliance with IDE requirements in stage 4 of the proposed phase-out policy.

Manufacturer and laboratory.

The term manufacturer includes any entity that engages in various activities that constitute manufacturing as described in FDA regulations, 24 such as design, preparation, propagation, assembly and processing."
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"FDA intends to phase out its general enforcement-discretion approach for LDTs, so that IVDs manufactured by a laboratory would generally fall under the same enforcement approach as IVDs manufactured by non-laboratories.

FDA recognizes that there is not a definition of laboratory in the FDCA, FDA regulations or the proposed rule.

Meaning of IVDs offered as LDTs.

FDA has generally considered the term laboratory-developed test to mean an IVD that is intended for clinical use, and that is designed, manufactured and used within a single CLIA-certified laboratory that meets the regulatory requirements under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing.

FDA recognizes, however, that not all laboratories have understood that definition and the limited nature of FDAs general enforcement-discretion approach, and some have been offering IVDs based on that approach even when they do not fit what the FDA generally considers to be an LDT.

Thus, FDA proposes to apply the phase-out policy to IVDs that are manufactured and offered as LDTs by laboratories that are certified under CLIA and meet the regulatory requirements under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing  even if those IVDs do not fall within FDAs traditional understanding of an LDT (e.g., they are not designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory).

Thus, throughout the proposed rule, these IVDs are referred to as IVDs offered as LDTs.

Research use only (RUO) components and kits.

RUO components and kits can be incorporated into an IVD where the manufacturer ensures that the test complies with applicable requirements.

Since the proposed phase-out policy would apply to all IVDs offered as LDTs  except as noted in the proposed rule, IVDs with components or kits that were previously labeled as RUO would be treated the same as tests manufactured by conventional manufacturers where the manufacturer is responsible for overall compliance , including incorporating into their quality system any components previously labeled as RUO.

Modifications of LDTs.

FDA does not propose to change the legal requirements that apply to modifications of FDA-authorized IVDs.

If a laboratory modifies an FDA-authorized IVD in a way that is considered manufacturing an IVD, then the laboratory and IVD must comply with applicable requirements in the FDCA and implementing regulations.

Under FDA regulations, a manufacturer includes a remanufacturer  which does any act to a finished device that significantly changes the devices performance, safety specifications or intended use.

25

A laboratory is a device remanufacturer if it modifies an existing IVD that it did not develop itself in a way that significantly changes the devices performance, safety specifications or intended use, and the modified IVD is expected to comply with applicable device requirements, as outlined in the phase-out policy, if finalized.

Timing of different phase-out stages.

The general enforcement-discretion approach for LDTs would be phased out over four years after FDA publishes a final phase-out policy.

Thus, the timing for each stage is based on the date FDA publishes the final phase-out policy and is not based on when the previous stage ends.

Laboratory inspection.

Laboratories that manufacture IVDs are subject to inspection under the FDAs inspection authority (codified in the FDCA, 21 USC  374).

Treatment of modular PMA.

Under FDAs proposed phase-out policy, FDA generally would not intend to enforce against IVDs offered as LDTs after a PMA has been submitted, within the three-and-a-half-year time frame, which includes all modular PMA submissions if a manufacturer is pursuing the modular PMA approach.

Enforcement discretion exercised after LDTs are submitted for premarket review."
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"Enforcement discretion exercised after LDTs are submitted for premarket review.

Under FDAs proposed policy, FDA generally would not intend to enforce premarket review requirements against IVDs offered as LDTs after a PMA, 510(k) or De Novo request has been submitted within the appropriate time frame until FDA completes its review.

Fees associated with premarket review.

There are user fees associated with stage 2 (registration and listing) and stages 4 and 5 (premarket review).

The current user fee program includes considerations for small business.

Applicability of the least burdensome approach.

FDA considers the least burdensome approach when evaluating premarket submissions consistent with applicable requirements.

Provided that available literature is adequate to demonstrate the test is clinically valid, FDA would not expect laboratories to generate additional clinical validity data.

FDAs current practice in review of IVDs is to leverage information from the literature when its available and applicable.

Further, FDA also has established a recognition program for databases of human genetic variants that provides a mechanism for test manufacturers to leverage information in FDA-recognized databases to support clinical validity of their tests (see the road ahead section below for further discussion of this program).

Predetermined change control plan (PCCP).

A PCCP is a means to manage certain device modifications, where regulatory authorization before marketing is typically required, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence/machine learning-enabled medical devices.

FDA is open to the use of PCCPs for LDTs.

Design controls.

IVDs and LDTs are subject to applicable device requirements, so QS requirements, including design controls, apply, but commenters also can comment on how design controls should be enforced for marketed LDTs.

This is an area where more guidance from FDA may be helpful for labs, so FDA will make more resources available in this area.

Labeling requirements.

Many LDTs do not have package inserts like those in IVD kits, but the LDTs still must meet labeling requirements for IVDs under 21 CFR  809.10, including specific information that must be included.

Laboratories may comment on how they meet these requirements  including how the information might be encompassed in more than one document, such as the test protocol, test report templates or a test menu.

FDA intends to issue more guidance on this topic over the course of the phase-out period.

Engagement and interactions with stakeholders.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA learned new ways to engage and interact with stakeholders, such as through townhalls and FAQs.

FDA plans to build on this approach going forward and also will provide additional guidance documents to clarify its policy  such as guidance on appropriate validation, particularly with respect to clinical validity.

The road ahead 1.

FDA is determined to phase out its long-standing enforcement-discretion approach for LDTs.

FDA has expressed significant concerns about IVDs offered as LDTs.

Informed by its recent experience reviewing LDT validation and performance information during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA treats this issue with renewed urgency and is moving forward on its own after recent legislative failures.

For that reason, FDA seeks to finalize the proposed rule expeditiously, declining to extend the December 4, 2023, deadline for comments.

Although it remains to be seen whether Congress will respond to FDAs proposed rule, FDAs action may put pressure on Congress to act.

Given FDAs significant concerns in this area in recent years, the issues will not go away any time soon.

2. FDAs efforts to finalize and implement any proposed phase-out policy will likely face obstacles.

Despite FDAs determination, the road to implementation seems rocky."
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"2. FDAs efforts to finalize and implement any proposed phase-out policy will likely face obstacles.

Despite FDAs determination, the road to implementation seems rocky.

First, it is no secret that FDA has faced industry opposition in its efforts to phase out the enforcement-discretion policy for LDTs.

Thus, a potential legal challenge from industry remains probable.

Any legal challenge would present obstacles to FDAs action in terms of timing and implementation of the new rule.

Second, even if the proposed rule and phase-out policy were to become final without being challenged, it is unclear whether the time frame proposed would provide sufficient time for industry to transition.

In the draft 2014 LDT guidance documents, FDA proposed a phase-out time frame about twice as long as the current proposal.

As a practical matter, many issues will still need to be worked out  including after FDA receives public comments, which will need to be digested and considered.

Third, in response to FDAs proposed rule, Congress may decide to intervene, which would affect FDAs timing and policy trajectory.

Fourth, any proposed policy would need support from the presidential administration after the 2024 elections.

Without such support, it would be difficult to make LDTs a top priority for implementation, from both policy and resource perspectives.

Finally, FDA will need resources to implement the proposed phase-out policy successfully.

It is unclear what level of user fee resources and associated fee structure will be available for LDTs.

Moreover, although FDA also is looking at ways to reduce its resource needs  such as by working to enhance its third-party review program  it is unclear what the structure of that program will look like and how it will work in practice.

3.

The risk-based approach will continue to drive how FDA regulates LDTs, regardless of whether the proposed rule and phase-out policy become final.

Not all LDTs are similarly situated.

Based on the proposed rule and FDAs actions in recent years, some types of LDTs will garner more attention from FDA than others.

Generally, the higher the risks that LDTs pose to public health based on their intended uses, the more attention they will receive.

For example, FDA recently raised concerns about certain pharmacogenetic tests that reference drugs.

LDT developers have increasingly offered tests that reference drugs and provide information and specific treatment recommendations concerning the drugs.

In FDAs view, some of these tests make claims that may be outside of, or inconsistent with, FDA-approved drug labeling.

Thus, FDA warned against the use of certain pharmacogenetic tests in 2018 26 and  despite its long-standing enforcement-discretion approach for LDTs  took regulatory actions against certain LDTs based on its belief that the LDTs were being offered with claims stating or suggesting that they may be used to manage therapeutic treatment of patients in a manner not consistent with the approved drugs labeling and not supported by sufficient clinical evidence.

27 FDA also has stated that certain LDTs will not get the benefit of any gradual phasing out based on the inherent risks they pose, including: Direct-to-consumer tests.

Blood donor screening tests or HCT/P donor screening tests under 21 CFR  610.40,  640.5 and  1271.80(c).

Tests intended for actual or potential emergencies or material threats declared under section 564 of the FDCA.

In addition, FDA has stated that IVD manufacturing activities occurring outside of a CLIA-certified laboratory are not the types of activities for which FDAs enforcement-discretion approach would apply.

By contrast, as discussed above, FDA has stated that it will continue to apply the enforcement-discretion approach for certain tests, because of the relatively low risk that they pose to public health or because they have additional safeguards."
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"These tests include 1976-type LDTs, certain HLA tests, forensic tests and public health surveillance tests.

FDA also will likely use the risk-based approach to evaluate whether LDTs made by certain groups, such as AMCs and small laboratories, should be treated differently based on the characteristics of those tests, including how they are made and used, along with their risk profiles.

4.

Even under its new proposed approach, FDA acknowledges that CLIA-certified LDTs require special consideration.

FDA understands the practical interplay between the FDCA and CLIA regulatory schemes.

Although FDA has explained that the two frameworks are different in focus, scope and purpose, it has recognized the complementary nature of the frameworks and has thus proposed a policy that leverages CLIA where appropriate.

Specifically, FDA has proposed to enforce a subset of QS requirements, rather than all, for laboratories, when all manufacturing activities within a single CLIA-certified laboratory meet the regulatory requirements to perform high-complexity testing and where the IVD is not distributed outside of that laboratory.

Moreover, FDA understands that it needs to address CLIA-certified laboratories differently as it winds down its enforcement-discretion approach to regulation across the industry.

Perhaps recognizing that its general enforcement-discretion approach has led to confusion across the industry, FDA is proposing to apply the phase-out policy to IVDs that are offered as LDTs by laboratories that are certified under CLIA and meet the regulatory requirements under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing, even if those IVDs are not designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory (i.e., they do not fall within FDAs traditional understanding of an LDT).

5.

FDA acknowledges that existing data sources can provide a viable option for test manufacturers to demonstrate clinical validity.

During the October 31 webinar, FDA reiterated its current practice to allow IVD sponsors to leverage information from the literature when it is available and applicable.

Specifically, FDA stated that it would not expect laboratories to generate additional clinical validity data if available literature is adequate to demonstrate the test is clinically valid.

Moreover, FDA has created a mechanism for test manufacturers to leverage information on human genetic variants in certain databases to support clinical validity of their tests through FDAs recognition of such databases.

28

After a database containing information about genetic variants is established, researchers submit data to the database, which collects, organizes and publicly documents the evidence supporting the links between a human genetic variant and a disease or condition.

For example, FDA recognized two databases in 2018 and 2021, respectively  Clinical Genome (ClinGen) Resource Consortiums ClinGen Expert Curated Human Genetic Data and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centers Oncology Knowledge Base.

29

The scientific information in such databases, including informed assessments of the correlation (or lack of correlation) between a disease or condition and a genetic variant based on the current state of knowledge, can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with genetic conditions.

FDAs recognition of such databases means that developers of genetic tests can use the information in such databases to support the clinical validity of their tests without the need for additional FDA review to confirm the suitability of the databases.

30"
Cooley,Proposed Rule on Laboratory-Developed Tests Takes Center Stage,"30

Finally, FDA recently created a Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations to share information about certain pharmacogenetic associations that FDA has evaluated and believes there is sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that subgroups of patients with certain genetic variants  or genetic variant-inferred phenotypes  are likely to have altered drug metabolism, and in certain cases, differential therapeutic effects, including differences in risks of adverse events.

31 FDA recognized that [p]harmacogenetic tests, along with other information about patients and their disease or condition, can play an important role in drug therapy.

FDAs regulation defines in vitro diagnostic products as reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease and other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae, and intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body 21 CFR  809.3(a).

The proposed rule states that FDA has generally considered an LDT to be an IVD that is intended for clinical use and that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and meets the regulatory requirements under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing 88 FR at 68009.

In other words, in this stage, requirements that would begin to apply include: (1) establishment registration and device listing requirements (21 USC  360 and 21 CFR Part 807); (2) labeling requirements (21 USC  352 and 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809); and (3) investigational use requirements (21 USC  360j(g) and 21 CFR Part 812).

For LDTs designed, manufactured and used in the same laboratory that is CLIA-certified for high-complexity testing, the QS requirements are limited to design controls (21 CFR  820.30), purchasing controls (21 CFR  820.50), acceptance activities (21 CFR  820.80 and 820.86), corrective and preventive actions (21 CFR  820.100) and records requirements (21 CFR Part 820, Subpart M).

Cooley,"Decoding the UK Online Safety Act 2023: Latest Draft Guidance, Key Features and Insights","On 9 November 2023, the UK Office of Communications (Ofcom) issued its first set of draft guidance on the UKs long-anticipated Online Safety Act (OSA), which aims to protect online users against illegal and harmful content.

While the OSA officially became law in the UK on 26 October 2023, Ofcom  the UKs communications regulator  will now take a three-year phased approach to implementation and enforcement.

The latest draft guidance from Ofcom focuses on how certain online service providers must approach their duties regarding illegal content and is the first of four major consultations that Ofcom will conduct in the coming months.

At a high level, the OSA introduces a new UK regulatory regime to address online safety.

It imposes extensive new obligations on online service providers to identify, mitigate and manage the risks of harm to users from illegal and harmful content.

With a focus on the protection of children, the OSA builds on the age appropriate design code of the Information Commissioners Office and confers special obligations on service providers whose platforms are likely to be accessed by children.

More broadly, the OSA is one of several new global regulatory developments focused on addressing online safety.

The OSA is distinct from the European Unions Digital Services Act (see our February 2023 blog on the DSA ); however, it bears similarities, as it also adopts a risk-based approach to content regulation with large or higher-risk online platforms subject to more extensive obligations, as explained in more detail below.

Which services are subject to the OSA?

There are three types of online service providers which are intended to be subject to the OSA, provided each have links with the UK: User-to-user services (U2U services).

Search services.

Services that publish or display certain pornographic content.

The OSA, therefore, applies to qualifying service providers  wherever they are located.

Links with the UK Services are considered to have links with the UK if they have a significant number of UK users or if the UK forms one of its target markets.

The OSA does not specify the number of users that qualifies as significant, although Ofcom has advised organisations to be ready to explain their decisions, especially where they believe that their UK user base is not significant.

In addition, regulated U2U and search services are considered to have links with the UK if they are capable of being used in the UK, and there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a material risk of significant harm to UK individuals presented by content associated with the service.

This provision appears to be designed to capture high-risk services which might not otherwise be captured by the OSA  e.g., because the number of UK user numbers would not otherwise meet the significant user number or target market thresholds.

U2U and search services U2U and search services are likely to be subject to the OSA if they have links with the UK (see above) and are not exempt.

The OSA outlines certain services that are exempt  for instance, services will not be subject to the OSA if emails, SMS messages (texts) or one-to-one live aural communications are the only user-generated content enabled by the service.

Providers of pornographic content Service providers that publish or display pornographic content are likely to be regulated by the OSA if they have links with the UK (see above).

However, some types of services  such as internal business services and on-demand programme services  may be exempt under certain conditions.

How will the OSA impact in-scope services?

Categorisation For regulated U2U and search services, the OSA takes a tiered approach to regulation by dividing certain services into categories (categorised services).

Ofcom has stated that only a small proportion of services will be designated as categorised services."
Cooley,"Decoding the UK Online Safety Act 2023: Latest Draft Guidance, Key Features and Insights","Ofcom has stated that only a small proportion of services will be designated as categorised services.

Categorised services are subject to additional duties  see the Obligations (duties of care) section below.

Although the category thresholds have not yet been set, Ofcom has stated it will advise the government on the thresholds in early 2024.

Ofcom anticipates that the government will pass the necessary legislation by summer 2024, and  assuming such legislation is passed  Ofcom will: Publish the register of categorised services by the end of 2024 (and, in any event, as soon as reasonably practicable).

Publish draft proposals on the additional duties that categorised services will be subject to in early 2025.

In mid-2025, start issuing categorised services with an annual notice requiring them to produce a transparency report.

The service categories are defined as follows: Category 1.

Regulated U2U services that meet the Category 1 threshold conditions, which relate to the following factors: Number of users.

Service functionalities.

Any other characteristics of the service that the government may consider relevant.

The thresholds also will account for the likely impact of the number of users and the services functionalities on how easily, quickly and widely content may be disseminated.

Category 2A. Regulated search or combined services (i.e., a regulated U2U service that also includes a public search service) that meet the Category 2A threshold conditions, which relate to: Number of users.

Any other characteristics of the service that the government may consider relevant.

Category 2B.

Regulated U2U services that meet the Category 2B threshold conditions, which will be set by reference to the same factors as Category 1 services, i.e.: Number of users.

Service functionalities.

Any other characteristics of the service that the government may consider relevant.

The exact threshold conditions for each category will vary and will be defined in secondary legislation, expected to be enacted by summer 2024.

Providers of pornographic content will not be categorised, but nevertheless do have duties of care, as set out below.

Obligations (duties of care)

The OSA imposes obligations, or duties of care, which vary depending on both the type (i.e., U2U, search or pornographic) and category of service.

To illustrate, we summarise some of the key duties below.

Ofcom has stated its intention to produce guidance on each of these duties and the many others that are contained in the OSA over the next 18 months.

Duty Service type/category Summary Reference Protection from illegal content* Regulated U2U services Take proportionate measures (according to the size of the service and the assessment of risk associated with it) to prevent individuals from encountering priority illegal content meaning terrorism, child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA), or any offence listed in Schedule 7 of the OSA, such as threats to kill, harassment or stalking.

Part 3 Protection from illegal content* Regulated search services Take proportionate measures (according to the size of the service and the assessment of risk associated with it) to minimise the risk of individuals encountering priority illegal content or other illegal content that the provider knows about (having been alerted to it by another person or becoming aware of it in any other way).

Part 3 Protection of children Regulated U2U services likely to be accessed by children Take proportionate measures to: Prevent (including through age verification or age estimation) children of any age from encountering primary priority content that is harmful to children (e.g., pornographic content or content which encourages suicide).

Protect children in age groups judged to be at risk of harm from encountering other content that is harmful to children (e.g., abusive content and content which incites hatred, bullying and/or unsafe challenges/stunts)."
Cooley,"Decoding the UK Online Safety Act 2023: Latest Draft Guidance, Key Features and Insights","Part 3 Protection of children Regulated search services likely to be accessed by children Take proportionate measures (including age verification or age estimation) to: Minimise the risk of children of any age from encountering primary priority content that is harmful to children.

Minimise the risk of children judged to be at risk of harm from encountering harmful content.

Part 3 Empowerment of adults Category 1 services To the extent it is proportionate, provide adult users with controls for specified types of content  including content which encourages, promotes or provides instructions for harmful acts, e.g., suicide, self-injury or eating disorders.

Controls must be easy to access and available to all adult users.

Controls also must include the ability to filter out nonverified users (i.e., individual users who have not verified their identity to the service provider).

Part 3 Fraudulent advertising Category 1 and Category 2A services Use proportionate systems and processes to prevent users of all ages from encountering fraudulent ads, minimise the length of time such ads are available to users and swiftly react to user alerts about them.

Part 3 User identity verification Category 1 services Offer all adult users the option to verify their identity.

Services may use any kind of verification process, and it need not require documentation to be provided.

The primary use of this identification is for purposes of adult user empowerment (see above).

Part 4 Pornographic content U2U and search services that publish certain pornographic content Use age verification or age estimation (or both) to ensure that children are not able to encounter regulated pornographic content on the service.

The age verification or age estimation must be highly effective at determining whether the user is a child.

Part 5 *Ofcom produced detailed draft guidance on illegal content as part of its first major consultation.

What are the key practical implications of the OSA?

Risk identification One of Ofcoms priorities is for services to understand and prioritise the risk of harm and build the structures necessary to embed user safety.

To achieve this, services will need to conduct risk assessments and put in place proportionate, risk-based systems and processes to improve user safety.

Ofcom has published draft guidance on how to conduct illegal content risk assessments, and the duty will come into force for most regulated services once Ofcom finalises this guidance (expected in autumn 2024).

Risk mitigation Service providers will need to ensure that their services are structured to mitigate the risk of harm to users  including by designing features, functionalities and algorithms appropriately, starting with the areas of greatest risk (e.g., by taking proportionate measures to protect children).

The OSA requires services to use all relevant information that is reasonably available to identify illegal content, which will be interpreted according to the size and capacity of the service, and whether the service used human moderators or automated systems (or both).

Ofcoms draft guidance on illegal harms notes that whatever measures are proposed must be proportionate and technically feasible.

However, the risk of erroneous takedown of legitimate content and potential implications for users privacy (e.g., which could arise from scanning users content to identify illegal material) have the potential to make this a challenging area for services.

How will the OSA be enforced?

Ofcom is responsible for enforcing the regime and is in the process of publishing guidance and codes of practice intended to help regulated companies comply with their duties under the OSA.


The OSA provides Ofcom with several enforcement mechanisms against companies, including (but not limited to): Fines, which may be up to 18 million or 10% of worldwide revenue (whichever is higher).

Service restriction orders."
Cooley,"Decoding the UK Online Safety Act 2023: Latest Draft Guidance, Key Features and Insights","Service restriction orders.

Ofcom may apply to the court for a service restriction order requiring ancillary services (e.g., payments providers) to withdraw their services.

Powers of entry, inspection and audit.

Ofcom will have powers of entry and inspection, including without a warrant in certain circumstances (but with seven days notice).

Notices to deal with terrorism or CSEA content (or both).

Ofcom may require services to use accredited technology to identify and swiftly take down CSEA content and/or identify and swiftly secure terrorism content.

Ofcom also may require services to use their best endeavours to develop or source technology to satisfy such a notice.

Ofcom also may require services to name a senior manager who may reasonably be expected to be capable of ensuring compliance with the requirements of a notice.

Under certain circumstances, senior managers could face criminal prosecution if, under the OSA, they fail to comply with an Ofcom information notice.

Corporate officers (e.g., directors, managers, associates or secretaries) also may be criminally liable if a false or threatening communication offence is attributable to their neglect.

Conclusion The OSA is broad in scope.

Ofcom projects that it will encompass more than 100,000 online service providers.

Similar to the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and as noted above, the OSA has extraterritorial reach, so it will likely regulate thousands of organisations located outside of  but with links to  the UK.

Services are strongly advised to start building effective compliance plans now.

Initial steps to think about include: Participating in upcoming consultations on draft guidance and codes of practice with Ofcom.

Considering how to address harmful and illegal content and apply age verification/age estimation (or both).

Ensuring that internal processes and teams are in place to communicate with Ofcom, including in respect of any information requests, audits, inspections or interviews.

Assessing whether there may be a need to use automated content moderation or content scanning tools, and how to resolve any associated privacy risks that may exist relating to such tools.

If applicable, ensuring that current adult content control tools meet the requirements of the OSA.

Cooley,California DFPI Invites Comments on Potential Rulemaking to Implement Digital Financial Assets Lawssets Law,"On November 20, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) issued an invitation for comments on a potential rulemaking relating to two new California laws that will impose sweeping obligations on companies engaged in virtual currency activities in California and with California residents.

The first law, Assembly Bill 39, prohibits people from engaging in digital financial asset business activity  or holding themselves out as being able to engage in digital financial asset business activity  without meeting certain criteria and obtaining a license from the DFPI.

The second, Senate Bill 401, imposes requirements on operators of digital financial asset transaction kiosks.

The DFPI refers to the two bills collectively as the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL).

The DFAL begins taking effect on January 1, 2024, with covered persons required to be licensed, or to have submitted a license application and be awaiting approval or denial of that application, on or before July 1, 2025.

As a result, the DFPI is considering promulgating rules for the DFAL licensing process and seeks public comments on four substantive areas of the law: License application form and related fees.

Surety bonds and trust accounts.

Capital.

Stablecoin approval process.

The DFPI also invites comments on other DFAL-related topics and on what future rulemaking actions related to the administration of the DFAL it should consider, though the invitation notes that the DFPI anticipates separately inviting comments on other topics in the future.

Comments must be submitted to the DFPI by January 12, 2024.

The DFPI will host a virtual informal listening session on January 8, 2024, for interested parties to discuss feedback live with DFPI staff.

For more information on comment submission guidelines and registration for the virtual session, visit the DFPIs website .

Below, weve summarized the substantive topics on which the DFPI is seeking comments.

Interested parties should review the invitation for comments and consider weighing in on matters of concern at this early stage, when the DFPI is still gathering information and soliciting broad industry feedback.

License application form and related fees The DFPI requests feedback on any other information it should require by rule as part of the application process, beyond what the new statute expressly requires applicants to submit.

The DFPI also is inviting comments on how it should approach the statutory provisions that authorize fees to cover the reasonable costs of application review and require the applicant to pay the reasonable costs of the DFPIs investigation of whether the applicant meets statutory criteria for the issuance of a license.

For example, the DFPI asks whether it should charge variable application fees based on the type and complexity of the application that is submitted, as well as how it should approach determining reasonable costs and fees.

Surety bonds and trust accounts The DFPI also invites comments on what factors it should consider in determining the surety bond or trust account amounts it may require under Financial Code Section 3207, whether the surety bond or trust accounts should vary based on the type of activity being licensed, and whether a minimum amount should be required.

In addition, the DFPI seeks comments on how specific activity requirements under the DFAL, such as custody and reserve requirements, should impact the required surety bond or trust account amounts.

Capital The DFAL requires a licensee to maintain a minimum capital amount to be determined by the DFPI to ensure the financial integrity of the licensee and its ongoing operations.

The DFAL includes nine factors for the DFPI to consider in setting the required capital amount, based on an assessment of the specific risks applicable to the licensee."
Cooley,California DFPI Invites Comments on Potential Rulemaking to Implement Digital Financial Assets Lawssets Law,"The DFAL includes nine factors for the DFPI to consider in setting the required capital amount, based on an assessment of the specific risks applicable to the licensee.

The DFPI invites comments on whether the enumerated factors in the law (e.g., actual and expected volume, amount of leverage employed by the licensee, the liquidity position of the licensee) are sufficient or if other factors should be considered.

The DFPI also seeks comments on whether the minimum capital requirements should vary by the type of activity in which the applicant or licensee is engaging.

Stablecoin issues The DFAL contains provisions specific to the regulation of stablecoins, including requirements that any stablecoin traded, custodied, or otherwise used in a regulated activity under the DFAL be issued by a person licensed and approved under the DFAL to issue a stablecoin (subject to narrow exemptions).

The DFPI also invites comments on a number of issues relating to the regulation of stablecoins under the DFAL, including: Whether the evaluation of the quality of assets that are proposed to be held against stablecoins should consider factors other than whether such assets are eligible securities under the existing money transmission law.

Any particular risks regarding how such assets are owned or held by the issuer that the DFPI should consider.

Other factors the DFPI should consider in determining whether to approve a stablecoin, such as the amount and type or quality of the issuers other liabilities  and whether the stablecoin is listed on the Greenlist maintained by the New York State Department of Financial Services."
Cooley,New York Employers Facing New Employment Laws,"New York recently enacted several new employment laws impacting employers in the Empire State.

In this alert, weve highlighted what employers need to know about these laws.

Inventions assignment limitations Under A05295 , which took effect on September 15, 2023, employers cannot require an employee to assign certain inventions that are made on the employees own time and do not use an employers equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information, unless such inventions either: At the time of conception or reduction to practice, relate to the employers business, actual research or development, or anticipated research or development.

Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

To the extent any agreement purports to require such an assignment, it will be deemed unenforceable.

Notably, this law does not create a private right of action.

In addition, while A05295 is similar to protections in other states (such as Californias Labor Code Section 2870), it does not affirmatively require employers to provide employees with a specific notice regarding such unassignable inventions.

Limitations on nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements Signed into law on November 17, 2023, S4516 makes significant changes to employers ability to include nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements that resolve claims of discrimination or harassment.

The law prohibits such settlement agreements from: Requiring a complainant to pay an employer liquidated damages in the event they violate a nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision.

Requiring a complainant to forfeit all or part of the consideration received as part of the settlement for violating a nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision.

Containing an affirmative statement that a complainant was not subject to discrimination or retaliation.

S4516 also modified existing requirements prohibiting settlement agreements from including a nondisclosure provision unless confidentiality is the complainants preference.

Under the amendments, this requirement now applies to independent contractors who settle discrimination claims, not just employees and potential employees.

In addition, while complainants were previously required to wait 21 days after receiving an agreement memorializing their preference to maintain confidentiality before executing the agreement, S4516 permits them to sign within the 21-day window.

The seven-day period during which an employee may revoke their acceptance remains unchanged.

The law applies to agreements entered on or after November 17, 2023.

Prohibition on requiring social media account information Effective March 12, 2024, S2518A prohibits employers from requesting or requiring that employees or applicants for employment: Disclose any username and password to a personal social media account.

Access their personal social media account in the employers presence.

Reproduce photos, videos or other information contained in a personal social media account obtained by prohibited means.

An applicable account under this law is defined as any account or profile on an electronic medium where users may create, share, and view user-generated content that is used exclusively for personal purposes.

This prohibition on access information does not apply to: Accounts provided by the employer that are used for business purposes.

Accounts known to the employer to be used for business purposes.

Access to an electronic communications device paid for by the employer where the provision of or payment for such electronic communications device was conditioned on the employers right to access such device and the employee was provided prior notice of and explicitly agreed to such conditions.

Access pursuant to a court order."
Cooley,New York Employers Facing New Employment Laws,"Access pursuant to a court order.

The law does not prohibit employers from accessing information about an employee or applicant that is available in the public domain or accessing information voluntarily shared by an employee in the course of investigating misconduct.

Updates to New York Citys Earned Safe and Sick Time Act (ESSTA) NYCs Department of Consumer and Worker Protection recently adopted final rules to the ESSTA , which took effect October 15, 2023.

Weve outlined significant changes below.

Employer size The rules clarify that an employers size, for purposes of determining the amount of safe/sick time required to be provided, is based on the employers total number of employees nationwide  not just those working in New York state or NYC.

Employer size is determined by counting the highest total number of employees concurrently employed at any point during the calendar year to date, and must include full-time and part-time employees, employees jointly employed by one or more employers, and employees on leaves of absence, suspension or other temporary absences.

The rules also provide for different threshold levels of safe/sick leave coverage when an employers applicable workforce increases or decreases.

For example, when the applicable headcount increases from less than five to between five and 99 employees, employers must provide 40 hours of safe/sick time prospectively from the date of the increase in the number of employees.

When an employers headcount decreases, however, the rules explain that the entitlements to safe/sick time cannot be reduced until the following calendar year.

Covered employees The rules clarify that employees are covered under the ESSTA if they either: Perform work (including by telecommuting) while physically located in NYC, regardless of where the employer is located.

Have a primary work location outside NYC but regularly perform or are expected to regularly perform work in NYC during a calendar year.

However, only hours worked in the city count as hours worked for purposes of safe/sick time usage and accrual.

Employees are not covered if they only perform work (including by telecommuting) while physically located outside NYC, even if the employer is located in NYC.

Notably, the rules also eliminated references to the 120-day waiting period for employees to use safe/sick time.

Documentation When an employees use of safe/sick time results in an absence of more than three consecutive workdays, employers may require reasonable written documentation that the use of safe/sick time was authorized under the ESSTA.

The rules explain that employers requiring such documentation must include in their policy information the types of reasonable written documentation the employer will accept and instructions on how employees can submit the documentation.

Further, employers cannot require employees to submit documentation before returning to work.

Employers also must reimburse employees for fees or costs incurred to obtain any requested documentation.

Foreseeability and notice Under the ESSTA, an employer may require notice of the need to use safe/sick time where the need is not foreseeable.

The rules clarify that an absence is foreseeable when an employee is aware of the need to use the time seven days or more before the use; otherwise, the need is considered unforeseeable.

Employers who require such advance notice must include in their written policies reasonable procedures for employees to provide the notice.

The rules contain examples of ways to provide reasonable methods of advance notice.

For example, employees can send an email to a designated email address or submit a leave request in a scheduling software system, provided the employees have access to the system on nonwork time  and have been trained on and given written instructions on how to use it."
Cooley,New York Employers Facing New Employment Laws,"Pay statements information Employees pay statements must include the amount of safe/sick time they have accrued and used during a relevant pay period, as well as the total balance available for use.

Employers using an electronic system to issue pay statements or other documentation related to safe/sick time may comply with this requirement by: Alerting employees electronically each pay period on the availability of the required information.

Making the required content readily accessible by employees outside the workplace within the electronic system.

Maintaining accrual, use and balance information for any past pay period in the electronic system.

Written policy In addition to the required documentation information described above, employers policies addressing safe/sick time also must contain a statement that they will not ask employees to provide details about the medical condition or personal situation that led them to use safe/sick time, and that information the employer receives about any employees use of safe/sick time will be kept confidential, and it will not be disclosed to anyone without the employees written permission or as required by law.

Reasonable inference of violation There is now a reasonable inference that an employer committed a violation of the safe/sick time laws if the employer fails to maintain or distribute a written safe/sick time policy and fails to maintain adequate records of employees accrued safe/sick time use and balances.

Unemployment insurance eligibility notice Effective November 13, 2023, S04878 expands the circumstances under which employers are required to provide a written notice of the right to file for unemployment benefits to any employee.

Under this update, such notice must be provided at the time of permanent or indefinite separation from employment, reduction in hours, temporary separation, and any other interruption of continued employment that results in total or partial unemployment.

Employers should use the updated form on the DOLs website .

Discipline prohibited for refusing to attend captive audience meetings Similar to several other states that have recently enacted legislation regarding captive audience meetings, effective September 6, 2023, S4982 prohibits disciplining employees for their refusal to attend employer-sponsored meetings, listen to speeches, or watch presentations if the primary purpose of which is to communicate the employers opinion concerning religious or political matters.

Political matters includes matters relating to elections for political office, as well as decisions to join or support any political party or civic or community organization.

Religious matters includes matters relating to religious affiliation and practice, including the decision to join or support any religious organization or association.

The prohibition does not apply to casual conversations between an employer or an employers agent or representative and employees, as long as participation in such conversations is not required.

The law also requires employers to post a notice in their workplace informing employees of their rights under the law.

Failure to pay wages constitutes criminal larceny Effective September 6, 2023, S2832A treats any failure to pay wages (including any promised wage beyond minimum wage or overtime) as a form of criminal larceny, by amending the definition of property to include compensation for labor or services.

The law also permits aggregation of all nonpayments or underpayments into one larceny count, even if the violations occurred in multiple counties, making it easier for employers to be prosecuted for wage theft.

This law follows p ledges earlier this year by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. to more aggressively pursue wage theft and other forms of worker harassment and exploitation, as well as the creation of a Worker Protection Unit to pursue criminal charges against individuals and corporations in violation of wage laws."
Cooley,New York Employers Facing New Employment Laws,"Employers with limited capital, such as startups, should be mindful of creating written records that reflect an intention to not pay employees at least the minimum wage.

Proposed exempt salary thresholds As we reported on June 7, 2023 , the New York State Department of Labor (DOL) increased the states minimum wage effective January 1, 2024.

Keeping in line with a historical exempt employee salary basis threshold of roughly 75 times the minimum wage, the DOL recently proposed regulations updating the exempt employee salary basis thresholds to the following levels beginning January 1, 2024.

Effective date of exempt salary threshold increase NYC, Long Island and Westchester Rest of New York State Current $1,125 weekly ($58,500 annually) $1,064.25 weekly ($55,341 annually)

January 1, 2024 $1,200.00 weekly ($62,400 annually) $1,124.20 weekly ($58,458.40 annually)

January 1, 2025 $1,237.50 weekly ($64,350 annually) $1,161.65 weekly ($60,405.80 annually)

January 1, 2026 $1,275.00 weekly ($66,300 annually) $1,199.10 weekly ($62,353.20 annually)

Next steps New York employers should revise their form separation and settlement agreements in accordance with the new limitations on nondisclosure provisions and the modified review period.

They also should ensure that their employment policies and agreements  including those relating to intellectual property, safe/sick time leave, and social media use  are updated for compliance with these laws, and review their pay practices and prepare to adjust their budgets in line with the proposed increase in exempt employee salary basis thresholds.

In addition, employers should verify that they are keeping accurate pay records and statements, including ensuring employees are paid for all time worked, in light of the new criminal penalties for wage theft.

Finally, employers should keep an eye out for more developments to come from the state before the end of 2023, including with respect to S3100A  the states proposed noncompete ban  and additional legislation pending before Gov. Kathy Hochul.

Cooley,FCC Explores Impact of AI on Robocalls and Robotexts,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a notice of inquiry (NOI) seeking comment on the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on robocalls and robotexts.

The inquiry aligns with other AI initiatives of the FCC and agencies across the federal government.

FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has made the reduction of robocalls and robotexts a priority for the commission throughout her tenure as chair.

This NOI is the latest step in the agencys efforts to identify tools to mitigate robocalls and identify sources of fraud in telecommunications networks.

The information collected by the FCC in this proceeding will inform future policy changes.

Accordingly, potentially affected parties can shape the FCCs dialogue on AI going forward by engaging with the FCC as part of this proceeding.

In the notice, the FCC explores how new AI developments can and will affect the FCCs current regulation of automated text and voice messages under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).

The FCC solicits public feedback on the benefits and risks associated with emerging AI technologies  including voice cloning  and contemplates including machine learning in the definition of artificial intelligence.

The FCC asks wide-ranging questions in the notice, and parties that participate in the proceeding also can raise their own issues on the topic of using AI for automated calling and texting.

Among the many issues raised in the notice, the FCC asks: Whether it should define artificial intelligence within the proceeding  and, if so, how can artificial intelligence be defined in a way that meets the FCCs responsibilities under the TCPA?

Whether AI technologies can be used to protect consumers from robocalls and robotexts, help the FCC enforce the TCPA, and/or promote accessibility for individuals with disabilities?

How AI technologies might be used to harm consumers by facilitating illegal, fraudulent, or otherwise unwanted robocalls and robotexts?

Whether the FCC should consider ways to verify the authenticity of legitimately generated AI voice or text content from trusted sources, such as through the use of watermarks, certificates, labels, signatures or other forms of labels?

Future steps the FCC should take to address AI technologies and further the inquiry on AI technologies.

Cooley,"Following Recent Policy Statement, FTC ‘Disputes’ 100+ Patent Listings in FDA Orange Book","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent letters on November 7, 2023, accusing 10 companies of improperly listing drug delivery device patents in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Orange Book, stating that the FTC has taken steps to dispute these listings.

The FTCs statements suggest the potential for future antitrust enforcement actions against these companies, as well as for further disputes regarding a wide array of patent listings.

The FTCs letters follow the agencys September 2023 policy statement announcing that improper Orange Book listings may be challenged as unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, as we described in this October 18 alert .

The letters come as the FTC is increasingly taking a position on these issues in private litigation  including a November 2023 amicus brief arguing that improper Orange Book listings can constitute illegal monopolization and cause harm extending beyond the 30-month stay, because they can distort the competitive process.

We summarize the FTCs actions and offer key takeaways for innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers.

FTCs challenges are not antitrust enforcement actions The FTCs September 2023 policy statement outlined an aggressive view of the antitrust implications of Orange Book listings.

The FTC implied that it views improper Orange Book listings as essentially per se unlawful under Section 5 of the FTC Act, subject to condemnation regardless of the reasonableness of the decision to list or the competitive effect of the specific listing.

The threat of antitrust enforcement may deter Orange Book listings, but it conflicts with existing case law and antitrust principles, leaving the FTC vulnerable if it were to bring antitrust challenges based on the theories articulated in the policy statement.

Indeed, while the FTC characterizes its recent letters as challenging 100+ Orange Book patent listings, it notably did not bring any Section 5 enforcement actions or other antitrust challenges against these Orange Book patent listings, nor did it initiate a process to compel delisting of any patent.

Instead, the FTC sent letters to the FDA, pursuant to FDA regulations that permit anyone to question a patent listing.

The companies that have listed the patents in the Orange Book have 30 days to either remove the listings or recertify that the listings comply with statutory requirements.

Beyond initiating the dispute, the FTC will play no formal role in the process  and presumably neither will the FDA, which historically has played only a ministerial role in managing the Orange Book.

If the companies targeted by the FTC letters recertify the patent listings, the patents will remain listed.

Since 2021, there have been more than a dozen other listings questioned, as tracked by the FDA .

In more than half of those instances, no changes were made to the Orange Book.

Uncertainty regarding listing device patents The Hatch-Waxman Act and related FDA regulations require new drug application (NDA) holders to list certain patents related to the companys approved drug products in the FDAs Orange Book, formally the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.

The regulations require the listing of patents directed to the approved drug substance, the approved drug product and method-of-use patents covering the approved indication(s).

For nearly two decades, if not longer, drug companies have sought the FDAs guidance on the listing of drug-device patents in the Orange Book, as these devices are frequently integral to the delivery of the drug and are approved as drug-device combinations.

Over this period, the FDA has continued to list drug-device patents but has refused to provide written guidance regarding the listability of these patents.

The 2021 Orange Book Transparency Act required the FDA to solicit comments regarding the listing of device and other patents in the Orange Book."
Cooley,"Following Recent Policy Statement, FTC ‘Disputes’ 100+ Patent Listings in FDA Orange Book","The 2021 Orange Book Transparency Act required the FDA to solicit comments regarding the listing of device and other patents in the Orange Book.

In response, the FDA received numerous comments from industry and others regarding the listing of device patents.

In the face of these comments, the FDA has continued to list drug-device patents in the Orange Book but has yet to issue any written guidance directed at the listability of these patents.

The patent listings disputed in the recent FTC letters are directed to these types of drug-device patents.

The FTCs claim that these patents are clearly unlistable stands in contrast to the FDAs long-standing practice of listing these patents in the Orange Book, along with the FDAs refusal to provide any express guidance regarding the listing of drug-device patents, notwithstanding decades of industry requests for clarity.

FTCs view on device patents and the Orange Book

The FTC has made clear that, in its view, only patents that claim the active ingredient should be listed in the Orange Book, and that drug-device patents that do not claim the active ingredient should not be listed.

In a recent interview, the FTC deputy director who signed the drug delivery listing letters asserted that this is not particularly controversial, as the law is actually relatively clear with not a lot of ambiguity here in terms of what should and should not be listed.

The FTC further suggested that listing these types of patents violates antitrust law, and that the FTC retains the right to take further action, including by investigating and bringing cases.

If any of the targeted companies recertify their listings, the FTC may well attempt to use that as evidence the listing was maintained knowing the FTC believes it is improper.

Any future antitrust enforcement actions against these or other disputed patents, however, would require the FTC to develop substantially more evidence.

As an initial matter, while the FTC has now expressed the view that these types of drug-device patents should not be listed, the fact is that the FDA has remained silent regarding repeated requests from industry to provide clear guidance regarding the listability of drug-device patents and has continued to list these patents in the Orange Book.

Moreover, the FTC is not an expert arbiter in determining statutory patent listing criteria for a fellow federal agency.

Even if certain drug-device patents are ultimately determined not to be listable, that would not necessarily mean the listing violates antitrust law, as the FTC suggests, for a number of reasons: The case law  in particular, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuits 2020 decision in Lantus  provides that there should be no antitrust liability if a listing was made reasonably and in good faith.

This precedent is based on the recognition that the requirement to list patents is not voluntary, but is statutorily mandated, and in the absence of clear guidance, companies should not be held liable for a good faith attempt to comply with a statutory scheme.

Antitrust law is concerned with conduct that causes or threatens likely harm to competition.

The FTC has expressed concern that improper Orange Book listings may delay or deter generic entry, but that is not plausible for at least some of the disputed patents.

For example, where a disputed patent has not been used as the basis for obtaining a 30-month stay, or if there are additional patents listed in the Orange Book that are not disputed by the FTC, the listing of the disputed patent may not have any effect on competition at all.

This is especially the case considering that a patent holder can allege infringement regardless of whether a patent is Orange Book-listed.

The FTC normally investigates and marshals supporting evidence of an antitrust violation before going public with suggestions of wrongdoing."
Cooley,"Following Recent Policy Statement, FTC ‘Disputes’ 100+ Patent Listings in FDA Orange Book","The FTC normally investigates and marshals supporting evidence of an antitrust violation before going public with suggestions of wrongdoing.

Here, the FTC has gone public while stating it retains the right to take  further action [including] investigating the manufacturers conduct.

Key considerations going forward The FTC has long prioritized enforcement against conduct that delays or deters generic entry, and it is now clearly focused on Orange Book listings as a method to do so, arguing it is protecting Americans from illegal business tactics that are hiking the costs of drugs and drug products.

In an interview following the FTCs announcement, the FTC deputy director said that the FTC continue[s] to review other patent listings and that this action is not exhaustive.

It thus appears likely that the FTC will continue to identify patents it views as improperly listed, such as patents covering manufacturing processes, packaging, REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) and other drug distribution systems, as well as device patents, and will publicize its efforts to target these listings.

Pharmaceutical companies should, therefore, be extra cautious to ensure they have a good faith basis for thinking their Orange Book listings satisfy the listing criteria.

As our October alert detailed, significant antitrust exposure would come from intentionally listing a patent that does not meet the statutory criteria and filing an infringement action on such patent to delay or deter generic entry.

Such action is likely to attract antitrust counterclaims from the generic applicant  in addition to potential FTC scrutiny and class actions on behalf of purchasers  that may be difficult to defend.

FTC enforcement is much less likely to succeed in the absence of evidence that a particular listing was made in bad faith, and that the listing caused or is likely to cause generics to delay or forego entry.

Under these circumstances, private claims also are much less likely, since conduct that does not actually impact generic entry would not result in antitrust injury and damages.

In the current environment, however, that does not mean the FTC will not act.

Where there is ambiguity about an Orange Book listing, companies will need to balance the benefits of listing against the downsides.

Considerations in this analysis include the strength of the legal basis for listing and associated documentary record, the potential for a protracted FTC investigation, including litigation and adverse publicity, even if the company may ultimately prevail, and the fact that companies can, of course, still assert infringement  even if a patent is not listed.

Cooleys antitrust, patent and Hatch-Waxman teams are available to advise on these and other issues at the intersection of antitrust and pharmaceutical patent enforcement."
Cooley,European Commission Publishes Third Annual Report on EU Foreign Direct Investments,"On 19 October 2023, the European Commission (EC) published its Annual Report on the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union , covering the year 2022.

This is the third annual report published by the EC since the European Unions Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

Screening Regulation became fully operational in October 2020.

Below, we summarise our main takeaways and the outlook for the road ahead.

EU Member States adopt and enhance FDI screening regimes Three years ago, in 2020, only 15 out of 27 EU Member States maintained a system to safeguard against potential national security risks associated with third-country investments.

Today, 21 Member States have domestic FDI screening regimes, with the remaining six Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Sweden  either currently working on draft legislation or soon adopting their own FDI screening regimes.

In fact, the new Swedish system is due to come into force next month (on 1 December 2023), and Ireland recently passed its Screening of Third Country Transactions Act in October 2023, which is expected to be operational in Q2 2024.

However, despite the increase in FDI regimes and the ECs efforts to set minimum standards for these national regimes, there remain significant differences among the various Member States systems  with notable discrepancies relating to timelines, sectoral coverage and notification requirements.

This is not unsurprising, given that issues of national security remain a Member State prerogative, although that prerogative must be exercised in line with EU law.

EU FDI cooperation mechanism frequently used, but areas for improvement remain The EU FDI Screening Regulation created a cooperation mechanism for Member States and the EC to exchange information, raise security-related concerns and identify solutions concerning specific FDIs with a view to ensuring the protection of security and public order.

Since the creation of the cooperation mechanism, the EC has screened more than 1,100 FDIs.

In 2022, 17 Member States submitted a total of 423 notifications to the EC under the cooperation mechanism, whereas in 2021, only 13 Member States participated.

The EC assessed 81% of these cases in Phase 1 reviews within 15 calendar days.

Only 11% of cases proceeded to Phase 2, with additional information being requested from the notifying Member State  including information to better assess the criticality of the target company and/or the potential threats posed by the investor (such as information on the products and/or services of the target company, alternative suppliers and market shares, influence of the investor on the target company after the transaction, and additional defining characteristics of the investor and its strategy).

The duration of Phase 2 proceedings varied significantly, from one to 126 calendar days, which is attributable to the information requested from the parties.

The sector subject to the highest number of Phase 2 investigations was manufacturing (59%), which is unsurprising given that it covers a diverse set of industries.

The main countries of investor origin were Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Japan, UK and US.

The proportion of US and UK investments was reduced, compared to 2021, from 40% to 32% (US) and from 10% to 7.6% (UK).

Similarly, the proportion of China-originating investments dropped, from 7% to 5.4%.

Around 40% of notified cases originated from countries other than the top six, compared to 2021, where the share was only 29%.

This marks a clear increase in the diversification of origin of the ultimate investors.

This also is reflected in the fact that in 2022 ultimate investors originated from 52 different countries.

Number of formally screened transactions has increased, yet risk of intervention is low In total, Member States handled 1,444 authorisation requests and ex officio cases in 2022."
Cooley,European Commission Publishes Third Annual Report on EU Foreign Direct Investments,"Number of formally screened transactions has increased, yet risk of intervention is low In total, Member States handled 1,444 authorisation requests and ex officio cases in 2022.

Of these, more than half (around 55%) resulted in a formal screening procedure, compared to 29% in 2021.

The vast majority (86%) of formally screened cases were cleared unconditionally, with only 9% of cases approved with conditions and 1% of cases blocked.

The remaining cases were abandoned by the parties.

These numbers suggest that FDI reviews entail mainly timing risks, with low risk of intervention or blocking.

However, it is notable that around 45% of authorisation requests and ex officio cases did not result in any formal screening and/or were deemed ineligible.

This shows that the scope of some FDI regimes remains disproportionately broad or unclear, resulting in parties taking a conservative approach and making precautionary filings, which can lead to unnecessary delays in deal timings, as well as costs for the parties involved.

Transactions involving manufacturing, information and communication technologies (ICT), and professional activities attract higher levels of scrutiny In 2022, the main sectors subject to FDI screening were manufacturing (27%), ICT (24%) and professional activities (12%).

Of these, manufacturing accounted for 52% of Phase 2 cases, which is not surprising given that it includes energy, aerospace, defence, semiconductors, health, data processing and storage, communication, transportation and cybersecurity.

Reforms ahead?

Further to the third annual report, the EC is expected to propose a separate report to the European Parliament and European Council on the functioning and effectiveness of the EU FDI Screening Regulation by the end of the year.

To that end, the EC conducted a public consultation during summer 2023.

The consultation followed publication of a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the Framework for Screening Foreign Direct Investment into the EU, which raised some issues on the effectiveness and efficiency of the FDI Screening Regulation.

In particular, some of the concerns raised by the study included (amongst other things) the variety in review timelines among the Member States national screening regimes and difficulties with gathering information on transactions that are not undergoing screening or that are reviewable but have not been notified.

It is likely that any revisions to the EU FDI Screening Regulation will seek to strengthen the cooperation mechanism and improve the sharing of information among national authorities and the EC.

It also is likely that the EC may broaden the list of sensitive sectors under review and the information requested from national authorities.

However, what is less likely is the requirement for all Member States to screen FDI transactions in a set period of time, as such a measure would be contrary to the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States.

Any changes to the EU FDI Screening Regulation will come at a critical time, with increased geopolitical tensions and accelerated technological shifts.

In June 2023, the EC published its Economic Security Strategy to minimise the risks arising from certain economic flows while promoting the EUs competitiveness.

It is still very much in its early days, but any revisions to the EU FDI Screening Regulation are likely to play a key role in achieving the EUs strategy."

Cooley,CFPB Proposes Increased Oversight of Digital Wallet and Payments Providers Through New Larger Participant Rule,"On November 7, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) that would allow it to supervise digital wallet and payment app providers deemed larger participants.

The proposed rule would apply to nonbank payments companies that offer digital wallets or person-to-person payments through mobile and web applications, process more than five million covered payment transactions per year and are not a small business concern, as defined under the Small Business Act (SBA).

Citing the need for such companies to adhere to the same rules as large banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions already supervised by the CFPB, the bureau suggests that subjecting such nonbanks to the rule will ensure continued monitoring and scrutiny on a regular basis.

According to the CFPB, the nonbank payments market has a large and increasing significance to the everyday financial lives of consumers.

The CFPB believes that gaining supervisory authority over these types of payments companies will ensure compliance with federal consumer financial laws, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and its prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, as well as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.

This supervisory authority would further the CFPBs statutory objective of ensuring that federal consumer financial law is enforced consistently between nonbanks and depository institutions in order to promote fair competition.

The CFPB estimates that this expanded supervisory authority would apply to 17 nonbanks that in 2021, according to the bureau, collectively facilitated almost $13 billion in transactions and are responsible for about 88% of known transactions in the defined market.

Comments on the proposed rule are due on or before January 8, 2024  or 30 days after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register, whichever is later.

Proposed supervisory authority Section 1024 of the CFPA gives the CFPB the authority to examine nonbank entities it defines as larger participant[s] of a market for consumer financial products or services.

1

The CFPBs nonbank supervisory authority allows it to conduct exams to: Assess compliance with federal consumer financial law.

Obtain information about an entitys activities and compliance systems.

Detect and assess risks to consumers and consumer financial markets.

2

Such nonbank exams include the collection of documents, information, records and data from a company; on-site and off-site meetings and interviews; and meetings with company leadership and management.

An exam concludes with issuance of a supervisory letter or examination report, which may include matters requiring attention (MRA), a memorandum of understanding (MOU), and other findings or potential violations of law.

Exams also may result in the identification of violations of law, including through the Potential Action and Request for Response (PARR) process and/or a referral to the CFPBs enforcement arm (and in the case of fair lending matters, the Department of Justice), resulting in the start of an investigation  including on issues broader in scope and time frame than those examined.

Touting the value of such supervisory authority in addition to existing enforcement authority, the CFPBs press release commented that [w]hile the CFPB has enforcement authority over these companies, the CFPB has not previously had, inside many of these firms, examiners carefully scrutinizing their activities to ensure they are following the law and monitoring their executives.

Who is covered by the proposed rule?"
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Increased Oversight of Digital Wallet and Payments Providers Through New Larger Participant Rule,"Who is covered by the proposed rule?

Under the proposed rule, a nonbank covered person would be classified as a larger participant of the general-use digital payment market and subject to CFPB supervision if it provides general-use digital consumer payment applications with an annual volume of at least five million consumer payment transactions and is not a small business concern, as defined under the SBA.

Defining the market for general-use digital consumer payment applications Under the proposed rule, providing a general-use digital consumer payment application means providing a covered payment functionality through a digital application for consumers general use in making consumer payment transaction (s) (emphasis added).

Below, we summarize how the proposed rule defines these concepts.

Covered payment functionality The term covered payment functionality includes a funds transfer functionality and a wallet functionality.

A funds transfer functionality means  in connection with a consumer payment transaction  receiving funds for the purpose of transmitting them, or accepting and transmitting payment instructions.

The first aspect of this definition would generally cover payments services provided by money transmission companies licensed under state money transmission laws.

(The CFPB notes that it is aware that States have been active in regulation of money transmission  and that many States actively examine money transmitters.)

The second element would, notably, encompass companies that are generally not subject to state money transmission laws  and that historically may not have considered themselves as covered persons under the CFPA in the first instance.

The proposed rule indicates that companies that accept and transmit payment instructions may include, for example, a nonbank that accepts a consumers instruction to send money from the consumers banking deposit account to another person by processing the transaction through the automated clearing house (ACH) network, or by transmitting the instructions to a partner depository institution.

Wallet functionality means a product or service that stores account or payment credentials, including in encrypted or tokenized form; and transmits, routes, or otherwise processes such stored account or payment credentials to facilitate a consumer payment transaction.

This can include storing credit card or other payment credentials for purchases on ecommerce websites or from brick-and-mortar merchants, or to fund person-to-person/peer-to-peer (P2P) or other types of funds transfers.

In other words, even if a platform does not receive or transmit money, but only holds credentials that are processed to facilitate purchase transactions or P2P funds transfers, its activity would still likely be within the scope of wallet functionality.

Digital application The proposed rule would define the term digital application as a software program a consumer may access through a personal computing device, including  a mobile phone, smart watch, tablet, laptop computer, or desktop computer.

Examples include applications, websites or programs activated from a personal computing device using a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint.

General use The proposed rule would define general use as the absence of significant limitations on the purpose of consumer payment transactions facilitated by the covered payment functionality provided through the digital consumer payment application.

Notably, the proposed rule would establish that a digital consumer payment application that is limited solely to facilitating P2P funds transfers (e.g., cannot be used for purchase transactions) would still qualify as having general use .

Some digital applications with limited payments functionalities would not be considered general use, such as functionality that is solely for purchase or lease of a specific type of goods  including transportation, lodging, food, etc."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Increased Oversight of Digital Wallet and Payments Providers Through New Larger Participant Rule,"These limitations would appear to potentially exclude platforms on which payments have a specifically defined, limited purpose  such as ridesharing or vacation rentals.

Consumer payment transactions The most significant part of the proposed rule is what does and does not constitute a consumer payment transaction.

The proposed definition is straightforward: the transfer of funds by or on behalf of a consumer physically located in a State to another person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

But there are some significant inclusions and exclusions.

The proposed rule states that a transfer of funds would encompass not just a consumers transfer of their own funds (e.g., from a linked bank account or stored value account) but also a creditors transfer of funds.

Hence, even though a credit card payment is not an electronic fund transfer subject to Regulation E, the proposed rule would cover the use of digital wallet functionality to purchase nonfinancial goods or services using stored credit card credentials.

Additionally, the CFPB states that it believes that funds for purposes of the CFPA include digital assets that have monetary value and are readily useable for financial purposes, including as a medium of exchange.

So, a transfer of funds in the form of digital assets that otherwise meets the criteria for the proposed market definition would be within scope of the proposed rule.

Additionally, the proposed rule would exclude four types of transfers from the scope of the proposed definition of a consumer payment transaction: International money transfers.

Transactions for the purpose of exchanging one type of funds for another  such as foreign currency purchases or purchases and sales of digital assets.

Payment transactions for sale or lease of goods or services conducted with a consumer by an online or physical store or marketplace operated prominently in the name of the store or marketplace.

3

An extension of consumer credit made using a digital application provided by the person who is extending the credit or that persons affiliated company.

The fourth exclusion focuses on payments and is not intended to encompass lending.

As the CFPB explains, as a result of this proposed exclusion, for example, a nonbank that provides a digital application through which consumers can borrow money to purchase goods or services would not be participating in the proposed market.

Defining a larger participant in the general-use digital consumer payment application market The proposed rule would define a larger participant of the general-use digital consumer payment application market as a nonbank covered person that provides general-use digital consumer payment applications with an annual volume of at least five million consumer payment transactions.

This five million annual transactions threshold would be aggregated across affiliated companies and would include the aggregate annual volume of both consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business transactions facilitated by all general-use digital consumer payment applications in the preceding year.

4 However, in order to be a larger participant, the nonbank covered person also must not be a small business concern, as defined by the SBA. 5

An entity would be a small business concern, and therefore not a larger participant (if the criteria were otherwise met), if its size was at or below the threshold for its primary industry as set forth in the rules implementing the SBA.

Looking ahead The proposed rule is the latest action by the CFPB to curtail risks it perceives in the payments space and Big Tech  including through interpretive guidance and public inquiries of some of the nations largest tech companies.

It also hits many of the themes emerging from the CFPB, including a focus on fair and competitive business practices, which the bureau believes benefits consumers, including by driving down product costs."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Increased Oversight of Digital Wallet and Payments Providers Through New Larger Participant Rule,"Also of note is the bureaus statement within its commentary to the proposed rule that the CFPBs proposed supervisory authority would not only ensure companies are monitoring their compliance with consumer protection laws, but also confirm they are monitoring their executives  highlighting the risks of noncompliance not just for entities but also for individuals, another CFPB theme.

Entities engaged in payments-related activities, including ACH processing services and bank partnership activities, will need to carefully review their services to evaluate whether the proposed rule might apply to their business.

Entities outside the scope of the proposed rules reach may want to evaluate how the existence of this larger participant rule could impact longer-term growth and related strategy.

The proposed rule has significant implications  not just for the way in which companies comply with federal consumer protection and other applicable laws, but how they do so, including the effectiveness of their compliance management systems.

Exam management is more than just showing compliance; issues such as record retention, change management and privilege all come into play when considering how to prepare for a potential exam.

For examined entities, building the right regulatory relationship may be as important as demonstrating compliance with the laws at issue.

Notes This proposed rule would be the sixth CFPB rulemaking to define larger participants of markets for consumer financial products or services for purposes of the CFPA, adding to existing rules covering participants in the following markets  consumer reporting, consumer debt collection, student loan servicing, international money transfers and automobile financing.

The CFPB also has authority to require submission of certain information for purposes of assessing whether a person is a larger participant of a covered market.

See 12 CFR 1090.103(d).

Under the proposed rule, a transfer of funds in connection with a consumer purchase on an online marketplace using account or payment credentials stored by the marketplace would not be considered a consumer payment transaction.

If, however, the online marketplace operator also provides a general-use digital consumer payments application (e.g., the ability to use credentials stored with the online marketplace platform for purchases on third-party websites), such activity would be covered and counted toward the larger participant test thresholds.

Note that the CFPB is considering one major alternative to the proposed rule: a different transaction volume threshold set, for example, at 10 million aggregate annual consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business transactions.

Changing this transaction volume could bring additional nonbank entities under the CFPBs supervisory authority.

Cooley,Parallel Enforcement: SEC Authorities and How They Can Impact FDA’s Civil and Criminal Enforcement,"Cooley partners Luke Cadigan and Sonia Nath coauthored an article in the Food and Drug Law Institutes Food and Drug Law Journal on the interplay between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory regimes concerning life sciences companies.

Cooley,"Federal, State Agencies Promote Expanded Oversight of Bank and Nonbank Community Development Activities","On November 2, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a survey on state Community Reinvestment Acts (CRAs) aimed at informing states without CRAs about actions they could take to promote lending and investment in communities of color.

In connection with the release, the bureau highlighted the explosive growth of mortgage lending by nonbanks as compared to banksonly the latter of which are covered by the federal Community Reinvestment Act.

Just two days earlier, the New York attorney general released a report on racial disparities in homeownership , finding that historic lending practices have prevented consumers of color from purchasing homes and deepened wealth inequality.

These reports build upon a deluge of public policy efforts  such as interagency promotion of special purpose credit programs and the Department of Justices Combating Redlining Initiative  aimed at driving additional lending and investment in communities of color.

Seven states have CRA laws creating an affirmative obligation for financial institutions to meet the lending, investment and service needs of their communities The CFPBs survey highlights the variety of approaches various states take to ensure financial institutions adequately serve the communities in which they operate.

Chief among the bureaus concerns is that the federal CRA and four of the seven state CRAs do not apply to nonbank financial services companies.

The bureau notes that when the federal CRA was enacted in 1977, banks originated 74% of all mortgages; however, as of 2021, nonbank mortgage companies originated 64% of conventional home purchase loans.

While the bureau does not expressly recommend expanding all CRA laws to nonbank mortgage companies, it implies as much by noting that their business model would not be viable without federally supported institutions  the justification for subjecting banks to the federal CRA.

The survey also explores the host of enforcement mechanisms state regulators use to promote compliance with CRA obligations.

While no state provides for the assessment of civil monetary penalties for noncompliance, the bureau found that states can restrict M&A activities, mandate corrective action, limit product offerings and examine highly rated institutions less frequently.

New York attorney general pushing for increased enforcement resources and tools The New York attorney general and New York State Department of Financial Services have in recent years focused on alleged discriminatory lending practices in mortgage lending and auto lending.

The attorney generals new report explores racial and ethnic disparities in homeownership, mortgage application and approval rates, and mortgage pricing.

To rectify these issues, the attorney general recommends, among other things, that the legislature increase funding for government agencies to conduct fair lending work.

Noting how resource-intensive it is to bring fair lending investigations, the report concludes that many lenders escape review.

The attorney general also recommends that the state directly subsidize down payments for first-generation homeowners to address historical inequities that created the racial wealth gap, thereby limiting asset accumulation for families of color.

Looking ahead Federal and state policymakers and regulators continue to use a variety of tools to press financial institutions to serve communities of color.

Perhaps the most prominent initiative is the DOJs Combating Redlining Initiative, which recently secured its 10th redlining settlement.

DOJ also recently disclosed it has more than 24 active investigations across the country .

In response to this pressure, both bank and nonbank financial institutions will need to continue to look for opportunities to support communities of color  whether it is through affirmative marketing and outreach, strengthening support for consumers with limited English proficiency, or developing new products."
Cooley,"Why SEC Is Worried AI Could Lead to Recession, Racial Bias","Editor's note: Authored by Nancy Wojtas, this article was originally published in Law360 .

There is little doubt that artificial intelligence represents one of the most disruptive technologies of the modern era.

AI has been described as the use of mathematics and software code to teach computers how to understand, synthesize and generate knowledge in ways similar to how people do it.

Although the rapid progression of AI over the last decade has generally occurred outside of the bounds of significant regulatory oversight, the 2022 and 2023 launches of numerous chatbots powered by AI models sparked wonder across the globe.

This led to significant regulatory questioning of this emergent technology worldwide, seemingly not because robots will spring to life and attack the human race, but because of concerns over the potential misuse of such technology.

On the U.S. regulatory side, the Federal Trade Commission , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Communications Commission are all proposing to play a role in regulating artificial intelligence, but these product, consumer and technology-focused agencies are not the only ones monitoring risks they believe that AI may pose.

Once again  much like he did for cryptocurrency  U.S. Securities Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has indicated, most recently at an event in September marking the 15th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc. , that he believes the SEC should have a seat at the AI regulatory table.

Similarly, in his speech at a National Press Club in July, Gensler waxed poetic about the fundamental progressions in technology over the last five centuries  from Newton to the mass production of the modern automobile  and then turned his sights to AI, launching into a discussion of the various risks that this new technology may pose to the U.S. financial markets.

The role of the SEC is to protect investors in securities and to maintain fair, orderly and efficient securities markets, but only time will tell what Gensler's regulatory and enforcement approach to effectuating these aims in the AI context will look like.

Gensler explained in July, flexing his technical terminology, that AI models are nonlinear and hyperdimensional, which makes them notoriously difficult to interpret and reverse engineer.

Models are trained on trillions of data points, but the models themselves do not actually retain copies of the data that are used to train them.

In fact, relative to the data underlying most AI large language models  the most common and, to date, effective category of an AI model  the models themselves are incredibly lightweight and unburdened by the terabytes of underlying data.

This is, of course, the case because it would be a highly inefficient approach for a model to review trillions of data points whenever a new question is asked of it.

Rather, it is much more efficient for the data to train the model first  over days, weeks or even years - and for the model to then answer a question simply as an algorithm derived from such data.

Why might the SEC care that it is difficult to discern what data trained a model to respond to an input in a certain way?

Gensler noted that initially, the debate around AI was over who owns an individual's data.

Gensler posited that the issues about today's AI are around privacy and intellectual property rights, not just about any one individual, but rather how the data being collected on each of us results in all of us helping to train the parameters of AI models.

Such data collection may result in significant value to those AI developers.

Further, Gensler noted that at the present time, the debate on ownership is playing out in Hollywood, with software developers and with social media companies."
Cooley,"Why SEC Is Worried AI Could Lead to Recession, Racial Bias","Further, Gensler noted that at the present time, the debate on ownership is playing out in Hollywood, with software developers and with social media companies.

For the SEC, Gensler noted that the commission's challenge is trying to ensure competitive, efficient markets in the face of what could be dominant base layers at the center of the capital markets, and that the SEC must closely assess this trend so that it can continue to promote competition, transparency and fair access to the securities markets.

Gensler touched on several potential fundamental legal areas that may fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC:

First, Gensler discussed that AI models may be trained on data ""reflecting historical biases as well as latent features that may inadvertently be proxies for protected characteristics,"" and thus Gensler postulated ""may mask underlying systemic racism and bias.""

For example, imagine that a potential investor is not permitted to make a leveraged trade through a broker-dealer because the broker-dealer deems the investor to pose a high risk, but it is an AI model providing this broker-dealer with the risk assessment.

How does anyone know whether the model is discerning that the investor's last name is more common among a historically marginalized ethnic group to make the risk assessment, even if the use of such ethnic information may not be permissible under the law?

Not only are there billions of parameters, weightings that bias a model toward one response over another, in each AI model, and, thus, far too many details for any single person  even an expert AI programmer  to wade through, but the AI models themselves rarely reveal the underlying data that are creating these weightings.

If a parameter exists within a model that biases the investor against receiving a positive risk assessment based on her last name, no one would ever know.

However, whether the SEC may opt to regulate, if at all, against such bias in the future remains to be seen.

Second, Gensler discussed a separate legal issue that arises from not knowing the underlying data used to train AI models.

Are the AI models utilizing IP not owned or licensed by the AI developer?

If such data allows an AI model to customize a response, or ultimately a product or service, then any entity using such product or service may be in constant breach of a third party's IP rights.

Gensler did not specifically discuss how the government  or, in particular, the SEC  may intervene in such scenarios in which such IP is being used to create unfair advantages in trading.

Again, we will have to wait and see how Gensler  and any subsequently appointed chairs  will feel the need to have the SEC propose and adopt rules by which traders or investment advisers and their vendors will be responsible for disgorging profits from any trade subsequently determined to have been made using illegally obtained IP.

Third, Gensler asserted that there are risks that may arise in the financial markets resulting from just one or a few companies ultimately winning the AI model race, and virtually all financial institutions growing dependent on that small number of models.

Gensler noted that such consolidation may lead to AI causing a herd effect in trading whereby the most powerful models drive all major investors in a single direction at once, causing a flash recession or other dangerous ramifications thereby negatively influencing the financial stability of the securities markets.

The SEC may play a role in limiting the use of such super-models in trading or implementing risk mitigation emergency frameworks in the case of a crash caused by the convergence of AI model behavior.

Financial firms also may wish to implement internal risk procedures against a harmful financial event caused by models moving in the same direction at once.

Gensler discussed a wide array of ideas, issues and risks relating to AI."
Cooley,"Why SEC Is Worried AI Could Lead to Recession, Racial Bias","Gensler discussed a wide array of ideas, issues and risks relating to AI.

While thoughtful regulation may be needed for AI, only time will tell how and when the SEC as well as the other regulatory agencies will take any significant actions.

The SEC has started already attempting to police this area by exercising its jurisdiction over broker-dealers and investment advisers.

It proposed, in July , by a 3-2 vote of the commissioners, new conflicts of interest rules[1] that are designed to prevent a broker-dealer or an investment adviser from using predictive data analytics or similar technologies in such a manner that results in a broker-dealer or investment adviser placing its own interests above those of its client.

The proposed rules, in addition to requiring written policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the proposed rules and requiring additional recordkeeping requirements, appear to be designed to prevent broker-dealers and investment advisers from using covered technologies  including AI  when communicating with their clients that optimize proprietary revenue or change their clients' behaviors in such a way that benefits the broker-dealer or investment adviser, to the detriment of those clients.

The proposed rules, however, rather than requiring broker-dealers or investment advisers to disclose such conflicts of interest and requiring a client's consent  the current framework for dealing with conflicts of interest  are asking those entities to prove a negative, meaning that the technology does not in any way put the interests of broker-dealers or investment advisers before the client's interests.

This new approach by the SEC may have a chilling effect on the types of technology, including AI, these firms will use, which could have made them more effective advisers to their clients.

Those developing AI models and those utilizing those models should exercise care, since we know at least one regulatory agency that is prepared to be a watchdog.

These proposed rules may only be the start of such AI rulemaking.

Cooley,California Employers Facing New Employment Laws for 2024,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed several new employment laws impacting California employers.

Unless otherwise specified, those laws, which are summarized below, take effect on January 1, 2024.

Minimum wage increases In the new year, the general statewide minimum wage will increase by 50 cents, to $16 per hour .

The minimum exempt salary for California employees, which is tied to the states minimum wage, will rise from $64,480 to $66,560.

( Note: Many cities have their own minimum wage requirements that are higher than the states minimum wage.)

The state also passed extensive legislation implementing minimum wages for specific industry employers, including healthcare facilities, as well as a $20 minimum wage for fast food workers beginning April 1, 2024.

Healthcare minimum wage Senate Bill 525 will require virtually all California healthcare facilities to meet certain minimum wage schedules beginning June 1, 2024.

The applicable minimum wage schedules (from $18 per hour up to $23 per hour) will depend on the type of healthcare facility and the nature and size of the business.

A covered health care employee is expansively defined to include healthcare providers, as well as those not directly involved in patient care, such as janitors, housekeeping staff, and clerical and food service workers.

Notably, the expansive definition includes certain contracted or subcontracted employees if there is a contract with the healthcare facility employer to provide healthcare services or services supporting the provision of healthcare and the healthcare facility employer directly or indirectly exercises control over the employees wages, hours, or working conditions.

Meanwhile, a covered health care facility covers virtually all healthcare employers, including facilities or worksites that are part of an integrated healthcare delivery system, licensed skilled nursing facilities, and clinics.

The applicable minimum wage is divided into four categories.

For example, large employers with 10,000 or more full time employees are required to pay a minimum wage of $23 per hour beginning June 1, 2024, $24 per hour beginning June 1, 2025, and $25 per hour beginning June 1, 2026.

On the other hand, hospitals with a high percentage of Medicare and Medi-Cal patients, rural independent facilities, and certain independent hospitals must pay a minimum wage of $18 per hour beginning June 1, 2024.

In addition to the varying minimum wage schedules, SB 525 requires healthcare workers who are paid on a salary basis to earn a monthly salary equivalent to at least 150% of the healthcare worker minimum wage, or 200% of the applicable state minimum wage, whichever is greater.

The law also preempts any local ordinance, regulation, or administrative action that is enacted or takes effect after September 6, 2023, that relates to wages, salaries, or compensation for covered healthcare facility employees.

Under the law, the California Department of Health Care Access and Information must publish, on or before January 31, 2024, a list of covered healthcare facility employers that qualify based on classification.

Employers who believe they were improperly excluded from the list may file requests with the department for reclassification.

Healthcare facilities also may apply for waivers with the state, which would allow a temporary pause or alternative phase-in schedule of the applicable minimum wage.

Workplace violence prevention safety plan In a groundbreaking development, California became the first state in the country to require employers to develop, implement and maintain an effective workplace violence prevention plan, train employees, and create and maintain extensive records regarding workplace violence, beginning July 1, 2024.

SB 553 covers virtually all employers, with limited exceptions."
Cooley,California Employers Facing New Employment Laws for 2024,"SB 553 covers virtually all employers, with limited exceptions.

Under the law, workplace violence is defined as any act of violence or threat of violence that occurs in a place of employment that results in, or has a high likelihood of resulting in, injury, psychological trauma, or stress, regardless of whether the employee sustains an injury.

Weve outlined key requirements of the law below.

The prevention plan must be in writing and made easily accessible to employees.

The plan can be incorporated as a stand-alone section in an existing injury and illness prevention program or maintained as a separate document.

The plan must include all of the following components: Names or job titles of the persons responsible for implementing the plan.

Effective procedures to obtain the active involvement of employees and authorized employee representatives in developing and implementing the plan.

Methods the employer will use to coordinate implementation of the plan with other employers, when applicable.

Procedures to accept and respond to reports of workplace violence, and to prohibit retaliation against an employee who makes such a report.

Procedures to ensure that supervisory and nonsupervisory employees comply with the plan.

Procedures to communicate with employees regarding workplace violence matters.

Procedures to respond to actual or potential workplace violence emergencies, including, but not limited to, all of the following: Procedures to develop and provide the training required.

Procedures to identify, evaluate and correct workplace violence hazards.

Procedures for post-incident response and investigation.

Procedures to review the effectiveness of the plan and revise the plan as needed.

For every workplace violence incident, the violent incident log must include: The date, time and location of the incident.

The type of workplace violence.

A detailed description of the incident.

A classification of who committed the violence.

A classification of circumstances at the time of the incident.

Where the incident occurred.

The type of incident, including, but not limited to, whether it involved a physical attack, threat of physical force, sexual assault, etc. Consequences of the incident, including whether security or law enforcement was contacted and their response.

Information about the person completing the log.

The required training also must be conducted when the plan is first established and annually thereafter.

Additional training must be provided when a new or previously unrecognized workplace violence hazard has been identified and when changes are made to the plan.

The initial training must include: The employers plan, how to obtain a copy of the employers plan at no cost, and how to participate in development and implementation of the employers plan.

How to report workplace violence incidents or concerns to the employer or law enforcement.

Workplace violence hazards specific to employees jobs, corrective measures the employer has implemented, how to seek assistance to prevent or respond to violence, and strategies to avoid physical harm.

The violent incident log and how to obtain copies of required records.

An opportunity for interactive questions and answers with a person knowledgeable about the employers plan.

Finally, employers must create and maintain training records for a minimum of one year, and the following records must be maintained for a minimum of five years: Records of workplace violence hazard identification, evaluation and correction.

Violent incident logs.

Records of workplace violence incident investigations.

Employers must make required records available to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), and records of workplace violence hazard identification, evaluation, correction, training records and violent incident logs must be made available to employees upon request."
Cooley,California Employers Facing New Employment Laws for 2024,"Although Cal/OSHA can begin enforcing SB 553 on July 1, 2024, it must propose its own workplace violence standards by December 31, 2025, and adopt such standards by December 31, 2026.

SB 553 also made changes to existing law permitting employers to petition for temporary restraining orders (TROs) on behalf of employees.

The law now permits union representatives to petition for TROs after hearing on behalf of employees (who can decline to be named) who have suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence from any individual that can reasonably be construed to be carried out or to have been carried out at the workplace.

Paid sick leave expansion SB 616 amends the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 to increase the amount of paid sick time employees can receive each year from three to five days (or 40 hours) for full-time employees.

The law also increases the accrual threshold from six days (or 48 hours) to 10 days (or 80 hours).

Employers using the front-loading method of providing paid sick leave must now provide five days (40 hours) at the beginning of the year.

Employers using a different accrual method, other than providing one hour per every 30 hours worked, must now ensure an employee has at least 40 hours of accrued sick leave by the 200th calendar day of employment, in addition to the preexisting requirement that such employees have no less than three days (24 hours) by the 120th calendar day of employment.

Employees must be permitted to use at least five days (40 hours) per year.

The sick leave statute contains an exemption for certain employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement, though employers relying on this exemption must meet certain additional requirements, such as not requiring employees to find a replacement worker as a condition of using the sick days.

Reproductive loss leave SB 848 requires employers with five or more employees to provide a leave of up to five days following a reproductive loss event, which is defined as the day or, for a multiple-day event, the final day of a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction.

The leave is capped at a maximum of 20 days within a 12-month period, and employees must be permitted to take such leave nonconsecutively.

Leave may be unpaid, though employees may use vacation, personal leave, accrued sick leave or other paid time off.

Any information provided to the employer relating to the leave must be maintained as confidential and must not be disclosed except to internal personnel or counsel, or as required by law.

The law also prohibits retaliation for exercising rights to the leave.

Noncompete agreements California recently enacted two significant laws regarding employers use of noncompete agreements, as we explained in an October 31 client alert .

Emergency or disaster declaration information Effective January 1, 2024, Assembly Bill 636 expanded the information required in employers wage theft notices.

Such notices, which contain specific information, already were required to be issued to non-exempt employees at the time of hire and, in certain circumstances, within seven days of any changes to the information.

AB 636 requires such notices to also include information regarding [t]he existence of a federal or state emergency or disaster declaration applicable to the county or counties where the employee is to be employed that may affect employees health and safety during their employment.

This requirement applies to declarations issued within 30 days before an employees first day of employment.

While Californias labor commissioner is required to create a new notice template by March 1, 2024, employers should update their notices in the meantime.

Cannabis use As we discussed in an October 2022 client alert , effective January 1, 2024, AB 2188 made it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against employees for their off-duty use of cannabis."
Cooley,California Employers Facing New Employment Laws for 2024,"Cannabis use As we discussed in an October 2022 client alert , effective January 1, 2024, AB 2188 made it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against employees for their off-duty use of cannabis.

SB 700 expands this protection by making it unlawful for an employer to request information from applicants regarding their prior use of cannabis.

The law also prohibits discrimination against applicants based on information about their prior cannabis use obtained from criminal history, unless the employer is otherwise permitted to consider or inquire about that information under the law.

Venture capital diversity data reporting Beginning March 1, 2025, SB 54 , another groundbreaking law, requires certain venture capital companies, including venture capital funds, to report to the California Civil Rights Department on the diversity of the founding members of companies in which they invest.

Climate disclosure requirements In a three-punch series of laws, California became the first state to impose climate-related disclosure obligations on companies.

AB 1305 , the Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act, will require companies who make climate-related claims or goals to provide certain annual disclosures on their website.

Two other bills  SB 253 (the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) and SB 261 (the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act), which are collectively known as the California Climate Accountability Package  impose new climate risk disclosure requirements for public and private companies doing business in California above certain revenue thresholds.

SB 253, which is applicable to companies with revenues greater than $1 billion, requires disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2026.

Companies also are required to obtain third-party assurance of their reports.

SB 261 requires large corporations with revenues exceeding $500 million to annually disclose climate-related financial risks, with an initial climate-related financial risk report due on or before January 1, 2026.

Rebuttable presumption of retaliation SB 497 , known as the Equal Pay and Anti-Retaliation Act, amends the California Labor Code to create a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an employee is disciplined or discharged within 90 days of engaging in certain protected activity, including disclosing an employees own wages, discussing or inquiring about the wages of others, making a written or oral complaint regarding owed unpaid wages, or aiding or encouraging any other employee to exercise their rights.

Employers also are liable for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per employee for each violation, to be awarded to the employee who experienced retaliation.

No automatic stay during appeals of motions to compel arbitration decisions SB 365 amends the California Code of Civil Procedure so that trial court proceedings are not automatically stayed (i.e., suspended) when a party appeals an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration.

This law will permit courts to exercise discretion in whether to stay trial court proceedings while an appeal is heard.

The law may be challenged in court, however, on grounds that it is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.

Prosecution for labor code violations AB 594 empowers local prosecutors  including any district attorney, city attorney, county counsel, or any other city or county prosecutor  to prosecute a civil or criminal action for violations of the states labor code that occur within the prosecutors geographic jurisdiction.

The law also provides that any individual agreement between the employer and employee that purports to limit representative actions or to mandate private arbitration will have no effect on such prosecution.

In addition to any other remedies available, a public prosecutor may seek injunctive relief, and prevailing plaintiffs may be awarded reasonable attorneys fees and costs, including expert witness fees."
Cooley,California Employers Facing New Employment Laws for 2024,"Next steps These new employment laws are expansive in breadth and scope.

Employers need to prepare well in advance by reviewing and updating policies and practices, including applicable employee handbooks and employment agreements containing restrictive covenants and arbitration provisions, for compliance with these laws.

Where applicable, employers also should create or revise workplace violence prevention plans to comply with SB 553 and monitor developments from Cal/OSHA on this law, which may include further guidance and a model workplace violence prevention program.

Employers affected by the new slew of climate-related legislation should coordinate closely with counsel to prepare to comply with the new reporting regime.

Cooley,"The Age of Principled AI: Exploring Risk, Responsibility and Possibility for Federal AI Use","Event summary Cooley special counsel Grant Schweikert attended this panel discussion hosted by Booz Allen and Fast Company, where federal leaders and industry luminaries explored the need for ethics and security as catalysts for artificial intelligence (AI) adoption by federal agencies in addressing this critical question: As frameworks, executive orders and legislation continue to surface across the federal government to address societal concerns and establish the United States as a leader in AI, how are we collectively responding?

Panelists included: Matthew Johnson  Senior technical adviser for responsible AI in the Chief Digital and AI Office at the Department of Defense (DoD)

Navrina Singh  Founder and CEO of Credo AI Randal Meyer  Legislative director and chief counsel to Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina John Beezer  Senior adviser to the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Key takeaways

On the heels of the release of the White Houses October 30 executive order on AI and the DoDs November 2 AI adoption strategy , Johnson announced that a publicly accessible online tool would be available very soon to help the government and industry figure out how to apply responsible AI principles in the development and implementation of defense technologies, while also supporting the combined joint all-domain command and control (CJADC2) strategy to accelerate the delivery of actionable data to warfighters.

Part of the DoDs strategy is to leverage its massive $900 billion annual budget to incentivize the development of AI technology that leans into American values  such as transparency in government, protecting intellectual property and ensuring the privacy of individuals  while combating authoritarian uses of AI as a tool for propaganda and repression.

Multiple panelists referred to an unavoidable tidal wave of transformational change on the horizon.

The national defense industrial base, especially innovators of dual-use technologies, should be prepared for growing pains as government leaders grapple with how best to manage and deploy US assets as the front-runner in the AI battlespace."
Cooley,"Q3 2023 Venture Financing Report – Deal Count and Invested Capital Increase Slightly, While Percentage of Down Rounds Continues Rise to New Levels","Cooley handled 225 reported venture capital financings in Q3 2023, representing $6.8 billion in invested capital  an increase from 221 reported financings and $6.4 billion in invested capital during Q2 2023.

This continues an upward trend that started in Q2 2023 and ends the steady decline we saw between Q4 2021 and Q1 2023.

The slight increase in the number of deals was reflected more in early rounds.

The number of mid-stage rounds decreased, and the number of late-stage rounds stayed consistent with Q2 2023.

The slight increase in invested capital in Q3 2023 was seen more in late-stage rounds, with early and mid-stage rounds showing a decrease in invested capital compared to last quarter.

Median pre-money valuations remained steady for most stages of financing.

Valuations for Series Seed deals generally remained high, consistent with levels seen since mid-2021.

Series A valuations were down from the highs seen in early 2021 through mid-2022, in line with valuations seen in late 2020 and consistent with those seen since mid-2022.

Series B and C valuations trended down during Q3 2023, with Series C valuations aligned with those seen throughout 2021 and 2022.

Meanwhile, Series B valuations aligned with the valuations seen in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023.

Valuations for Series D and higher deals, which have been down for most of 2023, climbed upward during Q3 2023 to be in line with valuations seen in 2022.

The percentage of deals (at all stages) with a pre-money valuation of $100 million or more dropped slightly during the quarter, from more than 30% of deals in June 2023 to 24% of deals in September 2023  though this is still higher than percentages seen during Q1 2023.

Despite the upward trends in numbers of deals and amounts raised, the percentage of down rounds continued to increase in Q3 2023, reaching 27% of deals for the quarter, as compared to 21% of deals for Q2 2023.

The number of flat rounds also increased to 9% of deals for the quarter, as compared to 2.2% of deals last quarter.

There was a corresponding decrease in up rounds to only 64% of deals in Q3 2023.

This is the highest percentage of down rounds and the lowest percentage of up rounds in the history of our reporting (since 2014).

In none of the previously reported quarters have down rounds exceeded 25%, nor have up rounds been less than 70%.

Similarly, flat rounds have represented 9% or more of deals in only four quarters across the history of this report  and generally represent less than 5% of deals in a quarter.

Other (nonvaluation) deal terms in Q3 2023 remained generally favorable to companies.

After rising to 3% of deals in Q2 2023, the percentage of deals involving a recapitalization declined in Q3 2023 to 1.8% of deals.

This number is more in line with percentages seen since 2015 and through Q1 2023.

Ninety-six percent of reported deals in Q3 2023 had non-participating preferred stock, up slightly from 95% of reported deals last quarter.

In contrast to these two favorable trends for companies, however, the percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision increased to 7.1% of reported deals for Q3 2023  the highest percentage seen since Q3 2020 and only the fourth time in the history of our reporting that this number has exceeded 7%.

In PitchBooks Q2 2023 Global League Tables , Cooley was named the #1 law firm overall in the US and globally for representation of companies in venture capital financings, as well as the second most active law firm in the US and globally for representation of investors in venture capital financings.

In addition, Cooley ranked as the most active law firm in venture financing deals in various industry sectors  including pharma and biotech, healthcare (services and systems), healthcare (devices and supplies), commercial products, and services and media."
Cooley,"Q3 2023 Venture Financing Report – Deal Count and Invested Capital Increase Slightly, While Percentage of Down Rounds Continues Rise to New Levels","Spotlight on technology Despite the quarters slight upward trend overall for deal volume and invested capital, those metrics for technology company venture financings remained about the same as they were in Q2 2023, with 119 reported venture financings, representing $3.1 billion in invested capital.

This represents the lowest deal volume for tech companies since Q3 2018, when Cooley handled 115 reported deals, and the lowest amount raised since Q1 2019, when Cooley handled 123 reported deals, representing more than $2.8 billion in invested capital.

As with all industries, the deal count and invested capital for tech company venture financings are down significantly compared to one year ago, when Cooley handled 211 reported venture financing deals for tech companies, representing more than $5.6 billion in invested capital.

The average reported deal size for tech company venture financings was just more than $26.4 million for Q3 2023, which is consistent with average deal sizes from both last quarter and one year ago.

Spotlight on life sciences In Q3 2023, Cooley handled 48 reported venture financings of life sciences companies, representing $2.3 billion in invested capital.

Deal count remained about the same compared to last quarter, but invested capital increased from just over $2 billion for Q2 2023.

Reported deal sizes for venture financings of life sciences companies also increased in Q3 2023 to an average deal size of $48.9 million, compared to $35.7 million in Q2 2023.

The number of venture financing deals for life sciences companies is down compared to one year ago  in Q3 2022 when Cooley handled 59 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies.

However, despite the decrease in deal count, the invested capital and average deal size have increased compared to one year ago, when invested capital was $1.8 billion and the average deal size was $30.6 million.

The percentage of life sciences venture financings structured in tranches increased in Q3 2023 to 46% of reported deals.

This is the highest percentage of financings structured in tranches observed in the history of this report  and the first time this percentage has exceeded 40% since Q4 2016.

Cooley,EMA Adopts Revised CTIS Transparency Rules,"On 5 October 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted r evised transparency rules for the publication of information on clinical trials submitted through the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) .

The CTIS plays a fundamental role in facilitating the exchange of clinical trial information within the European Union (EU), as provided in the Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR).

The previous iteration of the CTIS transparency rules requires publication of the almost complete clinical trial application dossier, except for personal data and commercially confidential information (CCI).

The rules also permit sponsors to request the deferral of publication of certain clinical trial documents.

To ensure easier access to pertinent clinical trial information, the revised CTIS transparency rules will introduce a more user-friendly CTIS public website.

Changes are intended to simplify access to information for clinical trial stakeholders, increase awareness of possible treatment options, rationalise the amount of clinical trial data that needs to be published and eliminate deferrals, resulting in earlier access to important documents.

The revised CTIS transparency rules are expected to apply in the second quarter of 2024, once their technical implementation in the CTIS has been finalised.

Removal of the deferral mechanism One of the key rule changes is the removal of the deferral mechanism which permits sponsors of clinical trials to delay publication of certain clinical trial documents for up to seven years after the end of the clinical trial to protect CCI.

The maximum deferral period depends on the categorization of the clinical trial and the type of document for which deferral is requested.


Many sponsors have been relying on this deferral mechanism while limiting redactions of CCI.

However, balancing the deferral mechanism and redaction has been challenging for sponsors and has created uncertainties in relation to the submission of documents to CTIS and requests for deferral.

Removal of the deferral mechanism contributes to simplifying the publication rules and reducing the potential risk that CCI may be published once the deferral period ends.

However, this also means that sponsors will become more reliant on redaction to protect CCI in clinical trial documentation.

The deferral mechanism and related functionalities in CTIS will remain in place until a new CTIS public website  implemented in line with the revised CTIS transparency rules  is available.

Revised publication rules for structured data fields in CTIS Structured data fields, which are the fields populated by users in CTIS, include information concerning the trial title, study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria to take part in the trial, primary and secondary endpoints, details on investigational medicinal products used in the trial, clinical investigator sites and sponsor contact details.

These fields also include data relating to the authorization status of a clinical trial and key dates, such as the start of the clinical trial, recruitment of patients or the end of the clinical trial.

These fields capture essential trial details but cannot be redacted.

The EMA, therefore, emphasises the importance of ensuring that personal data and CCI is excluded from structured data fields.

Details regarding the content of the structured data fields, and the related timing of publication on CTIS, are established in Annex I to the revised CTIS transparency rules.

Revised publication rules for documents submitted in CTIS In accordance with the previous iteration of the CTIS transparency rules, almost all data and clinical trial documents submitted as part of the clinical trial application are published at the earliest opportunity.

Exceptions to this principle apply if the sponsor of the clinical trial requests deferral of publication at the time of submitting a clinical trial application."
Cooley,EMA Adopts Revised CTIS Transparency Rules,"Exceptions to this principle apply if the sponsor of the clinical trial requests deferral of publication at the time of submitting a clinical trial application.

In addition, documents to be published may be redacted to protect CCI and personal data.

Accordingly, the CTIS offers the possibility to prepare and submit two versions when submitting documents in CTIS:

A version for publication for redacted documents.

A version not for publication that may contain personal data and CCI as necessary for scientific and regulatory review carried out by EU Member States.

The revised publication rules maintain the submission of two versions of documents uploaded to CTIS.

However, the type of documents and timing of disclosure have been amended.

In particular, the revised transparency rules aim to focus the publication of documents on those that are more impactful for patients and clinical researchers.

As a result, the number of documents to be publicly disclosed has been limited.

Details regarding the clinical trial documents that will be publicly disclosed, and the related timing of their publication in CTIS, are established in Annex I to the revised transparency rules.

Conclusion The previous iteration of the CTIS transparency rules led sponsors of clinical trials to balance redaction of CCI with the deferral mechanism to protect CCI.

However, these rules date back to 2015.

As a result, the EMA announced, following entry into application of the CTR in 2022, that a public consultation would be held to consider experience with use of the system.

The public consultation was open for comments between May and June 2023 and revealed that implementation of the new CTIS system  combined with the CTIS transparency rules  has proven to be complex in practice.

The revised CTIS transparency rules aim to streamline access to critical clinical trial information by focusing on publication of structured data fields and key documents.

The rules also remove the deferral mechanism and aim to simplify implementation of transparency requirements while permitting sponsors to protect personal data and CCI.

However, many sponsors have relied on the deferral mechanism to delay publication of clinical trial documents with minimal redactions of CCI.

As a result, sponsors may need to revise their internal procedures for managing CCI and fulfilling their transparency obligations under the CTR.

Sponsors also should ensure that all personnel involved in the submission of clinical trial applications are appropriately trained on the requirements of the new CTIS transparency rules ahead of entry into application of these rules in 2024.

Cooley,US Regulatory Agencies Launching Reviews of AI,"The extent to which the federal government will regulate artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in Washington, DC.

In September 2023, the US Senate held a closed-door forum , followed by another forum in October , with AI tech leaders.

In addition, the Biden-Harris administration has announced multiple initiatives involving AI, the most recent being a sweeping executive order on October 30 that addresses a wide range of issues such as AIs role in national security, public health, privacy, consumer fraud, worker protections and civil rights.

(More information about the executive order can be found in our October 31 client alert .)

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Regulators are hopeful that AI and machine learning will provide technical breakthroughs needed to fully optimize smart wireless networks.

As wireless spectrum becomes increasingly important in a 5G, always-connected world, tools such as AI-assisted spectrum sharing and real-time interference sensing may help maximize spectrum usage.

By encouraging the use of AI to operate wireless networks, regulators such as the FCC could have more flexibility to make important policy decisions on issues such as how to allocate spectrum between licensed and unlicensed uses, what interference criteria to adopt, and whether to institute receiver standards.

The FCC has not yet proposed rules that would mandate AI or machine learning in wireless networks, but the FCC is exploring how AI can be used.

The FCC began its inquiries with a joint workshop   The Opportunities and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence for Communications Networks and Consumers   with the National Science Foundation.

The workshop brought together academics, policymakers, and industry experts to discuss how the FCC and the telecom industry can use AI to optimize telecom networks and improve network resiliency.

The workshop also addressed how AI will make it more challenging for the FCC to protect consumers from harms such as illegal robocalls and robotexts and digital discrimination.

At the workshop, the FCC announced a spectrum notice of inquiry that focuses on how AI and other technologies can promote effective spectrum management  and identify new opportunities for innovation.

The spectrum notice asks questions about how to define spectrum usage and how technology can be harnessed to provide the FCC with the data it needs to improve spectrum management.

The spectrum notice will not result in new rules, but the FCC will use the proceeding to inform its policy decisions going forward.

Accordingly, parties with interests in wireless communications issues, including broadband infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, are monitoring the FCCs inquiry.

Comments on the spectrum notice were due on October 3 and reply comments were due November 2; interested parties may file their views with the FCC until the FCC takes action in the proceeding.

The FCC also has announced an inquiry to examine how AI can be used to protect consumers from unwanted robocalls and texts.

The FCCs messaging notice of inquiry will look at the privacy and safety challenges AI poses, as well as how AI can be used to block unwanted calls and protect telecommunications networks.

Interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on the FCCs proposals  comments are due on December 18, 2023, with reply comments due January 16, 2024.

Parties active in the messaging industry and parties that depend on automated texts or calls to reach consumers should monitor the proceeding.

The FCCs announcement of its intention to review robocall protections corresponds with an October 24 hearing in the US Senate , during which senators from both parties expressed frustration with current enforcement efforts against robocalls.

Comments filed in response to the FCCs notices will inform the FCCs next steps."
Cooley,US Regulatory Agencies Launching Reviews of AI,"Comments filed in response to the FCCs notices will inform the FCCs next steps.

In each case, the FCC likely will propose rules that are informed by the comments filed in response to the notices and industry participants will have an opportunity to comment on those proposals.

We cannot predict the timing of further FCC action, but the October 30 executive order encouraged the FCC to work with other government agencies to develop rules around the use of AI in telecommunications networks.

We believe these proceedings will be a priority for the FCC, and the FCC could adopt rules as early as the second half of 2024.

Parties interested in the FCCs proceedings should consider engaging with the regulators now, so their perspectives can be considered before new rules are in place.

Federal Election Commission (FEC) News reports of candidates and issue groups using AI to create misleading political ads have caused concerns for the 2024 election cycle.

In July, the advocacy group Public Citizen filed a petition with the FEC expressing concerns about the use of AI to create political ads.

Public Citizen argued that AI allows political actors to create deepfake audio or video clips that can deceive voters and harm the affected candidate, which violates the rule against fraudulent misrepresentation.

The Public Citizen petition, therefore, asked the FEC to clarify its rule on fraudulent misrepresentation to confirm that the rule applies to the use of AI to create deceptive campaign ads.

Mindful of the First Amendment issues that its request raises, Public Citizen does not ask the FEC to outright ban the use of AI in campaign communications.

Rather, Public Citizen urges the FEC to ban the use of deepfakes or similar communications where the purpose and effect are to deceive voters.

Comments on the Public Citizen proposal were due October 16, and proponents hope to have the new rules in place no later than early next year.

While the FEC commissioners unanimously voted to seek public comment on the Public Citizen petition, that does not mean the FEC will necessarily vote to adopt new rules at this time.

Indeed, two commissioners, Republican Allen Dickerson and Democrat Dara Lindenbaum, have questioned whether the FEC has the statutory authority to regulate AI, and they called on Congress to legislate on the topic.

Notably, there is legislation pending in Congress, the REAL Political Advertisements Act , that would give the FEC the authority to regulate AI.

The path forward for this bill is uncertain, given that it does not have bipartisan support.

Cooley,How Does the Latest Crackdown on Noncompete Agreements Affect US Employers?,"Noncompete agreements have come increasingly under attack at the federal and state level in 2023.

In this alert, we review notable recent developments on the legality of continuing to use noncompete agreements in the employment context.

Companies utilizing noncompete agreements in the US should confer with legal counsel to ensure that their practices remain in compliance with applicable law.

California 1.

Senate Bill 699 In September 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB 699 , which broadly expands the states already existing strong public policy against noncompetes, reflected in Business and Professions Code Section 16600 (providing that every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void).

Limited exceptions under the code permit noncompete agreements in the context of the sale of a business, dissolution of a partnership, or dissolution of, or termination of an interest in, a limited liability company.

SB 699, which is effective January 1, 2024, adds Section 16600.5 to the code and clarifies that existing law prohibits noncompetition covenants regardless of where or when the agreement was signed, even if the covenant was signed outside of the state.

An employer commits a civil violation for entering into or attempting to enforce a void noncompete.

Former and prospective employees now also have a private cause of action against any employer, and in addition to injunctive relief and actual damages, may recover attorneys fees and costs, if successful.

In drafting the new law, the Legislature noted that, as remote work has grown, employers outside of California have increasingly attempted to prevent the hiring of their former employees within California through the use of noncompete agreements.

Although California law has long prohibited noncompetes, out-of-state employers have sought to skirt that prohibition by asking non-California employees to sign noncompetes governed by the law of a different state, then seeking to enforce those agreements against former employees who subsequently start working for a competitor in California.

Thus, the law highlights the states interest in protecting the freedom of movement of persons whom California-based employers wish to employ to provide services in California, regardless of the persons state of residence, which the state deems paramount to competitive business interests.

Under this expansion, employers outside California would violate Section 16600.5 not only if they required a worker performing services in California to sign a noncompete, but also if a non-California employee who signed a noncompete moves to the state and begins working in California for the same employer or for a different employer  even if the noncompete was fully valid under the law of the state where the employee originally resided and worked.

The law spurs many questions that will need to be tested through the court system.

For example, it is unclear how SB 699 will interact with California Labor Code Section 925, which prohibits employers from requiring employees who primarily reside and work in California to agree to adjudicate claims outside of the state or deprive the employee of the substantive protection of California law, unless the employee was represented by legal counsel.

It is also unclear what effect a judgment secured outside of California enforcing a noncompete would have within the state.

SB 699 raises constitutional issues as well, including whether the law poses an undue burden on interstate commerce or impairs the obligation of contracts entered outside the state.

2. Assembly Bill 1076 Not to be outdone by SB 699, AB 1076 is the second significant noncompete bill to come out of this California legislative session and was signed by Newsom on October 13, 2023."
Cooley,How Does the Latest Crackdown on Noncompete Agreements Affect US Employers?,"2. Assembly Bill 1076 Not to be outdone by SB 699, AB 1076 is the second significant noncompete bill to come out of this California legislative session and was signed by Newsom on October 13, 2023.

This bill amends Section 16600 of the states Business and Professions Code to codify the California Supreme Courts holding in Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP, 44 Cal.

4th 939 (2008), and void the application of any noncompete agreement in an employment context, or any noncompete clause in an employment contract, no matter how narrowly tailored.

The law provides that Section 16600 should be read broadly, and it requires employers to notify any current or former employees who were employed after January 1, 2022, and have contracts containing a noncompete clause covered by Section 16600, that such noncompete clause is void.

The notice, which must be completed by February 14, 2024, must be written and delivered to the last known address and email address of the employee.

Failing to provide such notice constitutes a violation of the states Unfair Competition Law, which carries civil penalties.

This law also spurs many questions that will need to be tested through the court system, likely alongside SB 699.

For example, read literally, AB 1076 covers all employees everywhere, including where a noncompetition covenant is presently enforceable but theoretically could become unenforceable under SB 699 if an employee relocates to California.

Other pending legislation and agency enforcement FTCs proposed rule As we reported in a previous client alert , in January 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a proposed rule that would not only categorically ban noncompete agreements between employers and a broad class of workers, but also would require employers to rescind existing noncompete agreements and  like Californias AB 1076  notify current and former employees that those noncompete clauses are no longer in effect.

This sweeping proposed rule had received nearly 27,000 comments as of May 2023 , and is expected to be voted on in April 2024.

Proposed federal legislation Shortly after the publication of the FTCs proposed rule, on February 1, 2023, the Workforce Mobility Act of 2023 was introduced in the House.

Like the FTC rule, this proposed legislation would ban all noncompete agreements subject to limited exceptions.

To date, no further action has been taken on the bill.

New Yorks Senate Bill S3100A

In June 2023, New York passed its own proposed noncompete ban , which is on its way to the Gov. Kathy Hochuls desk for her signature.

If the law is signed, New York would be the fifth state in the country (following, most recently, Minnesota ) to ban noncompete agreements.

S3100A would add a new Section 191-d to the states labor law to prohibit employers from seeking or requiring entering into a noncompete agreement with anyone who is in a position of economic dependence on, and under an obligation to perform duties for, that other person.

Though unclear, this broad definition could be interpreted to include not just employees but also independent contractors.

The bill broadly defines a noncompete agreement as any agreement, or clause contained in any agreement, between an employer and a covered individual that prohibits or restricts such covered individual from obtaining employment, after the conclusion of employment with the employer included as a party to the agreement.

If signed, the law will be effective 30 days later and will affect agreements entered into on or after that date.

Certain agreements are exempted from this prohibition, provided that they do not otherwise restrict competition, including agreements that: Are for a fixed term of service with any covered individual.

Protect trade secrets and confidential and proprietary client information.

Prohibit solicitation of clients of the employer that the covered individual learned about during employment."
Cooley,How Does the Latest Crackdown on Noncompete Agreements Affect US Employers?,"Protect trade secrets and confidential and proprietary client information.

Prohibit solicitation of clients of the employer that the covered individual learned about during employment.

The law also provides for a private right of action against any employer who violates the law.

An employee must bring the action within two years of the later of: When the noncompete agreement was signed.

When the individual learns of the prohibited noncompete agreement.

When the employment relationship is terminated.

When the employer takes steps to enforce the noncompete agreement.

The court is empowered to order all relief, including an injunction, liquidated damages, lost compensation, damages, and reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

The bill leaves many questions unanswered.

For example, unlike the proposed FTC rule, S3100A does not directly address the permissibility of noncompetition agreements in the context of a sale of a business, or whether employers can continue to use garden leave and notice periods, or forfeiture for competition provisions.

Further, while the bill carves out certain exceptions, it does not address the permissibility of other kinds of nonsolicitation agreements, such as employee nonsolicitation clauses.

National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 1.

General counsels memo Following in the FTCs footsteps, on May 30, 2023, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer A. Abruzzo issued a memo asserting that the proffer, maintenance, and enforcement of noncompete provisions in employment contracts violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) Section 7, which guarantees employees the right to bargain collectively and engage in concerted activities, and Section 8(a)(1), which prohibits employers from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights.

In the memo, Abruzzo asserts that noncompetes chill employees from engaging in several types of protected Section 7 activity, including making a concerted threat to resign to demand better working conditions, and in soliciting co-workers to go to work for a local competitor as part of a broader course of protected concerted activity.

Abruzzo also noted that noncompetes must be narrowly tailored to special circumstances justifying the infringement on employee rights.

Although she did not provide any examples of such special circumstances, protecting legitimate business interests in proprietary/trade secret information must be addressed with narrowly tailored workplace agreements, and a mere desire to avoid noncompetition from former employees or to protect special investments in training employees is not sufficient.

Notably, Abruzzo stated that noncompetes may not be justified when they are imposed on low- or middle-wage workers.

Abruzzo ended the memo by encouraging all NLRB regions to seek make-whole relief for employees who can demonstrate they lost opportunities for other employment because of an overbroad noncompete, such as evidence of any adverse consequences, including specific employment opportunities employees lost because of the agreements.

While the memo does not have the force of law, it highlights the agencys enforcement priorities, and previews the types of arguments the NLRB may make in cases involving restrictive covenants.

Indeed, as highlighted in the Juvly lawsuit below, Abruzzos memo is already being used as a blueprint for the agencys enforcement efforts.

As a reminder, Abruzzos position does not apply to agreements with supervisors and managerial employees, or independent contractors, who are specifically excluded under the NLRA.

Lawsuit against Harper Holdings (d/b/a Juvly Aesthetics) As foreshadowed by the memo, on September 1, 2023, the regional director of the NLRB in Cincinnati, Ohio, issued a consolidated complaint against Harper Holdings, LCC d/b/a Juvly Aesthetics , alleging that Juvly maintained a series of unlawful policies and provisions, including noncompetes."
Cooley,How Does the Latest Crackdown on Noncompete Agreements Affect US Employers?,"The NLRB took issue with the following policies as violative of the NLRA:

A two-year noncompete for certain employees that restricted employees from practicing aesthetic medicine or having an ownership interest in, investing in, or providing services at any other medical practice within a 20-mile radius.

A two-year nonsolicitation clause prohibiting all employees from directly or indirectly soliciting or encouraging any person to leave employment, hiring any current or former employee, intentionally interfering with any relationship of the company or its affiliates or its employees, or enticing away from the company any contractor, adviser, employee, or another client of the company or its affiliates.

(The policy even prohibited departing employees from notifying clients of their departure or employment status, and former employees were required to pay $150,000 for every employee solicited away and $25,000 for every client solicited away, with interest for payments past due.)

A training repayment policy directing repayment of up to $105,000 for the cost of training and continuing education provided during employment, if the employee left within two years of being hired.

A confidentiality policy that prohibited employees from discussing salaries, bonuses and compensation packages, as well as employee-related information, to anyone outside the company and to each other.

An insubordination policy that prohibited workplace drama and provided that

[t]hreats, disparagement, or intimidation of management or other employees or malicious or disparaging statements concerning individuals within management, other employees, or [t]he [c]ompany constituted insubordination.

A nondisparagement policy prohibiting employees from making negative comments about the company during and after employment.

The NLRB seeks all just and proper relief, including rescission of the unlawful policies, training costs and make-whole monetary relief for the former employees.

The case is scheduled for a hearing on November 28, 2023.

What now?

Employers using noncompete agreements should think about taking the immediate steps outlined below.

1. Get back to basics.

Employers using noncompete agreements should re-evaluate and identify their goals for utilizing such agreements as a policy matter.

In this exercise, employers should identify the protectable interests justifying the need for the noncompete, whether it is trade secrets, confidential or sensitive information, intellectual property, customer or client lists, goodwill, or investments in employee training.

These categories of interests (and the positions most likely to involve access to them) need to be carefully articulated and defensible from a business perspective if the clause is challenged in court.

For example, the legitimate business interests applicable for a salesperson, which may include protecting existing relationships with customers or clients, may be different for an employee in a more technical role, which may include protecting confidential information and trade secrets.

Employers should ensure that the scope of a noncompete agreements restricted activities are actually necessary to protect those business interests.

2. Review and revise existing agreements.

Employers should carefully review and revise existing agreements for continuing developments, including those identified above.

Employers with California employees should carefully review their employment agreements for compliance with SB 699 and AB 1076 and issue compliant agreements moving forward.

Employers also should note that AB 1076 is retroactive  it affects existing agreements, as well as agreements imposed on former employees employed after January 1, 2022.

In addition, employers should consider the relevant pool of current and former employees to receive notice under AB 1076, while ensuring that the notice includes language that makes clear the company will not attempt to enforce the noncompete clause."
Cooley,How Does the Latest Crackdown on Noncompete Agreements Affect US Employers?,"Employers should immediately evaluate and create processes to handle the administrative and logistical challenges of providing notice to affected employees.

This process should include consideration of how voiding existing noncompetes, and/or not requiring noncompetes for some but not all employees moving forward, will impact employee morale in the workplace.

In some cases, employers with businesses relying on trade secrets should consider whether to continue doing business in California, including hiring employees in the state.

Where noncompetes are legal, employers may want to consider whether adjustments need to be made to such agreements, including limiting the duration, the range of employees required to sign a noncompete (such as excluding more junior employees or the low-wage workers identified by Abruzzo), and more carefully tailoring the scope of prohibited activity.

Employers should analyze whether individualized agreements may make sense for higher-level employees as well.

Employers can enhance the enforceability of their agreements by narrowly tailoring the noncompete.

3.

Adequately protect trade secret information.

Regardless of whether the pending legislation described above becomes law, trade secrets protection laws will continue to exist to protect legitimate trade secrets.

These laws include the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act and similar state laws prohibiting the misappropriation of trade secrets.

These laws can provide additional remedies including injunctive relief to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation, damages, and attorneys fees, in some cases.

In seeking protection under these laws, however, employers should note that they must have taken reasonable steps to keep such trade secret information secret.

These steps can include implementing comprehensive protective measures, such as: Proper policies, procedures, and training for employees on protecting and handling trade secrets (including adequate descriptions of company trade secrets).

Limiting access to such trade secrets to those with a legitimate need to know the information.

Protecting access to trade secret information by adequate security measures (i.e., password protection and encryption).

Processes to terminate access in the event an employee separates employment.

Adequately marking documents as confidential or as containing trade secrets.

4. Consider alternative restrictions.

Fortunately, much of the recent focus has been on noncompete covenants, which can be perceived as restricting a workers job mobility.

As the FTC noted in its proposed rule, other restrictive covenants such as nondisclosure agreements and client or customer nonsolicitation agreements are not included in its definition of a prohibited noncompete because they generally do not prevent a worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operating a business after the conclusion of the worker's employment with the employer.

Employers should thus consider utilizing less burdensome restrictions that remain legal and effective in protecting business interests.

Employers should reasonably tailor such clauses, however, to avoid them being construed as de facto noncompetes.

Employers with questions about the use of restrictive covenants, including compliance with the new California laws, should contact their Cooley employment lawyer."
Cooley,Biden Administration Issues Sweeping AI Executive Order,"On October 30, 2023, the Biden administration issued a long-awaited executive order (EO) on artificial intelligence (AI) .

The EO expands on previous AI initiatives, such as the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights , and lays out the most comprehensive set of directions to date for federal agencies and the largest AI developers.

The goal of the EO is to create a broad framework for responsible AI that can protect against potential harms without stifling innovation.

To that end, the EO instructs agencies to use regulatory and enforcement tools to address safety, privacy, discrimination, and collaboration with global AI regulatory efforts.

While the EO contains instructions to the various agencies and executive branch offices, it does not create new mandates.

Moreover, implementation of the EOs requirements takes place over various time frames  ranging from 90 days to 365 days from the date of signing  making it difficult to predict with specificity when guidance will be issued or regulations promulgated.

Also, many of the initiatives in the EO will require congressional action before taking effect.

Below, weve outlined the key elements to understanding the scope of the EO.

Cooley practitioners will be discussing these and other parts of the EO during our AI Talks webinar series .

AI safety and security The Department of Commerce, in coordination with other federal agencies, shall issue guidelines and best practices  with the aim of promoting consensus industry standards  for developing and deploying safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems.

Companies developing any foundation model that poses a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety must notify the federal government when training the model, and they must share the results of all red-team safety tests.

Beginning 90 days after the issuance of the EO and continuing at least annually, the head of each agency with relevant regulatory authority over critical infrastructure shall evaluate and provide to the secretary of homeland security an assessment of potential risks related to the use of AI in critical infrastructure sectors involved, with critical infrastructure defined in the EO as systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.

The Department of Commerce will develop guidance for content authentication and watermarking to clearly label AI-generated content, as well as establish standards and best practices for detecting AI-generated content and authenticating official content.
    

The National Security Council and White House chief of staff will develop a national security memorandum that directs further actions on AI and security.

Privacy Agencies shall use available policy and technical tools, including privacy-enhancing technologies where appropriate, to protect privacy and to combat the broader legal and societal risks  including the chilling of First Amendment rights  that result from the improper collection and use of peoples data.

Independent regulatory agencies are encouraged to use their full range of authorities, including issuing new regulations to protect American consumers from threats to their privacy.

Through the EO, the president calls on Congress to pass bipartisan data privacy legislation to protect all Americans, especially children.

Equity and civil rights Agencies are to address algorithmic discrimination through training, technical assistance, and coordination between the Department of Justice and federal civil rights offices on best practices for investigating and prosecuting civil rights violations related to AI."
Cooley,Biden Administration Issues Sweeping AI Executive Order,"Agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Labor shall use their respective civil rights and civil liberties offices and authorities to prevent and address unlawful discrimination, as well as other harms that result from uses of AI in federal government programs and benefits administration.

The Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies shall ensure fairness throughout the criminal justice system by developing best practices on the use of AI in sentencing, parole and probation, pretrial release and detention, risk assessments, surveillance, crime forecasting and predictive policing, and forensic analysis.

Healthcare and education The Department of Health and Human Services will develop a strategic plan that includes policies and frameworks  possibly including regulatory action to ensure responsible use of AI in healthcare, including drug development.

The Department of Health and Human Services will also establish a safety program to receive reports of  and act to remedy  harms or unsafe healthcare practices involving AI.

The federal government will provide resources to support educators deploying AI-enabled educational tools, such as personalized tutoring in schools.

Workplace fairness The Department of Labor is directed to addressing job displacement, labor standards, workplace equity, health and safety, and data collection.

The chair of the Council of Economic Advisers shall prepare a report on AIs potential labor-market impacts, and study and identify options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions.

Innovation and competition The under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and the director of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) shall publish guidance to USPTO patent examiners and applicants addressing inventorship and the use of AI  which includes generative AI  in the inventive process, with illustrative examples in which AI systems play different roles in inventive processes and how, in each example, inventorship issues ought to be analyzed.

After the US Copyright Office of the Library of Congress publishes its forthcoming AI study that will address copyright issues raised by AI, the under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and USPTO director shall consult with the director of the US Copyright Office and issue recommendations to the president on potential executive actions relating to copyright and AI.

To stop unlawful collusion, prevent dominant firms from disadvantaging competitors, and ensure that consumers and workers are protected from harms that may be enabled by the use of AI, the EO encourages the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether to exercise its existing authorities, including its rulemaking authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

The National Science Foundation shall launch a pilot of the National AI Research Resource  a tool that will provide AI researchers and students access to key AI resources and data to foster public-private collaboration.

Federal government use and procurement of AI The director of the Office of Management and Budget shall convene and chair an interagency council to coordinate the development and use of AI in agencies programs and operations.

The heads of each agency shall implement or increase the use of existing training and familiarization programs with the goal of acquiring specified AI products and services faster, more cheaply, and more effectively through more rapid and efficient contracting.

International collaboration The State Department, in collaboration with the Commerce Department, will lead an effort to establish robust international frameworks for harnessing AIs benefits  and managing its risks and ensuring safety.

Cooley will monitor the implementation of this EO.

Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules: What Investors Need To Know,"On October 10, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted amendments to Regulation 13D  G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), which govern the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of a person acquiring more than 5% beneficial ownership of a voting class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

Most significantly, the amendments impact initial filing deadlines for Schedules 13D and 13G, as well as amendments to those schedules.

The SEC also provided guidance on current legal standards related to beneficial ownership reporting  including with respect to the treatment of cash-settled derivative instruments and the circumstances in which a group may be considered to exist under the beneficial ownership rules.

In this alert, we summarize these amendments and provide practical takeaways for investors to consider when updating beneficial ownership reporting processes and timelines.

Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act require that beneficial owners of more than 5% of a voting class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act report their beneficial ownership on a Schedule 13D or, if eligible, a short-form Schedule 13G. Rule 13d-3(a) of the Exchange Act provides that a beneficial owner includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise has or shares voting or investment power.

This includes the right to acquire shares of a voting class of registered equity securities upon conversion or exercise of other securities  such as preferred stock, promissory notes, warrants or options.

Pursuant to SEC rules, more than one person can be considered to beneficially own the same securities.

For example, in the fund context, shares held by a fund are generally considered to be owned by the fund and the funds general partner entity (and, depending on the circumstances, possibly the managers of the general partner).

There are generally four types of filers of beneficial ownership reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act: Schedule 13D (Rule 13d-1(a)).

Any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a voting class of registered equity securities is required to file a statement on Schedule 13D, unless the filer is eligible to file a Schedule 13G. Schedule 13G Qualified institutional investors (Rule 13d-1(b)).

Certain qualified institutional investors (QIIs)  such as registered broker-dealers, banks, registered investment advisers, registered investment companies and insurance companies  may report their beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, provided that the institution has acquired shares in the ordinary course of business and without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the company.

Passive investors (Rule 13d-1(c)).

Certain investors who otherwise do not qualify as QIIs may report their beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G, provided that the investor beneficially owns less than 20% of a voting class of registered equity securities and has not acquired such shares with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the company.

Generally, in the eyes of the SEC, a fund with an individual serving on the board of a portfolio company is considered to be ineligible to file on Schedule 13G as a passive investor.

Exempt investors (Rule 13d-1(d)).

This refers to a category of investors who may make their initial filing on Schedule 13G to report that their beneficial ownership exceeds 5% of a voting class of registered equity securities."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules: What Investors Need To Know,"This refers to a category of investors who may make their initial filing on Schedule 13G to report that their beneficial ownership exceeds 5% of a voting class of registered equity securities.

This category includes investors who acquired their beneficial ownership prior to the company registering such class of securities  such as founders and pre-initial public offering (IPO) investors, investors who have not acquired 2% or more of the outstanding covered class of securities within a consecutive 12-month period, and investors whose beneficial ownership increased to more than 5% of a covered class because of company share repurchases or other company transactions.

Determining which of these filings applies to an investors holdings of a particular portfolio company can be very fact-specific and nuanced.

Accordingly, an investor that beneficially owns more than 5% of a voting class of registered equity securities should consult outside counsel to confirm the appropriate Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G filing status.

Key aspects of the new rules  including changes to the filing deadlines for initial and amended Schedules 13D and 13G  are described in further detail below.

Background The SEC adopted the amendments to Regulation 13D  G, particularly, the acceleration of the filing deadlines to report beneficial ownership disclosure on initial and amended Schedules 13D and 13G, in response to long-standing calls from market participants to modernize the beneficial ownership reporting rules, considering technological advances and changes in the financial markets.

The amended rules will require investors to implement and/or redesign systems that permit them to closely monitor their beneficial ownership and initiate drafts and supporting documentation of initial and amended filings more promptly.

Although the SEC recognized that the amended rules may impose challenges for certain smaller investors, in adopting the rule changes, the SEC concluded that a modernization of the reporting regime was important to improve the operation and efficacy of beneficial ownership reporting to reduce information asymmetries in the market for investor protection.

Summary of changes to filing deadlines for Schedules 13D and 13G As a general matter, the rule changes accelerate the filing deadlines for investors filing Schedules 13D and 13G, as well as amendments to those filings.

The current and amended filing requirements for Schedules 13D and 13G are summarized in the following table:

Filing Current filing deadlines Amended filing deadlines Schedule 13D Rule 13d-1(a), (e), (f) and (g); Rule 13d-2(a) Initial filing 10 calendar days after acquiring more than 5% of beneficial ownership or losing eligibility to file on Schedule 13G 5 business days after acquiring more than 5% of beneficial ownership or losing eligibility to file on Schedule 13G Amended filings Promptly after the date on which a material change occurs 2 business days after the date on which a material change occurs Schedule 13G Qualified institutional investors (QIIs) Rule 13d-1(b); Rule 13d-2(b) and (c) Initial filing 45 calendar days after the end of the calendar year in which beneficial ownership exceeds 5% at year-end; 10 calendar days after the end of the first month in which beneficial ownership exceeds 10% at month-end 45 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter in which beneficial ownership exceeds 5% at quarter-end; 5 business days after the end of the first month in which beneficial ownership exceeds 10% at month-end Amended filings Annual amendment : 45 days after the end of the calendar year in which any change occurred (not including changes in percentage ownership due to fluctuations in number of shares outstanding)"

Key takeaways on the amendments to Regulation 13D  G Schedule 13D Investors must be mindful of whether a transaction will trigger an amended filing.

Historically, Schedule 13D filers have often taken liberties in interpreting the meaning of the term promptly when filing amendments, generally without significant consequence.

Under amended Rule 13d-2(a), the precision of the two-business day requirement will make adherence to the timeliness of Schedule 13D amendments a priority.

For example, Rule 13d-2(a) provides that the acquisition or disposition of a number of shares exceeding 1% of the outstanding registered class of security is considered per se material, thereby triggering an amendment to a Schedule 13D.

However, in practice, it has not been uncommon for investors, particularly venture funds, triggering such amended filings to allow several days to elapse before filing the required amendment.

As filers embark on transactions including open-market purchases or sales and distributions in kind  it will be critically important to closely monitor the quantity of shares being acquired or disposed of and be prepared to file an amended Schedule 13D within the two-business day deadline.

This could be especially challenging in the event of transactions effected pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, given that investors do not control the timing of such transactions."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules: What Investors Need To Know,"This could be especially challenging in the event of transactions effected pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, given that investors do not control the timing of such transactions.

For funds utilizing Rule 10b5-1 trading or distribution plans, the parameters of those plans will need to be closely monitored to ensure that the fund is prepared to file any required Schedule 13D amendment within two business days of any material change in previously reported information.

Schedule 13G Funds will have to adjust their quarter-end regulatory processes to also reflect beneficial ownership reporting.

The rule changes to Schedule 13G filers are likely to have a more profound impact on funds.

What has historically largely been an annual exercise for funds  taking place between December 31 and February 14  will now transition to a quarterly exercise.

Many funds are already required to report certain ownership positions on a quarterly basis through the filing of Form 13Fs or potentially amend their large trader reports through Form 13H filings, which are subject to amendment on a quarterly basis.

For those funds, the new Schedule 13G rules will likely be folded into their existing quarter-end regulatory process for Form 13F and/or Form 13H.

For other funds not currently subject to these filing regimes, the rule changes to Schedule 13G will likely require the establishment of a new process to identify potential Schedule 13G filing triggering events on a quarterly basis.

The introduction of a materiality concept to the amended Schedule 13G filing requirements will require all funds to establish a new process for assessing the materiality of developments, including transactions effected in the covered class of securities, in order to determine whether an amendment has been triggered.

For example, when a fund engages in a transaction involving public company securities, the fund will need to promptly make a preliminary assessment of the materiality of the transaction to determine whether it  either alone or in combination with other changes that were previously determined to be immaterial  constitutes a material change.

If it is determined that a material change has occurred, the fund should be prepared to make a required filing at the end of the relevant quarter.

Determination of whether a change is material will be heavily fact-dependent and potentially subject to second-guessing with the benefit of hindsight.

Accordingly, funds should not wait until the end of the quarter to begin the process of assessing whether amendments are required, and they should consider consulting outside counsel to assist in this assessment.

The SEC clarified in the adopting release that the rules governing amended Schedules 13D and 13G will now share the same materiality standard for determining when an amendment is triggered.

As a result, the SEC stated that the Schedule 13D amendment trigger relating to any acquisitions or dispositions of 1% or more of the outstanding class of securities is equally instructive for Schedule 13G purposes.

New guidance and rules on cash-settled derivative securities Generally, the holder of a cash-settled derivative security has historically not been considered to beneficially own the reference equity securities of the derivative position in the absence of an agreement or understanding with the counterpartys respect to the voting or disposition of such reference equity securities.

In response to concerns that holders of certain cash-settled derivative securities could exert indirect influence over an issuer via a counterparty to a derivative transaction, the SEC proposed amending Rule 13d-3(e) to provide that any person with a control purpose that held cash-settled derivatives (other than security-based swaps) would be deemed to beneficially own the reference equity securities of the derivative position."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules: What Investors Need To Know,"After reviewing the comments received on the proposed amendments, rather than adopting rule changes, the SEC elected to issue guidance to clarify the circumstances under which a holder of cash-settled derivative securities (other than security-based swaps) could be viewed as beneficially owning the reference equity securities.

In developing its guidance, the SEC adopted an analysis similar to the guidance it had previously provided with respect to security-based swaps.

1

Under the SECs guidance, a holder of a cash-settled derivative security may be deemed the beneficial owner of the reference equity securities if: The derivative security provides its holder, directly or indirectly, with exclusive or shared voting or investment power over the reference equity security through a contractual term of the derivative security or otherwise.

The derivative security is acquired with the purpose or effect of divesting itself of beneficial ownership of the reference equity security or preventing the vesting of that beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of Sections 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act The holder has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the reference equity security within 60 days or acquires the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the reference equity security with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the company, regardless of when the right is exercisable.

2

In addition to the above guidance, the SEC also adopted amendments to the text of Item 6 of Schedule 13D to expressly state that interests in all derivative securities, including cash-settled derivative securities, relating to the covered class of registered equity securities must be disclosed.

No similar disclosure requirement exists with respect to cash-settled derivatives for filers of Schedule 13G. Key takeaways on SEC guidance for cash-settled derivative securities Funds should carefully evaluate the terms of their derivative securities.

In recent years, venture funds have with increasing frequency acquired cash-settled derivative securities, including total return swaps, as a means of gaining additional economic exposure to portfolio companies.

The SECs guidance will require funds to evaluate whether the investment in cash-settled derivatives will be considered beneficial ownership of the underlying reference security.

To reduce the risk that such arrangements would result in the fund being deemed to beneficially own the reference security, a fund investing in a cash-settled derivative should ensure that the derivative security does not provide the fund with the right to settle the derivative in stock.

In addition, funds also should be clear not to take any actions that would influence the counterpartys voting or disposition of the securities that it may acquire to hedge its economic exposure.

New guidance and rules on formation of a group Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) of the Exchange Act state that a group is formed when two or more persons act as a group for purposes of acquiring, holding or disposing of company securities.

Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act states that a group is formed when two or more persons agree to act together for purposes of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of company securities.

The purpose of the group rules is to treat investors who act together as a single person under the beneficial ownership rules, thereby requiring such investors to file reports on Schedules 13D or 13G when they collectively beneficially own in excess of 5% of a registered class of equity security.

Without this concept, multiple investors could work together to achieve control of public companies without public disclosures, thereby frustrating the policy of the SECs beneficial ownership rules."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules: What Investors Need To Know,"Without this concept, multiple investors could work together to achieve control of public companies without public disclosures, thereby frustrating the policy of the SECs beneficial ownership rules.

In response to questions regarding whether the coordinated behavior of investors  even in the absence of an agreement among investors to do so  could, in certain circumstances, constitute a group, the SEC proposed amendments to Rule 13d-5(b) to codify its view that the existence of a group is based on facts and circumstances and not merely on the presence or absence of an express agreement among investors to act together.

Although the SEC declined to codify the definition of a group as proposed, it issued guidance in the adopting release reiterating its views that the relevant legal standard for determining the existence of a group remains rooted in Sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3), which do not require express agreements among investors, notwithstanding the language in Rule 13d-5 that refers to an agreement.

Under the guidance, circumstances that may suggest the formation of a group include informal arrangements or concerted actions by two or more persons in furtherance of a common purpose to acquire, hold or dispose of company securities.

Importantly, the SECs guidance highlights that the determination is based on an analysis of all the relevant facts and circumstances and not solely on the presence or absence of an express agreement.

During the comment period on the proposed rule, many commenters expressed concerns regarding the ability of investors to engage in ordinary course discussions with management and other investors, including activists, regarding company policies.

To  address concerns raised in these comments, the SEC provided a helpful nonexhaustive list of common types of shareholder engagement activities that  without more  will not amount to the formation of a group.

As part of the amendments, the SEC did approve rule changes to clarify that any acquisition of beneficial ownership by a group member after the date of group formation is an acquisition of beneficial ownership by the group, and that intra-group transfers of securities by group members do not constitute an acquisition of beneficial ownership by the group.

Key takeaways on SEC guidance regarding formation of a group Funds should evaluate internal processes and controls with respect to shareholder communications.

It is not uncommon for funds to engage, from time to time, in discussions with other shareholders of a portfolio company  particularly in the context of a potential strategic transaction involving the company.

As a general matter, funds should exercise caution when engaging in such discussions to reduce the likelihood that the fund will be considered to have formed a group with other investors.

These risks are heightened when the discussions with other investors relate to the acquisition, disposition, holding or voting of equity securities of the portfolio company.

If the facts and circumstances of such communications are determined to create a group, it could trigger Section 13 filing or reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and potentially expose the fund to risk of liability for short-swing profits under Section 16.

If a fund determines that engaging in such communications is nevertheless appropriate, it should be clear that any such communications are for discussion purposes only.

Additionally, care should be taken to not express any agreement or coordination with respect to the acquisition, disposition, holding or voting of equity securities.

Funds also should avoid communicating to other investors any decision with respect to such matters to reduce the risk that the investors will be considered to be involved in concerted action that would constitute formation of a group."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments to Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rules: What Investors Need To Know,"Impact on investors What investors should do now The amendments and guidance demonstrate the importance that the SEC is placing on Section 13 beneficial ownership filing requirements.

These requirements can be quite complex  including determination of whether a fund is required to file a Schedule 13D or is permitted to file a Schedule 13G.

Moreover, depending on the circumstances, investors filing a Schedule 13G may be subject to differing amendment requirements.

Finally, in certain circumstances, funds may have the ability to switch between Schedule 13D and  

Schedule 13G.

The amended rules and guidance are very nuanced, and subtle differences in facts can often trigger very different filing and disclosure requirements.

Accordingly, investors are well advised to consult outside counsel with respect to these matters and should consult outside counsel well in advance of any portfolio company going public  whether that be via the traditional IPO process, de-SPAC transaction, reverse acquisition or direct listing.

Investors should take the following actions now: Take time to understand the new filing deadlines and guidance regarding derivative securities.

Investors should familiarize themselves with the beneficial ownership reporting regime and ensure they understand how the current rules operate, along with understanding the implications of the recently adopted rule changes.

Funds should take extra care to evaluate their current portfolio of public company securities to understand, for each portfolio company for which the fund files a Schedule 13G, whether the fund is filing the Schedule 13G as a QII, passive investor or exempt investor, along with the applicable amendment triggers.

Review internal processes and controls governing transactions.

Investors should consult with their investment team to ensure they have processes in place to monitor and, where possible, anticipate future transactions that could trigger filing requirements.

Develop a plan to meet the new filing deadlines.

Investors should develop or, as necessary, enhance the funds processes for coordinating with outside counsel for the preparation and timely submission of required filings.

For example, investors who file on Schedule 13G will now need to consider whether an amendment is required on a quarterly basis rather than annually.

Be thoughtful about shareholder engagement activities.

Investors should consult with outside counsel prior to engaging in meaningful shareholder engagement activities to avoid potentially taking steps that may be deemed, in hindsight, to constitute coordinated action in furtherance of a common purpose to acquire, hold or dispose of a companys securities  thus resulting in formation of a group.

Administrative rule changes Extended EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) filing deadlines In connection with the accelerated filing deadlines, the amendments extend the end of the filing day for Schedules 13D and 13G from 5:30 pm to 10:00 pm ET, thus aligning Section 13 filings with the approach that has been in place for Section 16 filings for many years.

In light of the accelerated deadlines for Section 13 filings under the amended rules, this change will be a welcome accommodation for investors.

Structured data requirements Effective December 18, 2024, Schedules 13D and 13G must be filed using an XML-based language.

This requirement applies to all disclosures (other than exhibits)  including quantitative disclosures, textual narratives and identification checkboxes  and will be a significant adjustment, given that the process will likely require more involvement from third parties (e.g., financial printers) experienced in tagging such information and compress the timeline for investors to comply with accelerated filing requirements.

Compliance dates The adopted amendments will become effective 90 days after publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register."

Cooley,UK AI Safety Summit 2023: What To Expect,"On 1 and 2 November 2023, the UK government will host world leaders, experts and leading technology companies at the first global AI Safety Summit .

The UK governments aim is to facilitate a critical global conversation on artificial intelligence (AI) and encourage a global coordinated approach to AI safety.

Focus and objectives With a focus on the serious misuse of AI, the summit will cover two types of AI systems based on the risks they may pose: Frontier AI: highly capable, multipurpose AI models (e.g., foundation models) that match or exceed the capabilities present in todays most advanced models  and pose significant risks associated with misuse, unpredictable advances and loss of control over the technology.

Narrow AI:

AI designed for a specific task with potentially dangerous capabilities  such as bioengineering AI models that could be used to develop bioweapons.

The UK government highlighted five key objectives for the summit: Build a shared understanding of the risks posed by frontier AI and the need for action.

Initiate a forward process for international collaboration on frontier AI safety, including how best to support national and international frameworks Propose appropriate measures which individual organisations should take to increase frontier AI safety.

Identify areas for potential collaboration on AI safety research, including evaluating model capabilities and the development of new standards to support governance.

Showcase how ensuring the safe development of AI will enable AI to be used for good globally.

Although two types of AI systems are expected to be covered as set out above, based on published government materials, the focal point is clearly frontier AI.

Agenda On day 1, attendees of the summit are expected to weigh in on the novel challenges and risks posed by recent and next-generation frontier AI models, as well as measures to combat misuse by bad actors.

Discussions also are expected to touch on topics such as the direction of AI development and how frontier AI developers can scale responsibly.

Day 2 is set to see a smaller group discussion among governments, companies and experts on measures to address the risks in emerging AI technology.

See the proposed agenda for more details.

How might this impact the UKs approach to regulating AI?

In March 2023, the UK government issued a policy paper detailing its pro-innovation approach to regulating AI .

The policy paper sets out a principles-based strategy whereby existing sector-specific regulators use existing laws to implement principles such as safety, fairness and accountability.

Despite this light-touch strategy and the summits apparent focus on high-risk models only, it may be the case that the summit will drive the UK toward some form of specific domestic regulation, whether focused on frontier AI models only or more widely applicable.

Indeed, calls for regulation from industry leaders  and the imminent arrival of the European Unions AI Act  may put additional pressure on the UK to reflect on its domestic policies.

Alternatively, it may be that the UK will successfully find a role as a bridge between the EUs rules-based approach (embedded in the EU AI Act) and the decentralised approach of other nations, such as the US.

In any case, with varying perspectives across the globe, it will not be easy to achieve a consensus on the direction of AI safety and regulation, and it will be interesting to see how the conversation unfolds.

We will publish an overview of the key outcomes of the UK AI Safety Summit after it has taken place.

Cooley,CFPB Proposes Financial Data and Open Banking Rule,"On October 19, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act .

Section 1033 of Dodd-Frank requires covered persons to make information concerning a financial product or service that a consumer has obtained from such person available to the consumer, subject to rules implemented by the bureau.

The proposed rule would require that certain financial institutions, card issuers and other payment facilitation providers make consumer data  including transaction data  more readily available to consumers and authorized third parties.

It also would place consumer protection obligations on these entities, as well as on third parties authorized to collect and use that data.

Who would be required to provide data under the rule?

The proposed rule would apply to data providers  generally, financial institutions that offer consumer deposit accounts subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), credit card issuers subject to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and entities that offer related payment facilitation products and services.

As a result, most banks would be covered, as would digital wallet providers and neobanks.

Entities without consumer-facing digital banking interfaces, as of the rules compliance date, would be excluded from coverage.

What data would be covered by the rule?

Under the proposal, data providers would be responsible for providing consumer and authorized third-party access to covered data, which would include 24 months of transaction data, certain account information (e.g., account balance, upcoming bills, basic account verification), information to initiate payment to and from accounts, and the terms and conditions under which the account or card was provided (e.g., APR, reward program terms, etc.).

Confidential commercial information, information collected solely to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other unlawful conduct, information required by law to be kept confidential, and information that cannot be retrieved in the ordinary course of business would not be subject to the rules requirements.

How would data providers be obligated to make covered data available?

The proposal would require that data providers maintain consumer interfaces and establish and maintain developer interfaces to allow consumer and third-party access to data.

The proposed rule would prohibit data providers from imposing any fees or charges on consumers or authorized third parties for establishing and maintaining  or making data available through  the interfaces.

It also would require providers to publicly disclose (e.g., on a website) developer interface and contact information to facilitate access and provide a method to address questions.

Importantly, with respect to their developer interfaces, the proposed rule also would require that data providers: Not rely on screen scraping  a technology that leverages consumer credentials to log into accounts to retrieve data, meaning such interfaces would likely take the form of application program interfaces (APIs).

Make covered data available in a standardized format based on qualified industry standards, or in a format widely used by the developer interfaces of other similarly situated data providers with respect to similar data and [that] is readily usable by authorized third parties.

Make data available, through such interfaces, after obtaining information sufficient to authenticate the third party and consumer, confirming that the third party has obtained consumer authorization and verifying the scope of the data request.

Not unreasonably restrict the frequency with which they accept and respond to data requests.

Ensure their developer interfaces perform at a commercially reasonable level  including that such interfaces have a data access request response rate, calculated consistent with the rule, of at least 99.5%."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Financial Data and Open Banking Rule,"Apply an information security program to the interface that complies with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or, if not subject to the GLBA, the information security program requirements of the Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) Safeguards Rule.

What obligations would be imposed on third parties authorized to access and collect consumers data?

The proposed rule would require authorized third parties to implement safeguards around the collection, use and retention of such data.

In order to access consumers covered data, the proposed rule would, for example, require authorized third parties to: Provide the consumer with a comprehensive authorization disclosure.

Certify to the consumer  within the authorization disclosure  that the third party agrees to limit the collection, use and retention of covered data, and apply to that collection, use and retention a GLBA-compliant information security program or, if not subject to the GLBA, the information security requirements of the FTC Safeguards Rule.

Obtain the consumers express informed consent to key terms of access through a signed authorization disclosure, either electronically or in writing.

Provide the consumer with a signed copy or otherwise agreed to copy of the authorization disclosure and the third partys contact information in case of any questions.

As reflected by the certification requirement identified above, the proposed rule would only permit third parties to collect, use and retain data as reasonably necessary to provide the consumer with the requested product or service.

Third parties would therefore be prohibited from using data for most other purposes, including for targeted advertising, cross-selling products or services, or sale to data brokers.

Additional limitations on authorized third parties include a requirement to obtain reauthorization from consumers to continue to collect data after one year.

Third parties that fail to obtain reauthorization would be required to delete previously collected data unless that data is reasonably necessary to provide the product or service requested by the consumer.

What role do data aggregators play  and what obligations do they have  with respect to the collection of covered data?

The proposed rule also would allow third parties to use data aggregators to access covered data, subject to disclosure and certification requirements.

The authorization disclosure presented by a third party to the consumer would need to identify any aggregators used by the third party.

Like authorized third parties, data aggregators also would need to certify to the consumer  either as part of the authorized third partys disclosure or separately  that they agree to comply with the rules data access conditions and restrictions.

The authorized third party, however, would ultimately be responsible for compliance with the proposed rules authorization procedures.

Looking ahead CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated that the proposed rule is meant to accelerate much-needed competition and decentralization in banking and consumer finance while at the same time providing strong data protections to prevent misuse and abuse of personal financial data.

This commentary, and the rule itself, align with the continued CFPB refrain to industry about the consumer benefits of increasing competition within the banking markets while ensuring robust controls in protecting consumer data.

This includes commitments from the CFPB to pursue insufficient data protection or security as a violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Acts prohibition on unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.

Indeed, the press release accompanying the proposed rule adopts the same aggressive tone the industry has come to expect from the CFPB, with references to eliminating data hoarding and empowering consumers to access information absent junk fees."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Financial Data and Open Banking Rule,"The rule also establishes clear record requirements designed to facilitate supervision and enforcement of compliance with the rule not just by the CFPB, but also by Federal and State banking regulators, State attorneys general, and other government agencies that supervise data providers.

Entities that come within the scope of the proposed rule should take note and begin to evaluate how it might impact their processes.

For example, entities that the rule would treat as authorized third parties may want to consider the potential implications of needing to align their information security practices to the FTCs Safeguards Rule if not subject to the GLBA.

Those entities currently outside the scope of the proposed rule should also pay attention.

As highlighted in the press release, this is just the first proposal to implement Section 1033.

The CFPB intends to cover additional products and services in future rulemaking.

To that end, the CFPB is seeking comment on whether electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, otherwise exempt from EFTA coverage, should be included in the scope of the proposed rule and also whether historical information should be made available for more categories of covered data.

In terms of next steps, comments on the proposed rule are due on or before December 29, 2023.

The bureau stated that it will seek to finalize the rule by fall 2024.

Please join us for a webinar to discuss the latest updates concerning the CFPB's proposed open banking rule.

Cooley,European Patent Office Makes Major Changes in Priority Entitlement,"The Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO) has issued a new dual decision  G1/22 and G2/22  dealing with the assessment of priority rights at the EPO.

The decision represents a significant break from the previous practice of the EPO and seems to adopt a much more pro-applicant/patentee approach when assessing these rights and their effects on European patents and patent applications.

In particular, the onus on the applicant to demonstrate their right to claim priority has been greatly reduced, with the threshold for opponents attacking this right in opposition proceedings now significantly higher.

The two key questions answered by the Enlarged Board of Appeal are: Is the EPO competent to assess whether a party is entitled to claim priority under Article 87(1) of the European Patent Convention (EPC)?

If question 1 is answered in the affirmative, can party B validly rely on the priority right claimed in a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application for the purpose of claiming priority rights under Article 87(1) EPC in a case where: A PCT application designates party A as applicant for the US only and party B as applicant for other designated states, including regional European patent protections.

The PCT application claims priority from an earlier patent application that designates party A as the applicant.

The priority claimed in the PCT application is in compliance with Article 4 of the Paris Convention.

In summary, the boards answer to both questions is an emphatic yes .

In more detail, referring to the first question, the board drew a clear distinction between competency to decide a dispute as to whether a particular applicant is legally entitled to apply for and be granted a European patent in respect of the subject-matter of a particular application, where national courts are competent, and priority rights, where the board held that no national laws are involved when a priority right is created or claimed for a subsequent application.

The board further reasoned that if the EPO was not competent to assess priority rights under its own law (i.e., not applying national law), then situations could arise in which the EPO has evidence potentially affecting the patentability of an invention but cannot use such evidence in its decision on patentability.

This stems from the effect a valid priority right has on the assessment of prior art and is, evidently, a situation which is desirable to avoid.

This scenario also is clearly distinct from entitlement proceedings, where the EPO is not competent, as the EPOs assessment of patentability of the invention, and the prior art, should not be affected by the identity of the applicant (in part because the EPO does not provide carte blanche grace periods).

Accordingly, the board has decided that the EPO is competent to determine whether a priority right is validly claimed  i.e., whether a party is the successor in title required by the EPC  and that this assessment should be made using its own law and not the national law of the relevant member states.

Furthermore, the board has decided that the autonomous law of the EPC should not establish higher formal requirements than those established under national laws that may be relevant in the context of a European application, and moreover that the EPO should adapt itself to the lowest standards established under national laws and accept informal or tacit transfers of priority rights under almost any circumstances.

That the transfer of a priority right should not need to meet the same threshold as the EPO requires for the assignment of a European application (i.e., in writing and signed by both parties) is directly stated: [T]he autonomous law of the EPC should not require that the assignment of priority rights has to be in writing and/or has to be signed by or on behalf of the parties to the transaction."
Cooley,European Patent Office Makes Major Changes in Priority Entitlement,"Indeed, the boards decision even implies another change from the practice, to date, that the transfer of priority rights must have occurred prior to the filing date of the European application, providing the rationale that [i]f there are jurisdictions that allow an ex post (nunc pro tunc) transfer of priority rights  the EPO should not apply higher standards.

It is cautioned, however, that the allowability of a retroactive transfer of priority rights may have limited practical relevance if priority entitlement is presumed to exist on the date on which priority is claimed for the subsequent European application.

That said, it is possible to add a priority claim to a European patent application 16 months from the earliest priority date, so there is  theoretically  a situation where an ex post transfer could be applied, though we expect the first cases to do so to be brought under significant scrutiny by third parties, although their ability to do so has been curtailed.

In line with the boards new permissive approach to the transfer of priority rights, this rebuttable presumption that the priority claim is valid involves the reversal of the burden of proof, i.e. the party challenging the subsequent applicants entitlement to priority has to prove that this entitlement is missing.

This means that  for example, in opposition proceedings  an opponent cannot just raise speculative doubts but must demonstrate that specific facts support serious doubts about the subsequent applicants entitlement to priority.

This higher burden on opponents, along with the more relaxed stance of the EPO, seems likely to reduce EPO proceedings  such as oppositions  where the validity of a priority claim on the basis of the patentees entitlement to claim priority is put to issue.

It is important to note, however, that national courts will still have jurisdiction over granted European patents and are not beholden to the EPOs approach or decisions.

Thus, third parties are not necessarily prevented from raising this issue in national proceedings where a more stringent test might be applied.

Referring to the second question, it is perhaps unsurprising that the application of the answer to the first question has led to the board agreeing with the referring decision that the mutual filing demonstrates  absent indications to the contrary  the existence of an implicit agreement between party A and party B, conferring party B the right to benefit from the priority for the EPC territory.

In order for this implied agreement to be questioned, the board considered that evidence would be needed that an agreement on the use of the priority right has not been reached or is fundamentally flawed.

Situations such as those seen with pre-America Invents Act (AIA), US-originating PCT applications  where the US provisional priority filing is filed in the names of the inventors and the resulting PCT application designates the inventors as applicants for the US where, for example, their employer is the applicant elsewhere  appear to be officially resolved at the EPO for now.

Takeaway Ultimately, the position adopted by the Enlarged Board of Appeal in response to the two questions at issue represents a significant softening of the EPOs historically strict position on the assessment of priority.

Whether this change in attitudes will be reflected in the courts of the EPOs member states in the future  or whether applicants will potentially remain beholden to the EPOs previous approach if they wish to enforce patent rights nationally  remains to be seen."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – October One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts amendments to beneficial ownership rules On October 10, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had adopted final rules governing beneficial ownership reporting under Exchange Act Sections 13(d) and 13(g).

The final rules will: For Schedule 13D, shorten the initial filing deadline from 10 days to five business days and require that amendments be filed within two business days.

For certain Schedule 13G filers (i.e., for qualified institutional investors and exempt investors), shorten the initial filing deadline from 45 days after year-end to 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the investor beneficially owns more than 5% of the covered class.

For other Schedule 13G filers (i.e., passive investors), shorten the initial filing deadline from 20 days to five business days.

For all Schedule 13G filers, require that amendments be filed 45 days after the calendar quarter in which a material change occurred, rather than 45 days after the year in which any change occurred.

For certain Schedule 13G filers, accelerate the amendment obligations upon exceeding 10% beneficial ownership or a 5% increase or decrease in beneficial ownership of a covered class.

In addition, the final rules extend the filing cut-off times from 5:30 pm to 10:00 pm Eastern Standard Time for Schedules 13D and 13G. They also revise Item 6 of Schedule 13D to clarify that a person is required to disclose interests in all derivative securities that use the issuers equity security as a reference security, and they require that these filings use a structured, machine-readable data language.

The final rules will become effective 90 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Compliance with the revised Schedule 13G filing deadlines will be required beginning on September 30, 2024.

Compliance with the structured data requirement for Schedules 13D and 13G will be required on December 18, 2024.

Compliance with the other rule amendments, including Schedule 13D, will be required 90 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Division of Corporation Finance issues CDIs on pay-versus-performance rules On September 27, 2023, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance posted new compliance and disclosure interpretations (CDIs) addressing issues arising under the final pay-versus-performance rules that were codified in Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The final rules required most public companies to provide a table and accompanying disclosure comparing executive compensation actually paid against specified measures of company financial performance beginning in 2023.

Among other topics, the CDIs address complex calculations for arriving at compensation actually paid in the pay-versus-performance table, with a particular focus on: The treatment of stock and option awards.

The applicability of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Reg S-K to non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures used in the proxy statement.

Investor Advisory Committee recommends human capital disclosure On September 21, the SECs Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) voted to approve a subcommittee recommendation regarding human capital management disclosure .

The IAC recommendations include two components: Adding quantitative disclosures to the business description under Item 101 of Reg S-K. Adding qualitative disclosures in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A).

In the business description, the IAC recommends the requirements be expanded to include disclosure of a breakdown of full-time and part-time employees, turnover of the workforce, the total cost of the workforce, and workforce demographic data.

Regarding the MD&A, the IAC recommends that narrative disclosure be required of how the companys labor practices, compensation incentives, and staffing fit within the broader corporate strategy  specifically, the portion of labor costs management views as an investment and why, including how labor is allocated across areas designed to promote firm growth (e.g., R&D) and those necessary to maintain current operations rather than increase sales revenue (e.g., compliance).

We will see whether the IACs recommendation impacts the SECs work on a proposed human capital management rule, which has appeared in the last few SEC Reg-Flex agendas.

New California law signed relating to climate goals, claims and offsets As discussed in this October 16 Cooley client alert , on October 7, 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1305, the Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act (VCMDA).

This legislation will impose new requirements applicable to companies making climate-related claims, as well as participants in carbon emission offset markets.

In addition to new obligations for companies that purchase and sell offsets, the VCMDA includes significant broadly applicable disclosure obligations for public and private companies, regardless of company size, that operate in California and make claims regarding the climate performance or goals of their business or individual products.

These new rules supplement greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk disclosure requirements (the California Climate Accountability Package) contained in Senate Bills 253 and 261 , which Newsom also signed on October 7.

Disclosure under the VCMDA must be published on company websites and updated at least annually.

The VCMDAs requirements take effect on January 1, 2024 , requiring covered companies to act quickly to prepare relevant disclosure.

To learn more, register for our November 2 webinar , where we will address questions regarding the interpretation of the VCMDA, understanding its significance, and strategies for mitigating enforcement and litigation risks."
Cooley,International Product Recall – The Basics You Need To Know,"Increasing globalization of product markets brings tremendous opportunities for product manufacturers.

New technologies enable companies to reach consumers in markets all around the world, and rapid geographical expansion is increasingly the order of the day.

These opportunities also bring risks that must be managed.

For any consumer product manufacturer, there is an ever-present risk  despite the best planning and investment  that something could go wrong in the design, production or distribution phases that creates an unexpected safety risk to consumers.

When that happens, the manufacturer may need to consider implementing an international product recall or some other form of safety action.  

Sometimes, that action may be required as a mandatory step by government regulators.

Where an international product recall is necessary, if its not managed right, it can be complex, costly and damaging to the brand.

But with proper advance planning, and an understanding of whats involved, the risks can be managed.

A product recall does not have to be damaging for a brand  experience has shown that if it is well managed, it can enhance consumer confidence.

Heres what you need to know.

Products need to be safe  its the law

In almost every country around the world, laws and regulations are in place to protect consumers from dangerous products.

Whilst the details of these laws vary from country to country, it is very common for these laws to impose express obligations on companies to take appropriate steps if it becomes apparent that a marketed product presents unacceptable risks to consumers.

Failure to meet these obligations can attract significant penalties and lead to significant liability exposures.

In some cases, criminal sanctions may be in play.

You need to know that your product is safe  and that it will stay that way In many countries, the law includes express obligations on manufacturers to monitor the safety of their products in the market.

Reports from consumers need to be taken seriously, and where potential safety concerns are reported, they need to be suitably investigated.

This can be challenging for companies, especially where information can become available from multiple sources, and where social media is used by consumers to share their experiences.

Companies are expected to have appropriate systems in place to be aware of consumer experiences of their product in the market, so they can remain confident that their product is not presenting unanticipated risks.

Make sure you have a PSIP Consumer product manufacturers need to have a product safety incident plan (PSIP).

This can take various forms, but fundamentally, companies need to have in place a structured process to ensure that potential safety issues are escalated for consideration in appropriate ways within the company, and that the company is well prepared to move quickly and decisively to deal with an issue, if necessary, by launching a product recall.

The plan should ensure there is clarity as to how critical decisions will be made (including by ensuring undesirable conflicts of interest are avoided in that process), as well as how the implementation phases will be managed and by whom.

There is some helpful guidance on this to be found in the Code of Practice PAS7100 , published by the British Standards Institute, with the support of the UK Office for Product Safety and Standards.

This Code of Practice is the first of its kind internationally and was updated in 2022, so it is worth a careful review.

You probably need to talk to the government Increasingly, the laws in countries around the world include express obligations to notify the appropriate government authority in the event that an unacceptable safety risk for consumers is discovered or a product safety incident has occurred in connection with a marketed product."
Cooley,International Product Recall – The Basics You Need To Know,"These can have strict  and very tight  time limits, and significant penalties can be imposed if this obligation is not met.

If a product has been marketed to consumers in multiple countries around the world, and it becomes apparent that the product might present unanticipated and unacceptable risks to consumers, there can arise an obligation to report simultaneously to government authorities all around the world.

The content and delivery of these notifications needs to be managed carefully.

The notifications are critical to ensuring not only that regulatory obligations are met, but also that the company can stay in control of the situation and look to deliver the best possible results for itself  and consumers  in difficult and time-critical circumstances.

Do a risk assessment straight away A risk assessment is a critical step when trying to assess if an unexpected risk requires a recall or other corrective action.

This step has become even more important for products marketed in Europe, because the European Commission has published a formal risk assessment methodology that it expects will be used routinely when considering risks associated with marketed consumer products.

After Brexit, the UK also published its own formal risk assessment methodology, which differs slightly from the European Union version.

Companies may be unfamiliar with how to go about doing this when faced with a potential time-critical safety emergency.

External expert support may be needed, and the key is to move quickly.

Data is your friend Companies that are best able to manage unexpected safety issues are those that have the best information available at the earliest opportunity.

In a product safety crisis, lack of certainty or lack of information always leads to precautionary measures and can easily result in a need for costly and damaging steps that subsequently prove to have been unnecessary.

Dont underestimate the importance of getting information quickly.

It makes a big difference to the ultimate outcome.

If you need help, get help Companies always do a product recall better the second time around.

Hopefully, however, companies wont be faced with a second recall  one is disruptive enough!

For companies faced with a product recall for the first time (or for the first time in a number of years), external expert support is inevitably going to be needed."
Cooley,IRS Announces Withdrawal Process for Employee Retention Credit Claims,"On October 19, 2023, the IRS announced (IR-2023-193) a withdrawal process for Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claims.

The ERC withdrawal procedure follows an earlier IRS announcement (2023-169) on September 14, 2023, of an immediate moratorium on processing new ERC claims and increased scrutiny of pending ERC claims.

These recent developments stem from IRS concerns about a flood of improper ERC claims being submitted by ineligible businesses that have been misled by aggressive promoters.

The IRS moratorium is described in further detail in this September 2023 client alert .

Under the ERC claim withdrawal process, certain employers that submitted an ERC claim  but have not yet had the claim processed or received a refund (including where the IRS has paid the claim, but the refund check has not been cashed or deposited)  may withdraw their submission and avoid penalties, interest, and issues with repayment of the ERC.

The claim withdrawal process is intended to help businesses that were misled by aggressive promoters into submitting invalid ERC claims.

Withdrawing a willfully filed fraudulent ERC claim, however, will not insulate a business from potential criminal investigation and prosecution.

To be eligible for the ERC claim withdrawal process, an employer must meet all of the following requirements: The employer submitted the ERC claim on an adjusted employment return (IRS Forms 941-X, 943-X, 944-X and CT-1X).

The employer filed the adjusted employment return only to claim the ERC and made no other adjustments.

The employer withdraws the entire amount of the ERC claim.

The IRS has not paid the ERC claim or, if the IRS has paid the ERC claim, the employer has not cashed or deposited the refund check.

The specific procedure for withdrawing an ERC claim depends on an employers situation, including whether the employers claim is under audit.

If an employer used a professional payroll company to file an ERC claim, the payroll company may need to withdraw the claim, depending on whether the claim was submitted individually or batched with others.

Employers that are not eligible for the ERC claim withdrawal process may amend their adjusted employment return in accordance with the guidance issued by the IRS on its ERC frequently asked questions page ."
Cooley,EU Changes CSRD Thresholds to Reduce Sustainability Reporting Burden,"Check whether this impacts your business In January 2023, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires EU and non-EU companies meeting certain thresholds to file annual sustainability reports alongside their financial statements.

On 17 October 2023, the European Commission adopted an amendment to the thresholds in the Accounting Directive , impacting which entities will need to file CSRD-compliant reports.

What are the adjusted thresholds?

A companys reporting obligations under the CSRD are determined by the size of the company or group.

Most large EU companies and groups will need to comply for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025, and certain small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will need to comply for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026.

A comparison of the current and new thresholds is set out in the table below Threshold test for non-EU parent companies The threshold for non-EU parent companies to prepare a group report under the CSRD from financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2028 has not been adjusted.

The CSRD remains applicable to any non-EU company which satisfies both of the following criteria: Generates a net turnover of more than 150 million euros in the EU for each of the last two consecutive financial years at the consolidated level (or, if not applicable, at the individual level).

AND Has at least one EU subsidiary in scope of the CSRD, or has at least one branch which generated a net turnover of more than 40 million euros in the preceding financial year.

When will these adjusted thresholds apply?

Member states are required to apply these new thresholds for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

Member states may, however, allow entities to apply these adjusted thresholds for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2023.

This will be determined at the individual member state level.

Why have the thresholds been changed?

The stated reason for raising the thresholds is to accommodate for inflation over the past 10 years and reduce the reporting burden for smaller companies.

Next steps The amendments adopted by the European Commission are now subject to a scrutiny period (usually two months, although this can be extended) during which the European Parliament or European Council might veto the changes.

If the changes are not vetoed, the amendments will be formally published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force three days after.

Are there any other changes on the horizon?

No changes to the first set of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS): The ESRS which will start to apply to certain large EU companies reporting on FY 2024 also are nearing the end of their cooling off period.

Adopted in July 2023, the ESRS are subject to a two-month scrutiny period in the European Parliament and European Council before they formally enter into force at the end of this year.

A motion tabled last week to reject the ESRS and requesting a less onerous set of reporting standards was itself rejected on 18 October 2023.

Delays to drafts of the sector-specific and non-EU-specific ESRS:

The European Commissions 2024 Commission Work Programme indicates that it plans to postpone the adoption of sector-specific ESRS and the ESRS to be used by non-EU companies in scope of the CSRD.

Adoption of these standards was initially scheduled for June 2024.

The proposed two-year delay is not, however, currently expected to impact the reporting deadlines for either EU or non-EU companies in scope of the CSRD.

Cooley,California Enacts Two New Virtual Currency Laws,"On October 13, 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two bills into law that will impose sweeping obligations on companies engaged in virtual currency activities in California and with California residents.

Newsom vetoed similar legislation last year due to concerns that it lacked the flexibility necessary to adapt to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Given that California was an outlier among the largest US states in leaving virtual currency activities to a great extent unregulated under the money transmission regulatory framework, the enactment of these new laws carries profound implications for the cryptocurrency industry.

The first bill ( AB 39 )  the California Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL)  is a new virtual currency licensing regime with similarities to New Yorks virtual currency regulations, which require entities conducting virtual currency business activity in New York to obtain a BitLicense (or a charter under the New York Banking Law).

The second bill ( SB 401 ) is tied to the DFAL and specifically regulates digital financial asset transaction kiosks, which are generally defined as devices that are capable of accepting or dispensing cash in exchange for a digital financial asset.

The California Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL) Overview The DFAL prohibits a person from engaging in digital financial asset business activity  or holding itself out as being able to engage in digital financial asset business activity  without meeting certain criteria and obtaining a license from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).

Similar to other states definitions of regulated virtual currency activity (although using a different term), the law defines digital financial asset to mean a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, and that is not legal tender, whether or not denominated as legal tender.

The definition of a digital financial asset excludes rewards points and value issued and usable only within an online game platform, provided certain criteria are met.

Securities registered with or exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 1 or the DFPI also are excluded from this definition.

A number of persons are exempt from the DFAL, including, but not limited to: Banks.

Certain trust companies.

Persons that provide processing, clearing or settlement services solely for transactions between or among persons that are exempt from the licensing requirements.

Persons using a digital financial asset, or obtaining a digital financial asset as payment, solely for personal, family or household purposes, or academic purposes.

A merchant that accepts a digital financial asset as payment for the purchase or sale of goods or services, which does not include digital financial assets.

Persons whose digital financial asset business activity with, or on behalf of, California residents is reasonably expected to be valued, in the aggregate, on an annual basis at $50,000 or less.

Persons that contribute only connectivity software or computing power to securing a network that records digital financial asset transactions or to a protocol governing transfer of the digital representation of value.

Distinct from the enumerated exemptions, the DFAL also authorizes the DFPI commissioner to further exempt any class of persons or transactions, if the commissioner finds the exemption to be in the public interest.

Licensing requirement The law requires a person to be licensed to engage in digital financial asset business activity (a covered person), unless exempt."
Cooley,California Enacts Two New Virtual Currency Laws,"Licensing requirement The law requires a person to be licensed to engage in digital financial asset business activity (a covered person), unless exempt.

Digital financial asset business activity subject to licensing includes exchanging, transferring, or storing a digital financial asset or engaging in digital financial asset administration and holding electronic precious metals or electronic certificates representing interests in precious metals on behalf of another person or issuing shares or electronic certificates representing interests in precious metals.

Perhaps most significantly, the DFAL defines digital financial asset business activity to include exchanging digital representations of value used within online games for a digital financial asset offered by the same game or app publisher, or for legal tender or bank or credit union credit outside the game.

This provision seems to suggest that if in-game tokens/digital assets can be redeemed for a digital financial asset or cash, such activity may be within the scope of the DFAL licensing requirement.

It is not clear, however, if it would apply to the exchange or trading up of digital representations of value within a game if the new token is within the scope of the exemption for digital representations of value used within online games and does not itself otherwise meet the definition of a digital financial asset.

Effective July 1, 2025, covered persons must be licensed or have submitted a licensing application.

The application requirements are similar to those for a traditional money transmission license but are more extensive and more prescriptive.

For example, in addition to standard requirements, like an anti-money laundering program and an information security program, applicants also are expressly required to have in place policies and procedures to address business continuity, disaster recovery, an anti-fraud program and a general compliance program.

Furthermore, the applicants business plan must not only describe the business activities of the applicant and its products and services, but also include information about its internet websites and social media pages.

Applicants also must provide insurance coverage information, information about licenses held in other states and information about persons that have control over the applicant.

The adjudication factors for the DFPIs licensing determination also are similar to the money transmission law but include the unique factor of whether the applicant has a reasonable promise of success in engaging in digital financial business activity.

The DFAL separately provides that a person with a pending license application may be issued a conditional license if the applicant holds a license to conduct virtual currency business activity pursuant to the New York BitLicense regulations ( 23 NYCRR Part 200 ), provided that the New York license was issued or approved no later than January 1, 2023.

The DFAL also effectively prohibits a covered person from exchanging, transferring or storing a stablecoin unless the issuer of the stablecoin is licensed under the DFAL (or has an application pending), or is an exempt bank or a California or nationally chartered trust company.

The commissioner of the DFPI also must approve any stablecoin before the covered person engages in exchanging, transferring or storing the stablecoin.

Licensee obligations Under the DFAL, licensees are subject to annual and special reporting requirements and annual assessments, as well as requirements to maintain certain records for all digital financial asset business activity for five years  including a general ledger maintained at least monthly that lists all assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses of the licensee.

The DFAL imposes additional requirements on covered persons that operate an exchange or engage in activities involving stablecoin."
Cooley,California Enacts Two New Virtual Currency Laws,"The DFAL imposes additional requirements on covered persons that operate an exchange or engage in activities involving stablecoin.

With respect to a covered exchange  a covered person that exchanges or holds itself out as being able to exchange a digital financial asset for a [California] resident  the entity must certify that it has complied with specific requirements, including determining the likelihood of whether any digital financial asset available to be exchanged through the platform would be deemed a security by California or federal regulators.

Penalties for listing or offering a digital financial asset without appropriate certification, or based on material misrepresentations in the certification process, include civil penalties of up to $20,000 per day.

Licensees also are subject to extensive disclosure requirements, largely based on the New York BitLicense regulations, including Pre-transaction disclosures of fees.

Information regarding whether the product or service is covered by insurance or other protection against loss.

Recognition that the transaction is irrevocable, along with any exceptions to irrevocability.

Liability for unauthorized transactions.

Disclosure of a California residents right to at least 14 days prior notice of a change in the licensees fee schedule, other terms and conditions that have a material impact on digital financial asset business activity, or the policies applicable to user accounts.

Finally, licensees are subject to examination and oversight by the DFPI and enforcement for noncompliance with the DFAL.

The DFPI has extensive enforcement authority, including the authority to impose severe penalties for unlicensed activity.

If a person that is not a licensee has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in digital financial asset business activity with, or on behalf of, a resident in violation of the DFAL, the DFPI may assess a civil penalty of up to $100,000 per day .

If a licensee or other covered person (e.g., a person that has been granted a conditional license) materially violates the DFAL, the DFPI still has the authority to assess a civil penalty of up to $20,000, which is much higher than the typical statutory penalty amounts enumerated in traditional state money transmission licensing laws.

California Digital Financial Asset Transaction Kiosks Law

The second piece of legislation signed by Newsom (SB 401) imposes requirements on operators of digital financial asset transaction kiosks that are not, as we read the legislation, otherwise licensed under the DFAL.

The law is intended to apply to operators of so-called bitcoin ATMs that allow customers to purchase and sell cryptocurrency in exchange for cash.

The law prohibits an operator from accepting or dispensing more than $1,000 in a day from or to a customer via a digital financial asset transaction kiosk.

The law also requires an operator, beginning on January 1, 2025, to provide written disclosure containing the terms and conditions of the transaction, including the amount of the digital financial asset involved.

These disclosures, which must be made prior to when the digital financial asset transaction takes place, also must include information about whether the operator provides a method to reverse or refund a transaction (and, if not, a warning that transactions are final and cannot be undone), as well as the amount of the digital financial asset involved in the transaction, the amount in US dollars of fees, charges, etc., the price in US dollars charged by the operator to the customer for the digital financial asset, and the US dollar price of that same asset as listed by a licensed digital financial asset exchange.

Further, total charges and fees cannot exceed the greater of $5.00 or 15% of the US dollar equivalent of the digital financial assets involved in the transaction based on the market price of that same asset quoted by a licensed digital financial asset exchange."
Cooley,California Enacts Two New Virtual Currency Laws,"Transaction receipts must include customer name, transaction information, the spread between the dollar price of the digital financial asset that is charged to the customer and the dollar price of the digital financial asset as listed by a licensed digital financial asset exchange, and the name of the licensed digital financial asset exchange used by the operator to calculate that spread.

Operators also are required to disclose the locations of their kiosks to the DFPI (to be posted on the agencys website) and must provide an update to the agency within 30 days of changing or adding kiosk locations.

Implications for the industry California, one of the most significant holdouts in the context of regulating virtual currency activities under state money transmission laws (or similarly constructed virtual currency-specific licensing laws), will soon have in place what seems to be the most stringent virtual currency licensing laws of any state.

Companies engaging in virtual currency activities in California will need to begin evaluating whether their activities in the state are within the scope of the DFAL and SB 401  and, if so, begin preparations to apply for any required license and otherwise come into compliance with the extensive requirements of the laws.

The industry also can anticipate some degree of complexity in evaluating how to operate in California going forward, because, for example, entities subject to the DFAL can likely only engage in stablecoin activities if the stablecoin issuers themselves also pursue a DFAL license in California.

While the laws do not take full effect until 2025, the industry will likely benefit from the relatively long lead time afforded by the legislation to develop compliance approaches for this unprecedented regulatory regime.

Notes The chair of the SEC has indicated that it is his view that virtually all tokens (or digital financial assets) are securities.

The SEC recently settled two cases involving non-fungible assets that the SEC determined were securities.

If the SECs interpretation prevails, virtually all digital financial assets would need to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
Cooley,FCC Expands Authority in Space Economy With New Orders,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently took steps to facilitate commercial operations in space by adopting two orders that provide more flexibility to the industry.

The FCC adopted a second report and second further notice of proposed rulemaking (FNRMP) to allocate spectrum for space launch operations and consider spectrum needs for other space-based needs.

The agency also recently approved a report and order and FNPRM to modernize the licensing process for satellite and earth stations.

Finally, the FCC announced that its Space Bureau will launch a Transparency Initiative creating knowledge-based resources to help make the application process easier to understand.

Space launch proceeding The FCC established new licensing and technical rules for space launch operations to facilitate growth of the commercial space industry.

The FCC adopted a new secondary allocation in the 2025-2110 megahertz (MHz) band that provides spectrum for commercial space operations within the band and removed the restriction on nonfederal space operations within the 2200-2290 MHz band.

The FCC declined requests to adopt new allocations for the 420-430 MHz, 2360-2395 MHz and 5650-5925 MHz bands.

To facilitate this process, the FCC created a new part 26 of its rules, which will include the new rules governing commercial space launch services.

Licensees will be able to use the 2025-2110 MHz and 2200-2290 MHz bands for telemetry, tracking, and command activities required for space launch operations.

Part 26 will outline the limits for authorized bandwidth, licensing requirements, emissions, and power limits.

The FCC adopted a post-license grant coordination process facilitated by a third-party space launch frequency coordinator to prevent harmful interference to users of the 2025-2110 MHz and 2200-2290 MHz bands.

The FCC adopted a renewal standard that requires commercial space launch licensees to certify that the operations are consistent with the initial application for authorization or that the licensees have complied with the required coordination.

Seeking information on the need for spectrum beyond launch services, the FCC asked for industry comments on the following topics: Including new spectrum allocations in specific bands for communications with cargo and crew capsules and payload communications with the International Space Station and other crewed space stations.

Spectrum needs related to suborbital spaceflight.

Expanding the use of 2360-2395 MHz band or other bands for commercial space launch.

Increasing the window for earth station operators to file an application for renewal.

Comments and reply comments for the second FNPRM will be due 30 and 60 days, respectively, after publication in the Federal Register.

Space and earth station licensing proceeding The FCC significantly revised the space and earth station application process and eliminated unnecessary rules.

Specifically, the agency announced the following changes: The FCC will not immediately dismiss an application requesting authority to operate a space station in a frequency band that is not allocated internationally for such operations under the ITU Radio Regulations if the applicant has requested a waiver.

Applications in the International Communications Filing System (ICFS) will have new features (e.g., automatic error notifications in Form 312, data entry alerts to misinformation).

In modification and amendment applications, applicants will have access to pre-filled forms that include information from the current authorization or pending application they seek to change.

The FCC eliminated the rules that prohibited a licensee or market access grantee from applying for another non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) license or grant of market access where the party has an already licensed-but-unbuilt NGSO system for the same frequencies, but it retained the limitation on the number of applications per NGSO operator per processing round."
Cooley,FCC Expands Authority in Space Economy With New Orders,"Applications to add space station points of communication to existing earth station licenses will be deemed granted 35 days after being placed on public notice, as long as certain FCC criteria are met  and no objections to the application are filed.

Additionally, the FCC has established time frames for Space Bureau staff to either place space and earth stations on public notice or notify applicants of any problems with their applications after the applications are filed in ICFS.

Earth stations and geostationary orbit (GSO) space station applications will be evaluated under a 30-day timeline, while NGSO space station applications will be evaluated under a 60-day timeline.

The FCC may take additional steps to modernize the application process and has asked for comments on the following: Expanding the list of minor modifications allowed without prior FCC authorization.

Whether operations beyond tracking, telemetry, and command functions should be permitted to continue during satellite drifts if a provider certifies that operations are limited to coordinated transmissions during the relocation and drift transition period.

Creating an equivalent to special temporary authority for space station market access grantees to communicate with [US-licensed] earth stations.

Allowing special temporary authority extensions to be automatically granted while applications are pending.

The feasibility of a Permitted List for NGSO operators similar to that used for GSO satellites.

Proposals for improvements of interagency coordination of space station and earth station applications.

Strategies to eliminate duplicative coordination requirements between the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the FCC.

Eliminating the rule requiring operators to keep paper copies of electronically filed applications.

Comments and reply comments for the FNPRM will be due 30 and 60 days, respectively, after publication in the Federal Register."
Cooley,FTC Issues Antitrust Warning Against ‘Improper’ Orange Book Patent Listings,"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently issued a policy statement to put market participants on notice that the FTC intends to scrutinize improper Orange Book listings and take actions against companies and individuals that improperly list patents in the Orange Book.

Aggressive and broad in scope, the FTCs statement: Suggests the FTC views improper Orange Book listings to be essentially per se antitrust violations, unlawful regardless of the reasonableness of the listing.

Targets existing as well as new Orange Book listings.

Threatens enforcement against companies and responsible individuals.

Asserts that the FTC will refer matters to the Department of Justice for investigation of criminal violations for the submission of false statements.

Indicates the FTC may scrutinize a firms history of improperly listing patents during a merger review.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers are well-advised to take steps to put themselves in position to fend off any aggressive FTC investigation or enforcement, as we discuss further below.

Orange Book listings are mandated by statute The Hatch-Waxman Act provides that pharmaceutical manufacturers shall list in the Orange Book all patents that could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use or sale of the drug, and that claim the drug, a formulation or composition containing the drug, or a method of using the drug.

1

These public listings put generic drug applicants on notice of the patents that may be infringed by generic entry.

In fact, drug manufacturers must submit a signed verification that the submitted patent information is accurate and complete.

Companies seeking to market generic drugs must certify against any Orange Book-listed patents for the reference listed drug.

If a generic makes a paragraph IV certification that any Orange Book-listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed, the innovator company may bring an infringement suit and, if it does so within 45 days, the statute imposes a 30-month stay on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving the generic drug while the patent litigation proceeds.

The Hatch-Waxman Act, including the 30-month stay, reflects legislative judgment balancing policies to encourage generic competition while preserving incentives to invest in innovation.


Listing a patent in the Orange Book and suing for infringement, however, can have significant consequences for the timing of generic entry, and hence can raise antitrust issues.

Although the FDA manages the Orange Book, its long-standing position has been to serve only a ministerial role, on the basis that it lacks the resources and expertise to assess whether patents are properly listed or otherwise police Orange Book listings in any substantive way.

By contrast, the FTC has in the past challenged Orange Book listings that it contends resulted in delayed generic entry.

In 2002, for example, the FTC charged and settled allegations that Biovail delayed a generic entrant by enforcing an Orange Book-listed patent that Biovail was aware did not claim the formulation of the reference drug.

The facts at issue, however, were extreme: In addition to Biovails alleged knowledge that the patent was not properly listable, Biovail had acquired the patent from a third party, and listing it triggered a second 30-month stay, after the generic had already defeated Biovails first patent suit and obtained tentative approval.

(Such multiple 30-month stays generally are no longer possible.)

The FTC also has filed a number of amicus briefs relating to Orange Book listings, including in 2022 taking the position that patents related to distribution systems  such as a patent covering a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program mandated by the FDA  are not properly listable."
Cooley,FTC Issues Antitrust Warning Against ‘Improper’ Orange Book Patent Listings,"Significant open issues remain The FTCs statement seeks to deter Orange Book listings, believing they contribute to high drug prices, but in doing so ignores existing case law and well-established antitrust principles, potentially leaving the FTC vulnerable if it actually brings suit on the theories articulated in the statement.

Perhaps most egregiously, the FTC seems to contend that improper Orange Book listings are essentially per se antitrust violations, and subject to challenge regardless of the reasonableness of the decision to list the patent, and regardless of the competitive effects of the particular listing.

This position, however, runs headfirst into the precedents, which recognize that mere improper listing does not violate antitrust law.

For example, in its 2020 In re Lantus decision, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit  citing precedent from other regulatory contexts  held that there should be no antitrust liability if an improper listing was the result of a reasonable, good-faith attempt to comply with the Hatch-Waxman scheme.

In Organon v. Mylan , a district court dismissed an antitrust counterclaim where there was a reasonable basis for Orange Book listing because the statute was capable of two equally plausible interpretations.

To be sure, there may be instances where a patent is intentionally listed improperly simply to obtain the 30-month stay.

But in other instances, there may be legitimate uncertainty about Orange Book listing requirements or the outcome of any future patent enforcement.

And the harm almost always flows directly from the filing of the patent litigation, not by the Orange Book listing itself.

In these circumstances, the precedents do not support per se antitrust liability for listing a patent, both because courts take into account the reasonableness of the decision to list and because likelihood of success is not a criterion for being listed.

2

It remains to be seen whether the FTC  consistent with its past practices  will focus its enforcement on the egregious cases, or also challenge good faith, reasonable listings ultimately found to be improper.

The FTC also suggests it may challenge improper Orange Book listings irrespective of any enforcement or invocation of the 30-month stay, theorizing that listings may disincentivize investments in developing [a generic].

Pharmaceutical manufacturers therefore should consider antitrust risks when listing a patent that may not meet the statutory criteria and when filing suit.

However, mere Orange Book listing  in the absence of any patent enforcement  is much less likely to actually delay or deter generic entry.

And in the absence of such evidence, there should be no legal or economic basis for antitrust condemnation.

It is notable that the FTCs statement  and even more so its press release  focuses on improper Orange Book listings as an unfair method of competition under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

As support, the FTC cites its own (highly controversial) November 2022 Section 5 policy statement , which argues that Section 5 reaches a wide swath of conduct not unlawful under the Sherman Act.

It is not at all clear, however, that an FTC challenge under Section 5 that does not meet the requirements for monopolization under Sherman Act would be upheld by a court.

The FTC further flouts the fact that companies are under statutory command to list patents, and that under-listing can itself be harmful.

Indeed, as recognized in Lantus, failure to list can itself arguably have an anticompetitive effect by depriving potential competitors of notice and of the other procedural benefits.

This was in part why the First Circuit rejected the plaintiffs position  which the FTC appears to mirror  that an improper listing violates antitrust law regardless of its reasonableness.

Key considerations for innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers The FTC statement certainly warrants attention."
Cooley,FTC Issues Antitrust Warning Against ‘Improper’ Orange Book Patent Listings,"Key considerations for innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers The FTC statement certainly warrants attention.

Even while the FTCs ability to obtain monetary relief is limited, the FTC can impose cease and desist orders.

And many companies will not want to incur the cost of defending an FTC investigation or the adverse publicity that could result from an enforcement action, even if the company might prevail in litigation.

Moreover, state attorneys general and private plaintiffs may attempt to leverage the FTCs statement to seek damages for alleged improper listings, although those entities would have to establish actual harm to obtain monetary relief.

Weve outlined three key considerations for pharmaceutical manufacturers below.

Be aware of significant antitrust risks from listing/enforcing patents that do not satisfy statutory criteria There is no doubt that intentionally listing a patent that clearly does not meet the statutory criteria and filing an infringement action on such patent, for the purpose of delaying or deterring generic entry, raises significant antitrust risks.

Such action is likely to attract antitrust counterclaims from the generic applicant in addition to potential FTC scrutiny.

Listing such a patent alone may carry antitrust risk insofar as it delays or deters generic entrants.

Audit existing and new Orange Book listings for compliance with current guidance In light of these risks, and the FTCs renewed attention on these issues, pharmaceutical manufacturers should consider auditing existing Orange Book listings, and vet future listings, to ensure that any patent listed in the Orange Book meets the statutory criteria for listing and covers the product for which approval is sought or has been granted.

In particular, pharmaceutical manufacturers should confirm their listings are up to date with current guidance, such as with respect to patents related to distribution systems (e.g., REMS).

If a listed patent does not meet the statutory criteria, or is known to be invalid, it should be de-listed.

Document good faith rationale for listing decisions To the extent there is ambiguity regarding whether a patent is properly listable, it is advisable to document the good faith rationale for listing the patent.

Companies should be cognizant to avoid creating documents that could be inaccurately read to suggest that a listed patent does not meet the statutory criteria and is in the Orange Book solely to delay generic entry.

Cooleys antitrust, patent and Hatch-Waxman teams are available to advise on these and other issues at the intersection of antitrust and pharmaceutical patent enforcement.

Notes The statute imposes additional requirements regarding patents that should be listed.

For example, formulation patents must claim the formulation described in the New Drug Application, and method-of-use patents must claim an indication for which approval was granted.

In a similar vein, the statement neglects to even mention the potential Noerr-Pennington issues at play.

Some courts have held that Noerr-Pennington  which protects petitioning the government  does not apply to Orange Book listings because the FDAs role is non-discretionary.

Other courts , however, have suggested that Orange Book listings in advance of a generic firms certification do not cause harm independent of filing the infringement lawsuit required to obtain a 30-month stay, which is protected by Noerr-Pennington ."

Cooley,All Eyes on Critical Technology in the EU,"The European Commissions Recommendation on critical technology areas for the EUs economic security , issued on October 3, 2023, kick-started an urgent risk assessment by policymakers and private sector stakeholders across the European Union.

While this work will be completed over the next few months, policymakers have already given a strong indication that four technology areas  advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies and biotech  are critical for the EUs economic security.

Expect not least tightened foreign investment reviews down the line.

New strategy for European economic security The European Commission's Recommendation forms part of the EUs new European Economic Security Strategy , adopted in June 2023 and developed further at the EU summit in Granada, Spain.

The strategy is based on a three-pillar approach: promotion of the EUs economic base and competitiveness, protection against risks, and partnership with the broadest possible range of countries to address shared concerns and interests.

The strategy identified the following four broad and nonexhaustive categories of risks for further assessment: Resilience of supply chains, including energy security.

Physical and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.

Technology security and leakage.

Weaponization of economic dependencies and economic coercion.

Analysis and policy initiatives will follow in each of those areas, but the European Commissions Recommendation concerns the third.

Initial steps to implement the EUs strategy The European Commission first conducted a preliminary analysis of technology areas across three dimensions: The enabling and transformative nature of the technology.

The risk of dual-use civil and military fusion.

The risk that the technology could be used in violation of human rights.

Based on this analysis, 10 critical technology areas for the EUs economic security were identified  with the following four areas identified as highly likely to present the most sensitive and immediate risks related to technology security and technology leakage: Advanced semiconductors  including microelectronics, photonics, high-frequency chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment  due to their enabling and transformative nature and their use for civil and military purposes.

Artificial intelligence  including high-performance computing, cloud and edge computing, data analytics, computer vision, language processing and object recognition  due to their wide range of dual-use applications and importance for processing large amounts of data and making decisions or predictions based on this data-driven analysis.

Quantum technologies  including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, quantum communications, quantum sensing and radar  due to their ability to transform multiple sectors by enabling new technologies.

Biotechnologies  including techniques of genetic modification, new genomic techniques, gene drive and synthetic biology  due to their enabling and transformative nature in areas such as agriculture, environment, healthcare, life sciences, food chains and biomanufacturing.

The European Commission and EU Member States will next collectively conduct risk assessments on the above four areas by the end of the year to identify and analyse vulnerabilities of a systemic nature, as well as their impact on the EUs economic security.

The European Commission stressed that it was not possible at this stage to specify the nature of any risks, and that any risks will be precise and proportionate measures to promote, partner or protect on any of these technology areas.

Comment The European Commissions Recommendation on critical technology areas for the EUs economic security constitutes one of the first steps toward implementing the EUs new European Economic Security Strategy.

Several additional initiatives will follow, and many of these can be expected to have profound impact on doing business in  and with  the EU."
Cooley,All Eyes on Critical Technology in the EU,"Several additional initiatives will follow, and many of these can be expected to have profound impact on doing business in  and with  the EU.

The European Commissions identification of four highly likely critical technology areas is not surprising as such, given the potential of these technologies.

Further policy initiatives are expected around those areas, depending on the outcome of the ongoing urgent review by Member States and the European Commission, and such initiatives are likely to enable  as well as restrict  business opportunities.

For instance, foreign investment reviews across the EU Member States affecting, for instance, semiconductors and biotech have been closely scrutinized in recent years.

Given the increasing importance of foreign investment review, along with the implementation of the EUs strategy, it is expected that future transactions involving the four areas now identified for analysis will face even closer review.

Cooley,Federal Circuit’s In re Cellect Decision Deals Blow to Patent Term Adjustment,"The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuits recent decision in In re Cellect confirmed that, when considering whether a reference patent invalidates for obviousness-type double patenting (ODP) a patent having a term that extends beyond the 20-year statutory term  for example, from patent term extension (PTE) or patent term adjustment (PTA)  the determination of which patent expires later must take into account whether the term extension arises from PTE or PTA.

The Federal Circuit had previously held that, where the patent has received PTE, its expiration date used for the ODP analysis is the patents expiration date before the PTE has been added.

1

In Cellect , the Federal Circuit determined that, if the patents extended term is due to PTA, the expiration date after the PTA has been added should be used.

Cellect owns a family of patents, four of which were asserted and subsequently subjected to ex parte reexamination.

The examiner rejected those four challenged patents for being invalid due to ODP over a reference patent.

The reference patent is another member of the patent family.

Because the challenged patents and the reference patent all derived from a common ancestor, absent any PTA, each of the patents would have expired on the same day.

However, each of the challenged patents, which claimed subject matter that was deemed patentably indistinct and not entitled to any safe harbor protections under 35 US Code 121, had PTA, whereas the reference patent did not.

As a result, each of the challenged patents had an adjusted expiration date that was later than that of the reference patent.

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) sustained the examiners determination of unpatentability under ODP.

In its decision, the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTABs determination that claims of the challenged patents were unpatentable for ODP over the patentably indistinct claims of the reference patent.

According to the Federal Circuit, any PTA-based extension past the reference patents expiration date (in this case, the 20-year statutory term) constitutes an inappropriate time-wise extension for the  claims of the challenged patents.

Next steps Going forward, patentees should understand that, for commonly owned patents and non-commonly owned patents naming a common inventor, it is likely a challenger would use the earliest-expiring patent of a patent family as an ODP reference against all other patents in the patent family (especially the later-expiring ones).

Therefore, in some cases, it may be desirable to file one or more terminal disclaimers in patent families whose earliest-expiring member is about to expire to avoid having it used as a reference to invalidate for ODP patent family members that have PTA and expire later.

In addition, patent practitioners should carefully weigh the pros and cons of prosecution strategies that rely on filing multiple continuation patents to pursue subject matter that might be considered patentably indistinct.

Where appropriate, divisional applications should be used to pursue any disclosed subject matter that is not at risk of being considered patentably indistinct  for example, subject matter restricted out from the reference patent in response to a restriction requirement issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office.

Here, steps should be taken to ensure that proper consonance is maintained between restricted/elected subject matter and that the claims pursued in later divisional application to meet the safe harbor requirements under 35 USC 121.

Likewise, to the extent possible, patent practitioners should consider drafting patent applications in ways where the invention(s) fall into patentably distinct groups and/or that are designed to provoke a restriction requirement."
Cooley,Federal Circuit’s In re Cellect Decision Deals Blow to Patent Term Adjustment,"Finally, because is likely that Cellect will file a petition for rehearing, a request for rehearing en banc, and/or a petition for certiorari at the US Supreme Court, Cooley will continue to monitor developments in this case.

Cooley,"New California Law Establishes Significant Disclosure Requirements Related to Climate Goals, Claims and Offsets Beginning January 1, 2024","On October 7, 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act (VCMDA)  AB 1305  which will impose new requirements applicable to companies making climate-related claims, as well as participants in carbon emission offset markets.

In addition to new obligations for companies that purchase and sell offsets within California, the VCMDA includes significant broadly applicable disclosure obligations for companies that operate in California and make claims regarding the climate performance or goals of their business or individual products .

These new rules supplement new greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate risk disclosure requirements (the California Climate Accountability Package, or CCAP) contained in SB 253 and SB 261, which Newsom also signed on October 7.

The VCMDA applies to public and private companies, regardless of company size, that undertake specified activities within the state.

The most impactful elements of the VCMDA are new annual website disclosure obligations covering any company that operates in California that makes certain climate-related claims or goals, including the very large number of companies that have set net zero targets or make claims regarding the climate performance of their business or individual products.

In addition to the many large public companies that have made net zero commitments, the VCMDA will potentially apply to companies that include certain climate-related claims in their product marketing  ranging from consumer goods or ecommerce companies that tout offset purchases and low-emissions products to renewable energy and other climate tech businesses.

Disclosure under the VCMDA must be published on company websites and updated at least annually.

These requirements take effect on January 1, 2024, requiring covered companies to act quickly to prepare relevant disclosure.

Disclosure obligations for companies making climate performance claims or setting emissions goals Separate from the new rules applicable to the purchase and sale of offsets, Section 44475.2 of the VCMDA creates disclosure obligations for entities that (1) operate within California and (2) make claims within California:

Regarding the achievement of net zero emissions; That the entity, its affiliates or a product is carbon neutral, or that imply that such entities or products do not add net GHG emissions; or That such entities or products have made significant reductions to their GHG emissions.

Companies subject to Section 44475.2 will be required to provide website disclosure covering: All information regarding how, if at all, a carbon neutral, net zero or similar claim was determined to be accurate or accurately accomplished; How interim progress toward such goals is being measured; and Whether the data and claims listed have been subject to third-party verification.

Cited examples of disclosure responsive to items 1 and 2 above include the use of third-party verification of all entity GHG emissions, identification of an entitys Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) pathway and the relevant sector methodologies used for such targets.

Although ambiguous, the text of Section 44475.2 suggests that relevant climate claims include both statements regarding historical achievements and forward-looking goals (i.e., net zero or emissions-reduction targets).

As a result, this provision potentially has an extremely broad scope, capturing not only companies that make claims regarding the net zero performance of their overall business, but also the much larger pool of companies that set climate goals, or make claims or set goals regarding individual products.

In addition, relevant claims include anything that implies that a business or product has achieved a significant (undefined) reduction in emissions, potentially capturing many sustainability-related product marketing statements."
Cooley,"New California Law Establishes Significant Disclosure Requirements Related to Climate Goals, Claims and Offsets Beginning January 1, 2024","The VCMDA does not specify what it means to operate in California or make claims within the state, though this may potentially cover all environmental, social and governance (ESG) publicity and product marketing statements by companies selling to California customers.

Given the number of companies that sell into or otherwise operate in California and either set net zero targets or make claims regarding product emissions performance, Section 44475.2 disclosure obligations may potentially apply to a very significant percentage of US and international companies  public and private.

Additional disclosure obligations regarding the use of climate offsets Entities operating in California that make the types of climate claims covered by Section 44475.2 are subject to additional requirements under Section 44475.1 of the VCMDA if they purchase or use voluntary carbon offsets 1 sold within the state.

Such entities must provide additional website disclosure related to offset purchases that specifies: Offset project types (i.e., whether the project offsets emissions via avoided emissions, such as through renewable energy or forest preservation projects, or through carbon capture/removal); Basic project information, such as the project name, identification number (if applicable), the entity selling the offset, and the offset registry or program; The protocol used to estimate emissions reductions or removal benefits; and Whether there is third-party verification of company data and claims listed.

Section 44475.1 does not specify whether disclosure must cover all offsets or just offsets sold within California  or what it means for offsets to be sold within the state.

This may be a distinction without a difference to the extent that the latter covers all offset markets open to California purchasers.

Under a broad interpretation, the requirements of Section 44475.1 would apply to the very large number of companies that purchase offsets and either set climate goals or make climate-performance claims.

Disclosure obligations for offset sellers Less broadly applicable than Sections 44475.1 and 44475.2, Section 44475 of the VCMDA imposes new disclosure obligations for entities that market or sell offsets within California.

Covered entities will be required to provide website disclosure that specifies: Basic project information, such as offset types, protocols used, project start dates and timelines, and emission reduction/removal quantities; Annual updates regarding emissions reduced or removed; Whether the project meets any standards established by law or a nonprofit entity, or whether the project is subject to independent expert or third-party validation of project attributes; Project durability (i.e., the period for which the project operator commits to maintaining emissions reduction or removal enhancements, if such period is less than the atmospheric lifetime of CO2 emissions); Any actions that will be taken, including but not limited to actions required by contractual obligation, if the relevant projects do not achieve future emissions reductions, or if carbon storage projects are reversed; and Pertinent data and calculation methods necessary to reproduce and verify emissions reduction or removal credit claims.

Relation of the VCMDA to other ESG regulations The VCMDA creates significant new disclosure obligations related to climate claims, goals and offsets that will apply to many US and international companies operating in California.

For many such companies  including most US companies  these rules represent the first required disclosures regarding the basis for climate-related claims and offset purchases.

Nonetheless, the VCMDA reflects broader trends in US and international regulation, including a general trend of anti-greenwashing enforcement and proposed and adopted regulations covering green claims and the use of offsets ."
Cooley,"New California Law Establishes Significant Disclosure Requirements Related to Climate Goals, Claims and Offsets Beginning January 1, 2024","The VCMDA also comes in advance of potential updates to US Federal Trade Commission Green Guides , following a solicitation of public comment this spring , including regarding guidance related to offset, net zero, carbon-neutral and other climate-related claims.

Similar to the CCAP, Section 44475.2 overlaps with certain elements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) climate proposal , while potentially applying to a much broader pool of companies.

Unlike the SEC proposal, the VCMDA applies to public and private companies and  unlike the CCAP  does not include any revenue thresholds.

In addition to adoption in advance of the final SEC rules, the VCMDA will be effective more than a year in advance of even the earliest expected SEC disclosure obligations.

Similar to the VCMDA, under the SEC proposal, new Item 1506 of Regulation S-K would require disclosure of climate targets and goals  including units of measurement, time horizons, interim targets, annual progress updates and target-achievement strategies.

In particular, this would include a requirement to disclose the role of offsets in any climate-related targets or goals including details regarding renewable energy credits, such as purchase costs, the amounts of energy generated, project locations and any offset authentication.

While there is significant overlap with the SEC proposal on these topics, the VCMDA includes a unique focus on historical and product-level claims that may have significant disclosure implications for many companies.

Practical considerations Navigating statutory ambiguity As with the CCAP, the statutory text of the VCMDA is relatively brief and leaves several key concepts undefined  including what it means to operate in California, sell or market offsets within the state, or make climate-related claims within the state.

Unlike the CCAP, the VCMDA does not specify that any particular regulatory agency will promulgate implementing resolutions under the statute, though the California attorney general and local prosecutors are responsible for prosecuting any civil actions under the statute.

As a result, the California attorney general may receive requests to issue guidance regarding key ambiguous provisions of the statute, particularly its scope.

In the absence of such guidance, many companies may choose to adopt conservative interpretations of the statute, assuming, for example, that operating and making claims within California covers any business that sells to customers in the state and makes climate-related claims in product marketing or in general ESG publicity.

Planning and inventory With the VCMDA effective as of January 1, 2024, companies will need to act quickly to prepare for disclosure.

In addition to assessing the applicability of the VCMDA in light of the above-discussed statutory ambiguities, legal teams should make a plan for preparing disclosures required by the VCMDA.

This should include taking an inventory of climate-related claims and goals, as well as any offset purchases, and compiling all necessary information for disclosure under the VCMDA.

In addition to compiling straightforward factual information, such as the details of offset purchases, and determining which data and claims have been subject to third-party verification, compliance preparation also may include more substantive items, such as formalizing interim goals and preparing narrative descriptions of control processes other than third-party verification and SBTi sector pathways.

Extending climate governance The VCMDA highlights the importance of establishing legal oversight and controls covering climate-related activities beyond formal sustainability reporting  including offset purchases, product marketing statements and target setting."
Cooley,"New California Law Establishes Significant Disclosure Requirements Related to Climate Goals, Claims and Offsets Beginning January 1, 2024","While liability concerns and the proliferation of sustainability reporting regulations have caused many companies to invest in robust controls for climate disclosures included in ESG reports or SEC filings, that oversight does not always extend to target-setting or marketing claims.

Legal teams and boards should consider how to organize oversight of such matters, including integration into existing climate disclosure controls and board and management ESG oversight.

In particular, the VCMDA emphasizes the importance of subjecting climate claims and goals to rigorous processes prior to publication, including claims made in product advertising.

For many companies, an internal audit will play a key role in such efforts, as it has in formalizing climate-reporting programs.

In addition to extending climate governance to matters such as product-focused climate claims, given VCMDA disclosure and increased scrutiny of offset quality, companies should evaluate the role of offsets in their climate strategies and consider enhancing governance and diligence for any offset purchases.

Evaluating liability risks Penalties under the VCMDA are relatively low, with civil fines of not more than $2,500 for each day that required information is not made available or is inaccurate, with total penalties not to exceed $500,000.

Nonetheless, by heightening attention on climate claims and goals, as well as the quality of offset purchases, and increasing company disclosure on such topics, the VCMDA may create a heightened risk of litigation related to such matters, including anti-greenwashing enforcement actions, private consumer litigation or securities fraud actions.

As a result, passage of the VCMDA may prompt legal teams and boards to reevaluate the liability risks associated with climate-related statements included in product marketing or ESG publicity and to further invest in safeguards in these areas, including increased use of third-party verification.

Anti-greenwashing scrutiny has caused many companies to reevaluate existing climate claims and goals, and the VCMDA may increase pressure on companies to amend or retract statements that cannot be substantiated or have lost plausibility.

If you have any questions, or would like support adjusting to this new reporting regime, please contact a member of Cooleys international ESG & sustainability advisory team .

Notes The VCMDA defines voluntary carbon offsets as any product sold or marketed in the state that claims to be a greenhouse gas emissions offset, a voluntary emissions reduction, a retail offset or any like term that connotes that the product represents or corresponds to a reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere or that prevents the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that would have otherwise been emitted."

Cooley,California Adopts New Law Requiring VC Companies to Collect Diversity Data From Portfolio Company Founders,"Californias governor recently signed into law SB 54 , a bill intended to increase transparency regarding diversity of founding teams in the venture capital (VC) industry.

The new law will require VC companies, including venture capital funds (as defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940), with a nexus to California to report to the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) on the diversity of the founding members of companies in which they invest.

Overview SB 54 will require covered entities to collect and maintain diversity data about the founding teams of their portfolio companies and report such information to the CRD on an annual basis.

While the bill includes March 1, 2025, as the first reporting date, we expect this may get pushed back due to some comments from Gov. Gavin Newsom and possible litigation challenges, as discussed below.

Covered entities As defined in the bill, the term covered entity means a VC company that meets two requirements.

First, the VC company must either primarily engage in the business of investing in, or providing financing to, startup, early-stage or emerging growth companies, or manage assets on behalf of third-party investors, including, but not limited to, investments made on behalf of a state or local retirement or pension system.

Second, the VC company must have a nexus to California meeting any of the below criteria.

The VC company: Is headquartered in California.

Has a significant presence or operational office in California.

Makes venture capital investments in businesses that are located, or have significant operations, in California.

Solicits or receives investments from a person who is a resident of California.

Reporting requirements SB 54 requires covered entities to survey the founding team members of portfolio companies they have invested in over the prior calendar year and report the following to the CRD on an annual basis: Founding team demographic data A covered entity must report the following demographic information for the founding teams of all portfolio companies in which the covered entity invested in the prior calendar year (to the extent the information was provided pursuant to the survey described below): gender identity, including nonbinary and gender-fluid identities, race, ethnic identity, disability status, veteran status, whether such person identifies as LGBTQ+ and whether such person is a California resident, at an aggregated level and on an anonymized basis.

Investment in diverse founding teams data Covered entities also must report the total amount of investments in the prior calendar year in portfolio companies that were primarily founded by diverse founding teams (i.e., where at least half of the founding team is made up of people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives), as a percentage of venture capital investments made by the covered entity, in the aggregate and broken down according to the demographic categories listed above, as well as the total amount of money in venture capital investments the covered entity invested in each portfolio company during the prior calendar year and the principal place of business of each portfolio company in which the covered entity made an investment during the prior calendar year.

The CRD may publish this information on its website and is charged with enforcing the new law.

Failure to comply could result in a court action brought by the CRD and/or financial penalties.

Demographic survey Covered entities will be required to collect founding team member demographic data through a standardized survey that will be established by the CRD.

The survey must be delivered to founding team members after the covered entitys investment is completed  i.e., the survey cannot be included as part of the covered entitys pre-investment diligence."
Cooley,California Adopts New Law Requiring VC Companies to Collect Diversity Data From Portfolio Company Founders,"The survey must be delivered to founding team members after the covered entitys investment is completed  i.e., the survey cannot be included as part of the covered entitys pre-investment diligence.

Founding team members can decline to participate in the survey, and covered entities are required to provide written notice in connection with the survey that such founding team members decision to disclose their demographic information is voluntary, that no adverse action will be taken against the founding team member if they decline to participate in the survey, and that aggregate data collected for each demographic category will be reported to the CRD.

Survey results must be collected and reported in a manner that does not associate the survey response data with individual founding team members, and the covered entity must preserve data for at least four years after the report is delivered.

Timeline and potential changes As it currently stands, the first report will be due on March 1, 2025.

However, we expect additional guidance and clarification from the CRD and the governors office in the coming months, and it is possible (if not likely) that this timeline will be delayed.

In his letter on signing the bill, Newsom said the bill contains problematic provisions and unrealistic timelines that could present barriers to successful implementation and enforcement, and that his administration will propose cleanup language  to ensure this important policy to improve the diversity of venture capital investments can be implemented properly.

We also expect the statute may be subject to legal challenges that could delay implementation.

We are monitoring this new law and will keep clients updated on developments as they arise."
Cooley,CFPB Signals Desire to Expand Supervision of Nonbank Payments Firms,"During remarks at a payments-focused event on October 6, 2023, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

Director Rohit Chopra signaled that the bureau intends to expand its oversight of digital payments and the companies that provide these types of services.

Chopras statements provide additional insight into the CFPBs thinking about payments regulation and follow several recent bureau actions that highlight its particular interest in emerging payments activities.

Chopras remarks In his remarks, Chopra emphasized several key aspects of the CFPBs roadmap for exercising supervisory authority over consumer payments.

First, the CFPB intends to explore its authority under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to enable the bureau to conduct supervisory examinations of nonbanks operating consumer payment platforms, including when firms act as service providers to large depository institutions.

Chopra also noted that the CFPB may use its authority to define larger participants in the market by rule, which would subject nonbanks meeting a particular size threshold to supervision.

1 Second, Chopra signaled that the CFPB would issue additional demands to certain large technology firms regarding their use of personal data and any issuance of private currencies.

This remark builds on the CFPBs 2021 inquiry , in which the bureau ordered six large technology companies operating payments systems in the US to provide information about their business practices.

Third, Chopra discussed the need for cross-agency collaboration.

In particular, he said that the Financial Stability Oversight Council should use its authority under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank to designate the operation of a payments platform as an activity that either contains systemic risk or is likely to become a systemically important payment, clearing, or settlement activity.

Fourth, Chopra noted that the bureau is considering issuing new guidance regarding the applicability of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act [EFTA] with respect to private digital dollars and other virtual currencies.

Fifth, and less clearly defined, is the CFPBs interest in combating market concentration in consumer financial markets, and associated data use risks.

Chopra commented on his fear that the US is lurching toward a consolidated market structure, like the one that has emerged in China, that blurs the lines between payments and commerce and creates the incentives for excessive surveillance and even financial censorship  .

As we seek to configure a payments architecture that can provide safe and secure electronic cash, we should make sure that the deployment of private sector technologies and services are aligned with our values for fair competition, consumer protection, and our national interest.

Market power considerations While aspects of Chopras remarks provide additional insight into the CFPBs current thinking about how to approach payments regulation  especially with respect to the CFPBs desire to examine certain larger nonbank payments companies and the possibility of new virtual currency guidance  Chopra also reiterated many of the CFPBs previously articulated areas of emphasis.

In particular, Chopras concerns regarding the potential for data misuse within a consolidated market structure appear to be driving several recent bureau actions and initiatives.

For example: The CFPB press release announcing the aforementioned 2021 inquiry into six large payments platforms stated the bureaus view that the scale and market power of large technology companies raise concerns about potential new risks to consumers and to broader competition in the marketplace.

In comments to the House Financial Services Committee regarding upcoming rulemaking implementing 12 USC  5533 of Dodd-Frank, Chopra remarked that the bureau want[s] to make sure that standards are giving the ability for consumers and all market participants  to switch."
Cooley,CFPB Signals Desire to Expand Supervision of Nonbank Payments Firms,"Further, Chopra said that when a consumer has the power to vote with their feet, youll see how our system will give them better service as well.

The CFPB has published issue spotlights highlighting the potential impact of market concentration in consumer payments.

Also apparent from recent CFPB initiatives is the emphasis on collaboration between the bureau and other federal agencies in service of the regulation of large payments companies.

For example: A comment submitted by Federal Trade Commission Chair (FTC) Lina Khan in response to the CFPBs 2021 payments inquiry highlighted that these issues were of concern to the FTC, and that the commission would be looking to this inquiry and the findings it produces to help inform the FTCs work.

Last year, on the same day that the CFPB published a Consumer Financial Protection Circular stating its view that providing [i]nadequate security for the sensitive consumer information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by  [a] company can constitute an unfair practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 2 the FTC announced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking public comment on commercial surveillance practices.

Chopras comments on October 6, 2023, expressly called upon the Financial Stability Oversight Council to support the CFPBs efforts to regulate larger payments companies.

Applying EFTA to virtual currency As noted above, Chopra previewed that the CFPB is considering issuing new guidance regarding the applicability of the EFTA to certain private digital dollars and other virtual currencies.

While his remarks discussed the potential for regulation of stablecoins and/or central bank digital currencies via the EFTA, Chopra suggested that the CFPB is particularly focused on the status of credit card points under the law.

Noting the volume of questions the bureau receives on the issue, he suggested that bait-and-switch tactics, where issuers potentially misrepresent the benefits of points-based sign-up bonuses, is a point of specific focus.

Accordingly, issuers of what Chopra characterizes as private money (e.g., stablecoins, but in particular, credit card points) should remain alert for any further communications from the bureau regarding the scope of applicability of the EFTA.

Similarly, given the interest from the CFPB and other agencies, larger nonbank payments companies and the banks that partner with them should pay close attention to developments from the CFPB and other federal regulators.

Cooley,10-Step Plan for Employers Using Artificial Intelligence in Employment Processes,"Artificial intelligence has transformed the way we live, work and even think.

While AI offers seemingly endless potential benefits in the workplace  including improvements in efficiency, cost cutting and innovation  employers must balance those benefits with the legal risks of using AI tools in employment processes.

Employers using these tools also must attempt to keep up with regulatory and technological developments in a rapidly evolving space.

Below, weve outlined a 10-step plan for employers using AI-based tools in employment decision-making and related processes to best mitigate against the risks of using such tools.

Weve focused on the broad umbrella of tools powered by AI, including those using machine learning and/or natural language processing, that are used in employment processes.

These tools have become the center of focus from agencies such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), due to some tools incorporation of software that uses algorithmic decision-making at different stages of the employment process.

1. Identify the technology As a preliminary matter, employers need to identify existing AI technology used in the employment decision-making process, including how they are using it, and what technologies they may want to implement in the future.

According to EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows, more than 80% of employers use AI in some of their employment decision-making processes, but many employers might not realize the ubiquity and broad scope of tools using such technologies.

For example, AI technology may be used in sourcing and screening candidates, interviewing, onboarding, performance management, succession planning, talent management, and even diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) activities.

Some examples include rsum scanners, employee engagement/monitoring software, virtual training programs, virtual assistants or chatbots, video interviewing software, job fit or cultural fit testing software, and trait- or ability-revealing applicant gaming systems.

2. Understand the role of human oversight It is critical for employers to understand the role of human oversight in the use of AI tools.

Employers should ensure that a tool does not replace human judgment and any final decisions continue to be made by HR or management.

Human oversight is not only advisable from a legal perspective, but it also may mitigate distrust and employee morale issues arising from concerns of overreliance on AI technologies in employment decision-making.

3. Vet vendors, tools and data Vetting the vendor The explosion of AI tools designed for use in employment processes means that vendors will need to be carefully vetted as a threshold matter.

Employers may want to consider whether the vendors developers receive any training on detecting and preventing bias in the design and implementation of such tools.

Employers also may wish to consider whether vendors regularly consult with diversity, labor, or other outside experts to address and prevent bias issues, and they should be wary of any claims of bias-free or EEOC-compliant tools, as these representations have no legal effect.

In addition, employers should take a close look at any purchasing contracts made with vendors, with particular focus on how potential liability in connection with the tools use will be allocated.

Vetting the tool Employers should thoroughly vet any tool they wish to implement, including understanding how the tool works and how it makes any recommendations or conclusions.

As a preliminary matter, employers should consider the track record of the tool, including if and how long the tool in consideration has been used by other employers and the purposes for which they have been utilized."
Cooley,10-Step Plan for Employers Using Artificial Intelligence in Employment Processes,"Employers also should understand if and how the tool was developed for individuals with physical and mental disabilities  and ask whether any interface is accessible to individuals with disabilities, whether materials presented are available in alternative formats, and whether vendors attempted to determine whether using an algorithm disadvantages individuals with disabilities, such as where characteristics measured by the tool are correlated with certain disabilities.

Some tools may improperly screen out individuals with disabilities (including visual disabilities ), and employers should ask vendors how the tool mitigates or provides accommodations for that issue.

In addition, screen outs can occur if tools, such as chatbots, are programmed to reject all applicants who have gaps in their employment history, when such gaps may have resulted from disability-based reasons.

Vetting the data Understanding the data that the AI tool has been trained on is a critical part of vetting any AI tool.

Prior to using a tool, employers should mitigate any risk that a tool is a proxy for impermissible discrimination.

Such discrimination can occur where the data a tool is trained on is itself biased (e.g., an employers existing nondiverse employee population), leading to potentially biased results (i.e., the garbage in, garbage out problem).

Employers also may consider what statistical analyses have been run on the tools and how such analyses were selected.

4. Assemble the right team Several federal agencies recently asserted that many automated systems operate as black boxes whose internal workings are not clear to most people and, in some cases, even the developer of the tool and this lack of transparency often makes it all the more difficult for developers, businesses, and individuals to know whether an automated system is fair.

To mitigate against this asserted black box problem in the workplace, employers should ensure that they assemble a multidisciplinary team tasked with implementing and monitoring any AI tool.

This team should not only comprise members from human resources, legal, communications, marketing and DEI functions, but also members of IT, including those with backgrounds in software or data engineering.

Assembling the right team with the appropriate experience will help ensure all players understand, are aligned on, and are able to explain the business goals tied to using AI tools and how the tool reaches particular decisions or predictions.

Employers may want to designate a team member tasked with monitoring trends and technology developments in this evolving space.

5. Know the applicable laws While federal government regulation, for the most part, is still playing catch-up to the rapid advancement of AI technologies, employers using such technologies already are subject to numerous federal and state anti-discrimination, intellectual property, cybersecurity and data privacy laws.

In the employment space in particular, federal anti-discrimination laws  including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  collectively prohibit disparate treatment discrimination (intentional discrimination against members of a protected class) and disparate impact discrimination (facially neutral policies or practices that discriminate in practice against members of a protected class).

In addition, US states and local jurisdictions may impose more protective anti-discrimination laws.

The use of AI tools in certain instances can trigger compliance risks under other federal employment laws, such as the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act."
Cooley,10-Step Plan for Employers Using Artificial Intelligence in Employment Processes,"The use of AI tools in certain instances can trigger compliance risks under other federal employment laws, such as the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Federal contractors should note that the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs recently revised its scheduling letter and itemized listing to require employers to provide information and documents relating to the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, automated systems or other technology-based selection procedures.

Some jurisdictions specifically regulate certain AI technologies used in the workplace.

For example, as we reported in a May 2023 client alert , New York City recently began enforcing the Citys Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT) Law, which imposes several requirements for employers using a qualifying AEDT, including conducting an independent bias audit of the AEDT and making available certain information about data collected by the tool.

The Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act also imposes notification, consent, deletion and reporting requirements for jobs based in Illinois.

Maryland House Bill 1202 similarly requires applicant consent for employers to use facial recognition technology during pre-employment job interviews.

Employers navigating this complex area will need to ensure that their use of AI tools complies with all applicable laws.

6. Have appropriate policies in place Employers should consider whether to implement policies identifying and addressing appropriate use of AI technologies in employment processes.

In a policy, employers should be transparent about how the tool operates, what data is being used, and how  if at all  the tool assists with decision-making processes.

With clear language identifying how such tools are used, employees and applicants can be better informed, and employment decisions such as hiring and promotion can be perceived as more fair.

Any applicable policies should be communicated and updated regularly.

7. Implement training and education Any AI use policies should be communicated to employees, preferably through training and education programs.

Management-level employees also should receive education and training on AI tools, including applicable legal requirements regulating the use of such tools, the potential for tools to perpetuate bias or discrimination if used improperly, the importance of human oversight, and concerns regarding incorrect or misleading outputs.

8.

Ensure accommodations are available Employers using AI tools should prepare their managers and HR teams to recognize and evaluate accommodations requests from applicants and employees.

Even though some laws, such as New York Citys AEDT Law, do not explicitly require that employers provide an accommodation (only that individuals are provided notice that they may request an accommodation or alternative selection process), accommodations are required under the federal ADA and New York City and state human rights laws.

The EEOC and the White House have cautioned against screening out candidates based on inaccessibility to a human alternative to an AI tool.

9. Conduct regular testing and audits Once deployed, AI tools should be evaluated and regularly monitored to ensure that business objectives for using the tool continue to be met, the tool is implemented in a fair and unbiased manner, and any adjustments may be made.

Even if the tool has been subject to an audit prior to being used, employers should continue to conduct such audits at least on an annual basis, as the implementation of the tool in any particular workforce can result in unforeseeable issues."
Cooley,10-Step Plan for Employers Using Artificial Intelligence in Employment Processes,"For instance, the White Houses Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights suggests that automated systems be regularly monitored for algorithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not accounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the context of use or associated data.

Audits also should be conducted in coordination with legal counsel.

10. Pay attention to the rapidly evolving AI landscape Employers, especially those operating in multiple jurisdictions, need to stay up to date on potential laws and regulations regarding AI in employment processes.

For example, new laws similar to  or even more stringent than  NYCs AEDT law have been proposed in New York state, New Jersey, California, Massachusetts and Washington, DC, while other states have created task forces to advise and propose regulations governing such tools in the employment context.

In California, a new state agency  the California Privacy Protection Agency  is tasked with addressing automated decision-making technology.

Although there is no current comprehensive federal legislation, several bills and frameworks are in consideration, such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumers SAFE Innovation framework and the No Robot Bosses Act .

Conclusion AI tools will continue to revolutionize the workplace.

Employers should keep on top of these rapid developments and implement best practices for mitigating legal risk in using such tools.

Employers with questions regarding the use of AI tools should contact their Cooley employment lawyer."
Cooley,UK Antitrust Regulator Outlines Guiding Principles for AI Foundation Model Market,"Like many regulators across the globe, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been hypervigilant in watching the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model market.

Following a five-month initial review into the market launched earlier this year , the CMA published its initial report on the UK market for AI foundation models on 18 September 2023.

The report outlines a series of proposed guiding principles for the AI foundation model market, which will be relevant to any organisations that are developing or deploying foundation models in the UK.

Supported by an overarching principle of accountability for outputs created by AI systems, the CMAs proposed guiding principles focus on three key areas: Foundation model development  with key principles of access and diversity.

Use of foundation models in other markets  with key principles of choice, flexibility, and fair dealing.

Use of foundation models by consumers  with a key principle of transparency.

The report does not call out any current competition concerns or advocate for any immediate regulatory intervention.

However, a golden thread that runs throughout the report is the CMAs objective to ensure that vibrant competition and innovation are promoted in the development of the foundation model market.

The CMAs objectives outlined in the report echo recent statements from Lina Khan , chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), who highlighted that the FTC is watching the sector closely.

It is clear that regulators in the US and UK do not want to be caught behind the curve in regulating this important and emergent market.

Foundation model development Key principle: Access A key focus of the report is on a need to maintain an ability for organisations to access the key resources needed to successfully develop a foundation model  data, computing power, technical expertise and capital.

In the report, the CMA highlights a need to make sure that successful early movers in the market do not gain entrenched and disproportionate market power through creating economies of scale and benefiting from the positive feedback loops, which drive model improvement and come from high volume user engagement with AI systems in the wild.

The report notes that a positive market outcome would be a dynamic market in which a range of foundation model developers are able to gain access to these resources, on reasonable terms, allowing them to effectively challenge these incumbents and early movers.

Key principle: Diversity The report highlights a need to maintain a sustained diversity of business models, supported by the availability of both closed-source and open-source foundation models.

The CMA identifies that there are a variety of ways in which a model could be considered to be open  e.g., some may simply be the raw ingredients for the model and require costly and time-consuming development and pre training, while others may come pre-trained with weights and biases, meaning they only require relatively inexpensive and quick fine-tuning.

The CMA observes that many significant players in the market have already open-sourced certain models  including a number of high-performing, fine-tuned models  and notes that this has led to vibrant innovation in the sector.

The CMA notes that the continued availability of these open-source models will help reduce barriers to entry for new players.

Conversely, if access to key resources, such as data, computing power, technical expertise and capital, were restricted to only a handful of firms, the CMAs concern is that larger and more successful market players might be able and incentivised to provide only closed-source models, potentially resulting in entrenchment and disproportionate market power."
Cooley,UK Antitrust Regulator Outlines Guiding Principles for AI Foundation Model Market,"Use of foundation models in other markets Key principle: Choice The CMAs position is that positive market outcomes are likely to follow if downstream firms have effective choice as to how to incorporate models into their products or services  e.g., through application programming interfaces (APIs) and plug ins  including through the ability to develop models in house (an approach that would likely be supported by the continued availability of pre-trained, open-source models).

Key principle: Flexibility Touching on a common regulatory goal of driving moves toward increased interoperability in the tech space, the CMA highlights the benefits of: Organisations deploying foundation models being able to mix and match multiple foundation models.

Consumers having the ability to easily switch the best solutions without technical or contractual restrictions.

Key principle: Fair dealing The report also highlights concerns around potential anticompetitive effects that could hinder successful exploitation of downstream services enabled by foundation models  where firms that might acquire market power impose anticompetitive contractual terms or engage in anticompetitive conduct (e.g., by foreclosing other upstream or downstream services).

Use of foundation models by consumers Key principle:

Transparency The report calls for consumers and downstream firms to be provided with information about the use and limitations of technologies supported by foundation models.

To support this principle, the CMA impresses the importance of developers giving organisations that deploy their technology the information needed to allow them to manage their responsibilities to consumers (e.g., through the use of model cards that can be used to provide users and deployers with basic information about a model).

Next steps The CMA itself concedes that it does not view the guiding principles as the finished article; rather, they are a product of continuing dialogue with the sector and inform its thinking and development of the principles.

The CMA is planning to commence a significant programme of engagement and speak to a wide range of interested parties  ranging from consumer groups and academics to leading foundation model developers and deployers, along with innovators and new entrants to the market.

The emphasis of the report is that the CMA is very much seeking a collaborative approach with the sector.

That said, it is also clear from the report that the CMA is closely watching the sector and will not hesitate to intervene should competition or consumer issues begin to emerge.

The next occasion on which we will gain insight into the CMAs thinking will be early 2024, when it will publish an update on its principles  including its view as to how those principles have been received and adopted across the market, as well as further market trends.

How can we help?

If you receive an information or meeting request from the CMA or want to proactively engage in dialogue with the CMA, please contact one of the Cooley lawyers listed below for assistance."
Cooley,Treasury Department Issues Proposed Regulations for Brokers of ‘Digital Assets’,"On August 25, 2023, the US Department of the Treasury issued proposed regulations that would impose new information reporting requirements for brokers that facilitate certain transactions involving digital assets  if finalized in their present form.

The proposed regulations were issued to implement certain changes to Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , as amended, made by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to improve tax administration and compliance with respect to trading and investing in digital assets.

1

What is a digital asset?

For purposes of the proposed regulations, a digital asset is a digital representation of value that is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger (or any similar technology), without regard to whether each individual transaction involving that digital asset is actually recorded on that ledger.

Cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and stablecoins generally would be considered digital assets under this definition.

The US dollar or a foreign currency (i.e., fiat currency) in digital form (such as funds held in an online account with a bank or payment processor) and virtual assets that exist only in a closed system (such as video game tokens that can only be used in game and cannot be sold or exchanged outside the game or sold for fiat currency) would not be considered digital assets under this definition.

Under the proposed regulations, the sale of an asset that qualifies both as a security and as a digital asset must be reported only as a sale of a digital asset, although brokers also may be required to provide additional information for these sales.

A similar coordination rule is provided for the sale of an asset that qualifies both as a commodity and as a digital asset.

Who would be considered a broker with respect to digital assets?

Any person that in the ordinary course of a trade or business stands ready to effect sales of digital assets to be made by others would be considered a broker for purposes of the proposed regulations.

A broker also would include a person that regularly offers to redeem digital assets that were created or issued by that person (even if the person actually makes redemptions only occasionally), such as digital assets issued in initial coin offerings or redemptions of stablecoins.

A broker also would include a digital asset middleman that provides facilitative services that effectuate sales of digital assets by customers, provided that the nature of the service arrangement is such that the person ordinarily would know or be in a position to know the identity of the party that makes the sale and the nature of the transaction potentially giving rise to gross proceeds.

A facilitative service is defined in the proposed regulations as any service that directly or indirectly effectuates a sale of digital assets  such as providing a party in the sale with access to an automatically executing smart contract or protocol, access to digital asset trading platforms, order matching services, market making functions to offer buy and sell prices, or escrow or escrow-like services to ensure both parties to an exchange act in accordance with their obligations.

These definitions are intended to limit brokers to persons who have the ability to obtain information that is relevant for tax compliance purposes, but would include decentralized exchanges that currently may have a policy of not requesting (or making only limited requests for) customer information  but could update their smart contracts or protocols to obtain additional customer information."
Cooley,Treasury Department Issues Proposed Regulations for Brokers of ‘Digital Assets’,"Thus, digital asset trading platforms that also provide hosted wallet services, certain unhosted wallet providers, operators of non-custodial trading platforms or websites (including those that effectuate trades through smart contracts or protocols), digital asset payment processors, and operators and owners of physical electronic terminals or kiosks to effect sales of digital assets generally would be subject to reporting under the proposed regulations.

The preamble to the proposed regulations observes that founders, development teams or investors may have the ability to control changes to a decentralized exchange platform or to modify or replace smart contracts, or a holder of a significant amount of governance tokens may routinely take actions on behalf of the platform, and therefore could come within the definition of a broker for purposes of the proposed regulations.

The Treasury Department and the IRS recognize that some stakeholders may have privacy concerns with providing personal identity information to decentralized exchanges and have requested comments on alternative approaches that could reduce these concerns while satisfying tax compliance objectives.

Persons solely engaged in the business of providing distributed ledger validation services (e.g., miners and stakers) or selling hardware or licensing software for which the sole function is to permit persons to control private keys used for accessing digital assets on a distributed ledger generally would not be considered to provide facilitative services.

However, the provision of wallet software would not be excluded from the definition of facilitative services if the software also provides users with direct access to trading platforms from the wallet platform.

Which transactions involving digital assets would be subject to reporting?

A sale that is subject to reporting under the proposed regulations generally includes exchanges of digital assets for cash, stored-value cards (such as gift cards), different digital assets, property of a type that is subject to reporting under Section 6045 (such as securities or real property) or broker services.

A person that is already a broker under existing law and that accepts digital assets from a customer as payment will be subject to the reporting requirements of the proposed regulations.

For example, if a stockbroker accepts a digital asset as payment from a customer, the customer generally will recognize gain or loss on the disposition of the digital asset (as set forth in existing IRS guidance).

In that case, the stockbroker generally will be required to file an information return and provide information to the customer with respect to this disposition, regardless of whether the broker  regularly as part of its trade or business  accepts digital assets as consideration.

Transactions that would not be considered a sale include the receipt of new digital assets without disposing of something else in exchange (e.g., digital assets received from an airdrop or a hard fork), and the receipt of digital assets in exchange for services by a person that is not a broker within the meaning of Section 6045, such as a reward for marketing-related services (e.g., completing a survey).

The proposed regulations do not address whether reporting is required for a loan of digital assets, a transfer of digital assets to and from a liquidity pool by a liquidity pool provider, or the wrapping and unwrapping of digital assets.

What information would need to be reported?

Brokers of sales involving digital assets would be required to report certain information that generally is similar to the information reported on IRS Form 1099-B with respect to securities including the customers name, address and taxpayer identification number; the name or type of digital asset sold and the number of units sold; the date and time of the sale; and the gross proceeds of the sale."
Cooley,Treasury Department Issues Proposed Regulations for Brokers of ‘Digital Assets’,"In addition, brokers would be required to report the transaction identification or hash for the digital asset sale, the digital asset address(es) from which the digital asset was transferred, and whether the consideration received was cash, different digital assets, other property or services.

Brokers would be required to report this information on a new tax form (IRS Form 1099-DA).

The proposed regulations would further require certain digital asset brokers to report cost basis information with respect to digital assets, which would be treated as covered securities.

Until future rulemaking under Section 6045A is complete, mandatory basis reporting would be limited to digital assets that are acquired in a customers account by a broker providing hosted wallet services in exchange for cash, stored-value cards, different digital assets, property of a type that is subject to reporting under Section 6045 (such as securities or real property) or broker services.

Sales transactions effected by custodial brokers of digital assets that were not previously acquired in the customers account and sale transactions effected by non-custodial brokers, such as decentralized exchanges, are not subject to mandatory basis reporting until future regulations are promulgated.

Although mandatory basis reporting would not take effect until January 1, 2026, it would apply with respect to digital assets that were acquired in an account on or after January 1, 2023.  

Digital asset brokers therefore should consider implementing systems to implement cost basis tracking in anticipation of the finalization of these rules.

However, in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRS requested comments on whether the requirements should apply only to digital assets acquired on a date after the finalization of the proposed regulations.

Do the proposed regulations apply to sales effected outside the United States or to foreign persons?

The proposed regulations classify a broker as a US digital asset broker, controlled foreign corporation (CFC) digital asset broker or non-US digital asset broker, and provide rules for determining the location of a digital asset sale for each type of broker.

The reporting requirements generally are more stringent for US digital asset brokers and CFC digital asset brokers than for non-US digital asset brokers.

All sales of digital assets by a US digital asset broker are considered effected at an office inside the United States, and the broker is required to report information with respect to sales effected for its customers  unless the broker can treat the customer as an exempt recipient under existing rules or as an exempt foreign person under certain proposed presumption rules, or on the basis of certain tax documentation.

If a CFC digital asset broker or a non-US digital asset broker conducts activities as a money services business within the meaning of the Bank Secrecy Act, 2 the broker generally will be subject to the same rules as a US digital asset broker.

The Treasury Department and the IRS are considering extending this rule to CFC digital asset brokers and non-US digital asset brokers that are regulated by other US regulators, on the basis that these brokers may have sufficient contacts with the United States to warrant the same diligence and reporting rules as those that apply to US digital asset brokers.

Sales effected by a CFC digital asset broker not conducting activities as a money services business are considered effected at an office outside the United States, but nevertheless are required to be reported under the proposed regulations  unless effected for an exempt recipient or an exempt foreign person.

This is consistent with existing regulations for securities brokers, which require CFCs to report on sales effected inside or outside the United States unless an exception applies."
Cooley,Treasury Department Issues Proposed Regulations for Brokers of ‘Digital Assets’,"This is consistent with existing regulations for securities brokers, which require CFCs to report on sales effected inside or outside the United States unless an exception applies.

Sales by a non-US digital asset broker not conducting activities as a money services business generally are treated as effected at an office outside the United States  unless the broker collects documentation or information (e.g., under applicable anti-money laundering rules) indicating that the customer has connections to the United States or may be a US person.

In the absence of such an indication, this type of non-US digital asset broker would not be considered a broker and would not be required to report the sale.

If such an indication exists, the sale is treated as effected at an office inside the United States, and the non-US digital asset broker is required to report sales effected on behalf of this customer after the broker obtains that documentation or information  unless the broker determines that the customer is an exempt foreign person or an exempt recipient, or the broker closes the account before effecting the sale for the customer.

When would the proposed regulations apply if finalized in their present form?

The proposed regulations would require brokers to report the gross proceeds from sales of digital assets effected on or after January 1, 2025.

Brokers also would be required to report the adjusted basis and character of gain or loss for sales of digital assets that constitute covered securities (within the meaning of Treasury Department regulations, Section 1.6045-1(a)(15) ) that are effected on or after January 1, 2026, with respect to digital assets that were acquired in an account on or after January 1, 2023.

As noted above, until future rulemaking under Section 6045A is complete, basis reporting is limited to digital assets that are acquired in a customers account by a broker providing hosted wallet services.

Notes Under the IIJA, information reporting requirements for digital assets would have applied to taxpayers who disposed of digital assets beginning after December 31, 2022.

However, on December 23, 2022, the IRS issued Announcement 2023-2 , which delayed information reporting by brokers with respect to dispositions or transfers of digital assets until final regulations were issued.

31 USC 5311 et seq."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"California climate bills to be signed into law This month, The Associated Press reported that California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to sign into law a pair of far-reaching climate disclosure bills that will impact many large US companies, regardless of where they are based.

The first bill  SB 253  will require public and private companies that have more than $1 billion in annual revenues and qualify as ""doing business"" in California to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beginning in 2026.

Businesses would have to report their own emissions from operations and energy use (Scopes 1 and 2) beginning in 2026, and their indirect emissions from supply chains, contractors and consumer use of their products (Scope 3) beginning in 2027.

Importantly, because Scope 3 reporting will be required, many companies with revenues well below $1 billion that are not directly subject to the reporting obligations should expect to come under additional pressure from their customers and vendors to calculate and produce GHG emissions data.

Under the final bill, Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures will require independent third-party assurance, while more limited third-party assurance for Scope 3 emissions will be required in 2030.

The second bill  SB 261  will require public and private companies that have more than $500 million in annual revenues and qualify as ""doing business"" in California to prepare reports disclosing their climate-related financial risk in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and describe their measures adopted to reduce and adapt to that risk.

This requirement will begin on January 1, 2026, and will continue biennially thereafter.

Notably, while these bills are poised to be adopted as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still preparing the final version of its own climate disclosure rules, it is likely that once the initial SEC disclosures are adopted, they will apply to large accelerated filers for fiscal year 2024.

As a result, for those companies, SEC disclosures may be due in 2025, a year in advance of Californias reporting obligations.

Corp Fin issues new C&DIs on Rule 10b5-1 plans On August 25, 2023, the SEC Division of Corporation Finance (Corp Fin) posted several new Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DIs) related to the final rules regarding Rule 10b5-1 plans that were adopted by the SEC in December 2022.

The final rules impose new conditions on the availability of the Rule 10b5-1 affirmative defense and require enhanced disclosures regarding Rule 10b5-1 plans, option grants and insider trading policies, while also adding a checkbox to Forms 4 and 5 to indicate whether a transaction is made pursuant to a plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c).

For more information on the final rules, refer to this December 2022 client alert and this January 2023 PubCo post .

The new C&DIs address the calculation of the mandated cooling-off period triggered by entering into or materially modifying a plan, overlapping plans involving 401(k) plans, the new Form 4 checkbox, and disclosures about adoption and termination of trading arrangements under Item 408(a) of Reg S-K. In brief: Question 120.29 clarifies that for purposes of the later of cooling-off period applicable to directors and Section 16 officers, the date of disclosure of the issuers financial results is the filing date of the relevant Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, and the first business day would be the next business day that follows the filing date."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"Question 120.30 addresses a scenario where an administrator of a 401(k) plan uses issuer cash advances to purchase stock in the open market to make matching grants to plan participants, clarifying that a participant that relies on Rule 10b5-1 to participate in the 401(k) plan also can rely on Rule 10b5-1 for a concurrent plan for purchases or sales on the open market without running afoul of the restriction on overlapping plans.

Question 120.31 explicitly states that the Rule 10b5-1(c) checkbox in Form 4 should not be checked for trades pursuant to 10b5-1 plans adopted prior to the final rules.

Question 133A.01 clarifies that Item 408(a)(1) does not require disclosure of the termination of a plan that ends by its own terms due to its expiration or completion.

Question 133A.02 confirms that Item 408(a) picks up any 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-10b5-1 trading arrangement in which an officer or director has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest that is reportable under Section 16, provided that the officer or director made the decision to adopt or terminate the arrangement.

SEC finds Form 12b-25 disclosures inadequate On August 22, 2023, the SEC announced settled charges against five companies for failing to disclose in their Form 12b-25 filings that their request to delay quarterly or annual reporting was caused by an anticipated restatement or correction to prior financial reporting.

Filing a Form12b-25 Notification of Late Filing is required of public companies when they are unable to file a periodic report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense and are seeking additional time to file the applicable report in order for such report to be considered timely.

When filing this form, companies are required to disclose why their quarterly or annual report could not be filed on time, in addition to revealing any anticipated significant changes in results of operations from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

The SEC orders found that each of the five companies announced restatements or corrections to their financial reporting shortly after the Form 12b-25 filing, within a range of three days to three weeks, despite failing to disclose that anticipated restatements or corrections were among the principal reasons for their late filings.

The orders also found that the companies failed to disclose that management anticipated significant changes in results of operations from the prior fiscal year.

These actions serve as a reminder that companies filing a Form 12b-25 should take special care to ensure their disclosures in the form address these requirements.

Massachusetts case cautions careful preparation of disclosures regarding pending litigation A recent case from the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts serves as a cautionary tale to companies making public statements about the merits or prospects of pending litigation.

In this example, a securities fraud class action case was brought against Pegasystems based on statements made by the company regarding pending litigation against it.

In the prior litigation, a competitor filed a complaint against Pega for $3 billion, after which the company described the litigation in its Form 10-K, stating that the claims were without merit, the company had strong defenses to these claims and any alleged damages claimed by [the competitor] are not supported by the necessary legal standard.

Pega subsequently lost the case and was ordered to pay $2 billion in damages, leading to a claim of fraud against the company for the Form 10-K disclosure.

The court highlighted in the finding for the plaintiffs the difference between stating that a claim is without merit and a mere statement that Pega had legal defenses against those claims."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"The court highlighted in the finding for the plaintiffs the difference between stating that a claim is without merit and a mere statement that Pega had legal defenses against those claims.

The court continued to say that this does not mean that Pega was under the obligation to confess to the wrongdoing in its disclosure, as an issuer may legitimately oppose a claim against it, even when it possesses subjective knowledge that the facts underlying the claims against it are true, but continued to state that issuers must do so with exceptional care, so as not to mislead investors.

SEC enforcement focuses on related party transaction disclosure The SEC recently settled two enforcement actions that indicate the staff is closely analyzing disclosures regarding related party transactions.

In the first action, the SEC announced charges against Maximus for failing to disclose that it employed two siblings of one of its executive officers, for which the company agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty.

In the second action, the SEC announced charges against Lyft for failing to disclose a directors role in a shareholders sale of approximately $424 million in private shares of Lyfts stock before the companys initial public offering.

According to the SECs press release, before Lyfts IPO in March 2019, a Lyft board director arranged for a shareholder to sell [their] shares to a [SPV] set up by an investment adviser affiliated with the same director.

According to the SEC, that same director then contacted an investor interested in purchasing the shares through the SPV, and Lyft was a participant in the transaction by virtue of approving the sale and securing several terms in the contract.

The director also received millions of dollars in compensation from the investment advisory for his role in structuring and negotiating the deal, which Lyft failed to disclose in its Form 10-K in 2019.

To settle these charges, Lyft agreed to pay a $10 million penalty.

Given the enhanced scrutiny around these types of disclosures, companies should carefully consider all potential related party transactions to ensure compliance with Item 404 of Regulation S-K. For more information, refer to this September 2023 PubCo post .

SEC brings another enforcement action for discouraging whistleblowing On September 21, 2023, the SEC charged CBRE for violating an SEC whistleblower protection rule.

According to the SEC, CBRE was using an employee release form that allegedly violated the rule, as CBRE took action to impede potential whistleblowers from reporting complaints to the Commission by conditioning separation pay on employees signing the release form.

This case should remind companies to precisely draft relevant provisions in their separation agreements to ensure they do not run afoul of the SECs whistleblower rules.

FASB approves expanded tax disclosure requirements and adopts crypto accounting and disclosure rule On August 30, 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) had approved new standards to require companies to disclose more details about the income taxes they pay to government authorities.

Under the new standard, both public and private companies will be required to break out income taxes that were paid to authorities at the federal, state and foreign levels for the full year in annual financial reports.

If a jurisdiction represents more than 5% of the taxes for the year, businesses will need to identify that jurisdiction and specify the amount in their annual reports.

Public companies also will be required to: Disclose detail on how they reconcile their domestic statutory rate with the rate they actually paid."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"Public companies also will be required to: Disclose detail on how they reconcile their domestic statutory rate with the rate they actually paid.

Present a standardized table showing how categories such as state and local income taxes, foreign taxes, tax credits and the enactment of new tax laws contribute to the difference between the two rates by providing the percentages and dollar amounts.

The requirements are set to go into effect for public companies beginning with their 2025 annual reports and for private companies one year later.

The FASB expects to formally issue the new standard by the end of 2023.

On September 6, 2023, the WSJ also reported that the FASB adopted the first crypto accounting and disclosure rule for companies .

Under this new standard, companies will be required to use fair-value accounting for bitcoin and certain other crypto assets.

This is a change companies were calling for, as it will allow them to recognize losses and gains immediately and treat digital assets like some financial assets.

Public company financial statements will have to disclose crypto assets on a quarterly and annual basis, while private companies must do the same in whichever financial reports they compile.

Gains and losses on crypto assets also will now have to be included by companies in their net income.

The rule is set to go into effect for 2025 annual reports for calendar-year public and private companies.

The FASB expects to formally issue the new rule by the end of 2023.

Foreign private issuers to potentially become subject to Section 16 Section 6081 of the new National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 would amend Section 16(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to make insiders of foreign private issuers (FPIs) subject to Section 16.

In effect, the amendment would eliminate the longstanding exemption from Section 16 set forth in Exchange Act Rule 3a12-3 applicable to securities registered by FPIs and would subject insiders (i.e., directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders) of FPIs to report their ownership and transactions in the securities of the FPI, in addition to insiders becoming subject to the short-swing profit provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

In July 2023, the bill passed the House (H.R. 2670) and then passed the Senate with amendments (S. 2226).

The provision that would repeal the Section 16 exemption for FPIs is not yet law, and both the House and Senate will have to resolve their differences before the bill reaches the president for signature.

If enacted, the SEC will have to first propose, then adopt, rules to repeal the Section 16 exemption granted to FPIs within 90 days of enactment.

Another sweep?

SEC charges multiple companies and insiders with untimely reporting under Sections 16 and 13(d) On September 27, 2023, the SEC announced charges against six officers, directors and major shareholders of public companies for failing to timely report information about their holdings and transactions in company stock on Form 4 and Schedules 13D and 13G. Five publicly traded companies also were charged for contributing to the filing failures by insiders or for failing to report their insiders filing delinquencies.

Using data analytics, SEC staff identified the insiders charged as repeatedly filing these reports late.

Those charged were assessed penalties ranging from $66,000 to $200,000.

In commenting on these cases, SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said, These enforcement actions also make clear that we will not hesitate to charge companies for causing their insiders disclosure violations where the companies took on the responsibility for making relevant filings for their insiders, and then acted negligently.

According to the deputy enforcement director, Several years ago, we undertook a similar initiative to root out repeated late filers."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"According to the deputy enforcement director, Several years ago, we undertook a similar initiative to root out repeated late filers.

Todays enforcement action should serve to remind SEC filers that reporting obligations under the securities laws are not optional, and there are consequences for failing to file required forms in a timely manner.

The SECs announcement referenced an ongoing investigation of potential beneficial ownership violations.

Potential government shutdown looms On September 27, 2023, the SECs Corp Fin posted an announcement regarding its plans in the event of a federal government shutdown, which indicates that its activities would be extremely limited.

According to the announcement, although the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system would continue to operate and accept filings, Corp Fin will not be able to accelerate the effectiveness of registration statements.

In light of the uncertainty, Corp Fin suggests that registrants with pending registration or offering statements that are substantially complete, and that have met all statutory requirements to request acceleration of the effective date (including the dissemination of any draft registration statement for the required periods under Securities Act Section 6(e) or the related Division accommodations) or qualification, may want to consider requesting effectiveness or qualification while the Division continues its normal operations.

Corp Fin has posted a series of FAQs primarily addressing companies in the registration process (or contemplating offerings) but potentially caught in the shutdown, in addition to FAQs about shareholder proposals and guidance.

Corp Fin plans to post updates on operating status on the SECs website."
Cooley,The Benefits and Perils of Expedited Arbitration Clauses,"Companies often complain that international arbitration can be as long of a process as litigation.

Therefore, they inquire about faster ways of resolving disputes, such as resorting to expedited arbitration.

Many arbitration rules incorporate this alternative, and it can be a powerful tool, but there may be several perils associated with it that companies should consider when deciding whether to expedite their arbitration.

The problem, the common solution and the problem with the solution Many corporate users believe arbitration  domestic and international  has become slow, costly and too much like litigation.

In response, clients are demanding expedited arbitral procedures.

While that objective is understandable, in some cases, the remedy may be worse than the disease.

Parties are now including time limits in their arbitration clauses  often with unrealistic deadlines that do not provide sufficient time for what the arbitral process requires.

Deadlines that are too ambitious could render the resulting award unenforceable, defeating the main purpose of the arbitration.

While these clauses offer advantages in terms of an early award, they can favor the deep-pocketed party or the first mover and can seriously prejudice the smaller party in the event of a dispute.

The problems with arbitration deadline clauses First, arbitration deadline clauses are often unrealistically aggressive and do not allow sufficient time to form a tribunal, prepare submissions and hold a hearing.  

They also often make no allowances for the other inevitable exigencies of dispute resolution  which is especially true in significant or complex cases.

Second, these clauses can be viewed as temporally restricting the tribunals jurisdiction, such that a late award may be unenforceable on the theory that the tribunals jurisdiction has been time-constrained by the parties (under the doctrine of functus officio ).

How to provide for functional expedited arbitration Clients that desire speedy proceedings should either use an institutional form of expedited arbitration or draft a bespoke arbitration clause that avoids the flaws in deadline clauses and provides for a realistic arbitration process.

Recommendations and best practices Strongly consider using the expedited rules of an established institution that actively administers its cases and allows the institution or tribunal to use its judgment in modifying the expedited procedures.

If you use a bespoke clause, draft for realistic time periods and allow deadlines to be extended by the tribunal (or institution) when necessary.

Be aware of the potential prejudice to the client in agreeing to accelerated arbitration and forgoing certain forms of process, such as document disclosure.

Institutional expedited arbitration Many of the major arbitral institutions have developed expedited arbitration rules that are tried and tested.

Typically, these rules impose abbreviated proceedings, limit or eliminate hearings, establish (extendable) deadlines for issuing the final award and vest the arbitrator and/or the institution with broad authority to truncate the process.

Some also give the institution the power to appoint a sole arbitrator, even if the parties agreed to three.

Expedited rules tend to apply automatically when the amount in dispute is below a defined threshold, but they also allow users to opt into the procedures for larger disputes.

The ICDR, the ICC, the LCIA, the SCC, the SIAC, the HKIAC, CPR and JAMS all provide for expedited procedures.

Drafting considerations for functional expedited arbitration clauses Provide for a presumptive deadline but give the tribunal discretion to extend it.

The clause should grant the tribunal the power to extend the deadline for good cause, on a finding that more time is required due to the complexity of the case, on account of unforeseen circumstances or in the interest of due process."
Cooley,The Benefits and Perils of Expedited Arbitration Clauses,"Any target date for the award should run from the constitution of the tribunal or (better yet)

the first case management conference or procedural hearing.

It can take months to form a tribunal, which can eat up a significant portion of the expedited timeframe.

Consider providing for a sole arbitrator.

Frequently, delays are created by the inability of three busy arbitrators to coordinate their calendars.

Rethinking the need for expedited arbitration: Is it really essential?

Parties should not forget that there is a relationship between time, on the one hand, and quality of processes and decision-making on the other.

Arbitral awards are generally not reviewable for errors of fact or law, and arbitrations sometimes offer what is effectively rough justice.

While expedited arbitration may be suited to simple, low-value disputes, when used for complex, significant or high-value cases, the effects can have a significant impact.

For example, where a smaller intellectual property (IP) owner has contracted with a larger player providing capital and support, a dispute may have far-reaching consequences concerning the use or misappropriation of the smaller companys IP.

Expedited procedures may prevent thorough development of all the issues and can be used tactically by the larger party to rush an important decision or gain leverage in settlement discussions.

Before agreeing to expedited arbitration, consider the following factors: The importance of the relationship in commercial and economic terms.

The likely nature of any dispute  the complexity of the relationship, the nature of recurring disputes, the magnitude of likely disputes and whether key assets or freedom to operate may be at issue.

The need for document disclosure.

Tight deadlines make accommodating any sort of document disclosure difficult to manage.

Expedited arbitrations require intensive effort in a short period of time.

Is the client ready and able to commit the resources required to support an accelerated arbitration?

Cooley,CFPB Proposes Removing Medical Debt From Credit Reports While Also Eyeing Broad FCRA Expansion,"On September 21, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced details of its anticipated rulemaking under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

In connection with the announcement, the CFPB also issued an Outline of Proposals and Alternatives Under Consideration (the outline).

While the messaging and remarks delivered with the outline focus on the CFPBs proposal to ban medical debt collection information from consumer reports and prevent lenders from using such information in underwriting, the outline actually reflects a wide range of consumer reporting proposals and builds upon the bureaus recently announced plan to regulate certain data brokers under the FCRA .

If implemented, these proposals would expand the FCRAs reach and have a significant impact on traditional consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), furnishers, users of consumer report information, certain data brokers and potentially the entities that provide consumer information to and receive consumer information from such data brokers.

Proposed restrictions on the use of medical debt information As previewed in the outline, the CFPBs preliminary proposal would effectively strike medical debt on consumer reports and prevent lenders from using medical debt collections information in underwriting determinations.

The bureau has long maintained that, unlike other credit reporting sources, medical debt tradelines fail to accurately predict a consumers creditworthiness.

In early 2022, shortly after the No Surprises Act took effect, the bureau issued a compliance bulletin asserting that CRAs could violate the FCRA if they issued consumer reports reflecting inaccurate information about medical debts.

The CFPB also released a report detailing the adverse impact of medical debt information in consumer reports.

Earlier this year, the three nationwide CRAs voluntarily began removing certain medical debt information on consumer reports.

In addition to the CFPBs recent focus on regulating medical debt, in July 2023, the White House published a request for information on financial products used to pay for healthcare  including medical credit cards and installment loans.  

This is part of a broader effort to reduce the burden of medical debt , by the CFPB, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of the Treasury.

Recent CFPB research also has singled out consumer protection hazards in medical finance, suggesting a continued interest in the field.

FCRA expansion and clarifications The outline also meaningfully builds on the bureaus announcement in August 2023 of its plan to extend the FCRAs obligations to certain data brokers and broaden the statutes definition of consumer report to encompass credit header data.

The outline also reflects proposals regarding additional entities and data that may satisfy the definition of consumer reporting agency or consumer report, application of certain permissible purpose provisions under the FCRA, and CRA and furnisher dispute handling obligations.

Proposals to expand and clarify the FCRAs definition of consumer reporting agency and consumer report With respect to the definitions of consumer reporting agency and consumer report, the bureau proposes to: Expand such definitions to cover data brokers that sell certain types of consumer data, such as a consumers payment history, income and criminal records, regardless of the purpose for which the data was actually used or collected  or the expectations of the data broker regarding the use of such information.

Provide a bright-line definition for when entities that facilitate electronic data access between parties, or otherwise act as intermediaries with respect to the transmission of consumer data, may engage in assembling or evaluating information, which is one component of the FCRAs definition of consumer reporting agency."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Removing Medical Debt From Credit Reports While Also Eyeing Broad FCRA Expansion,"Identify the extent to which credit header data  e.g., identifying information such as name, date of birth and Social Security number  constitutes a consumer report, potentially narrowing the scenarios under which an entity may be permitted to sell or disclose such data.

Address the role of CRAs in targeted marketing, including by clarifying that certain targeted marketing activities by CRAs, even if  the CRA does not directly share consumer information with a third party, may constitute furnishing a consumer report and, thus, implicate the FCRAs permissible purpose requirements.

Address whether and when aggregated or anonymized information, which is sometimes shared by CRAs for marketing or other purposes, constitutes a consumer report.

Each of these proposals  if implemented  would have a profound impact across many sectors and with respect to a variety of industry participants.

For example, if the bureau takes the position that credit header data constitutes a consumer report, the action could have a negative effect on a businesss ability to identify fraud and identity theft.

Proposals to clarify when a CRA can issue a consumer report The bureau plans to set firmer parameters around when the permissible purposes set forth in the FCRA would apply.

In particular, the outline includes proposals to: Address what is needed in order to obtain written instruction sufficient to provide a permissible purpose under 15 USC  1681b(a)(2), including the steps that companies must take to obtain the consumers written instruction, who can obtain written instruction, limits on the scope of any authorization and methods for revoking any ongoing authorization.

Specify that the FCRAs legitimate business need permissible purpose, which is reflected in 15 USC  1681b(a)(3)(F), only applies where consumer report information is being used to determine the consumers eligibility for the requested transaction  which must have been initiated by the consumer for personal, family or household purposes  or is actually needed in connection with an account review to determine whether the consumer continues to meet the terms of the account.

Expand protections against unauthorized access to consumer reports by making a CRAs failure to sufficiently protect against  for example, a data breach  a potential violation of the statute.

These new initiatives come just over a year after the bureau issued an advisory opinion emphasizing the narrow circumstances under which CRAs may provide consumer report information to third parties and the potential consumer harm associated with impermissible disclosure of consumer report information.

Proposals regarding CRAs and furnishers dispute handling obligations under the FCRA In the last year, the CFPB has devoted significant attention to ensuring that CRAs and furnishers understand and comply with their dispute handling obligations under the FCRA and Regulation V.

The bureau doubles down on this effort by including in the outline proposals to: Clarify that, in the bureaus view, CRAs and furnishers must reasonably investigate both legal and factual disputes  a position the CFPB has previously taken in amicus briefs .

Address how furnishers and CRAs must investigate and attend to systemic issues affecting the completeness or accuracy of consumer reports including by mandating a specific process through which a consumer could notify a CRA or furnisher of possible systemic consumer reporting issues that affect other similarly situated consumers and requiring specific action by CRAs and furnishers in response to such.

Looking ahead The bureau is still a long way away from issuing any final rules on the proposals under consideration.

These proposals are currently submitted for comment from the bureaus Small Business Review Panel and still need to be formally issued in a proposed rule, followed by a final rule."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Removing Medical Debt From Credit Reports While Also Eyeing Broad FCRA Expansion,"These proposals are currently submitted for comment from the bureaus Small Business Review Panel and still need to be formally issued in a proposed rule, followed by a final rule.

Notwithstanding, the bureaus proposals reflect its interest in erecting substantial new compliance requirements and liability for certain entities involved in the collection and transmission of consumer information.

Entities should remain engaged throughout the rulemaking process and also consider current policies and procedures in place regarding both the sharing and receipt of consumer information.

In connection with the proposals, the CFPB also has invited feedback from stakeholders that do not qualify as small business entities.

Feedback is due to the bureau by October 30, 2023."

Cooley,CFPB Mandates Additional Specificity in Adverse Action Communications Based on AI or Complex Credit Models,"On September 19, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued Circular 2023-03 to provide creditors additional guidance for communicating denials of credit to consumers based upon artificial intelligence (AI) or complex credit models.

The circular makes clear that it is insufficient for a creditor utilizing such models to satisfy their obligation under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B by relying on codified sample adverse action notice forms if the forms do not accurately indicate the principal reason for the denial.  

The circular also provides that creditors may not rely on overly broad statements of denial to the extent that such statements obscure the specific and accurate reasons for the credit decision.

Adverse action notification requirements under ECOA and Regulation B Regulation B requires a creditor that denies an application for credit to provide to the applicant an adverse action notice containing a statement of reasons for the action.

The statement must be specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the action taken.

1

The reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.

2 Regulation B contains sample adverse action notification forms with an illustrative  but not exhaustive  list of reasons for taking adverse action, and the CFPB states that a creditor may use the checklist of reasons in the sample forms only to the extent that the reasons listed are specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action taken.

The circular highlights the provision of Regulation B that states: If the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed.

Rather, the sample forms merely provide an illustrative and nonexclusive list.

Thus, if the principal reason(s) a creditor actually relies on is not accurately reflected in the checklist of reasons in the sample forms, it is the duty of the creditor  if it chooses to use the sample forms  to either modify the form or check other and include the appropriate explanation, so that the applicant against whom adverse action is taken receives a statement of reasons that is specific and indicates the principal reason(s) for the action taken.

Adverse action notification complications associated with denials based on use of AI and complex credit models The CFPBs circular notes the heightened import of  and additional complexity associated with  providing specific reasons for adverse actions when creditors use AI in making credit determinations, because consumers may not anticipate that data gathered outside of their credit application or file may be the principal reason for the adverse action taken against their credit application.

As one example, the circular states: [I]f a complex algorithm results in a denial of a credit application due to an applicants chosen profession, a statement that the applicant had insufficient projected income or income insufficient for amount of credit requested would likely fail to meet the creditors legal obligations, even if the indicated reasons are broadly related to the actual reason for credit denial.

Along those lines, the CFPB also indicates that, where a creditor lowers a consumers credit limit based on behavioral data, such as where the consumer shops, an adverse action reason stating purchasing history or disfavored business patronage would be insufficiently specific.

To satisfy Regulation B, the CFPB states the creditor would need to disclose additional specific details, such as the type of establishment, location of business or type of goods purchased, that led to the adverse action."
Cooley,CFPB Mandates Additional Specificity in Adverse Action Communications Based on AI or Complex Credit Models,"Other recent CFPB actions related to AI/fair lending This AI-related fair lending circular builds upon the CFPBs Circular 2022-03 , published last year, which stated that the ECOA requires creditors to explain the specific reasons for taking adverse actions against consumers.

The CFPB also last year issued an advisory opinion reiterating that creditors must provide adverse action notices to borrowers when changes are made to existing lines of credit  and not only for applications for new credit.

The series of issuances underscores the CFPBs general policy concerns regarding the effects of technology on fair lending compliance.

For example, the CFPB issued guidance last year informing corporate landlords that prospective tenants must receive adverse action notices when denied housing.

The CFPB also participated in an interagency rulemaking regarding automated valuation models designed to ensure that AI models do not exacerbate disparities based on historical patterns of discrimination.

Looking ahead In its most recent annual report , the CFPB noted it is increasing its expertise in data science and fair lending analytics to ensure it is able to hold creditors and service providers accountable for complying with fair lending laws.

In addition to conducting general fair lending testing of advanced models, this new CFPB circular makes clear that creditors also will need to carefully consider how they communicate to consumers credit decisions made on the basis of AI and complex credit models.

Cooley,"IRS Publishes Guidance on Tax Rules for Software Development, Research Expenses","The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) introduced significant changes to the tax treatment of specified research and experimentation (SRE) expenditures.

Historically, companies were able to immediately deduct all costs associated with research and experimentation activities under Internal Revenue Code (IRC), Section 174, including costs related to laboratory research, computer software development, and contract research performed by third-party or affiliated research entities.

As explained in an April 2023 Cooley client alert , the TCJA introduced new rules for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, requiring taxpayers to capitalize SRE expenditures and amortize them over five years for research performed in the United States or 15 years for research performed outside the United States.

Although members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have publicly supported a repeal of the SRE expenditure capitalization rules introduced by the TCJA, congressional action has not yet been taken.

The IRS recently published Notice 2023-63 to provide guidance on how these relatively new capitalization rules under IRC Section 174 should be applied by taxpayers  and to preview proposed regulations that soon will follow.

The notice is effective for tax years ending after September 8, 2023, but taxpayers can apply them to, and rely on the guidance in the notice for, any tax year beginning after December 31, 2021, provided that it is applied consistently.

Computer software development costs As noted above, the new mandatory capitalization rules apply to certain software development costs.

The notice indicates that taxpayers are required to capitalize certain costs related to the development of new software programs, as well as certain enhancements to existing software where the enhancements result in additional functionality or increased efficiency.

The notice states that costs from activities such as planning software development, documenting software requirements, designing and building a model of computer software, and writing code are subject to the new capitalization rules.

However, taxpayers are not required to capitalize any costs incurred after the computer software is ready for sale or license to others, such as costs related to marketing, distribution, or customer support.

The notice also excludes certain costs for software developed by a taxpayer for use in their own business, including costs related to employee training, maintenance and data entry.

In light of the different tax deductibility rules applicable to amounts expended in advance of a sale or license versus amounts expended after sale or license, taxpayers should carefully document their research and experimentation expenses to properly allocate the costs to periods before and after software is ready for sale or license.

Contract research Taxpayers are required to capitalize amounts paid to others to perform laboratory science, software development or other qualifying research activities.

This includes amounts paid to third-party contract researchers and entities performing research and development activities for the benefit of their affiliates.

A contract researcher being paid for research and experimentation work will often be able to deduct the costs incurred in connection with research and experimentation activities.

However, the notice indicates that a contract researcher will be required to capitalize its research costs if it bears financial risk in connection with the research or has a right to use or exploit the results of the research.

A contract researcher that gets paid whether the research succeeds or fails will not be required to capitalize its research costs.

Alternatively, if a contract researchers compensation is contingent on the results of the research or it retains any rights to the intellectual property developed as part of the research, costs incurred in connection with the contractors research will be required to be capitalized."
Cooley,"IRS Publishes Guidance on Tax Rules for Software Development, Research Expenses","If a contract researcher wants to avoid the current IRC Section 174 capitalization rules, it will be important to limit the researchers right to use or exploit any results of the research arrangement.

The notice does not address cost-sharing arrangements in which a group of affiliated entities or joint venture partners collectively work on a research project by sharing development costs in proportion to their expected benefit.

However, the notice does indicate that further guidance will be forthcoming on this topic.

Disposition, retirement or abandonment of property Typically, taxpayers can deduct any remaining basis in depreciable property at the time that property is sold, exchanged, retired or abandoned.

However, the TCJA added special rules that apply to the disposition, retirement, or abandonment of property that results from research and experimentation activities.

Instead of being able to immediately deduct any remaining costs when the property is sold, taxpayers will be required to continue to amortize SRE expenditures over the original five- or 15-year period.

These rules may have significant ramifications for companies in the life sciences or technology sector that commonly sell intellectual property.

For example, current tax law requires taxpayers to recognize income from the sale of developed IP without offset against unamortized SRE expenditures incurred in developing the IP.

Instead, these SRE expenditures must continue to be amortized in future years pursuant to the original SRE expenditure amortization schedule, even though the taxpayer has sold the applicable IP.

The notice includes special rules that apply to certain transactions in which a corporation ceases to exist for federal income tax purposes.

If a corporation ceases to exist for federal income tax purposes pursuant to a tax-deferred liquidation, a contribution to a controlled corporation or other reorganization, the successor company generally steps into the shoes of the company that performed the research.

If a corporation ceases to exist for federal income tax purposes not pursuant to a transaction described in the preceding sentence, the corporation is generally allowed to deduct the remaining unamortized SRE expenditures.

These special rules do not apply to partnerships.

If you have questions about how these changes may impact your company, we strongly suggest contacting a member of the Cooley tax team, your accountant or other tax adviser."
Cooley,FinCEN Publishes New Guidance on Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Rule,"On September 18, 2023 , the US Department of the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published its Small Entity Compliance Guide  the agencys most comprehensive guidance to date on compliance obligations under the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule.

It provides a useful resource in addition to FinCENs collection of information regarding BOI reporting for companies seeking a better understanding of their obligations under the new rule.

Whats the BOI reporting rule?

The BOI reporting rule was finalized by FinCEN in September 2022 to implement Section 6403 of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA).

The stated goal of the CTA is to improve transparency of corporate structures and discourage the use of shell corporations to disguise and move illicit funds.

The reporting rule is intended to address this goal by requiring certain companies to report information about their beneficial owners to FinCEN.

Barring an applicable exemption, a reporting company is any company formed in the US, or any foreign company that registers to do business in the US, by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office.

The compliance guide summarizes the specific information reporting companies are required to report.

As also explained in the compliance guide, the BOI reporting rule requires covered entities in existence on December 31, 2023, to file a report no later than January 1, 2025.

However, reporting companies that are formed or (if a foreign company) registered on or after January 1, 2024, must file a report within 30 days of the date on which the formation or registration becomes effective under applicable law.

Whats in the compliance guide?

The guide does not create any new requirements.

Rather, it provides an accessible and detailed summary of how the BOI reporting rule works, particularly with respect to: Which types of companies are subject to the reporting rule and how the 23 categories of exemptions operate to narrow the scope of covered entities.

How to identify beneficial owners of a reporting company.

In turn, the guide addresses what reporting companies and their individual beneficial owners must do to comply, across six chapters: Does my company have to report its beneficial owners?

Who is a beneficial owner of my company?

Does my company have to report its company applicants?

What specific information does my company need to report?

When and how should my company file its initial BOI report?

What if there are changes to or inaccuracies in reported information?

How should companies approach the reporting rule?

The first key step for any company is to determine if it is a reporting company or meets one of the available exemptions.

Exempt entities include those subject to certain preexisting registration requirements or regulatory regimes, such as securities issuers (i.e., public companies), money services businesses and other types of financial institutions, investment companies and investment advisers, venture capital fund advisers, and pooled investment vehicles.

Each type of exemption has specific criteria that must be met, so any potentially covered entity should carefully evaluate whether a relevant exemption is applicable.

The BOI reporting rule also includes a general exemption for a large operating company, which is generally any entity that employs more than 20 full-time employees in the US, has more than more than $5,000,000 in gross receipts or sales in the US, and has an operating presence at a physical office within the US.

Again, there are very specific criteria for meeting the large operating company exemption, so any company that believes this exemption may apply should closely evaluate the applicable criteria.

Finally, an entity that is controlled or wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by most (but not all) categories of exempt entities is exempt."
Cooley,FinCEN Publishes New Guidance on Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Rule,"Finally, an entity that is controlled or wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by most (but not all) categories of exempt entities is exempt.

For example, a wholly owned subsidiary of a public company is exempt, but a wholly owned subsidiary of a money services business is not (unless another exemption applies, such as the money transmitter being a public company or a large operating company).

The second key step for any non-exempt entity that is therefore a reporting company is to determine whom its beneficial owners and company applicants are.

A beneficial owner is any individual who, directly or indirectly, exercises substantial control over a reporting company or owns or controls at least 25% of the ownership interests of a reporting company.

The compliance guide explains that an individual might be a beneficial owner through substantial control, ownership interests, or both, and states that FinCEN expects that every reporting company will be substantially controlled by one or more individuals, and therefore that every reporting company will be able to identify and report at least one beneficial owner to FinCEN.

The compliance guide elaborates on what constitutes substantial control by describing four categories: The individual is a senior officer.

The individual has authority to appoint or remove certain officers or a majority of directors of the reporting company.

The individual is an important decision-maker.

The individual has any other form of substantial control over the reporting company.

The compliance guide includes checklist-type questions to help a company identify persons with substantial control, such as whether any individual has the ability to appoint or remove a majority of the companys board of directors (or similar body), or otherwise appoint or remove a senior officer such as president, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer.

Similarly, the compliance guide covers how to identify and calculate the various types of ownership interests that can trigger reporting based on the 25% threshold: Equity, stock, or voting rights.

A capital or profit interest.

Convertible instruments.

Options or other nonbinding privileges to buy or sell any of the foregoing.

Any other instrument, contract, or other mechanism used to establish ownership.

The guide provides a checklist to identifying each of the types of ownership interests, then how to calculate relevant percentages based on each of these types of interests.

The compliance guide also outlines the process of identifying company applicants, which should generally be more straightforward than the process of identifying beneficial owners.

As an initial matter, reporting companies created or registered on or before December 31, 2023, do not have to report company applicants (such companies do not need to report anything before January 1, 2025, in any event).

However, reporting companies created on or after January 1, 2024, will need to report company applicants.

All such reporting companies must have at least one, but no more than two, company applicants, and company applicants must be natural persons.

The first category of company applicant is the individual who directly filed the document that created a domestic reporting company or first registered a foreign reporting company.

The compliance guide clarifies that this individual would have actually physically or electronically filed the document with the secretary of state or similar office.

This direct filer must be identified by all reporting companies that have a company applicant reporting requirement (i.e., all reporting companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2024).

The second category is the individual who was primarily responsible for directing or controlling the filing of the creation or first registration document.

The compliance guide notes that not all reporting companies will necessarily have a person that falls into this second category."
Cooley,FinCEN Publishes New Guidance on Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Rule,"The compliance guide notes that not all reporting companies will necessarily have a person that falls into this second category.

Finally, the compliance guide walks through the information that needs to be filed with FinCEN by a reporting company, including details about each beneficial owner and company applicant (if applicable), as well as the requirements for updating and correcting BOI reports.

Company information includes full legal name (and any trade names), address, jurisdiction of formation, and taxpayer identification number (or equivalent issued by a foreign jurisdiction).

Information about beneficial owners includes their full legal name, date of birth, address, and the unique identifying number and image of their US passport, state drivers license, or other eligible identification document.

Information generally must be updated within 30 days after a change in information occurs or after the date the company became aware of an inaccuracy or had reason to know of it.

Note:

A reporting company is responsible for maintaining current and accurate information not only about the company itself, but also about its beneficial owners and (to the extent applicable) company applicants.

Reports  and updates  are required to be filed through a filing system that FinCEN is still in the process of developing.

The compliance guide states that FinCEN will publish separate instructions and other technical guidance on how to complete the reports.

What are the next steps?

Companies currently in existence have time to determine if the BOI reporting rule applies, because it does not take effect until January 1, 2025, for companies created or registered on or before December 31, 2023.

Nevertheless, such companies may consider whether it is appropriate to develop processes to determine whether the reporting rule applies and to address whether newly created entities (e.g., subsidiaries, special purpose vehicles) are subject to the reporting rule.

Newly formed companies, and persons or entities that are involved in or create such companies  such as entrepreneurs, venture funds and other investors and investment vehicles, law firms, and corporate services firms  also may need to develop processes to address BOI reporting rule requirements, including approaches to updating previously reported information.

Cooley,IRS Announces Moratorium on Processing New Claims for Employee Retention Credit,"On September 14, 2023, the IRS announced an immediate moratorium on processing new claims for the Employee Retention Credit (ERC).

According to the IRS announcement (IR-2023-169), the moratorium will last through at least the end of 2023.

The ERC is set forth in Section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

It was created as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and modified several times under subsequent pandemic relief legislation.

The ERC is a refundable employment tax credit for qualified wages paid by certain employers the operations of which were suspended due to a government shutdown order, that experienced a significant decline in gross receipts, or that qualified as a recovery startup business  each as determined under specific rules set forth in Department of the Treasury regulations and IRS administrative guidance.

The ERC is described in further detail in this May 2020 client alert and this December 2020 client alert .

Under the IRS moratorium, ERC claims received after September 13, 2023, will not be processed until the moratorium ends.

The IRS will continue to process ERC claims received before that date, but they will receive additional scrutiny before being approved.

That additional scrutiny will extend the IRSs standard processing goal from 90 days to 180 days.

The IRS attributed the moratorium to concerns about a flood of improper ERC claims being submitted by ineligible businesses that are misled by aggressive promoters that often receive a contingency fee from any ERC refund paid.

The IRS cautioned that the ERC is an incredibly complex credit with very specific eligibility requirements and urged businesses to consult with a trusted tax professional rather than relying solely on a promoter with a vested interest in obtaining ERC payments.

In a separate IRS announcement (IR-2023-170) released on the same day as the moratorium, the IRS identified red flags for ERC scams, including: Unsolicited calls or advertisements mentioning an easy application process for the ERC.

Statements that ERC eligibility can be determined within minutes.

Large upfront fees to claim the ERC.

Fees based on a percentage of the refund amount of the ERC claimed.

Preparers seeking anonymity by refusing to sign the ERC return (e.g., ghost preparers).

Aggressive claims that a taxpayer qualifies for the ERC before any discussion of the taxpayers tax situation.

The IRS warned that, despite promoters claims to the contrary, receiving an improper ERC payment can leave a business in a much worse financial position if it must later repay the credit  potentially with penalties and interest  and may expose the claimant to criminal investigation.

The IRS previewed that it will be implementing a settlement procedure for repayment of improper ERC claims that have already been paid, as well as a withdrawal procedure for improper ERC claims that have been submitted but not yet processed.

Withdrawing an improper ERC claim may allow a business to avoid penalties, interest, and issues with repayment of the ERC and promoter contingency fees, but it will not necessarily insulate the business from criminal investigation and prosecution for willfully filed fraudulent ERC claims."
Cooley,CFPB Details Concerns Over Tuition Payment Plan Practices at Higher Education Institutions,"On September 14, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released a report on financial risks to students associated with school-issued tuition payment plans.

Although the report acknowledges that many tuition payment plans are free of interest, the bureau cautions that inadequate disclosures, opaque product terms and collection practices create the potential for harm to students.

The report, which draws its findings from the CFPBs review of payment plan terms from nearly 450 higher education institutions, represents one more step in the bureaus initiative to examine and oversee institutional lending and servicing practices .

Using real-life school examples, the bureau identifies a number of origination and servicing practices it believes put students at financial risk In its review of actual tuition payment plans offered by higher education institutions, the bureau details and highlights numerous practices it believes create risk of financial harm to students.

Specifically, the bureau calls out the following practices: Forced enrollment The bureau identifies situations where it believes students are forced to enroll in payment plans, such as where alternative financial aid is delayed.

This creates, according to the bureau, a situation where the student is held captive to the schools payment plan, because the student has already enrolled in the school and is therefore not free to choose among other financing vehicles.

Location of disclosures The bureau finds that material terms and conditions pertaining to tuition payment plans can be strewn across multiple enrollment documents, which makes it difficult for students to understand the full terms of the payment plans.

These material terms are not always redisclosed to the student at the time they enter into the payment plan.

Late payment penalties The report concludes that students are assessed significant penalties when they miss payments, noting further that late fees and returned payment fees can be assessed on the same transaction.

The bureau raises concerns about penalty default interest rates on otherwise no-interest payment plans.

Waivers of rights The bureau describes a host of payment plans with language requiring the student to give up certain legal rights upon entering into the payment plan  such as a waiver of the right to litigate, discharge the debt or retain counsel, along with forced arbitration.

Withholding benefits Although the bureau has previously warned institutions against withholding transcripts from students who are delinquent on their loans, the bureau says a significant number of schools continue this practice.

The bureau also found instances in which schools remove delinquent students from class and withhold other benefits, such as meal plans or housing.

Marketing The bureau cautions schools about positioning payment plans as an alternative to student loans, or describing them as something other than a loan.

What to expect?

The CFPBs report goes into great detail about practices of concern, even if it stops short of declaring those practices illegal, unfair, deceptive or abusive.

The bureaus report also is heavily footnoted with references to payment plans from specific higher education institutions and is accompanied by a detailed spreadsheet with the list of institutions reviewed  and whether the institution engages in a particular practice identified in the report.

Institutions should review the report, determine if they are specifically highlighted and examine the accompanying data to see how the bureau is characterizing their practices.

Institutions also may do well to review the terms of their payment plans  as well as their operations for offering and administering the payment plans  in light of the myriad practices highlighted as concerning to the bureau."
Cooley,Basics of Generative AI,Special counsel Judd Lauter provides an introduction to generative artificial intelligence.
Cooley,California GHG Emissions and Climate Risk Bills Near Finalization,"Last week, the California Legislature passed two far-reaching climate disclosure bills  SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (CCDAA) , and SB 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (CRFRA)  together, the California Climate Accountability Package.

The passage of these bills puts California in the position to implement first-of-its-kind mandatory climate disclosure in the US.

While these bills are similar to the climate rule proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2022, the bills reach further on several fronts, as discussed below.

Because the bills would apply to both public and private companies over certain revenue thresholds, they are expected to significantly broaden the number of companies required to publish public climate disclosures.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has until October 14, 2023, to sign or veto the bills and, if he does neither, they will automatically become law  though he has indicated that he plans to sign both bills.

In summary, SB 253 requires disclosure of and independent third-party assurance on all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  Scopes 1, 2 and 3  for entities with total annual revenues exceeding $1 billion and that qualify as ""doing business"" in California.

SB 261 requires disclosure of climate-related financial risks, in accordance with recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), for entities with total annual revenues exceeding $500 million and that qualify as ""doing business"" in California.

A discussion of the requirements of each bill, as well as a comparison to other climate disclosure rules, follows below.

Although both bills provide broad outlines of climate reporting expectations, the California Air Resources Board will be responsible for developing implementing regulations, which will presumably contain more detailed reporting instructions.

What do you need to know about the California Climate Accountability Package?

SB 253: The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (CCDAA)

Who is subject to SB 253?

SB 253 applies to US companies with total annual revenues exceeding $1 billion and that qualify as ""doing business"" in California.

Applicability is based on the reporting entitys revenue for the prior fiscal year.

Public and private companies are subject to SB 253.

The bill does not define doing business in California.

We anticipate that California will take a broad view of the phrase based on other state regulations.

The California Franchise Tax Boards definition for doing business in the state includes any entity that engages in any transaction for the purpose of financial gain within California.

What disclosures does SB 253 require?

Companies must annually publicly disclose their Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions for the prior fiscal year in conformance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards and guidance.

Scope 1 emissions means all direct GHG emissions that stem from sources that a company owns or directly controls, regardless of location, including, but not limited to, fuel combustion activities.

Scope 2 emissions means indirect GHG emissions from consumed electricity, steam, heating or cooling purchased or acquired by a company, regardless of location.

Scope 3 emissions  also known as full value chain emissions  means indirect upstream and downstream GHG emissions, other than Scope 2 emissions, from sources that a company does not own or directly control, and may include, but are not limited to, purchased goods and services, business travel, employee commutes, and processing and use of sold products.

The exact requirements for Scope 3 emissions disclosure are likely to be an important focus of the California Air Resources Boards regulations.

Because companies subject to the bill will be required to report their Scope 3 value chain emissions, we expect to see an increase in emissions data requests from large companies to their suppliers and vendors."
Cooley,California GHG Emissions and Climate Risk Bills Near Finalization,"As a result, many companies with revenues well below $1 billion that are not directly subject to reporting obligations should expect to come under additional pressure from their customers and vendors to calculate and produce GHG emissions data.

When do companies need to publish their GHG emissions under SB 253?

Companies need to start reporting their direct and indirect (Scopes 1 and 2) emissions beginning in 2026 .

Emissions reporting for indirect, full value chain (Scope 3) emissions would not begin until 2027 .

The California Air Resources Board is required to adopt regulations concerning the annual reporting process on or before January 1, 2025.

Will GHG emissions disclosures need to be verified?

Yes.

The final bill requires companies to obtain third-party assurance for their emissions reporting, at a limited assurance level, beginning in 2026 for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and at a more stringent, reasonable assurance level in 2030.

The assurance engagement for Scope 3 emissions shall be performed at a limited assurance level in 2030.

Limited assurance is the baseline level of assurance, where an independent auditor obtains sufficient and appropriate evidence, limiting assurance to specific aspects of the reporting.

Reasonable assurance is the highest level of assurance and is more rigorous and intensive, requiring evidence to demonstrate the reporting is free of material misstatements.

Who will oversee this new disclosure regime?

The California Air Resources Board will develop and adopt regulations implementing this new disclosure regime on or before January 1, 2025.

The bill also requires the state to review these rules in 2029 and update them as necessary by 2030.

What are the penalties for failing to report?

A company that fails to file the required report, or that fails to make adequate disclosures in a filed report, may face an administrative penalty of up to $500,000.

SB 261:

The Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (CRFRA) Who is subject to SB 261?

SB 261 applies to public and private US companies with total annual revenues exceeding $500 million and that qualify as ""doing business"" in California.

Applicability is based on the reporting entitys revenue for the prior fiscal year.

Public and private companies are subject to SB 261.

What disclosures does SB 261 require?

Companies will be required to publish a biennial climate-related financial risk report that discloses their: Climate-related financial risk, built upon recommendations of the TCFD or a comparable disclosure regime.

The measures adopted to mitigate and adapt to the disclosed climate-related financial risk.

Climate-related financial risk, as defined in the bill, includes all material risk of harm to immediate and long-term financial outcomes due to physical and transitional risks  such as risks to corporate operations, provision of goods and services, supply chains, employee health and safety, capital and financial investments, institutional investments, financial standing of loan recipients and borrowers, shareholder value, consumer demand, and financial markets and economic health.

The exact nature of alignment with TCFD recommendations remains unclear under the statute and will likely be clarified by future implementing regulations, including whether mandatory disclosures will need to align with the governance and metrics/targets pillars of the TCFD, in addition to strategy and risk management.

In an effort to minimize the burden on companies that are already publishing climate risk reports either voluntarily or to comply with a mandatory requirement, such as future SEC or Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) disclosures, the bill provides that companies may satisfy the biennial reporting requirement with a comparable climate-related financial risk reporting framework, including the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) framework."
Cooley,California GHG Emissions and Climate Risk Bills Near Finalization,"The bill provides that climate-related financial risk reports may be consolidated at the parent company level and does not require a subsidiary of a parent company subject to the bill to file its own separate report.

When do companies need to report under SB 261?

On or before January 1, 2026, companies will need to publish an initial climate-related financial risk report.

Reports will be required every two years after the initial report.

Reports must be posted publicly on the companys website and filed with the California Air Resources Board.

If a company cannot provide all of the required disclosures in its report, it must provide a detailed explanation of any reporting gaps, describe the steps it is taking to comply and provide complete disclosures in the future.

What are the penalties for failing to report?

A company that fails to file the required report, or that fails to make adequate disclosures in a filed report, may face an administrative penalty of up to $50,000.

Comparison with the SECs proposed climate rule and EU mandatory ESG reporting standards How does the final California Climate Accountability Package compare with the SECs proposed climate rule?

Timing.

Although the California Climate Accountability Package is poised to be adopted while the SEC is still preparing the final version of its own climate disclosure rule, it is likely that initial SEC disclosures  once adopted  will apply for companies that are large accelerated filers in fiscal year 2024.

As a result, for those companies, SEC disclosures may be due in 2025, a year in advance of California reporting obligations.

Application.

The California Climate Accountability Package goes further than the SEC proposed climate rule, as it applies to both public and private companies that do business in the state and meet certain annual revenue thresholds.

The SECs proposed climate rule targets only public companies reporting to the SEC, including US public companies and foreign private issuers.

In this respect, the California rules more closely approximate the CSRD (discussed below), which applies to non-EU entities that meet certain presence and size thresholds.

Scope 3 emissions.

SB 253 requires that all covered companies report their Scope 3, or full value chain, emissions, while the SECs proposed climate rule requires Scope 3 emissions disclosure only if the company has set Scope 3 reduction targets or has determined that its Scope 3 emissions are material.

Although the California rules may be subject to litigation, SEC climate rulemaking is exposed to unique litigation and political vulnerabilities, particularly with regard to statutory authority.

In addition to reporting under the CSRD, or customer and investor expectations for climate disclosure, these new rules will create an additional layer of obligations for a large number of mature public and private companies  independent of the fate of the SECs rule.

How does the California Climate Accountability Package relate to EU reporting standards?

Many US companies will be required in the near future to comply with the CSRD adopted by the EU and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) .

The CSRD requires mandatory reporting obligations for large, non-EU parent companies and subsidiaries doing business in Europe, even if the parent companies are not listed on a European exchange.

Compared with the California bills, the CSRD has a lower revenue threshold.

Large EU companies  including subsidiaries of non-EU companies, listed or not  are required to report in 2026 on 2025 data, if they satisfy at least two of the following criteria: a balance sheet total of more than 20 million euros, a net turnover of 40 million euros, or an average of more than 250 employees over the financial year.

Non-EU parent companies are required to report in 2029 on 2028 data."
Cooley,California GHG Emissions and Climate Risk Bills Near Finalization,"Non-EU parent companies are required to report in 2029 on 2028 data.

For those companies subject to both the CSRD and the California rules, reporting obligations should generally be complementary, particularly given that SB 261 contemplates satisfying reporting obligations with equivalent disclosures under other mandatory regimes, such as the CSRD.

What should companies do to prepare?

Internal organization is a critical step in preparing for effective climate reporting.

Companies should start by assigning internal responsibility for climate reporting, which often includes setting up a cross-functional committee of management team members from operations, legal and finance.

Companies also should begin building an internal system for climate reporting and related data governance and disclosure controls.

Identifying appropriate outside advisers also will be an important early task  particularly, finding the right emissions accounting firm for a given business and industry to gather emissions data and prepare audit-ready GHG emissions disclosure.

Climate reporting can be time-consuming and logistically challenging, especially given the need to gather full value chain GHG emissions data.

It is critical for companies to first understand their carbon footprint, including their own emissions profile and that of their full value chain, before embarking on climate-related financial risk reporting.

While many companies are already publishing some GHG emissions data or TCFD-aligned climate reporting, these disclosures may not fully comply with the new California requirements, particularly with regard to Scope 3 or methodological requirements.

In addition to conducting a careful gap analysis of existing reporting against these new rules, companies may want to consider other changes to account for the shift from voluntary to regulated disclosure  including adopting additional controls, improving data quality and refining methodological approaches.

Cooley,UK OFSI Uses Disclosure Power as FCA Reviews Sanctions Compliance Systems,"On 31 August 2023, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) used its new disclosure enforcement power for the first time, issuing a report against Wise Payments Limited for breach of financial sanctions .

The use of this power is a significant step in OFSIs efforts to ensure compliance with the UKs financial sanctions regime and deter future breaches.

In addition, OFSI has updated its monetary penalties guidance, shedding further light on how it will use the disclosure power in the future.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also has published a review assessing the systems and controls relating to sanctions compliance for more than 90 financial services firms in a range of different sectors, including banking, wealth management, insurance, electronic money and payments.

OFSIs disclosure power OFSIs disclosure power was introduced as an enforcement tool last year under the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022.

It allows OFSI to publish information about financial sanctions breaches  including details of those who committed the breaches and the circumstances of the breach  where OFSI considers that the breaches are not serious enough to justify a civil monetary penalty.

Wises sanctions breach In July 2022, Wise reported a suspected breach of financial sanctions to OFSI following a 250 cash withdrawal made from a Wise business account held by a company owned or controlled by a designated person, using a debit card held in the designated persons name.

Wise explained that after the designated person was added to the UK sanctions list, Wises systems raised an alert, and the account associated with the designated person was suspended.

However, at the time when the money was withdrawn, activity on the debit card was not restricted, allowing the 250 withdrawal.

Wise clarified that the lack of restrictions imposed on debit card access was due to the high number of false positives for sanctions alerts  and Wises desire to balance its regulatory requirement to consider its customers interests with its legal obligation to comply with financial sanctions.

By permitting the withdrawal and making funds available to an entity owned or controlled by a designated person, Wise was in breach of financial sanctions.

Furthermore, OFSI explained that there was an internal alert raised with Wises sanctions specialist team on a Friday, but that team did not operate on the weekend, so the customer was not exited until the following Monday.

Disclosure in Wise case OFSI determined that no monetary penalty was warranted.

However, despite the low value of the breach (250), the disclosure of this case was justified as the case was considered moderately severe overall.

Additionally, OFSI found that Wises policy regarding debit card payments was inappropriate.

The lack of staff operating at the weekend also caused a significant delay in proper restrictions being placed on the designated persons account and debit card.

In making the disclosure and the lack of imposition of monetary penalties, OFSI considered several mitigating factors, including the voluntary disclosure, the low value of the breach, the remedial actions taken (such as introducing weekend working for the sanctions team and exiting the designated person as a customer), and a lack of evidence of deliberate sanctions evasion.

Notes on compliance In the report, OFSI highlights the importance of addressing identified sanctions risks promptly, as well as maintaining proportionate sanctions screening and alert review functions.

OFSI further underlines the value of voluntary disclosure, which may be considered a mitigating factor.

The notes also reiterate the need to freeze funds, not deal with them, and report them to OFSI as quickly as possible where such funds or economic resources belong to a designated person."
Cooley,UK OFSI Uses Disclosure Power as FCA Reviews Sanctions Compliance Systems,"The notes also reiterate the need to freeze funds, not deal with them, and report them to OFSI as quickly as possible where such funds or economic resources belong to a designated person.

Guidance Following publication of its first disclosure, OFSI has updated its guidance on monetary penalties and enforcement to provide more detail on how OFSI categorises breaches, noting that moderately severe cases where no monetary penalty has been imposed are likely to be dealt with via a disclosure, if a warning letter would be too lenient.

It also highlights that a disclosure may be made in cases where there are valuable lessons for industry or where it is not in the public interest to issue a monetary penalty.

FCA update In parallel, the FCA also recently published a review assessing the sanctions systems and controls of more than 90 financial services firms.

The review identifies good practice carried out by several of the firms, including risk exposure assessments and scenario planning in advance of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and appropriate calibration of sanctions screening tools.

The FCA also identified the key areas for improvement , as summarised below.

Senior managements oversight of sanctions risks: Managers often were identified as having insufficient management information to discharge their responsibilities.

Global sanctions policies: In some international firms, global policies lacked sufficient focus on the UK sanctions regime.

Over-reliance on third-party sanctions screening tools: Firms often lacked an understanding of how their sanctions screening tools worked and were updated.

Contingency planning: Firms which had conducted a risk assessment of their exposure to Russia and developed contingency plans were better placed to introduce risk-reducing measures.

Sanctions screening backlogs: Many firms had significant backlogs in the assessment, escalation and reporting of alerts from sanctions screening.

Screening capabilities: Some firms had incorrectly calibrated sanctions screening tools so that they were either too sensitive or not sensitive enough.

Assessment quality concerns: Many firms Customer Due Diligence and Know Your Customer assessments were found to be of low quality.

Reporting to the FCA: Inconsistencies were identified in reporting to the FCA, including delays and failure to report at all.

Whilst focused on the financial sanctions sector, the FCAs report has wider application and provides useful guidance for all companies on how to avoid potential vulnerabilities in their sanctions compliance measures.

It reinforces that designing effective sanctions compliance policies and processes need to be carefully calibrated to the risks and needs of the relevant organisation.

Takeaways The disclosure represents a significant step in OFSIs enforcement of financial sanctions.

It highlights that businesses should be aware that, even if there is a low-value breach of sanctions, they may suffer reputational costs due to the publication of information regarding the breach.

Businesses can seek to avoid this risk by adopting robust sanctions policies and screening procedures that are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure full compliance with UK and international sanctions regimes.

Where a sanctions breach is detected, businesses should consider disclosing it promptly to OFSI to mitigate any monetary penalties and associated reputational impact.

All firms  especially FCA-regulated businesses  should consider the FCAs review findings to identify areas for improvement in their sanctions systems and controls and ensure compliance."

Cooley,"UK Government Announces Repeal of 1.5% Stamp Tax Charge on Issuances, Certain Transfers of Shares to Depositary Receipt Issuers, Clearance Services","In a welcome move, the UK government issued a statement yesterday confirming its intention to repeal the 1.5% charge to UK stamp taxes on issuances of securities and any exempt capital-raising transfer to a depositary receipt issuer or clearance service with effect from 1 January 2024.

Draft legislation also has been published for inclusion in a future Finance Bill.

The statement provides much-needed certainty to UK-parented groups whose shares trade on non-UK exchanges, such as groups with American depositary shares listed in the US or shares trading directly through the Depository Trust Company, and to groups that are considering becoming listed on such exchanges.

As explained in this July 2023 client alert , concerns had arisen from the enactment in June of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023.

The Revocation and Reform Act will, from the end of this year, repeal a number of EU-derived laws and rights that survived Brexit.

This raised the prospect that UK statutory provisions, which have been disapplied for more than 10 years, could apply once again (and so give rise to stamp tax charges at 1.5%) to issuances of shares, and transfers that are integral to the raising of capital, to a depositary receipt issuer or clearance service.

In the absence of a clear statement by the government to the contrary, there has been considerable uncertainty as to what the likely outcome would be.

It is therefore very helpful that the government has issued its statement shortly after the return of Parliament following its summer recess.

By emphasising the importance of the competitiveness of the UKs tax code, the statement echoes representations made by Cooley and others since the Revocation and Reform Act became law.

The government has launched a technical consultation on the draft legislation, which Cooley will take part in.

Areas of focus for this consultation will include potential differences between what constitutes an exempt capital-raising transfer under the new legislation and what counted as integral to the raising of capital under the old EU-derived exemption, as well as potential timing complications raised by the fact that the draft legislation may not become law until after 1 January 2024, albeit with retrospective effect."
Cooley,State Pay Transparency Laws: What’s Required Now and What’s Next?,"As the summer winds down, multistate employers must remain apprised of an ever-increasing number of obligations in the area of pay transparency.

Below, we highlight recent developments to existing pay transparency laws, summarize new pay transparency laws enacted over the summer and offer compliance tips for multistate employers grappling with this growing nationwide trend.

New York Starting in the Empire State, New York employers are reminded that the states pay transparency law (signed into law in December 2022) goes into effect on September 17, 2023.

The law, which was amended earlier this year, largely tracks the requirements of New York Citys law , which became effective on November 1, 2022.

The state law covers employers with at least four employees and requires employers to disclose the compensation or range of compensation in any job posting, promotion or transfer opportunity, as well as the job description for the position, if one exists.

The job description requirement is a major distinction from New York Citys law, which has no such requirement.

Penalties include a fine of up to $1,000 for a first violation, $2,000 for a second violation and $3,000 for a third or subsequent violation.

In a recent amendment, the state clarified that the scope of covered job postings includes jobs that will physically be performed, at least in part, in the state of New York, including a job, promotion, or transfer opportunity that will physically be performed outside of New York but reports to a supervisor, office, or other site in New York.

The amendment substantially extends the scope of the law.

In fact, even nonremote jobs, such as jobs based in other offices of the employer, will be covered if they report into a New York location.

In addition, through a new, expansive definition of the term advertise, the amendment also clarified that the law applies to both internal and external job postings.

For positions with solely commission-based compensation, the amendment also clarified that a compensation range is not required; rather, employers should include a general statement that compensation shall be based on commission.

Finally, the amendment also removed the record-keeping requirements under the law, which previously constituted another major departure from New York Citys law.

Although employers no longer need to maintain records of compensation and job descriptions in accordance with the states pay transparency law, employers must still comply with record-keeping obligations under the New York State Labor Law.

Hawaii

Meanwhile, in the Aloha State, effective January 1, 2024, Hawaiis new pay transparency law (signed in July 2023) will require employers with 50 or more employees to include the hourly pay rate or salary range in job listings.

The rates or range must reasonably reflect[] the actual expected compensation for the position.

Notably, the law does not require disclosure of other benefits, like bonuses or stock options, as some other pay transparency laws do.

Further, the law does not apply to internal transfers or promotions.

These exclusions, along with the 50-employee headcount threshold, make Hawaiis pay transparency requirements less onerous than other states laws.

Open questions remain, however, including whether the 50-employee requirement includes all employees or only those employed in Hawaii.

The law also materially expands equal pay protections, prohibiting employers from discriminating against employees based on any protected category  not just sex  by paying them differently for substantially similar work.

Illinois As we previously reported, the Prairie State recently enacted its own pay transparency law in August 2023, requiring pay and benefits disclosure beginning on January 1, 2025.

Read more about the law in this August 28 client alert .

Colorado"
Cooley,State Pay Transparency Laws: What’s Required Now and What’s Next?,"Read more about the law in this August 28 client alert .

Colorado

As we previously reported in this November 2020 client alert , the Centennial States pay transparency law  the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act  went into effect in 2021 and requires employers to disclose pay ranges and other forms of compensation and employment benefits in job postings, as well as certain promotion information.

In June 2023, Gov. Jared Polis signed an amendment to the law, which takes effect on January 1, 2024.

The amendment clarified the laws application to employers with only remote employees in the state and redefined job opportunities subject to the notice requirements, while also enacting additional requirements for job notices.

We outline these updates below.

Job opportunity notices The amended Equal Pay for Equal Work Act makes three significant changes to job opportunity notices employers must provide to their Colorado employees.

First, career progression or career development promotions are no longer considered job opportunities subject to the internal notice requirements of the law.

The amendment defines career development as a change to an employees terms of compensation, benefits, full-time or part-time status, duties, or access to further advancement in order to update the employees job title or compensate the employee to reflect work performed or contributions already made by the employee.

The amendment defines career progression as regular or automatic movement from one position to another based on time in a specific role or other objective metrics.

Second, the amended law now provides that if an employer is physically located outside of Colorado and has fewer than 15 employees in the state working remotely, then through July 1, 2029, the employer need only provide notice of remote job opportunities to its employees in Colorado.

The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) has since clarified in an Interpretive Notice & Formal Opinion that this means that small, out-of-state employers no longer need to disclose in-person (nonremote) job opportunities to its Colorado employees, although external postings for those jobs must still disclose pay.

Third, the notice of job opportunity must now include an additional component  the date the application window is anticipated to close.

Post-selection notice regarding selected candidate Employers now also must comply with an additional notice requirement after selecting a candidate to fill a job opportunity.

Specifically, within 30 days after a candidate is selected to fill a job opportunity and begins working in the position, employers will need to make reasonable efforts to announce, post or otherwise make known to the employees with whom the selected candidate is intended to regularly work, the following information: The name of the candidate.

The selected candidates former job title, if selected while already employed by the employer.

The selected candidates new job title.

Information on how employees may demonstrate interest in similar job opportunities in the future  including identifying individuals or departments to whom an employee can express interest in similar job opportunities.

The amendment clarifies that the requirement should not be applied in a manner that violates a candidates privacy rights under applicable law or in a manner that would place a candidates safety or health at risk.

However, the amendment does not further define what constitutes reasonable efforts under the law or how to determine whom a selected candidate will regularly work with."
Cooley,State Pay Transparency Laws: What’s Required Now and What’s Next?,"However, the amendment does not further define what constitutes reasonable efforts under the law or how to determine whom a selected candidate will regularly work with.

New requirements for positions with career progression Although employers will no longer need to provide employees with notice of career progression promotions, under the amendment, employers must now disclose and make available to all eligible employees the requirements for career progression (under the new definition referenced above), in addition to each positions terms of compensation, benefits, full-time or part-time status, duties and access to further advancement.

The law does not define who would be considered an eligible employee.

Enhancement of the CDLEs investigatory powers Lastly, the amendment now requires the CDLE to create and administer a process to accept and mediate complaints, investigate complaints, order compliance and relief, and provide legal resources regarding violations of the wage discrimination provisions of the law.

In addition, the amendment expanded the maximum period for which aggrieved employees will be able to recover back pay  from three to six years  for violations of the law.

We expect to see more guidance from the CDLE on these processes in the near future, in addition to further guidance on the pay transparency amendment.

Considerations for employers For multistate employers, complying with this patchwork of pay transparency laws is increasingly challenging.

According to the National Womens Law Center , nearly 44.8 million people  or 26.6% of the labor force  is now covered by various state pay transparency laws.

Employers with multistate operations may wish to consider adopting a uniform nationwide policy addressing salary ranges, including policies addressing promotion and transfer opportunities, as the number of states enacting pay transparency laws will undoubtedly increase.

Employers may wish to consider, for example, adopting a national policy that complies with the most stringent pay transparency requirements of the states in which it operates or has employees, in order to reduce the administrative burden of tracking and complying with several different laws in multiple jurisdictions.

Employers also should pay special attention to where employees are located, particularly remote and hybrid employees, and their reporting structures.

For example, the Illinois and New York laws include positions that may be performed out of state or from other employer locations, if they report into the state.

Determining an accurate reporting structure is essential to complying with these requirements.

In addition, employers should train appropriate staff and hiring managers to ensure compliance with any recordkeeping obligations, reporting requirements, employee pay inquiry responses and related data security matters.

If not already done, employers also may wish to conduct a pay equity audit in conjunction with legal counsel to take advantage of legal safe harbors afforded to employers who run such audits.

Legal counsel can assist with making applicable adjustments and communicating those adjustments to employees and external stakeholders.

Cooley,Texas Court Strikes Down CFPB Policy Expanding UDAAP Authority to Prohibit Discrimination in Noncredit Financial Products and Services,"On September 8, 2023, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) exceeded its authority when it announced via an update to its exam manual a new policy to consider as unfair certain discriminatory acts and practices  including with respect to offering noncredit products and services.

In its ruling, the court vacated the CFPBs exam manual update and enjoined the CFPB from enforcing the policy with respect to members of the plaintiff organizations that challenged the policy, which includes, among others, the US Chamber of Commerce and Consumer Bankers Association.

Challenged policy significantly expanded scope of CFPBs antidiscrimination efforts In its March 16, 2022, update to the unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) chapter of the exam manual, the CFPB offered examples of practices that may be unfair because they are discriminatory.

This included giving inferior terms to one customer demographic as compared to another, offering more products or services to one customer demographic as compared to another, and engaging in targeted advertising or marketing in a discriminatory manner.

While the CFPB traditionally has had authority, pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), to prohibit discrimination in the offering of credit products, the update to the exam manual indicated the CFPB also would assess noncredit offerings for discrimination.

This would have included an assessment of potential discrimination with respect to institutions deployment of models, algorithms and decision-making processes, assessment of fees, and customer product usage, including with respect to noncredit products.

Court:

CFPBs decision to examine institutions for unfair discrimination  including for products and services falling outside ECOAs scope  exceeded its statutory authority Relying on the major questions doctrine, the court considered whether Congress meant to confer upon the CFPB the power to examine institutions for unfair discrimination.

The court determined that the CFPBs decision had significant economic and political implications and, as such, the bureaus action would need to be based upon a clear statement from Congress that the bureau should have such authority.

The court found that the statutory definition of unfairness does not mention discrimination, is separate from other statutory provisions that do regulate discriminatory practices and has not historically been understood to encompass the power to prohibit discrimination.

Thus, the court ruled that the CFPBs updates to the exam manual, which directed examiners to look at discriminatory practices as unfair, exceeded the CFPBs statutory authority.

The court also followed the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuits decision in Community Financial Services Association of America v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, ruling that the exam manual was invalid because the CFPB is unconstitutionally funded.

While the court could have ceased its analysis on these grounds, the court nevertheless considered the exam manual updates on the basis of the major questions doctrine in light of the US Supreme Courts pending review of the CFPBs funding mechanism, which provided a compelling reason to reach at least one alternative ground for providing relief to the plaintiffs in this case.

Whats next?

The CFPB indicated on September 11, 2023, that it is reviewing its options for appeal, and noted on its website that the updated language in the UDAAP chapter is no longer operative."
Cooley,Texas Court Strikes Down CFPB Policy Expanding UDAAP Authority to Prohibit Discrimination in Noncredit Financial Products and Services,"Whats next?

The CFPB indicated on September 11, 2023, that it is reviewing its options for appeal, and noted on its website that the updated language in the UDAAP chapter is no longer operative.

In other instances where the CFPB is litigating over the scope of its authority  and even while a Supreme Court decision looms as to its very constitutionality  the bureau has not withdrawn from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement activity in other jurisdictions except where it must (for example, with respect to its small business lending rule , where the bureau has stayed compliance only for plaintiffs and members of plaintiff organizations , in the case successfully challenging implementation of that rule).

This decision is different than some others, however, because the injunction prohibits the CFPB from enforcing the manual against the members of the plaintiff organizations, while vacating the rule  in this case, the exam manual  is a more universal remedy that means the bureau should not continue to rely on it.

But what it portends for future litigation and enforcement activities where this same theory has been applied remains to be seen.

One thing is certain: Financial institutions will need to think carefully about their exam management approach and confer with counsel early about requests that implicate the ruling."

Cooley,Model Money Transmission Modernization Act: 12 States Take Action,"Since the beginning of 2023, 12 states  Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas  have passed legislation based, to varying degrees, on the Model Money Transmission Modernization Act (Model Act) developed by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), with input from a working group constituted of industry participants and regulators.

These states join Arizona, which replaced its money transmission law with a new statute based almost entirely on the Model Act, and West Virginia, which incorporated substantial elements of the Model Act  both last year.

Overview of money transmission laws and the Model Act Money transmitters are regulated at the state and federal levels.

At the federal level, companies engaged in money transmission are generally subject to anti-money laundering compliance program obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act.

Additionally, each US state 1 (with the exception of Montana) regulates money transmission under a state-specific licensing regime.

As a result, the regulatory frameworks under which money transmitters operate can vary significantly from state to state.

CSBS, which released the Model Act two years ago, drafted it with the goal of creating a single set of nationwide standards and requirements that would be adopted by states, therefore harmonizing the regulation of money transmitters and other similarly situated payments companies.

If broadly and uniformly adopted, the Model Act would standardize definitions applicable to money transmission activity, as well as relevant exemptions from licensing, including an exemption for an agent of a payee.

The Model Act also is intended to eliminate technical differences between states that create unnecessary compliance burdens for companies operating in multiple states  which, in todays environment, encompasses most companies.

For example, the Model Act provides a mechanism for streamlining and accelerating the licensing and acquisition of control processes, including standardized determinations of whether an individual or an entity is in control of a licensee and therefore subject to a pre-acquisition approval process.

(Related to these change of control processes, the Model Act also is intended to standardize required background check and vetting processes.)

The Model Act also provides a uniform approach to prudential standards, including the calculations of required minimum net worth and surety bond amounts, as well as the types of permissible investments.

Adoption timetable In the states that have enacted legislation based on the Model Act, the new laws are starting to take effect.

The Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Nevada and South Dakota laws became effective on July 1, 2023, Minnesotas law became effective on August 1, 2023, and Texass law took effect on September 1, 2023.

Legislation from the remaining states will take effect in the coming months.

Many of the states that adopted substantially all of the Model Act have included a transition period for existing licensees.

These provisions generally provide that such companies are not subject to the updated law until their next license renewal, to the extent that it conflicts with the prior law.

State approaches to the Model Act States have taken varying approaches to implementing the Model Act.

Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas have each passed legislation that implements substantially all of the Model Act in one bill.

With the exception of Iowa, these adoptions were executed by replacing the states existing money transmission law in its entirety (or near entirety) with the new law.

However, none of these states adopted the Model Act verbatim, and each deviation can impact companies approaches to managing compliance with money transmission laws on a state-by-state basis."
Cooley,Model Money Transmission Modernization Act: 12 States Take Action,"However, none of these states adopted the Model Act verbatim, and each deviation can impact companies approaches to managing compliance with money transmission laws on a state-by-state basis.

Other states have only partially implemented the Model Act by selecting certain provisions to incorporate into their existing money transmission laws.

Furthermore, some states have implemented different sections of the Model Act at different times.

For example, Georgia and South Dakota enacted some elements of the Model Act in 2022, and other provisions this legislative session.

And Georgia, like West Virginia last year, also implemented Model Act provisions through regulation.

While some elements of the Model Act have been relatively uniformly incorporated into these states new laws (such as the agent of a payee exemption), in many cases, there is variance in key terms or elements of regulation.

The result is that licensed money transmitters  and companies considering applying to become licensed money transmitters  will likely need to continue tracking and managing compliance on a state-by-state basis instead of being able to rely on a single, uniform law.

Below we provide an overview of some key elements of the Model Act and how the various state implementations address each element.

Please note that the information provided herein is not intended as a comprehensive account of each new or different provision in each states money transmission law, and companies should review legislative changes with counsel as appropriate to address their ongoing compliance obligations.

Exemptions The Model Act contains various exemptions from money transmission regulation.

States that adopted the Model Act in place of their existing money transmission laws generally kept each of the exemptions from the Model Act.

As a result, the agent of a payee exemption, as set out in the Model Act, is (or will be) law in the 14 states that have enacted Model Act-related legislation (though West Virginia did not conform its existing, similar exemption to the Model Act version of the exemption).

Other notable exemptions, also broadly enacted, include an exemption for a service provider to an exempt bank and an exemption for an entity that processes payments solely between and among exempt entities and/or money transmission licensees.

The Model Act also includes a carve-out for firms that process payments between a licensed entity that has directly incurred an outstanding money transmission obligation to a sender and the senders designated recipient.

(Each of these exemptions is subject to specific criteria, and the laws generally provide the state banking department with the authority to require any entity seeking to avail itself of the exemption to demonstrate that it meets such criteria.)

Permissible investments and net worth One of the foundational elements of customer protection under the state money transmission licensing regimes is the requirement that a licensee must maintain permissible investments that equal or exceed  at all times  the licensees outstanding money transmission obligations (effectively, the amount of money received from customers for transmission but not yet paid to a designated beneficiary or otherwise redeemed).

The permissible investments concept is generally the same in all states that have such a requirement, and it generally requires a licensee to hold funds in relatively low-risk, liquid investments.

However, the specific assets and holdings  e.g., money market funds, certificates of deposit (CDs), etc.  that constitute a permissible investment vary significantly under existing laws.

The Model Act creates a standardized and modernized list of permissible investments which includes cash (including bank deposits) and cash equivalents, CDs, senior debt obligations from insured deposit institutions, AAA-rated money market funds, US government debt, and irrevocable letters of credit that meet specific and detailed criteria."
Cooley,Model Money Transmission Modernization Act: 12 States Take Action,"Several states have not adhered to the Model Acts list of permissible investments.

Georgia, for example, adds a general requirement to maintain permissible investments, but does not define any permissible investments by statute; permissible investments are established by rule , and do not include an irrevocable letter of credit as a permissible investment, as other states have done.

Hawaiis new money transmission legislation does not update the states existing permissible investments definitions.

South Dakota adopted the Model Act permissible investments list in its entirety, except for a change in the treatment of cross-border outbound payments made via wire.

West Virginia largely enacted, through statute and follow-on regulation, the Model Act permissible investments provisions but established a fixed date for the annual expiration of the letter of credit (assuming it is used as a permissible investment).

The Model Act also establishes a single formula for determining the amount of minimum net worth an applicant (and subsequently, a licensee) must maintain at all times.

Licensees must hold the greater of $100,000 or 3% of total assets for the first $100 million of total assets, 2% of additional assets between $100 million and $1 billion, and 0.5% of additional assets for more than $1 billion.

The Model Act provides a provision expressly authorizing applicable banking department authority (generally, a commissioner) to waive this requirement  in whole or in part  for good cause shown.

Some states included this provision, while others (such as Tennessee and Nevada) did not.

Payroll processors The applicability of state money transmission laws to companies that provide payroll processing services has been in question for a number of years.

A handful of states exempt payroll service providers that meet certain criteria, while other states have historically not applied their money transmission laws to payroll providers, and still others have deemed payroll processing to constitute money transmission.

The Model Act attempts to address this inconsistency by expressly defining money transmission activity subject to licensing to include payroll processing, defined in the Model Act as receiving money for transmission pursuant to a contract with a person to deliver wages or salaries, make payment of payroll taxes to state and federal agencies, [make payments relating to employee benefit plans], or make distributions of other authorized deductions from wages or salaries.

However, only some of the states that enacted Model Act legislation incorporated the express provisions pertaining to payroll processing.

The Hawaii and Indiana laws do not expressly include payroll processing services in their respective definitions of money transmission.

Similarly, Arizona, which passed the first money transmission law based on the Model Act in 2022, did not include payroll processing in its definition of money transmission.

Other changes While there are deviations among states that have changed their money transmission laws based on the Model Act, adoption of the new law also has eliminated some unique state requirements.

For example, while Georgia still requires background checks to be conducted on the employees of a licensee, licensees now have more flexibility in how they conduct such background checks.

In addition, the new Nevada money transmission law has eliminated the former laws requirement that all officers and directors of a licensee be legally authorized to work in the US (thus impacting non-US executives or directors at applicants and licensees).

Virtual currency and digital assets The Model Act contains an optional article specifically pertaining to the regulation of virtual currency.

Unlike the other provisions of the Model Act, this article was not the product of consensus among participants in the CSBS working group."
Cooley,Model Money Transmission Modernization Act: 12 States Take Action,"Unlike the other provisions of the Model Act, this article was not the product of consensus among participants in the CSBS working group.

As the commentary to the virtual currency provisions notes, it is [d]erived from the Virtual-Currency Businesses Act published by the Uniform Law Commissions Uniform Regulation of Virtual-Currency Businesses Act.

Nevertheless, this article would provide for the regulation of covered virtual currency activities under the existing money transmission law (in contrast to states such as Louisiana or New York, which have implemented separate virtual currency licensing regimes ).

With some exceptions, this section of the Model Act would require entities that exchange, transfer or store virtual currency to register for a money transmission license.

Like Louisiana, the Model Act defines virtual currency as a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value that is not legal tender whether or not it is denominated in legal tender.

As with Louisianas law and New Yorks regulations, digital assets issued and usable only in merchant rewards programs or in online games are excluded from the definition.

Among the Model Acts virtual currency provisions are requirements that licensees maintain holdings of virtual currency in kind sufficient to satisfy the aggregate entitlements of the licensees customers to the type of virtual currency.

Of the bills passed this year, only Minnesotas and North Dakotas adopt the Model Acts provision for regulating virtual currency.

Additionally, Texass new law addresses the regulation of virtual currencies to some degree by defining stablecoins as a type of money  and therefore requiring persons engaging in covered stablecoin activities to be licensed.

The Texas law also permits money transmitters to hold stablecoins as a permissible investment against their stablecoin-denominated obligations.

Finally, even in states that have not expressly addressed virtual currency in their Model Act-related legislation, the definition of receiving money for transmission includes receiving monetary value for transmission.

Monetary value is defined by the Model Act as a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money, and many existing state money transmission laws employ a similar definition.

The breadth of monetary value could be interpreted by a regulator to encompass virtual currencies and other digital assets, depending on how they function.

What should payments companies expect?

Despite the progress made this legislative session, the opportunity for substantial improvement and harmonization remains.

As recently passed legislation relating to the Model Act comes into effect and is implemented over the next few months, industry should closely review the changes to the laws in these states and any related guidance issued by state banking departments.

Similarly, participants should track developments as more states introduce and potentially enact legislation based on the Model Act.

Note The District of Columbia and US territories, including Puerto Rico, Guam and the US Virgin Islands, also have money transmission licensing laws."
Cooley,DOJ’s Top Antitrust Official Turns Spotlight on Broadened Scope of Bank Merger Enforcement,"In the wake of major bank failures in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has signaled that it plans to step up antitrust enforcement of bank mergers.

In June 2023, the DOJs Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter delivered a speech at the Brookings Institution , providing listeners with insights into significant changes in the way the DOJ and bank regulators are reviewing proposed bank mergers.

[T]he division is modernizing its approach to investigating and reporting on the full range of competitive factors involved in a bank merger to ensure that we are taking into account todays market realities and the many dimensions of competition in the modern banking sector, stated Kanter.

While Kanter reported that the DOJ is working with federal bank regulators on new, formal guidance, he used the speech to provide informal, interim guidance on how the DOJ is currently evaluating bank deals.

The DOJs new approach will subject banks proposing to merge to a wide-ranging review that is less easily resolved through branch divestitures, as has been common in the past.

With Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen predicting a wave of consolidation in the banking industry , and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus continued focus on consumer protection risks arising from consolidation, banks looking to merge will find themselves navigating through new waters.

Background and procedure for bank merger review The DOJ and the prudential bank regulators work closely together to investigate proposed bank mergers.

By statute, the DOJ must evaluate whether the merger would violate antitrust laws and report its findings in a competitive factors report submitted to bank regulators.

The bank regulators, for their part, may not approve any merger that violates antitrust laws, unless they conclude that any anticompetitive effects are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.

If this criterion is not met, the DOJ may sue to block the merger in court under Section 7 of the Clayton Act  the same statute that governs mergers in other sectors.

Traditionally, in evaluating the competitive impact of a proposed bank merger, the DOJ has placed significant weight on local market shares and concentration statistics as measured by local deposits.

Mergers that resulted in high concentration levels in local markets generally have been allowed to proceed, subject to divestitures of branches to other banks.

Historically, the DOJ has negotiated branch divestiture settlements with the merging parties and appended these settlements to its competitive factors report submitted to bank regulators.

The bank regulators have then incorporated the DOJs settlements into their orders approving these mergers.

The DOJs new approach In the speech, Kanter shared his view that the DOJs historical approach  now three decades old  has not kept pace with developments in the banking sector.

In particular, he noted that banks today may compete in many more geographic areas, across many more business lines, and on many different dimensions than they did three decades ago.

He criticized the past approach as disproportionally focus[ing] enforcement on transactions involving small local banks and understat[ing] network concerns relating to large national and multi-national banks.

He also noted that the DOJs past approach failed to account for the diverse set of customer financial needs in todays economy.

To address these shortcomings, Kanter identified several significant changes in the DOJs approach to reviewing bank mergers.

The DOJ will apply a broader lens, use new metrics and consider additional dimensions of competition in evaluating the effects of a merger."
Cooley,DOJ’s Top Antitrust Official Turns Spotlight on Broadened Scope of Bank Merger Enforcement,"The DOJ will apply a broader lens, use new metrics and consider additional dimensions of competition in evaluating the effects of a merger.

The DOJ will consider how a proposed merger may affect competition in retail banking, small-business banking and large-to-midsize banking and will consider concentration levels using a wide range of metrics, beyond just bank overlaps and local deposits.

While Kanter did not mention specific new metrics, he reported that the DOJ and federal bank regulators are working to augment their data sources.

Kanter also noted that the DOJs competitive factors report will go beyond a simple assessment of concentration levels to evaluate the likely impact of a proposed merger across a variety of dimensions on which banks compete  including fees, interest rates, branch locations, product variety, network effects, interoperability, and customer service.

The impact on competition for different customer segments will be analyzed.

Kanter also committed to evaluating the impact of proposed mergers on variety and choice, noting that customers needs vary significantly in the modern banking system, and that [t]o protect competition, antitrust enforcers must ensure that customers retain a meaningful choice as to the type of bank with which they do business by recognizing that different segments of customers have different needs and that substitution across different types of banks may be limited.

There will be increased scrutiny of all types of bank mergers and evaluation of a broader set of harm theories.

Kanter cautioned that the DOJ will closely scrutinize mergers that increase the risk of anticompetitive coordination between banks, which has not been a major focus in banking in the past.

Historically, the DOJ has instead focused on harm resulting from a reduction in head-to-head competition between the merging parties.

Kanter also explained that, consistent with the DOJs review in other sectors, DOJ staff will examine the extent to which a transaction threatens to entrench power of the most dominant banks by excluding existing or potential disruptive threats or rivals.

In short, no bank merger appears safe from DOJ scrutiny, with Kanter warning that the DOJ will scrutinize any transaction that presents substantive legal concerns  ranging from small and local bank acquisitions to those involving the largest and most powerful actors.

The DOJ will step back from divestiture remedies.

Kanter reminded the audience that the DOJs job is enforcing the law, not micromanaging or regulating the private sector, and thus, the DOJs statutorily prescribed role in reviewing bank mergers is twofold: to provide federal banking agencies with an analysis of competitive factors and to enforce federal antitrust laws.

Accordingly, Kanter stated that, going forward, the DOJ plans to focus on providing advisory opinions, as required by law, rather than on combining those opinions with divestiture agreements with merging parties, which has long been the norm.

Kanter reasoned that [w]e owe it to the public to maintain a high bar for the divestitures we will accept, and [b]ranch divestitures may not always be adequate to address the broader range of competitive and antitrust concerns.

The bottom line The DOJs new approach creates significant uncertainty about how bank mergers will play out in the years ahead.

Based on Kanters speech, the DOJ appears more likely to find fault with specific bank mergers and less likely to sign on to proposed solutions in the form of branch divestitures.

This will, in turn, create pressure on bank regulators who are prohibited from approving any merger that violates antitrust laws, unless they find that the mergers anticompetitive effects are outweighed by the public interest.

Assuming bank regulators do not step in, we should expect the DOJ to bring more cases challenging bank mergers."
Cooley,DOJ’s Top Antitrust Official Turns Spotlight on Broadened Scope of Bank Merger Enforcement,"Assuming bank regulators do not step in, we should expect the DOJ to bring more cases challenging bank mergers.

This is particularly meaningful in a year where the industry has seen increased interest in such consolidation, particularly in the small-to-midsize bank sector, in no small part due to the recent, large-scale bank failures that continue to drive policy discussions in Washington, DC.

Banks proposing to merge may have a much higher hill to climb in convincing the DOJ and bank regulators that their proposed acquisitions will advance the public interest.

We therefore recommend that banks considering transactions seek advice early in the process to help navigate the evolving regulatory landscape."
Cooley,Uncertain Copyright and Patent Protections in the AI Age,"Editor's note: Authored by Adam Gershenson, Angela Dunning, Kristin Leavy and Dustin Knight, this article was originally published in Law360 .

Advances in artificial intelligence technology have enabled the generation of new inventions, text, images, videos, and other content with unprecedented speed and ease.

They also give rise to a crucial question: How do intellectual property laws protect what is created using AI?

For both copyright and patent law, the answer is evolving.

Recent decisions and pronouncements demonstrate that AI cannot be a wholesale substitute for human intelligence, skill and creativity.

But that is not to say that all AI-assisted content is currently barred from protection in the U.S. Patent Law

The Patent Act requires inventors to be natural persons.

Last year, in Thaler v. Vidal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected an application for a patent covering output generated from AI software that the applicant created, where the application identified the AI as its would-be inventor.

The USPTO determined that an inventor must be an individual, and that an individual must be a natural person, precluding an AI as the inventor.

The Federal Circuit agreed, but sidestepped ""whether inventions made by human beings with the assistance of AI are eligible for patent protection.""

The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari, leaving intact the Federal Circuit's decision.

Since Thaler, the USPTO has explored the role of AI in inventorship and its implications on intellectual property policy through its AI and emerging technology partnership initiative, and by seeking public input in a February request for comment.

These inquiries explore the degree to which AI systems influence the innovation ecosystem, the ways in which reliance on AI systems differs from the use of other technical tools in invention ideation, and what patent protection should be available if an AI system contributes to an invention at the same level as a human under the doctrine of joint inventorship.

Looking ahead, AI assistance will be key to inventions on everything from software to medical devices, as will the contours of a regime that determines when such output should be recognized as a patentable invention, with the attendant exclusive right to use, make and sell such products.

Copyright Law

The Copyright Act has repeatedly been interpreted to require human authorship.

Although authors may utilize technological tools to assist in creating copyrightable works, those works must be created by humans.

In August, in Thaler v. Perlmutter, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment to the U.S. Copyright Office and denied a cross-motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiff Stephen Thaler.

Thaler argued that the Copyright Office had erred when refusing copyright registration for a work ""autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine"" Thaler had invented and dubbed the ""creativity machine.""

In denying registration, the Copyright Office reasoned that copyright extends only to works created by human authors and not works created entirely by an AI.

The court agreed with the Copyright Office that copyrightability requires ""human involvement in, and ultimate creative control over, the work,"" and that ""human creativity is the sine qua non at the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into new media.""

Works originating entirely from nonhumans are not protectable under copyright law, but human creativity coupled with technology may result in a work that is protectable under copyright, like photos taken by a human using a camera."
Cooley,Uncertain Copyright and Patent Protections in the AI Age,"The court acknowledged that ""we are approaching new frontiers in copyright"" and that many open questions remain, including how much human input is necessary to qualify the user of an AI system as an ""author"" of a generated work, the scope of the protection obtained over the resultant image, how to assess the originality of AI-generated works where the systems may have been trained on unknown pre-existing works, how copyright might best be used to incentivize creative works involving AI, and more.

Although the court in Thaler addressed the narrow issue of whether a work created by artificial intelligence without human creativity is protectable under copyright, the Copyright Office has been wrestling with the new frontier of how much human involvement is necessary for copyright registration.

According to the Copyright Office, as of June, it had received less than 100 claims of works known to incorporate content created using generative AI.

In its 2021 Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, the Copyright Office clarified that ""to qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being,"" and that it ""will not register works produced by a machine or mere mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author.""

In order to further clarify its practices for examining and registering works that contain AI-generated materials, the Copyright Office issued copyright registration guidance for these works, which requires disclosure of the inclusion of unclaimable AI-generated content and the claimable human contributions in a work submitted for registration.

Applying these principles, in its registration decision regarding the comic book ""Zarya of the Dawn,"" the Copyright Office denied protection for images created using the generative AI art platform Midjourney Inc.

The office indicated that rather than being a tool that the author ""controlled and guided to reach her desired image, Midjourney generates images in an unpredictable way.""

Under this view, the prompts that a user provides are merely suggesting, rather than directing, what the content output will look like.

The Copyright Office allowed registration for the text and the selection and arrangement of images and text where the applicant, Kris Kashtanova, attested Kashtanova was solely responsible for those elements.

Kashtanova's second, still-pending application, points to a new doctrinal frontier.

That application raises the issue of whether copyright law will cover as a derivative work an image, titled ""Rose Enigma,"" that originated with a copyrighted drawing by a human author but was then iterated upon with an AI tool to add color and dimensionality but otherwise retain substantial similarity of the original expression.

The Copyright Office has yet to weigh in on this scenario, but a June webinar on registration guidance for works containing AI-generated content reiterated the office's position that AI-developed or modified works are not eligible for protection under copyright law, using an example of an illustration modified by AI:

[I]f you plan to use AI to make appreciable changes to a photograph or illustration that was created by a human author, you can register the human authored photograph or illustration without the AI modifications, even if the only version that you intend to publicly display or publicly distribute is the modified AI version.

If AI is used to make only de minimis changes, then it does not matter whether you registered before or after, because in neither case would disclosure be required.

Protection only accrues to the human-authored components and not to any of the AI tool manipulations, but the resultant image or work may nevertheless be substantially similar to the original copyrighted one, such that it constitutes a protectable derivative that third parties may not copy without permission."
Cooley,Uncertain Copyright and Patent Protections in the AI Age,"The Copyright Office's decision with respect to the registrability of ""Rose Enigma"" will determine this issue, and may also elucidate whether there may be circumstances in which authors exert sufficient control over an AI tool  e.g., by including their copyrighted material in detailed prompts so that they can control what is generated, resulting in output protectable under copyright law.

Looking Ahead Until Congress, courts or regulators take more definitive action, the landscape will feature rapidly advancing technology governed by outmoded rules that cannot keep pace.

Still, possibilities abound.

Both the USPTO and the Copyright Office have left open the possibility that AI-assisted works will be protectable under patent and copyright laws, and are investigating how to enable some form of intellectual property protection for AI-enabled innovation.

For example, where inventors and authors exert sufficient control over the AI to demonstrate user-directed output, protection may arise.

Although based on current guidance, not all use of generative AI technology will produce copyright-registerable content, the Copyright Office will consider whether the AI contributions are an author's ""own original mental conception, to which [the author] gave visible form"" in determining whether the human direction was sufficient.

The Copyright Office will make this determination on a case-by-case basis, and the ""answer will depend on the circumstances, particularly how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final work.""

The Copyright Office has acknowledged that, like everyone else, it is still learning about generative artificial intelligence.

As it has the chance to review more copyright applications and research the technologies used to create works subject to those applications, the Copyright Office expects to provide more guidance on authorship and the scope of protection for works generated in whole or in part with AI tools.

Control and direction are likely to be key components in its analysis.

Similarly, in the patent realm, we might expect more protection to arise where a human inventor enjoyed assistance from AI, but nonetheless made the primary novel contributions to the invention.

Given the uncertainties in the law, for now, would-be authors and inventors should closely document their personal contributions to their works and inventions, as contrasted with contributions made by AI technologies.

This is particularly important for authors, as those seeking to avail themselves of a copyright registration must also disclose the existence of AI-generated content or components to the Copyright Office, with the understanding that those components may not be protectable or claimable  or risk wholesale rejection of their copyright registrations.

Given the potentially evolving nature of these legal issues, authors and inventors should be prepared to identify how and with which technologies AI contributed to their works.

If an approach more favorable to authors and inventors who use AI is adopted by the Patent Office or Copyright Office and permits protection where a human inventor was assisted by AI, this documentation will be critical to support intellectual property protection.

AI itself seems to expect a balanced approach.

When asked recently whether AI-generated works should be protected by copyright or patent law, ChatGPT opined that ultimately, ""finding a balance between encouraging innovation and creativity while respecting ethical considerations is crucial.""

The coming years will test how well our legal regimes strike that balance."
Cooley,FCC Seeking Input on New Internet of Things Cybersecurity Program,"As we explained in an August 2023 client alert , the US Cyber Trust Mark program will provide consumers with information about the relative security of an Internet of Things (IoT) device or product.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently took the next step in establishing the US Cyber Trust Mark program when it released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) seeking input about the rules and processes that will govern the program.

This is the last step the FCC must take prior to setting final rules.

In the NPRM, the FCC asks for comment on which devices or products should be eligible for the US Cyber Trust Mark program, how the program should be managed and administered, and whether it should be managed or administered by the FCC or third parties.

The FCC also seeks comment on the criteria and standards a device or product must satisfy to be eligible to display the US Cyber Trust Marks logo.

While participation in the program will be voluntary, parties choosing to participate must adhere to the programs standards, and the FCC is asking what enforcement measures should be adopted to ensure compliance by program participants.

The FCC proposes that program participants file for renewal each year, and it asks how the program can ensure consumers have access to up-to-date information regarding the participating device or product.

The FCC proposes to develop the qualifying standards jointly with industry groups and other stakeholders, and it seeks comment on whether the FCC or an outside entity is in the best position to convene stakeholders and timely establish the details of a testing program.

The FCC proposes that the standards be based on cybersecurity criteria developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), but it also asks whether other criteria should be considered.

The FCC notes that NIST already has identified the key elements of a labeling program, and it seeks comment on various aspects of the NIST standards.

Comments on the FCCs proposals are due on October 6, 2023, and reply comments are due on November 10, 2023.

We expect the FCC will prioritize this proceeding  meaning that the new program could be launched as soon as the second half of 2024.

Cooley,"Fair Lending Activity: Calm on the Surface, Churning Below","Editor's note: Authored by Michelle Rogers, Josh Kotin and Margaux Curie, this article was originally published in Law360 .

""Fairness"" in financial services has been the watchword of the Biden administration's consumer financial services policy from day one, with the administration making a number of big pronouncements to combat redlining,[1] appraisal bias,[2] digital marketing,[3] and bias in the deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools throughout the underwriting process.[4]

The Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been outspoken on these and other fair lending topics but in 2022 brought only one public fair lending enforcement action.

On June 29, the CFPB issued its annual fair lending report to Congress, confirming that, despite the paucity of public fair lending enforcement actions in 2022, the CFPB and prudential banking agencies are engaged in significant nonpublic oversight, examination and enforcement activities.

These oversight activities extend to virtually all consumer lending products, as well as small-business loans.

And, while the CFPB is focused on bias with respect to advanced and emerging technologies, the report details a host of regulatory activities around technical noncompliance with fair lending protections related to not only race and ethnicity  areas of traditional concern  but also with respect to age discrimination and public assistance discrimination.

The bureau is keeping a watchful eye for discrimination risks associated with the deployment of new technologies.

In its annual report, the CFPB describes how it and other agencies are focused on understanding and monitoring risks of discrimination associated with new or advanced technologies.

The CFPB indicates in the report that it is already using its Equal Credit Opportunity Act and unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices supervisory authority to look at bias in automated systems and models, including the targeting of vulnerable populations.

More broadly, in the bureau's discussion about the future of fair lending, the CFPB flags discrimination risks associated with sophisticated digital marketing, fraud screens and underwriting models reliant on artificial intelligence and machine learning, and chatbots and behavioral analytics that affect post-origination consumer interactions.

To that end, the bureau states it is ""increasing its expertise in data science and analytics to ensure that we can identify fair lending violations ... and hold creditors and service providers accountable for fully complying with fair lending and other federal consumer financial laws.""

Using somewhat charged language, the CFPB also highlights in its report concerns with ""big tech platforms,"" which collect data that ""are now fueling highly complex, black box algorithms.""

Making good on these concerns, in its July 26 supervisory highlights, the bureau notes it has begun flexing its authority to supervise nonbank entities that the CFPB has ""reasonable cause to determine"" pose risks to consumers, and that several entities not ordinarily subject to CFPB supervisory authority have voluntarily consented to be examined.

Scrutiny of the deployment of emerging technologies has clearly already begun, and can be expected to continue, particularly given all the public excitement and coverage of developments in artificial intelligence technology.

The lack of CFPB fair lending enforcement actions in 2022 is by no means an indication of lax enforcement and stringent oversight.

The CFPB brought only one fair lending enforcement action in 2022  a joint settlement with Trident Mortgage and the U.S. Department of Justice and attorneys general over claims of redlining in the Philadelphia region."
Cooley,"Fair Lending Activity: Calm on the Surface, Churning Below","However, the report reflects that the CFPB devoted significant resources to fair lending oversight in the past year, and it is engaging in substantial nonpublic examinations and investigations of lending activity across a wide range of products.

Specifically, the CFPB indicates it is conducting active fair lending investigations in product markets including student lending, payday lending, credit cards and mortgage lending for evidence of discriminatory UDAAP and/or ECOA violations.

In the mortgage space, the CFPB notes it is looking at redlining, reverse redlining, and pricing exception and home valuation practices.

Picking up on themes highlighted in its annual report, the CFPB also disclosed in its most recent supervisory highlights a host of fair lending issues identified in examinations.

In the mortgage space, the bureau for the second time in its supervisory highlights describes the risks associated with the use of pricing exceptions in mortgage lending.

The bureau noted that examiners found disparities with respect to the number of pricing exceptions for competitive reasons granted to protected class borrowers as compared to nonprotected class borrowers.

The bureau also criticized institutions for, among other things, maintaining inadequate policies and procedures governing pricing exceptions, failing to document the justification for exceptions, and not taking corrective actions when risks were identified.

The bureau also describes in its supervisory highlights concerns about certain attributes used in underwriting for a variety of financial products and services.

In particular, the bureau notes that the use of attributes related to a consumer's ""prior contact with the criminal justice system"" is likely to have a disparate impact based on race and national origin, and its use therefore creates a heightened risk of fair lending violations.

The bureau also describes underwriting policies and concern that inadequately credit, or account for, the receipt of public assistance income.

When it comes to fair lending oversight and enforcement, the CFPB is by no means the only game in town.

From a federal perspective, the annual report states that the bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ., the Federal Reserve Board and the National Credit Union Administration collectively referred 23 potential fair lending violations to the Justice Department in 2022, with the FDIC accounting for 12, the CFPB and the NCUA accounting for five each, and the FRB accounting for one.

Those referrals covered mortgage lending, consumer lending, auto pricing and credit cards.

This referral activity shows that, while agencies have concerns about more traditional areas of focus  redlining and discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity in underwriting and pricing practices  there is also a significant focus on compliance with other ECOA protections.

In particular, the agencies are looking at improper consideration of consumer marital status, age, public assistance income, familial status and a consumer's exercise of rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

Outside the CFPB and federal banking regulators, the Federal Trade Commission and certain state agencies have shown similar interest in enforcing fair lending laws  particularly in the auto lending space.

For instance, at the end of 2022, the FTC settled with the auto dealership Passport Automotive Group alleging that it unfairly discriminated against Black and Latino customers by charging higher interest rate markups untethered to consumer creditworthiness, and more often charging them so-called junk fees.[5]

The New York Department of Financial Services also settled at the end of 2022 a similar case with Rhinebeck Bank pertaining to discrimination in pricing indirect auto loans.[6]"
Cooley,"Fair Lending Activity: Calm on the Surface, Churning Below","The New York Department of Financial Services also settled at the end of 2022 a similar case with Rhinebeck Bank pertaining to discrimination in pricing indirect auto loans.[6]

The Massachusetts Attorney General also charged two auto dealerships over alleged discriminatory pricing of add-on products, reaching a settlement with Hometown Auto Framingham in January.[7]

Fair lending hygiene remains important even if we can't point to new public settlements.

Whether you're using an abacus to calculate borrower income or letting machine learning models do the thinking for you, fair lending must remain top of mind.

As the bureau's 2023 fair lending report makes clear, regulators are interested in new and old lending practices, and are interested in fair lending risks across a wide array of products.

To that end, we expect regulators to continue deploying novel approaches for assessing fair lending risks, particularly outside the mortgage space where there is an absence of demographic information regarding the consumer.

This is likely to include monitoring institutional decision-making practices around the deployment of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning models.

With respect to advertising, regulators are likely to continue looking at dark patterns and distribution practices, which the bureau even weighed in via an amicus brief in pending ECOA-related litigation over practices at for-profit nursing school Health Career Institute LLC.[8]

Finally, regulators have always analyzed underwriting guidelines and customer complaints, and will continue to do so to identify new practices that may raise fair lending concerns.

Cooley,"USCIS Launches New Form I-9, Alternative Procedure for Virtual Documentation Inspection","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently launched a new Form I-9 for employers verifying employment eligibility and announced a new alternative procedure permitting certain employers to inspect employees Form I-9 documentation virtually.

According to the agency , the latest development responds to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, which demonstrated the substantial practical benefits of an optional alternative to the physical documentation examination procedures required by the employment eligibility verification regulations.

Below, weve answered common questions regarding the new form and alternative procedure.

What changes were made to the Form I-9?

Released on August 1, 2023, the new Form I-9 includes several changes to streamline materials and  reduce employer and employee burden associated with the form , including: Reducing Sections 1 and 2 to a single page.

Designing it to be a fillable form on tablets and mobile devices.

Moving Section 1s Preparer and/or Translator Certification to a supplemental page for use when necessary.

Revising the Lists of Acceptable Documents page to include acceptable receipts and links to information on automatic extensions of employment authorization documentation.

Changing Section 3, Reverification and Rehire, to a supplemental page for use if or when rehire occurs or reverification is required.

Including a check box for employers to indicate that they examined Form I-9 documentation remotely under the alternative procedure.

The instructions for completing the Form I-9 also were revised and reduced from 15 pages to eight pages, and they include guidance for employers choosing to use the alternative procedure for verification.

Whats the alternative procedure?

The alternative procedure permits qualified employers (explained below) to verify Form I-9 documents remotely via live video.

Specifically, within three business of an employees first day of employment, an employer wanting to use this procedure must: Examine copies (front and back, if the document is two-sided) of Form I-9 documents or an acceptable receipt to ensure that the documentation appears genuine.

Conduct a live video interaction with the employee presenting the document(s) to ensure that the documentation  which must be the same document(s) presented per Step 1 above  appears genuine.

Indicate via the new check box on the Form I-9 that the alternative procedure was used to examine documentation to complete Section 2 or for reverification, as applicable.

Employers using the prior Form I-9 (Edition 10/21/2019) should note that it does not contain a check box allowing them to indicate that documentation was reviewed using the alternative procedure.

Employers utilizing the alternative procedure with the 2019 edition of the Form I-9 should write Alternative Procedure in the Additional Information box under Section 2.

Employers using the alternative procedure also are required to retain clear and legible copies of the identity and employment authorization documentation (front and back, if the document is two-sided) for employees whose documents were verified using the alternative procedure.

Retaining required documentation and completing the Form I-9 in a timely, accurate and complete manner are critical, as employers may be required to produce Form I-9s and accompanying documentation in the event of an audit or investigation.

Employers face stiff penalties in connection with Form I-9 violations  for example, in 2022, a staffing companys Form I-9 compliance violations resulted in a fine of more than $1.5 million.

The violations included failing to produce in whole the requested Form I-9s, missing or blank pages, missing employee and employer attestations, untimely completion, invalid documents, and missing expiration dates.

Do employers have to record and save the live video?

No."
Cooley,"USCIS Launches New Form I-9, Alternative Procedure for Virtual Documentation Inspection","Do employers have to record and save the live video?

No.

The alternative procedure only requires that employers conduct the live video interaction with the employee in a format that offers at least an equivalent level of security to physical examination.

There is no separate requirement to record or save the live video.

Which employers can use the alternative procedure?

Qualified employers may (but are not required to) use the alternative procedure if they are participants in good standing in E-Verify.

Launched in 1996, E-Verify is a free, internet-based system that compares information entered by an employer from an employees Form I-9 to records available to the agency in order to confirm employment eligibility.

The program, which currently has more than one million employer subscribers, requires employers to participate in training as part of the enrollment process.

To be in good standing and take advantage of the alternative procedure, an employer must: Be enrolled in E-Verify with respect to all hiring sites  the location(s) where an employer hires employees and they complete the Form I-9  that use the alternative procedure.

Be in compliance with all requirements of the E-Verify program, including but not limited to verifying the employment eligibility of newly hired employees in the US.

Continue to be enrolled and a participant in good standing in E-Verify at any time during which the employer uses the alternative procedure.

Employers should note that USCIS requires qualified employers using the alternative procedure to complete the fraud awareness and anti-discrimination training that is required as part of the E-Verify enrollment process.

Does a qualified employer have to use the alternative procedure?

No.

The alternative procedure is completely optional and, as such, qualified employers can continue to physically examine I-9 documents.

However, if an employer opts to offer the alternative procedure to some employees at any E-Verify hiring site, that employer must do so consistently for all employees at that site.

Employers may choose to offer the alternative procedure for remote hires only but continue to apply physical examination procedures to all employees working on-site or in a hybrid capacity, as long as the employer does not adopt this procedure for a discriminatory purpose.

The USCIS notes that [u]nder no circumstances can employers unlawfully discriminate, such as by deciding who is eligible for the alternative procedure based on a protected characteristic.

Can employers still use the old Form I-9?

Yes.

Employers may continue to use the October 21, 2019, edition of the Form I-9 from August 1, 2023, until October 31, 2023.

If, however, employers use the 2019 edition for the alternative procedure during this grace period, they must write Alternative Procedure in the Additional Information field in Section 2 of the Form I-9.

Employers do not need to complete a new Form I-9 for any current employee with a properly completed Form I-9 on file, unless the employee needs to be reverified after October 31.

Can employers use the alternative procedure if an employee objects?

No.

Per the USCIS, employees who are unable or unwilling to submit documentation using the optional alternative procedure must be given the option to submit documentation in person for physical examination.

Can employers still use authorized representatives?

Yes.

The alternative procedure permits employers, including any authorized representative (such as a notary public or a professional service provider), to conduct the verification and live video and complete the Form I-9.

However, employers remain liable for any violations in connection with the form or the verification process.

Employers are still allowed to use authorized representatives to conduct physical verification and inspection of documents as well."
Cooley,"USCIS Launches New Form I-9, Alternative Procedure for Virtual Documentation Inspection","Employers are still allowed to use authorized representatives to conduct physical verification and inspection of documents as well.

Next steps The recent changes to the Form I-9 and verification procedures are likely welcome news for large employers, particularly those with remote or geographically dispersed employees.

Employers already enrolled in E-Verify should confirm they remain in good standing  and ensure that their HR and onboarding professionals have completed the required training.

Employers that would like to use the alternative procedure, but have not enrolled in E-Verify, should do so and complete the required training.

Employers also should determine the appropriate policy for using the alternative procedure, keeping in mind that such policy must be consistent and applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion.

For example, employers can consider using the alternative procedure for remote hires only and retain the physical verification procedures for in-person and hybrid employees.

HR and onboarding professionals also should be trained on the alternate procedure  and note that penalties for noncompliance can be steep.

Finally, employers who are not enrolled in E-Verify should keep an eye on continuing developments from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

For example, on August 3, 2023, DHS proposed a new pilot program for virtual Form I-9 inspections for employers not currently enrolled in E-Verify.

Under the proposed pilot program, DHS would limit participating employers to those with 500 or fewer employees, and it would require interested employers to complete a formal application for the program.

Cooley,Top 10 Considerations for Management in a UK IPO,"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is consulting on wide-ranging changes to the UK listing regime which would replace the current standard and premium listing categories with a single listing category.

In this post, we explain where the requirements may change as a result of the consultation, although the final rule changes and timings are still to be confirmed.

1. Share structure and cap table A key eligibility requirement for the London Stock Exchanges main market is that not less than 10% of the issuers shares must be in public hands at the time of listing and post-IPO; owners of stakes of greater than 5% and directors, amongst others, will not be considered in public hands.

In addition, in order to be eligible for the FTSE UK indices, a premium listed issuer currently would need to meet the FTSE free float requirements of 10% minimum free float for UK incorporated issuers and 25% minimum free float for non-UK incorporated issuers.

A limited form of dual-class voting structure is now permitted for a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, although there may be more flexibility on other UK markets (e.g., a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange).

The FCAs proposed single listing category would allow for dual-class voting structures, but the high-vote shares could be held only by directors of the company  and these structures would be subject to certain other restrictions, including a mandatory sunset provision of no longer than 10 years.

Make sure that your capitalisation records accurately reflect all share issuances, transfers and cancellations, as well as option and warrant issuances, exercises and cancellations.

Do not underestimate the work involved on a cross-functional basis between legal, HR and finance on managing the cap table and equity platform, as well as the transition to the registrar on an IPO.

2. Financial statements and accounting issues You will need to include consolidated financial statements for three years in the prospectus for your IPO.

For a premium listing, currently the latest audited financials must not be more than six months old, so depending on your financial year-end and the IPO window you are targeting, audited interim financial statements also may be required.

The financial statements included in the prospectus  known as the historical financial information (HFI)  for a UK-incorporated issuer will need to be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the accounting policies to be adopted by the company going forwards, as well as remain consistent throughout the financial track record period.

You will need to hire reporting accountants to report on the HFI in the disclosure document, but it does not need to be issued by the same accounting firm that issued the previous audit opinions.

Consider whether you will appoint your existing firm of auditors or a different firm as reporting accountants and, if the latter, focus on how they will work with your existing auditors to ensure timelines can be met.

For a premium listing, currently the HFI must: Show a revenue earning track record and put prospective investors in a position to make an informed assessment of the business.

Represent at least 75% of the companys business for the full financial track record period.

Where acquisitions have been undertaken, meaning that the second requirement has not been met, separate audited HFI for the acquired entities  prepared on the same basis as the rest of the HFI  will be required, which can necessitate significant work.

The FCAs proposed single listing category would not have either of these additional requirements.

You will need to identify any sensitive issues or any fine-line determinations in your significant accounting policies or practices, then discuss them with your reporting accountants."
Cooley,Top 10 Considerations for Management in a UK IPO,"You will need to identify any sensitive issues or any fine-line determinations in your significant accounting policies or practices, then discuss them with your reporting accountants.

Key financial statement issues include segmentation, consistency across reporting periods, disclosure in the notes to the financial statements, and the disclosure of alternative performance measures (APMs) and adjusted metrics.

The UK has reporting accountant workstreams which are not typically seen in other jurisdictions and will impact the overall IPO timetable, including the preparation of: A long-form report, which is a private financial due diligence report on significant aspects of the business.

A working capital report, which is a private report that considers the basis for the statement in the disclosure document that the company has sufficient working capital for at least 12 months.

3. Key metrics Public investors will be looking for operating metrics, beyond the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financials, that management uses to measure and run the business.

Investment bankers are very helpful, but a company should have its own perspective on the metrics that will work best over time.

Ensure that you document the metrics consistently and are able to thoroughly support any add backs.

Be sure to consider how your business might evolve and how that might affect your key metrics.

For at least a few years following the IPO, you want your key metric disclosure to be as consistent as possible with your IPO disclosures.

In addition, consider any non-IFRS financial metrics or APMs early  and how the FCA may view these during your IPO review process.

4. Marketing activities Investor marketing begins very early in the UK IPO process  with early-look meetings which can follow soon after the formal IPO kickoff  and requires the company to have a finessed and verifiable equity story to present to investors at that stage.

That typically would be followed by pilot-fishing meetings later in the process and potentially deeper dive or gold card meetings where an advanced draft of the disclosure document may be made available on a confidential basis to certain key accounts before the formal announcement of the IPO.

In addition, in some IPO processes, companies give a limited number of investors additional access to management and due diligence material in an attempt to secure one or more cornerstone investors who typically agree to purchase a substantial and disclosed portion of the companys shares at the time of the IPOs launch.

These activities take up a lot of management time and focus, so it is important to plan and agree upfront on sensible timings and deliverables with your investment banks to minimise the strain on the management team.

5.

Pre-IPO research On UK IPOs, research is prepared and distributed by analysts employed by the underwriting banks, with the analysts then using their research to discuss the company with potential investors ahead of setting the price range and commencement of the roadshow (the pre-deal investor education process).

This is an important part of the IPO process, and it will be a key area of focus for lawyers and bankers, given the regulatory requirements and potential legal and practical problems associated with distribution of research reports in the lead up to an IPO.

The pre-IPO research process  including preparing the presentation to be delivered to the syndicate analysts, presenting to analysts, dealing with follow-up questions, reviewing the research reports for factual accuracy and now dealing with unconnected analysts to the extent they want to have access to management  can take up a lot of management time and focus during the IPO process.

Rules that came into effect in the UK in 2018 impose additional regulatory requirements, including obligations to give access to third-party unconnected analysts to allow them to produce research on your company."
Cooley,Top 10 Considerations for Management in a UK IPO,"There is pressure on the FCA to reform these rules, which generally are acknowledged not to have achieved their aims while also putting the UK equity markets at a disadvantage.

6. Board, committee requirements and management team Reassess the composition of your board of directors (executive and non-executive) and board committees to identify any changes necessary to ensure an appropriate board of directors for a listed company.

Beyond the legal requirements, seek out directors with diverse backgrounds and skills who can help you build a listed company and contribute in a meaningful way to the companys culture, as well as support and challenge the management team.

We believe strongly that diversity  including gender, racial, sexual orientation and neurodiversity  creates a stronger board and a healthier company.

It also is important to understand the requirements for independent directors that will apply after your IPO.

For IPOs on the premium segment of the main market, the corporate governance regime is currently to comply or explain with the UK Corporate Governance Code, which allows for a degree of noncompliance at IPO, although investors will expect to see a path to full compliance for premium listings in most cases.

Recruiting capable directors and ensuring they are sufficiently onboarded ahead of an IPO can take time, so start early.

Similarly, determine whether you need to build out your senior management team to operate as a listed company (common areas of focus include financial reporting and investor relations).

Run background checks on new significant hires to avoid surprises during the IPO process.

Consider whether newer members of the team, particular executives who will be interfacing with public investors, have been with the company long enough to truly understand business trends and convey the companys story  and deliver financial results to investors.

7. Corporate governance Begin to act like a listed company.

Focus on corporate governance appropriate for a listed company and develop a culture of compliance.

Transitioning a workforce from a private company to a heavily regulated listed company takes time and effort, and the example should be set at the top.

Work with your lawyers to adopt state-of-the-art corporate policies and codes of conduct that comply with the rules and best practice, but also work for your organisation.

Consider strategies to ease the transition, such as mock investor presentations on financial results, closing the relevant reporting on listed company timelines and/or establishing board committees akin to a listed company.

If you share key financial or operating data broadly within the company, consider a strategy to begin to limit this disclosure, so that post-IPO you are limiting the number of people who will need to be included on insider lists.

Taking the time during the IPO process to train management and employees on the important aspects of corporate governance and ongoing obligations  from insider dealing to external communications  will make the transition to a listed company much easier following the IPO.

8.

Financial position and prospects procedures Discuss with your advisers any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in your internal financial controls  and understand their impact on your IPO process.

Be prepared to discuss these forthrightly with your investment bankers and their lawyers, as well as to disclose them publicly.

Even if there have been resource constraints or other problems in the past, investors want to see that you have a plan of remediation and a path to strengthening your financial controls in the future.

Consideration of financial position and prospects procedures (FPPP) is critical in determining your companys suitability for listing."
Cooley,Top 10 Considerations for Management in a UK IPO,"Consideration of financial position and prospects procedures (FPPP) is critical in determining your companys suitability for listing.

You will need to have established systems, controls and procedures to enable you to achieve this, and your reporting accountants will need to prepare a private report on the companys FPPP as part of the IPO process.

9.

Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance The exposure to liability is significantly greater for director and officers of listed companies than it is for private companies, and a private company D&O insurance policy will not be appropriate once your company is listed.

There has been increasing growth in securities claims in the UK in the past few years, with a number of high-profile cases being pursued.

Choose an experienced D&O insurance broker and coordinate with the broker early in the process to ensure that your officers and directors are adequately protected.

We also see companies take out public offering of securities (POSI) insurance or policies for the company and its directors, alongside traditional D&O policies, which provide ring-fenced coverage for liabilities relating to the IPO.

10.

Executive remuneration Consider engaging a remuneration consultant to assist in analysing remuneration practices, including equity and non-equity incentives, comparison to peer companies and potential reactions from investors and shareholder activists and compliance with guidelines issued by institutional investor bodies.

Begin to develop a remuneration structure appropriate for a listed company.

Talk to your lawyers about adopting employee share schemes and long-term incentive plans that will meet the future needs of the business and investor expectations, as doing so after an IPO can be decidedly more difficult and may require shareholder approval.

Focus also on personal financial planning for executives: Senior management should consult with personal financial advisers regarding wealth maximisation alternatives."
Cooley,Public Companies Update–August One-Minute Reads,"SEC sets compliance dates for cybersecurity disclosure rules Our July One-Minute Reads discussed the new cybersecurity disclosure rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, with compliance dates tied to the publication of the final rules in the Federal Register.

On August 4, 2023, the final rules were published in the Federal Register with the finalized compliance dates included in the published release .

The final rules will become effective on September 5, 2023, with the following compliance dates for the different requirements: Companies other than smaller reporting companies will be required to begin complying with the incident disclosure requirements in new Item 1.05 of Form 8-K on December 18, 2023 (and for foreign private issuers, on Form 6-K as one of the disclosable events if disclosed or publicized in a foreign jurisdiction, to any stock exchange or to security holders).

Smaller reporting companies will have an additional 180 days and will be required to begin complying with Item 1.05 on June 15, 2024.

All companies will be required to comply with the annual disclosure requirements in new Item 106 of Regulation S-K and new Item 16K of Form 20-F beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023  therefore, for companies with calendar year fiscal years, the first annual report requiring compliance with Item 106 or Item 16K will be the 2023 Form 10-K or Form 20-F filed in 2024, as applicable.

With respect to compliance with the Inline XBRL requirements, companies generally will have an additional year after the initial compliance date for the related disclosure requirement.

Therefore, for Item 1.05 of Form 8-K (and incidents reported on Form 6-K), all companies must begin tagging the required disclosures in Inline XBRL beginning on December 18, 2024, while compliance with the tagging requirements for Item 106 of Regulation S-K and Item 16K of Form 20-F will begin with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2024.

SEC chair speaks on artificial intelligence On July 17, 2023, SEC Chair Gary Gensler spoke before the National Press Club on generative artificial intelligence (AI) , stating that he believes AI is the most transformative technology of our time, on par with the internet and mass production of automobiles.

Gensler then discussed the advances in math, data and computational power  and how they underlie the recent growth in generative AI  before turning to the opportunities and challenges AI poses.

Gensler first described, on a micro level, AIs ability to communicate on an individual basis and asserted that this could pose challenges  such as biases, conflicts of interest and deception  after which he described two specific macro, systemwide challenges he believes AI could eventually pose.

He explained that if one or a small number of tech platforms ultimately come to dominate the field of generative AI, the SEC may focus on: Privacy, intellectual property and rent extractions: In focusing on who owns the collective data that is helping train the parameters of AI models, Gensler noted that [f]or the SEC, the challenge here is to promote competitive, efficient markets in the face of what could be dominant base layers at the center of the capital markets.

I believe we closely have to assess this so that we can continue to promote competition, transparency, and fair access to markets."
Cooley,Public Companies Update–August One-Minute Reads,"I believe we closely have to assess this so that we can continue to promote competition, transparency, and fair access to markets.

Financial stability: In focusing on the need to update current models of risk management guidance due to [t]he possibility of one or even a small number of AI platforms dominating, rais[ing] issues with regard to financial stability, Gensler noted that AI may heighten financial fragility as it could promote herding with individual actors making similar decisions because they are getting the same signal from a base model or data aggregator, potentially exacerbat[ing] the inherent network interconnectedness of the global financial system.

In his concluding remarks, Gensler noted that [s]ecurities laws  may be implicated depending upon how AI technology is used, and that within the SECs current authorities, it is focused on protecting against both the micro and macro challenges that [have been] discussed.

Whether  and within what time frame  any securities law changes for AI will be proposed remains to be seen, though the speech indicates this is now an area the SEC is looking into.

Delaware implements DGCL amendments As discussed in our May One-Minute Reads , certain amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) were proposed for ratification by the Delaware House of Representatives.

The amendments have now been ratified and signed into law by Delawares governor, with the amendments taking effect on August 1, 2023.

Most notably for public companies, the amendments revise Section 242 of the DGCL to (i) eliminate the need to obtain the default vote of stockholders for charter amendments effecting specified types of forward stock splits and associated increases in the authorized number of shares, and (ii) reduce the minimum stockholder vote required to authorize a charter amendment increasing or decreasing the authorized shares of a class, or effecting a reverse split of the shares of a class, in circumstances where the shares of such class are listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the amendment becomes effective and meet the listing requirements of such exchange after the amendment becomes effective.

(For more information, refer to this memo from Richards, Layton & Finger ).

Because these amendments lower the required vote threshold for the specified charter amendments from the current threshold, the amendments are particularly helpful for companies with large retail shareholder bases that have faced difficulty securing various required stockholder votes.

Among other changes, the amendments also: Confirm that a corporation is not required to receive the statutory minimum consideration (typically the par value) for a disposition of treasury shares.

Simplify the requirements for the filing of certificates of validation in connection with the ratification of certain defective corporate acts.

Provide greater certainty regarding the stockholders who must be given a notice of a nonunanimous action by consent of stockholders.

Reduce the vote required to consummate a domestication, transfer or continuance of a Delaware corporation to a non-US entity.

Revise the provisions governing statutory appraisal rights, including to add such rights in connection with a transfer, continuance or domestication of a Delaware corporation to a non-US entity.

Provide that no vote of stockholders is required to authorize a sale, lease, or exchange of collateral securing a mortgage or pledge under specified circumstances.

IRS releases guidance on stock buyback tax On July 11, 2023, our Cooley tax team published an alert discussing recent IRS transitional guidance on the 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock of publicly traded US corporations that was introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act."
Cooley,Public Companies Update–August One-Minute Reads,"Importantly, while the tax applies to repurchases occurring in taxable years after December 31, 2022, the guidance states that taxes owed will not be reportable or payable until after the Treasury Department and the IRS issue forthcoming regulations.

Per the guidance, the regulations are expected to provide that (i) the stock repurchase excise tax will be reported once per taxable year on the Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, that is due for the first full quarter after the close of the taxpayers taxable year, (ii) the deadline for payment of the stock repurchase excise tax will be the same as the filing deadline, and (iii) no extensions will be permitted for reporting or paying the stock repurchase excise tax.

The regulations also are expected to require companies to keep complete and detailed records to establish the amount of stock repurchases, which companies already should be doing.

Nasdaq proposes listing rule regarding reverse stock splits On July 28, 2023, Nasdaq filed a proposed rule change with the SEC to establish listing standards related to notification and disclosure of reverse stock splits.

Nasdaq noted in the filing an increase in reverse stock split activity over the past few years and stated that it believes the proposed listing rules would enhance the ability for market participants to process these events.

Under current listing rules, a reverse stock split qualifies as a Substitution Listing Event, which requires notification to Nasdaq no later than 15 calendar days prior to implementation of the event.

The proposed rules would delete a reference to a reverse stock split as a Substitution Listing Event and instead require a company conducting a reverse split to notify Nasdaq about specific details of the reverse split by submitting a complete Company Event Notification Form at least five business days prior to the anticipated market effective date.

In addition, under the current rules, companies disclose reverse stock splits under the requirement to make prompt disclosure of material information that could reasonably be expected to affect the value of its securities or influence investors decisions, but there is no express requirement for public disclosure specific to reverse splits.

The proposed rules also would require public disclosure about the reverse stock split in a Regulation FD-compliant manner at least two business days prior to the anticipated market effective date.

Additional provisions also would require timely notice to Nasdaqs MarketWatch department.

FASB proposes more disclosure on expenses On July 31, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced the publication of a proposed Accounting Standards Update (ASU) aimed at providing investors with more information regarding a public companys expenses.

Per the press release, the proposed ASU would require public companies to provide detailed disclosure of specified categories underlying certain expense captions in interim and annual periods.

It would provide investors with more detailed information about the types of expenses, including employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and costs incurred related to inventory and manufacturing activities in income statement expense captions such as cost of sales; selling, general and administrative; and research and development.

Comments on the proposal are due by October 30, 2023.

For more information on the proposed ASU, together with a discussion of the recent tentative decision by the FASB to move forward with new requirements for enhanced disclosure about segment expenses and other segment items, refer to our August 3 Cooley PubCo blog post ."
Cooley,Public Companies Update–August One-Minute Reads,"EU adopts mandatory sustainability reporting standards Previous Cooley client alerts have discussed the European Unions adoption of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires EU and non-EU companies with activities in the EU to file annual sustainability reports alongside their financial statements.

As explained in our August 11 client alert , the European Commission adopted the first set of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which dictate how EU sustainability reports required by the CSRD should be prepared.

The alert notes that the ESRS soon will become law and will apply directly in all 27 EU member states, but not in the UK, and that companies will need to report in compliance with these detailed new ESRS as early as the 2024 reporting period.

In addition to urging companies within the scope of the CSRD to begin preparing for these reporting requirements, the alert also summarizes the ESRS and highlights the key elements covered businesses should consider as they get ready to report in accordance with these standards."
Cooley,"Illinois Pay Transparency Requirements Take Effect January 1, 2025","On August 13, 2023, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an amendment to the Illinois Equal Pay Act, which will require certain Illinois employers to include the pay scale and benefits information for a position in any job posting beginning January 1, 2025.

Illinois joins a growing crowd of jurisdictions that require employers to disclose pay in job postings, including California , Colorado , Hawaii (effective January 1, 2024), New York (effective September 17, 2023), New York City and Washington , along with several other localities.

In addition, at the federal level, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the Salary Transparency Act earlier this year in Congress, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to require employers to disclose wage ranges in job postings.

The Illinois pay disclosure law also adds to a recent surge of new compliance obligations for Illinois employers related to pay equity issues.

In 2021, for example, the state again amended the Illinois Equal Pay Acts equal pay reporting and compliance requirements, only a few months after the requirements were previously amended.

See this December 2021 Cooley client alert for more information on the Illinois Equal Pay Act reporting and certification obligations.

This alert summarizes the main requirements and highlights key considerations under the Illinois pay disclosure law.

Pay and benefits disclosure requirements Employers in Illinois with 15 or more employees must include the pay scale and benefits for a position in any specific job posting beginning January 1, 2025.

This means providing the following information for the position in the job posting: The wage or salary, or the wage or salary range.

A general description of the benefits and other compensation the employer expects in good faith to offer for the position  including bonuses, stock options or other incentives.

The pay scale and benefits information should be set by reference to any applicable pay scale, the previously determined range for the position, the actual range of others currently holding equivalent positions or the budgeted amount for the position, as applicable.

To satisfy this disclosure requirement, the job posting also can include a hyperlink to a publicly viewable webpage that includes the required pay scale and benefits information.

Employers also must make promotion opportunities known to current employees no later than 14 calendar days after they post the position externally.

If a public or internal posting for the job, promotion, transfer or other employment opportunity has not been made available to an applicant, the employer must disclose to the job applicant the pay scale and benefits offered for the position prior to any offer or discussion of compensation and at the applicants request.

Notably, the law does not require employers to make a job posting and does not prohibit employers from asking applicants about wage or salary expectations.

Covered positions Like many other pay transparency laws, the disclosure requirements apply to both in-state and remote or hybrid positions.

Specifically, positions that will be physically performed, at least in part, in Illinois and positions that will be performed outside of Illinois, but will report to a supervisor, office or other worksite in Illinois, are subject to the disclosure requirements.

Using a third party to publish job postings If an employer uses a third party to post a job, the employer must provide the pay scale and benefits information (or the hyperlink) to the third party, and the third party must include this information in the job posting.

In this case, the third party is liable for failing to include the required information in the job posting, unless it can show that the employer did not provide the necessary information.

Recordkeeping An employer must make and keep records of the pay scale and benefits for each position, as well as the job posting for each position."
Cooley,"Illinois Pay Transparency Requirements Take Effect January 1, 2025","Recordkeeping An employer must make and keep records of the pay scale and benefits for each position, as well as the job posting for each position.

These records must be kept for at least five years.

Protection against retaliation An employer cannot refuse to interview, hire, promote, employ or otherwise retaliate against an applicant or employee for exercising any rights under the law.

Penalties The Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) is empowered to investigate in response to any complaints about violations or at its own discretion.

If it determines that an employer has violated the pay and benefits disclosure requirements, it will issue a notice of violation, setting forth the applicable penalty and the applicable period to cure the violation.

The penalty and cure period depend on the number of previous violations, whether the job posting in violation is active or inactive, and the discretion of the IDOL.

For active job postings at the time the IDOL issues a notice of violation, penalties are as follows: For a first offense, following a cure period of 14 days to remedy the violation, a fine of up to $500.

For a second offense, following a cure period of seven days, a fine of up to $2,500.

For a third or subsequent offense, no cure period and a fine of up to $10,000.

For inactive job postings at the time IDOL issues a notice of violation, penalties are as follows: For a first offense, a fine of up to $250.

For a second offense, a fine of up to $2,500.

For a third or subsequent offense, a fine of up to $10,000.

Next steps While the Illinois pay transparency law is not effective until January 1, 2025, understanding its requirements is only one step in preparing your business for pay equity-related issues.

Illinois employers should prepare to determine and disclose pay scale and benefits information well in advance of 2025.

Employers with multistate operations should pay attention to this evolving landscape, as more jurisdictions are expected to pass similar laws.

In addition, making pay information available makes it easier to identify pay disparities that may be based on certain demographic characteristics.

Employers should consider getting in front of potential issues by conducting an audit of their workforce to identify and address unjustified pay disparities.

Businesses undertaking a pay equity audit should closely protect the confidentiality of these audits, including by retaining outside counsel.

If you have any questions about pay disclosure requirements or pay equity issues, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,"District Court Confirms ‘Human Authorship’ Requirement, Sets Copyright Boundary for AI-Generated Works","On August 18, 2023, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a first-of-its-kind federal court decision in Thaler v. Perlmutter, et al. , agreeing with the US Copyright Office that works generated entirely by artificial intelligence are not copyrightable for lack of human authorship.

The court rejected the plaintiffs argument that copyrights adaptability to new technologies is expansive enough to contemplate AI authorship.

Judge Howell reasoned that although copyright is designed to adapt with the times and contemplates new and unforeseen mediums of expression, the requirement of human authorship  and, more specifically, human creativity  is the immutable  sine qua non at the core of copyrightability.""

The decision arises from a copyright application filed by inventor Stephen Thaler in 2019 for a visual artwork titled  A Recent Entrance to Paradise .

Rather than listing himself as author of the work, Thaler identified that author as Creativity Machine  an AI computer system he had invented.

He based his claim of ownership on the work-for-hire doctrine, on the theory that he owned the Creativity Machine, so it was akin to an employee who creates works in the course and scope of their employment.

The Copyright Office denied Thalers application, reasoning that copyright extends only to works created by human authors, not those  as Thaler claimed  that were created autonomously by an AI computer algorithm.

Thaler challenged this determination in court, both sides sought summary judgment, and the district court sided with the Copyright Office.

Judge Howell acknowledged that copyright law is malleable enough to cover works created with or involving technologies developed long after traditional media, such as engravings and photography.

However, the court agreed with the Copyright Office that the core of copyrightability is human creativity.

Even modern high-tech art mediums require human involvement in, and ultimate creative control over the creation of the work to be protectable.

The court explained that this human authorship requirement is grounded both in the language of the Copyright Act  which does not explicitly define author, but uses uniquely human concepts and terms  and in many decisions interpreting it, beginning with the US Supreme Courts 1884 decision in Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 US 53 (holding that a photograph of Oscar Wilde was copyrightable despite use of a camera to give visible expression to ideas in the mind of the author), and continuing through the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuits 2018 decision in Naruto v. Slater , 888 F.3d 418, 420 (2018), which held that a photograph taken by a monkey was not protected by copyright insofar as all animals, since they are not human, lack standing under the Copyright Act.

In his summary judgment papers, Thaler raised new arguments that he should be considered the rightful human author, insofar as he provided instructions and directed his AI to create the [w]ork, and his AI is entirely controlled by [him].

These arguments, however, contradicted Thalers copyright application and were not properly made before the court.

Likewise, the court found that, because the work did not give rise to a valid copyright upon its creation, Thalers arguments as to how the copyright may have later passed to him were irrelevant.

The court concluded by acknowledging that we are approaching new frontiers in copyright and that many open questions remain, including: [H]ow much human input is necessary to qualify the user of an AI system as an author of a generated work.

[T]he scope of the protection obtained over the resultant image.

[H]ow to assess the originality of AI-generated works where the systems may have been trained on unknown pre-existing works.

[H]ow copyright might best be used to incentivize creative works involving AI, and more."
Cooley,"District Court Confirms ‘Human Authorship’ Requirement, Sets Copyright Boundary for AI-Generated Works","[H]ow copyright might best be used to incentivize creative works involving AI, and more.

Other courts may take up these issues as new authors seek protection for works generated in whole or in part by generative AI.

For now, the Thaler case merely serves to uphold the Copyright Offices narrow determination that a work generated exclusively and autonomously by a generative AI tool is not protectable under the Copyright Act."
Cooley,CFPB Announces Plans to Extend FCRA to Data Brokers Through Rulemaking,"At an August 15, 2023, White House roundtable, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

Director Rohit Chopra announced plans to issue rules that would extend the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to certain data broker practices.

This announcement and a concurrently issued fact sheet come on the heels of a March 2023 CFPB inquiry in which the bureau made clear it was reviewing and assessing data broker practices to inform a future rulemaking under FCRA.

Less than six months later, the CFPB appears poised to publish an outline of proposals and alternatives under consideration in September.

Chopra also suggested that the bureau will publish the actual proposed rule, under FCRA, for public comment sometime in 2024.

Expansion of FCRA through proposed rulemaking Chopras announcement, and the related fact sheet, reflect that the proposed rules under consideration by the bureau would expand FCRAs reach in at least two ways.

First, the proposed rules would define data brokers that sell certain types of consumer information as consumer reporting agencies under FCRA.

According to the bureau, this would mean that covered data brokers would be required to comply with certain accuracy and dispute handling requirements.

Second, the proposed rules would clarify the extent to which credit header data  meaning identifying information such as name, date of birth and Social Security number  constitutes a consumer report under FCRA.

According to the bureau, the clarification is intended to protect against disclosure of credit header information for, among other things, targeted advertising, to train artificial intelligence or to sharpen chatbots.

Role of AI A key driver of the CFPBs FCRA rulemaking proposals appears to be concerns over artificial intelligence and other predictive decision-making tools.

According to the bureau, the rules under consideration would bring much-needed accountability to data brokers who, purportedly, power artificial intelligence and other automated decisioning about consumers lives.

Consequently, the CFPB stresses that the proposed rulemaking is part of an all-of-government effort to address the risks related to use of AI.

This is unsurprising in light of an April 2023 joint statement by federal agencies warning entities that existing laws apply to new technologies , such as artificial intelligence, and the many publications addressing risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence that have been issued by the CFPB over the past year.

The proposal also coincides with efforts, at the state and local level, to enhance privacy laws to more closely regulate automated decision-making.

For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act directs the California Privacy Protection Agency to adopt regulations governing access and opt-out rights with respect to businesses use of automated decision-making technology, including profiling and requiring businesses response to access requests to include meaningful information about the logic involved in those decision making processes, as well as a description of the likely outcome of the process with respect to the consumer.

New York Citys  automated employment decision tools  rule regulates the use of AI tools in hiring, including requiring employers to notify candidates about the use of AI, allowing candidates to be informed of the data used to train the AI, and an annual audit of the tools to evaluate them for bias.

Privacy laws in Colorado , Virginia and Connecticut further provide consumers with the right to opt out of certain profiling with respect to automated decisions.

What to expect As noted above, the bureau plans to move quickly with respect to its proposed FCRA rulemaking."
Cooley,CFPB Announces Plans to Extend FCRA to Data Brokers Through Rulemaking,"What to expect As noted above, the bureau plans to move quickly with respect to its proposed FCRA rulemaking.

Entities involved in the sale of data  including, but not limited to, consumer payment history, income and criminal records data, as well as credit header data  should therefore monitor announcements by the bureau, and engage with legal and compliance partners to evaluate, in real time, if and how the impending rules may impact their compliance responsibilities.

This goes for data brokers across industries.

During the White House roundtable, Chopra explained that any updated rules under the [FCRA] can be enforced by the CFPB and state law enforcement across sectors of the economy, as well as by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture, and other agencies  for specific sectors under their jurisdiction.

Accordingly, we expect the CFPB to continue to coordinate with federal and state agencies to ensure that a comprehensive cross-sector approach to addressing data broker practices is ultimately implemented."
Cooley,US and EU Poised for Closer Ties in Tech Financial Market,"Editor's note: Authored by Yulia Makarova, this article was originally published in Law360 .

In an increasingly globalized world, national and international regulatory authorities have repeatedly signaled that working together to develop effective policies for regulating and supervising financial markets is a key priority.

In 2018, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , or CFPB, announced an initiative to create the Global Financial Innovation Network to provide a more efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, helping them navigate between countries.

Across the pond, the European Union has played a key role in cultivating international cooperation on financial regulation.

With U.S. and EU regulators facing shared challenges with respect to fast-developing technology, a dialogue between the CFPB and the European Commission is a logical step aimed at cultivating international regulatory cooperation.

This will be done via its directorate-general for justice and consumers, the body that develops and monitors the implementation of policies to ensure that the EU is an area of freedom and security without internal borders.

Protecting Consumers The statement published on July 17 by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra and European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders announced the beginning of an annual  at least  informal dialogue, focusing on strengthening consumer financial protection.[1]

The dialogue seeks to facilitate better policy coordination and exchange of insights and experience on a range of financial consumer protection issues.

In the statement, both regulators aim to address perceived key challenges created by the increasing digitalization of financial products, ""from pricing and customer service to competition and privacy.""

The agencies cited, for example, the increasing use of automated decision making and artificial intelligence, new products such as buy-now-pay-later, and the role of Big Tech in digital payments.

The statement highlights that while policymakers are responding to these issues, the regulatory and enforcement agencies believe that more must be done in order ""to compete with the pace of evolving markets and consumer needs.""

AI in Focus The use of AI is fast becoming one of the key issues that the regulators must grapple with.

This is demonstrated by Chopra's comments in May when he stated that the CFPB has been intensifying its AI enforcement efforts.[2]

In its June 2023 spotlight analysis on AI chatbots in banking,[3] the CFBP also highlighted instances where chatbots were noncompliant with federal consumer financial protection laws that diminished customer service and trust and could cause harm to consumers.

In the EU, the commission intends to find a proportional and fair way to regulate AI.

In April 2021, the commission proposed the first EU regulatory framework for AI, also known as the AI Act.[4] The European Parliament has stated that its priority is to make sure that AI systems used in the EU are safe, transparent, traceable, nondiscriminatory and environmentally friendly.

The aim is to reach an agreement by the end of 2023.

Once approved, this regulatory framework is expected to become the world's first rules on AI.

Big Tech In the statement, the CFPB and the commission listed several issues of concern, including data privacy and security, unfair competition and financial stability, in committing to further dialogue focused on potential risks in Big Tech.

This too ties to the concerns cited repeatedly by the CFPB, including its announcement of an inquiry into data brokers in March.[5]

In this inquiry, the CFPB sought information about business practices employed in the market to inform the CFPB's efforts to administer the law, including planned rulemaking under the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act."
Cooley,US and EU Poised for Closer Ties in Tech Financial Market,"The CFPB investigated the business models and practices of the data broker market, including details about the types of data the brokers collect and sell and the sources they rely upon.

In the EU, the Digital Markets Act[6] that became effective, for the most part, on May 2, intends to ensure a higher degree of competition in European digital markets by preventing large companies from abusing their market power and by allowing access for new players.

It has established a list of obligations for designated gatekeepers, mainly large digital platforms providing core platform services, such as online search engines, app stores and messenger services.

The Digital Markets Act is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

New Forms of Credit Securing a consistently high level of protection for consumers taking out credit and contributing to consumer confidence has long been a key priority for the regulators.

In the statement, the CFPB cites concerns about the over-consumption of new forms of credit and over-indebtedness of consumers.

The CFPB has repeatedly flagged concerns in connection with consumer credit products, including in its March consumer use survey.[7]

The survey concluded that while many buy-now-pay-later borrowers used the product without any noticeable indications of financial stress, buy-now-pay-later borrowers were, on average, much more likely to be highly indebted, revolve on their credit cards, have delinquencies in traditional credit products and use high-interest financial services such as payday, pawn, and overdraft compared to non-buy-now-pay-later borrowers.

They are more likely to also have traditional credit products like credit and retail cards, personal loans, and student loans, but have lower liquidity and savings compared to non-buy-now-pay-later borrowers.

In 2021, the commission adopted a legislative proposal[8] to revise the existing EU consumer credit directive[9] to cover buy-now-pay-later products to ensure increased transparency and better consumer protection resulting in higher consumer confidence.

The general goals of this review are to reduce the detriment to consumers taking out loans in a changing market and to facilitate cross-border provision of consumer credit and the competitiveness of the internal market.

Fair Lending

The CFPB has long focused on the themes of fair lending and equal access.

In its 2022 Fair Lending Report to Congress, the CFPB indicated that as a result of its annual risk-based prioritization process, it focused much of its 2022 fair lending supervision efforts on mortgage origination and pricing, small business lending, policies and procedures regarding geographic and other exclusions in underwriting, and on the use of automated systems and models, such as AI and machine learning models.[10] The statement aligns with the continued focus on more regulatory oversight in the EU.

This is evidenced by the commission's proposed reform of the current EU rules on distance marketing of consumer financial services published in 2022,[11] which aims to bring EU regulation in line with the digitalized financial sector by strengthening consumer rights and fostering the cross-border provision of financial services in the single market.

What's Next?

As technology continues to evolve and with a tidal wave of new regulation on the horizon for the EU, the regulators are focused on coordinating efforts to tackle perceived consumer protection issues in the ever-changing regulatory landscape.

The regulators have committed to keeping an ongoing dialogue on the key areas of concern involving subject-matter experts and market participants.

As technological advancement outpaces the development of regulation, we should expect more activity in international regulatory cooperation beyond the issues flagged in the statement as the regulators across the globe seek to keep abreast of change."

Cooley,Baby Steps as FDA Issues First Draft Guidance Under MoCRA,"On August 7, 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released its first draft guidance on the new regulatory requirements under the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA).

As we explained in a January 2023 client alert , MoCRA overhauls the regulatory framework for cosmetics in the United States, placing new obligations on manufacturers and granting the FDA additional authority over cosmetics.

The FDAs first guidance document related to the new MoCRA requirements, Draft Guidance for Industry: Registration and Listing of Cosmetic Product Facilities and Products , outlines the key components of these requirements: who must register, what information is required, when registration must be submitted, and how the FDA intends to accept registration and listing information.

Who must register?

Pursuant to Section 607(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), every person who owns or operates a facility engaged in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product  a defined term under MoCRA that means a preparation of cosmetic ingredients with a qualitatively and quantitatively set composition for use in a finished product  for distribution in the United States must register the facility, with two exceptions: Small businesses, defined as responsible persons, owners, and operators of facilities with average gross annual sales of less than $1 million across the previous three-year period, are exempt from the registration and listing requirements unless they engage in manufacturing or processing of cosmetics that regularly come into contact with the mucus membrane of the eye, are injected, are intended for internal use, or are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 hours.

Facilities subject to the requirements for drugs and devices are also exempt from registering separately as a cosmetic facility, unless they manufacture or process cosmetics that are not subject to drug and device requirements under the FDCA.

What information is required?

The registration requirements for facilities are specified under Section 607(a) and 607(b)(2) of the FDCA, and product listing requirements are specified under Section 607(c).

Notably, registration as a cosmetics facility requires submission of the facility registration number, if one was assigned.

The FDAs guidance indicates that to facilitate registration, owners or operators of a cosmetic facility should obtain an FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI) number prior to submitting the cosmetic facility registration.

When must registration be submitted?

Facilities that were engaged in manufacturing or processing of cosmetic products on December 29, 2022, must register no later than December 29, 2023.

Facilities that first engaged in manufacturing or processing of cosmetics after December 29, 2022, must register within 60 days of first engaging in the activity or by February 27, 2024, whichever is later.

Any amendments, including cancellations, of registrations must be submitted within 60 days of the change.

How will registration and listing information be submitted?

The FDA intends to make a new electronic submission portal available in October 2023 and also is developing a paper submission form.

The FDA has specified that the new electronic submission portal is intended to be efficient for subsequent submissions, as information from prior submissions can be reused without needing to be reentered.

Additionally, because the cosmetic registration and product listing will use the same process as drug registration and listing, the FDA anticipates this will streamline the process for facilities that manufacture both drug products and cosmetics.

Because the registration requirements under MoCRA differ from those of the FDAs prior voluntary cosmetics registration program, manufacturers that have previously registered under the voluntary program should be aware that the FDA does not consider prior voluntary registration to fulfill the MoCRA requirements."
Cooley,Baby Steps as FDA Issues First Draft Guidance Under MoCRA,"Moreover, any information provided to the FDA under the voluntary program will not be transferred into the new system.

Manufacturers previously registered under the voluntary program should be prepared to submit all the information required under MoCRA through the new electronic portal.

Future FDA guidance anticipated As many provisions of MoCRA are set to take effect at the end of 2023, there are still several areas where we anticipate future guidance from the FDA, such as establishing good manufacturing practices (GMPs) consistent with national and international standards, as well as a system for adverse event reporting for cosmetics.

In addition, we hope to gain some insight into how the FDA intends to approach inspections and enforce these new regulatory requirements, particularly given the agencys plans to restructure its Office of Regulatory Affairs.

Cooley senior regulatory analyst Kelly Marco and law clerk Madelon Bird also contributed to this alert."
Cooley,Employees Have the POWR (Act): Colorado Enacts New Protections for Employees,"In June 2023, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed into law the Protecting Opportunities and Workers Rights (POWR) Act , which, among other things, substantially limits the use of nondisclosure agreements, lowers the burden of proof for workplace harassment claims and imposes new record-keeping requirements on employers with employees working in Colorado.

We outline the key provisions of the act  which took effect on August 7, 2023  below.

Limitations on nondisclosure agreements The POWR Act declares that it is the states public policy to encourage free reporting, discussion, and exposure of discriminatory or unfair employment practices to better protect employees.

Therefore, the POWR Act makes clear that attempts to interfere with employees ability to communicate about and report alleged discriminatory or unfair employment practices are contrary to the public policy of the state.

In alignment with these objectives, the POWR Act substantially limits an employers ability to use nondisclosure agreements entered into or renewed on or after August 7, 2023.

Under the act, such provisions that limit an employees or prospective employees ability to disclose or discuss any alleged discriminatory or unfair employment practices are now void, unless the agreement satisfies all of the following requirements: The provision applies equally to the employer and employee.

The provision expressly states that it does not restrain the employee or prospective employee from disclosing the underlying facts of any alleged discriminatory or unfair practices to certain individuals  including immediate family members, local, state, or federal government agencies, or in response to a legal process (e.g., a subpoena).

The provision expressly states that disclosure of the underlying facts of any allegation does not constitute disparagement.

The agreement includes a condition that if a nondisparagement provision is included and the employer disparages the employee or prospective employee, the employer cannot seek to enforce the provision or seek damages against the employee.

Any liquidated damages provision in the agreement does not constitute a penalty or punishment  and to be enforceable, it must include an amount that is reasonable and proportionate and not punitive.

The agreement must attach an addendum signed by all parties to the agreement, attesting to compliance with the above requirements.

Notably, any violation of the above requirements carries significant costs and penalties, including liability for actual damages and a penalty of $5,000 per violation.

Further, any employee or prospective employee who is presented with an agreement that fails to comply with the new requirements may immediately bring an action and may recover penalties, actual damages, reasonable costs, attorneys fees and punitive damages.

Lowered standard for workplace harassment Like some other states, such as New York , the POWR Act also rejects the severe or pervasive standard for proof of workplace harassment claims in favor of a lower standard that makes harassment claims easier to prove.

Under this standard, unwelcome conduct that is subjectively offensive to the individual alleging harassment and is objectively offensive to a reasonable individual who is a member of the same protected class is harassment under Colorado law.

While the conduct or communication need not be severe or pervasive to be unlawful, it must still meet one of the following additional requirements to constitute illegal harassment: Submission to the conduct or communication is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of the individuals employment.

Subjection to or objection to the conduct or communication is used as a basis for the employment decision affecting the employee.

The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individuals work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment."
Cooley,Employees Have the POWR (Act): Colorado Enacts New Protections for Employees,"The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individuals work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

Notably, however, even a single incident may rise to the level of harassment, and the act points out that conduct that was previously welcome may become unwelcome between two individuals.

Limitations on affirmative defenses to harassment claims The POWR Act also limits an employers ability to assert affirmative defenses to claims of harassment by supervisors.

To assert such a defense, employers must now establish that they had a program in place designed to prevent harassment and deter future harassers that was communicated to employees, and that the employee bringing such a claim unreasonably failed to take advantage of the program.

As part of this program, employers must take prompt and reasonable action to investigate or address the alleged harassment or unfair employment practice and take remedial actions when warranted.

New record-keeping requirements The POWR Act also requires employers to preserve personnel or employment records for at least five years.

Personnel or employment records broadly include: Requests for accommodation.

Employee complaints.

Application forms submitted by applicants for employment.

Other records related to hiring, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other terms of compensation, selection for training or apprenticeship, and records of training.

In addition, employers also must keep a designated repository of all written and oral complaints of discrimination or unfair employment practices, which must include the date of the complaint, identity of the parties and substance of the complaint.

Marital status as a protected class and modified disability discrimination framework Finally, the POWR Act also adds marital status as a protected category under the states anti-discrimination law and modifies the framework for disability discrimination.

With respect to disability claims, Colorado law now provides that it is not a discriminatory or unfair employment practice to take adverse action against an individual with a disability if there is no reasonable accommodation that the employer can make with regard to the disability that would allow the individual to satisfy the essential functions of the job.

Previously, the law also required that the disability has a significant impact on the job.

By removing this requirement, the states standard now mirrors the federal Americans with Disabilities Act standard.

Next steps Colorado employers should take the following steps in light of the POWR Acts significant new obligations: Review and revise any nondisclosure agreements, including any separation or settlement agreements with such provisions, for compliance with the law.

Review and revise applicable policies to comply with the new standards outlined in the act.

Train relevant human resources (HR) staff and management on any updated policies and standards established by the act.

Review and revise applicable document retention policies with respect to personnel files and other employment records and work with HR to ensure compliance with the new record-keeping requirements.

Reevaluate reasonable accommodation processes in light of the new disability discrimination framework, if applicable.

Cooley,Two Recent Federal Circuit Opinions Illustrate Risk of Product Demonstrations for Patent Validity,"Section 102 of the Patent Act holds that an invention may not be patented if it was in public use before the effective filing date of the patented invention.

1

The public use bar to patenting is triggered if the invention is both in public use and ready for patenting.

2 US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit precedent holds that an invention is in public use if it is accessible to the public or commercially exploited.

3 Put another way, an invention is in public use if it is shown to or used by an individual other than the inventor under no limitation, restriction, or obligation of confidentiality.

4 Courts also look to contextual factors, such as the nature of and public access to activities involving the invention [and] confidentiality obligations imposed upon observers.

5

An invention is ready for patenting when either the subject matter of the claimed invention is in the possession of the inventor and known to work for its intended purpose, which can be shown by the existence of a working prototype, or the inventor has prepared drawings or other descriptions of the invention that are specific enough to enable a skilled artisan to practice the invention.

6 Importantly, depending on the nature of the invention, the mere display of a prototype or sample may not constitute an invalidating public use.

For example, the display of a later-patented new keyboard design was not a public use because the public was only provided with a visual view of the keyboard without any disclosure of the technology that actually sought to be patented, which involved data entry using the keyboard.

7

On the other hand, it is not a requirement that inventors physically handle or operate the invention on display; all that is required is that the inventor use the invention in public such that a skilled observer who is not under any confidentiality obligation can understand the invention.

8

An invention also can be considered ready for patenting even if it is still undergoing testing or improvement.

9

For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an invention is not a prerequisite for considering a therapeutic invention ready for patenting.

10 All that is necessary is that the inventor was in possession and knew the invention to work, or had prepared documentation sufficient to enable a skilled artisan to practice the invention.

Minerva v. Hologic : When is a product demo of a medical device invalidating?

Minerva Surgical, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc. serves as a potent reminder of both the in public use and ready for patenting prongs of the public use bar.

11

In this case, patentee Minerva owned a patent directed to an endometrial ablation device that stops or reduces abnormal uterine bleeding.

More than one year before the effective priority date of the patent, Minerva showcased 15 fully functional devices at a public trade show.

After the trade show, Minerva continued to refine the device, but the devices it showcased were working prototypes of the claimed invention.

The district court granted summary judgment, holding that Minervas patent was invalid for prior public use.

On appeal, Minerva made two arguments on in public use.

Minerva argued that demonstration of the device at the trade show was mere display, and that because the showcased device lacked a key limitation of the patent claim at issue, it had not disclosed the invention.

The court rejected both arguments.

On the first, it found that Minerva showcased the devices over several days at the Super Bowl of the industry, where sophisticated industry members who were under no obligation of confidentiality  were permitted to closely scrutinize the device.  

These events exceeded mere display."
Cooley,Two Recent Federal Circuit Opinions Illustrate Risk of Product Demonstrations for Patent Validity,"These events exceeded mere display.

And, contrary to Minervas position, the court found that evidence of handling of the device was not required; instead, all that was required was disclosure in a way that at least one member of the public, without any obligations of confidentiality, would understand it.

On Minervas second argument, the court found that Minerva documents from before and after the trade show described the device with the key feature, while feedback Minerva received from the trade show further established that the disclosed device likely had that feature.

Minerva also argued that the disclosed device was not ready for patenting, both because it did not yet function for its intended purpose of ablation in live human uteri and because Minerva was continuing to refine it with better materials since the time of the trade show.

Again, the court disagreed, noting that the ready for patenting standard is not as exacting as FDA approval for use in humans, and that fine-tuning of an invention does not preclude that the showcased working prototypes were ready for patenting.

Moreover, Minerva documents  including drawings and detailed descriptions in lab notebooks  were sufficiently specific to enable a skilled artisan to practice the invention.

Patentees and patent challengers should heed the lessons of Minerva for display of patented inventions at conferences and trade shows.

While the court did not draw precise boundaries between activities that rise to public use versus mere display, disclosures that lack obligations of confidentiality and permit skilled artisans to understand the invention may be invalidating.

And, an invention may be ready for patenting even if the patentee continues to fine-tune the invention.

In re Wingen : When is disclosure of ornamental plants invalidating?

The public use bar can be especially consequential in the world of agriculture, which often involves trialing and other potentially public demonstrations of plants and crops, including ornamental flowers.

In the case of In re Wingen , 12 a utility patent reissue application for the Cherry Star variety of petunia was rejected on the basis of public use of the patented variety at a Proven Winners demonstration event at Home Depot more than one year before the filing date of the application.

Although event attendees were not permitted to take cuttings, seeds or plant tissue samples of Cherry Star, and further were not provided with genetics or breeding history information, they also were under no obligation of confidentiality as to what they saw.

There was no dispute that Cherry Star was ready for patenting by the time of the event, thus Wingen was left with only the argument that the Home Depot demonstration did not qualify as an invalidating public use.

Wingen argued that mere display of the plant itself did not put all claimed features of the invention in public use, because aspects that are not observable to the naked eye  such as plant genetics  were not made available to attendees.

Without this information, Wingen argued, a member of the public could not exploit or recreate the Cherry Star variety.

Wingen relied on the only Federal Circuit authority concerning public use of a plant variety, Delano Farms Co. v. Cal.

Table Grape Commn , which held that pre-filing growth of a later-patented grape variety was not public, in part because the grapes were not labeled and thus could not be recognized by the public as the patented variety.

The court disagreed with Wingen, arguing that the cases were distinct, in part because the Cherry Star variety was clearly labeled as such at the Home Depot event, including in an advertisement with the name and photo of the variety.

The court also distinguished Delano Farms on the basis that petunias are purely ornamental, while grapes are not  meaning that in this case, the petunias were put into public use for their ultimate intended purpose, namely ornamental display."
Cooley,Two Recent Federal Circuit Opinions Illustrate Risk of Product Demonstrations for Patent Validity,"Wingen maintained its argument that the public still did not have sufficient access to the invention to be put in possession of it.

Without the undisclosed genetics or breeding history, Wingen argued, the public could not recreate Cherry Star, as attendees were prevented from taking parts of the plants themselves.

The court refused to address this issue, however, because Wingen failed to meaningfully present the argument and thus forfeited the ability to make that argument.

Thus, this nonprecedential Federal Circuit opinion leaves unaddressed the important question of how an ornamental plant developer can participate in demonstration events without risking the ability to later patent the plant, even if they take appropriate steps to prevent demonstration attendees from taking samples of the plant material or learning the necessary genetics or breeding information that would be required to actually exploit or recreate the variety.

Patent applicants and litigants can learn from this decision how to challenge or protect intellectual property based on prior displays of ornamental flowers  and how (and when) to muster relevant evidence to prove those allegations.

Notes The 2011 America Invents Act modified the text of 35 USC  102 to remove the more than one year safe harbor for pre-filing public uses, but it did not otherwise materially change the substantive law with respect to the public use bar to patentability.

Cooley,EU Adopts Long-Awaited Mandatory ESG Reporting Standards,"In January 2023, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires EU and non-EU companies with activities in the EU to file annual sustainability reports alongside their financial statements.

These reports must be prepared in accordance with European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).

On July 31, 2023, the European Commission adopted the first set of ESRS .

The ESRS soon will become law and will apply directly in all 27 EU member states, but not in the UK.

Companies will need to report in compliance with these new ESRS as early as the 2024 reporting period.

The standards are notable for their breadth and granularity, going well beyond the reporting requirements in other mandatory and voluntary ESG reporting frameworks.

It is clear that companies in scope need to start getting ready to report to these new ESRS now.

For further details on the companies covered by the CSRD, see Cooleys related October 2022 client alert .

The ESRS The ESRS set out detailed reporting requirements for EU companies in scope of the CSRD, including EU subsidiaries of non-EU companies.

The ESRS cover:

General reporting principles.

A list of mandatory disclosure requirements for EU companies related to the identification and governance of sustainability matters.

The 10 ESG topics where disclosure is required, subject to a materiality assessment.

While this is the first set of ESRS, further sets of standards also will be adopted in the near future for specific industry sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and non-EU parent companies.

Together, the CSRD and ESRS require companies to: Perform materiality assessments on each sustainability topic applying the double materiality principle to work out which information should be reported.

(In line with double materiality, companies must report if sustainability information is material from either a financial or an impact perspective, taking account of people and the environment.)

Report on the material impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) identified in the companys own operations, those of its group and those of its upstream and downstream value chain .

Provide metrics and targets for material sustainability topics and connect these to their financial reports.

Have their sustainability disclosures audited by an independent third-party auditor before they are filed with the relevant authority.

General requirements ESRS 1 on General Requirements explains the process requirements that apply to all companies reporting under these standards.

For example, it explains what is meant by double materiality and reporting boundaries, as well as the extent to which a company must report on its value chains, due diligence expectations, the required quality of quantitative and qualitative data (including the use of estimates), the need for consistency with the companys financial statement disclosure, and the overall report structure.

General disclosures ESRS 2 on General Disclosures lists all the mandatory disclosures that all in-scope companies must report on, irrespective of materiality.

This standard includes disclosures on how sustainability-related performance is integrated into the companys incentive schemes, statements on its due diligence processes and descriptions of the processes used to identify and assess materiality.

Disclosures on key performance indicators prescribed by the EU Taxonomy Regulation also are required.

Topical ESRS Materiality assessments: For the topical ESRS that cover the 10 ESG topics set out in more detail below, a materiality assessment is the starting point for reporting.

Companies are required to assess and report on material sustainability-related IROs in their value chains under each of the 10 topical standards."
Cooley,EU Adopts Long-Awaited Mandatory ESG Reporting Standards,"Companies are required to assess and report on material sustainability-related IROs in their value chains under each of the 10 topical standards.

If, following the materiality assessment, a given sustainability matter is material from either a financial or impact perspective, the company must disclose against the relevant topical ESRS.

The European Commission has been keen to emphasize that reporting on material sustainability matters is not voluntary.

The conduct of materiality assessments may require significant advanced planning, including gathering information related to value chain impacts.

Companies still will be required to gather sustainability information from their value chains even if, once assessed, they ultimately conclude that the information is not material enough to require reporting.

Where a company has determined that a topical ESRS is not material, it is not required to report information under that standard.

However, unlike the other topical ESRS, if a company judges climate-related disclosures (E1) to be immaterial, the company must provide a detailed justification.

Permitted exclusions are very limited, and where a company relies on an exemption, it must disclose this to be the case.

The table below provides an overview of the content for each adopted topical ESRS.

Environmental E1 Climate change Disclosures on climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation and energy consumption.

Disclosures on climate change mitigation relate to the companys efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C in line with the Paris Agreement.

Disclosures on Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions and transition risks.

E2 Pollution Disclosures on pollution of the air, water, soil, living organisms and food resources, as well as the use of substances of concern and microplastics.

This standard covers pollutants generated or used during production processes and those that leave facilities as emissions, products, or as part of products or services.

E3 Water and marine resources Disclosures on consumption, withdrawal and discharge from and into water (including ground and surface water) and marine resources.

This standard also requires consideration of the extraction and use of marine resources.

E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems Disclosures covering areas such as the drivers of biodiversity loss, impact on species, and impacts and dependencies on ecosystems.

E5 Circular economy Disclosures on resource inflows, outflows, waste, resource optimization and the risks of the transition to a circular economy.

A circular economy is one in which the value of products, materials and other resources in the economy are maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of hazardous substances at all stages of the product life cycle.

Social S1 Own workforce Disclosures on the companys own workforce  including freedom of association, working conditions, access to equal opportunities and other work-related rights.

S2 Workers in the value   chain This standard is similar to ESRS S1 in content but requires consideration of the workers in the companys value chain(s).

S3 Affected communities Disclosures on the impact of a companys own operations and value chain  including its products and services, impact on indigenous rights, civil rights, and social and economic rights, including water and sanitation, among others.

S4 Consumers and end-users Disclosures on the impacts of a companys products and/or services on consumers and end-users  including access to quality information, privacy and the protection of children.

Companies are not required to consider the unlawful use or misuse of products or services."
Cooley,EU Adopts Long-Awaited Mandatory ESG Reporting Standards,"Companies are not required to consider the unlawful use or misuse of products or services.

Governance G1 Business conduct Disclosures on anti-corruption and anti-bribery practices, the protection of whistle blowers, political lobbying and the management of relationships with suppliers (including payment practices).

Sector-specific standards and additional forthcoming standards

The ESRS outlined above do not represent the entirety of potential disclosure obligations under the CSRD.

Sector-specific standards which will apply in addition to the current ESRS are expected to cover sectors such as textiles, information technology, electronics, and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

These standards would create additional disclosure requirements related to topics of particular materiality for specific industries.

Drafts of these standards initially were scheduled for 2023  2024.

Other sets of sustainability standards will be adopted by the EU in the coming years for SMEs and non-EU parent companies.

Further application guidance also can be expected in the coming months.

The European standards body  the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group  is currently developing additional guidance on how companies can perform the double materiality assessment and the extent of value chain information required under the ESRS.

Key elements for businesses Companies in scope of the CSRD should start getting ready for ESRS reporting now, as it may take some time to perform materiality assessments and set up systems to gather the audit-ready data needed for their reports.

Key elements for businesses are outlined below.

Centrality of materiality assessments Companies will need to front-load work in this area to determine the scope of their reporting requirements under each of the topical ESRS.

Outside advisers likely will play a key role in helping companies design relevant processes, which must include an analysis of value chains and double materiality  and likely will differ substantively from companies existing sustainability reporting frameworks or risk management systems.

Process cannot be neglected The ESRS are very detailed on what companies should report on and how they should report.

This means that most companies will need to assess whether their existing sustainability diligence and reporting practices comply with the CSRD, even if they already report on some or all of the areas covered by the topical ESRS.

Similar to US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cybersecurity and climate rules, as well as the widely used Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and CDP climate disclosure frameworks, the ESRS has a significant focus on disclosures related to the governance of sustainability matters.

Companies should be attentive to preparing for the mandatory process and governance disclosures in ESRS 2.

Importance of climate materiality Perhaps the most notable feature of the adopted ESRS is the move away from proposed mandatory reporting on climate change, including the disclosure of scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.

Nonetheless, in practice, we anticipate that most companies will need to report on climate change, given the breadth of the double materiality framework and the need to justify any decision to exclude climate reporting  and have that justification pass audit.

At the same time, we are seeing increased investor and customer demands for climate data, meaning, in practice, many companies will be making these disclosures anyway.

Greater consistency with other ESG reporting frameworks, but gaps remain Although the SECs final climate rule is not expected until later this year, the ESRS differ from the SECs current and proposed rules in numerous substantive and methodological areas.

Divergences include how the ESRS approach to value chain reporting, the need for impact materiality assessments and the need to report on a broader set of sustainability topics."
Cooley,EU Adopts Long-Awaited Mandatory ESG Reporting Standards,"Divergences include how the ESRS approach to value chain reporting, the need for impact materiality assessments and the need to report on a broader set of sustainability topics.

The ESRS also are broader than just climate disclosures and extend well beyond the current limited SEC requirements related to human capital and governance matters.

For US companies already aligning voluntarily with frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or TCFD, the ESRS also contains numerous significant differences in subject matter and methodology.

Similarly, while improvements have been made to better align the ESRS and International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards  IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 , published June 2023  companies should not assume that a CSRD-compliant report will automatically meet all the requirements under the ISSB standards, and vice versa.

For UK and Singapore companies, this is particularly relevant.

On 2 August 2023, the UK government confirmed that the incoming UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards will be based on the ISSB standards .

These new UK sustainability reporting requirements may apply to companies as early as July 2024.

A similar proposal has been made in Singapore, where certain companies may be required to comply as early as 2025.

The publication of a summary comparing the ESRS to the ISSB standards is expected in the coming months.

As a result, we recommend that companies conduct gap assessments of their current voluntary reporting or other regulated disclosures against the ESRS to identify areas where additional work will be required.

Cooley,FCC Proposes Expansive New Ownership Disclosure Rules for Telecom Investors,"In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has increasingly focused on safeguarding the US telecommunications network from potentially adverse foreign interests.

In response to these concerns, the FCC has proposed significant changes to its requirements for reporting foreign ownership  and potentially all ownership  in companies that provide regulated international telecommunications services, including voice and high-capacity services.

These changes would require any 5% interest (and potentially even smaller interests) to be reported and would result in national security review of future investments that today would not be reported at all.

A telecommunications carrier in the US must have an authorization (called an international Section 214 authorization) from the FCC before it can send telecommunications traffic outside the US.

Accordingly, a US telephone company, cable operator or wireless carrier that provides standard long-distance telephone service (or other telecommunications services used to reach international destinations, such as high-capacity services) should hold an international telecommunications authorization.

Applications for international telecommunications authorizations currently must disclose parties that hold a 10% or greater equity or voting interest in the applicant.

However, there is no obligation to update those ownership disclosures after an authorization is granted unless there is a change of control.

In a notice of proposed rulemaking , the FCC proposed to significantly expand the reporting requirements applicable to international telecommunications authorization holders.

Under the proposal, the threshold for a reportable investment would be reduced from 10% to 5%.

This change would force carriers with international telecommunications authorizations to publicly disclose many investors that previously did not have to be disclosed.

Because of the additional disclosures of foreign ownership, this change also would subject many more applications to national security review or evaluation by Team Telecom, an interagency committee that reviews FCC applications for national security concerns.

In addition, the FCC proposed a 10-year renewal requirement for international telecommunications authorizations.

As part of the renewal process, or as part of any application for new ownership, the FCC proposed to collect information about all holders of 5% or greater direct or indirect voting and equity interests.

The FCC also proposed that carriers update their ownership information every three years.

The FCC is seeking public comment on its proposals.

Questions raised by the FCC include whether the 5% disclosure requirement should apply to all interest holders or only to foreign individuals or entities, how the FCC will determine whether an investment crosses the 5% threshold, and whether passive or insulated interests should be disclosable.

Comments on the FCCs proposals are due on August 31, 2023, and reply comments are due by October 2, 2023.

If you would like more information about the FCCs proposed new rules or the rulemaking process, you can reach out to one of the Cooley attorneys listed below."
Cooley,Court of Justice Sets Lightning Rod for EU Foreign Direct Investment Screening,"On 13 July 2023, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) handed down its first ruling on the European Union Foreign Direct Investment Screening Regulation, which entered into force in October 2020.

In short, the CJEU clarified in Xella Magyarorszg that the regulation does not apply to acquisitions by EU-based buyers, regardless of whether they are ultimately controlled by non-EU shareholders.

Cross-border acquisitions by EU-based buyers are subject to EU law on the freedom of establishment.

While EU Member States are free to decide  and pursue in investment screening  their own public policy and public security goals, investment screening measures cannot restrict fundamental EU freedoms unless the measures are justified by a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society.

No such threat existed in the case before the CJEU.

The judgment has important implications for companies, EU Member States, EU Institutions and especially the European Commission (EC).

Multiple parallel investment screening systems in the EU Investment screening in the EU is by no means a one-stop-shop affair.

Constitutionally, foreign direct investment (FDI) is an exclusive competence of the EU , though historically only a few Member States maintained any system for national security or public policy screening of inbound investment.

In fully decentralized reviews, those Member States had to factor in EU law in the screening, but the EC and other EU bodies played no operational role.

The regulatory landscape for investment screening changed dramatically in the past few years The EU Foreign Direct Investment Regulation (FDI Screening Regulation) took effect in 2020.

Under this regulation, it is for the Member States to decide which investments to review, approve, condition or block, but Member States are encouraged to implement and apply systems consistent with EU law.

The regulation does, however, establish a common framework by setting out: Certain core system requirements for Member States that maintain or adopt review systems.

A cooperation mechanism for the EC and Member States to exchange information and identify potential concerns regarding specific investments.

The possibility for the EC to issue opinions when investments present threats to the security or public order of more than one Member State or an EU initiative.

International cooperation on investment screening.

Member States have expanded and strengthened their existing investment screening systems or introduced new systems altogether.

The political impetus for more rigorous controls has increased in view of  especially  the COVID-19 pandemic and global security changes following Russias invasion of Ukraine.

Today, 25 of the 27 EU Member States either have, or are introducing, systems for the review and approval of inbound investments.

This mostly decentralized patchwork of parallel screening mechanisms affects a large number of transactions each year.

According to the EC in its second annual report on the screening of foreign direct investments into the European Union , Member States reviewed 1,563 cases in 2021, and 414 cases were submitted for cooperation among the EC and Member States under the FDI Screening Regulation.

The number of cases reviewed each year is set to increase as Member States introduce and enhance screening systems.

But this evolving system is fraught with problems of efficiency, as well as effectiveness.

For instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) identified not less than one dozen such issues  as well as potential solutions  in a report published last year .

Such issues also are apparent from the CJEUs recent ruling in Xella Magyarorszg .

National security threatened by the acquisition of a gravel pit?"
Cooley,Court of Justice Sets Lightning Rod for EU Foreign Direct Investment Screening,"Such issues also are apparent from the CJEUs recent ruling in Xella Magyarorszg .

National security threatened by the acquisition of a gravel pit?

The CJEUs ruling concerned the acquisition of Janes, a Hungarian company involved in the extraction of sand, gravel and clay, by another Hungarian company, Xella, a concrete manufacturer.

Janes market share in Hungary was minimal (0.52%), and most of its output (90%) was sold to Xella, with the remaining portion sold to other local customers.

The minister for the Hungarian Ministry of Innovation and Technology blocked the acquisition on the basis that a non-EU entity (Xella was majority-owned, via German and Luxembourg entities, by a Bermuda company) would get indirect control of a strategic Hungarian company, threatening the national interest in the security of supply of critically important raw materials at the local level.

Unsurprisingly, Xella appealed against the decision before the Budapest Hight Court.

Xella argued that the ministers decision involved either arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction of fundamental EU law on the free movement of capital and companies freedom of establishment.

The Budapest High Court requested guidance from the CJEU on the interpretation of EU law.

Not a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society The CJEU held that Xellas fundamental EU freedom of establishment had indeed been restricted and that the ministers decision failed to justify that restriction.

This conclusion was based on five key premises.

First , the FDI Screening Regulation does not apply to any form of investment inbound to a Member State.

The notion of foreign direct investment, as defined in the regulation, includes only investments where the direct investor is an undertaking constituted or otherwise organized under the laws of a [non-EU country].

The only exception arises in case of such an investors circumvention attempt by artificial arrangements that do not reflect the economic reality.

Second , in this case, a Hungarian company was being acquired by another Hungarian company.

Since the acquirers parent was German, with a grandparent in Luxembourg, the situation was not purely domestic, but involved indirect EU cross-border investment which should be analyzed under EU law on freedom of establishment.

The ultimate ownership of the acquiring entities was irrelevant (and there was no evidence on file which indicated that there was any attempt to circumvent the FDI Screening Regulation).

Third , the CJEU reminded that all measures which prohibit, impede or render less attractive the exercise of freedom of establishment restrict that fundamental freedom and are prohibited.

That is settled case law which curtails Member States ability to limit EU companies exercise of that fundamental freedom.

The CJEU held that the Hungarian legislation, as applied in this case, constituted a particularly serious restriction.

Fourth , Member States may justify a restriction on the freedom of establishment on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, but these are derogations from a fundamental freedom that must be interpreted narrowly.

The CJEU held that: While Member States are still, in principle, free to determine the requirements of public policy and public security in the light of their national needs, those grounds must  be interpreted strictly, so that their scope cannot be determined unilaterally by each Member State without any control by the EU institutions.

Thus, public policy and public security may be relied on only if there is a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society.

Moreover, those derogations must not be misapplied so as, in fact, to serve purely economic ends."
Cooley,Court of Justice Sets Lightning Rod for EU Foreign Direct Investment Screening,"Moreover, those derogations must not be misapplied so as, in fact, to serve purely economic ends.

Fifth , the CJEU concluded that the Hungarian goal to secure supply of raw materials, at the local level, to the construction sector (unlike the goal of ensuring security of supply in the petroleum, telecommunications and energy sectors) was not a fundamental interest of society.

Moreover, the prohibition at hand was incapable of posing a genuine and serious threat to any fundamental societal interest.

Implications for companies, Member States and the EC When laws and actions of Member States conflict with EU law, the latter prevails.

Member States must bring conflicting aspects of national law or action in line with the requirements of EU law.

The judgment in Xella Magyarorszg has important implications for companies and Member States, as well as the EC.

Companies should not expect investment screenings to be delayed by inquiries and coordination under the FDI Screening Regulation, unless the deal involves a direct acquirer based outside the EU.

Can such coordination be avoided by a deal structure involving an EU-based special purpose vehicle as direct acquirer?

Not necessarily.

The EC has commented that it views as [t]he most common example of circumvention  the case where foreign investment into the Union is channeled through an EU-based pure shell/letterbox company, which has neither directly nor indirectly a genuine economic activity but serves solely the purpose of being the legal vehicle for the investment, which reflects a strict view on investment via special purpose vehicles.

But the EC recognizes that each specific deal structure needs to be assessed separately.

EU-based companies, regardless of the nationality of their ultimate shareholders, can clearly rely on EU law to challenge unwarranted or disproportionate screening by Member States.

Member States cannot unilaterally decide the requirements of public policy and public security in light of their national needs.

Whenever Member States screening systems or decisions fall short of the standards set by EU law rules on free movement, companies have grounds for challenge.

The deal in Xella Magyarorszg involved an outright acquisition of control and accordingly engaged the EU freedom of establishment.

But investments involving a lesser degree of influence may fall under the rules on free movement of capital, and those rules also embody standards that Member States must observe.

Basically, Member States must justify the design of their screening systems and how those systems are applied in individual cases, on grounds recognized in EU law.

For Member States, the CJEU ruling should serve as an impetus to review (especially, recently established or expanded ) investment screening systems to ensure that these systems conform to the strict requirements of fundamental EU law.

This impetus is the same for screening of situations involving cross-border EU acquisitions and EU inbound investments.

In Xella Magyarorszg , the Hungarian screening mechanism fell short of established EU law standards, but all Member States screening systems merit consideration given that screening mechanisms inherently involve barriers to capital flows and establishment.

While there is no question that national security and public policy screening fulfills crucial functions, those functions should operate consistent with EU law.

Given that points of friction may arise between national and EU law at the level of system design (e.g., rules on jurisdiction and review process), as well as application (decisions in individual cases), any review should be comprehensive.

The EC has a key role to play in ensuring that EU investment screening works effectively, efficiently and in compliance with EU law.

For instance, in October 2023, the EC is due to deliver its first evaluation of the FDI Screening Regulation to the European Parliament and the European Council."
Cooley,Court of Justice Sets Lightning Rod for EU Foreign Direct Investment Screening,"For instance, in October 2023, the EC is due to deliver its first evaluation of the FDI Screening Regulation to the European Parliament and the European Council.

The ruling in Xella Magyarorszg confirms that the effectiveness and efficiency of the current system can be improved.

A point on effectiveness arises from the class of transactions that is subject to coordination and information exchange under the FDI Screening Regulation.

As the CJEU made clear, the regulation covers only deals where a non-EU firm is a direct acquirer, but it would be nave to think that only such transactions might give rise to concerns with respect to wide common EU interests or national security interests in more than one Member State.

However, there is no mechanism for coordination outside the scope of the regulation, which points to an effectiveness gap.

This could be addressed by changing the scope of the FDI Screening Regulation.

The judgment also highlights key points of inefficiency, owing to the lack of convergence among the Member States diverse and complex screening mechanisms.

The EC can do more to promote harmonization of those national systems, including by specifying more specific common standards for jurisdictional rules, sectors covered, procedural fairness and substantive review.

Such alignment may require further changes to the regulation, and it would be opportune to address these adjustments in the evaluation that is due in October.

A one-stop-shop system may not be realistic (or desirable), but a coordinated and harmonized system may be within reach."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for Public Procurement Tenders Goes Live,"The Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR), the European Unions new screening tool for third-country subsidies, introduces a novel and additional layer of scrutiny in public procurement.

Companies that take part in sizeable public tenders in EU Member States need to account for the provision of significant information and the involvement of potentially time-consuming review processes in their bid strategy.

From 12 July 2023, the European Commission (EC) has the power to ex officio investigate potentially distortive subsidies granted by third countries.

The FSR takes full effect on 12 October 2023, when participation in certain public tenders must be notified, reviewed and cleared before the relevant contracts can be awarded.

The FSR establishes mandatory notification requirements, backed by standstill obligations, and compliance is subject to potentially severe financial penalties.

Notwithstanding the fact that the final Implementing Regulation (FSR-IR) streamlined the requirements of notification  consistent with overwhelming consultation feedback  the reporting burden on firms remains significant.

Compliance with the FSR should therefore form an early and integral part of planning for participation in public procurement tenders.

What is the purpose of the new system?

The goal of the FSR is to level the playing field with respect to unfair advantages that third- country (non-EU) government subsidies may cause in the context of public tenders.

The need to address foreign subsidies distorting the EU internal market is considered especially salient in public procurement procedures given the economic significance of tenders in the internal market, as well as the fact that public contracts are financed by taxpayer funds.

Before adoption of the FSR, the EU regulatory framework allowed only for the control over State aid granted by EU Member States.

In particular, a contracting authority may reject a tender offer on the basis that the offer is abnormally low because the bidder had obtained illegal State aid.

The FSR aims to address competitive distortions caused within the EUs internal market by foreign subsidy schemes that facilitate submission of bids that are unduly advantageous.

That is a tall order and uncharted waters: Not only will the EC need to appraise the impact of foreign government subsidies in the context of a complex and disrupted global economic climate, the EC for the first time is granted direct powers to intervene in public procurement procedures held within Member States.

The FSR supplements  and will be applied in parallel to  the EUs existing regulatory toolbox for EU rules on State aid and public procurement.

The FSR also includes specific rules for subsidy screening in M&A deals (see our our M&A-related July 2023 client alert )

What is in scope for review?

The FSR requires a notification if the following two thresholds are satisfied: The estimated value of the public procurement or framework agreement exceeds 250 million euros (net of value-added tax) or, where divided into lots, the aggregate value of the lots that the bidder applied for exceeds 125 million euros.

The bidder (and relevant affiliates) and, where applicable, its main subcontractors and suppliers in the tender offer, was awarded aggregate financial contributions in the three years prior that exceeded 4 million euros.

If no notifiable financial contributions have been granted in the past three years, tenderers must submit a declaration to that effect.

Nevertheless, the EC can request notification even if the thresholds are not satisfied to review whether a party benefitted from foreign subsidies.

Lastly, similarly to the M&A procedure, the EC also may launch an ex officio investigation over a tender that has already been awarded.

Should a bidder fail to submit a notification when one is required, the EC may impose fines on bidders of up to 10% of their aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for Public Procurement Tenders Goes Live,"Should a bidder fail to submit a notification when one is required, the EC may impose fines on bidders of up to 10% of their aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year.

What needs to be notified?

A designated notification form (Form FS-PP) specifies the information to be provided about the tender, the third-country financial contributions and their possible positive effects.

Business documents are also required to explain the rationale of the financial contribution.

Notification is made in the first instance to the relevant contracting authority, which then transmits the notification to the EC.

Bidders are required to give detailed information for certain foreign financial contributions which are considered the most likely distortive.

These include: Subsidies provided to a bidder that is likely to go out of business in the short or medium term without the subsidy.

Unlimited guarantees for the debts or liabilities of the bidder.

Export financing measures not in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits.

A subsidy enabling a bidder to submit an unduly advantageous tender.

Whilst in practice the incidence of bidders being in receipt of such subsidies may be limited such that no or little detail needs to be provided, bidders are still expected to provide an overview of all other foreign financial contributions equal to or exceeding one million euros received in the preceding three years.

Given the broad notion of foreign financial contribution which would include measures such as direct grants, tax advantages, loans, etc. received globally, this will be a particularly onerous obligation for bidders and their sub-contractors when competing in large European procurements.

As such, corporates who regularly participate in large European procurements will need to ensure that they put in place sophisticated systems capturing this information, as well as imposing clear information obligations on parties with whom they may subcontract or partner.

Even for tender offers that do not qualify for review, bidders must sign a declaration that the notification thresholds were not satisfied.

Requests to participate in a tender process may be rejected if a bidder has not provided an FSR notification, or declaration, as part of the documentation.

What does the ECs review involve?

If a tender proposal satisfies the thresholds, the contracting authority must not award the contract to the relevant bidder unless and until the EC grants its approval.

The ECs review process and timeline are intended to run parallel to the public procurement procedure, although in practice the FSR review, if instigated, may extend beyond the normal timings of a procurement procedure.

An initial phase of 20  30 working days may be followed by a phase II review that can last up to 130 working days.

Similar to the M&A process, any commitments are formally addressed only in phase II.

In a multistage procedure,  the timeline changes, as the notification or declaration shall be submitted twice, first with the request to participate and then as an updated notification or declaration with the submitted tender or final tender.

The practical impact is that not only will contracting authorities have to make accommodation for potential delays to their procurement procedure, but also they may have little control over these events.

Bidders should therefore anticipate longer tender procedures in large procurements.

Procurement processes also are likely to commence much earlier and significantly before the expiry of existing contracts, with the impact that the term of certain public contracts may be extended beyond current typical contract durations.

When is a third-country subsidy problematic  and is there a fix?

As mentioned, the jurisdictional and notification requirements reference third-country financial contributions."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for Public Procurement Tenders Goes Live,"When is a third-country subsidy problematic  and is there a fix?

As mentioned, the jurisdictional and notification requirements reference third-country financial contributions.

But the actual review concerns subsidies, meaning financial contributions by a third country that  directly or indirectly  confer benefits on a party conducting business in the EU and are selective in the sense that they are limited as to the number of beneficiaries or industries.

This is a broad notion.

A foreign subsidy is deemed to be distortive of the EUs internal market if it is liable to improve the competitive position of an undertaking in the internal market, and where, in doing so, that foreign subsidy actually or potentially negatively affects competition.

This assessment depends on several factors, including the subsidys amount, nature, purpose and any conditions attached to it.

The following rules of thumb can be discerned:

Naturally, factors pertaining to the beneficiarys situation also are important, including the competitive landscape of the markets, the sectors involved, and the nature and degree of the beneficiarys presence in the EU.

The assessment ultimately involves a balancing test between, on the one hand, the competitive advantage conferred by any distortion caused by the subsidy and, on the other hand, any positive effects for the relevant subsidized economic activity, as well as broader policy considerations.

It is unclear how, in practice, the EC will conduct this assessment and how involved the relevant contracting authority will be.

The parties may propose remedies to address any actual or potential distortions arising from foreign subsidies, but formal offers may only be put forward during an in-depth review.

Any remedies should be tailored to the harm and may, for instance, involve: Foreign subsidy repayment.

Corporate governance commitments.

Access or licensing commitments.

Capacity or market presence reductions.

Investment restraints.

Divestment commitments.

Takeaways for bidders, subcontractors and suppliers The FSR adds complexity to the public procurement procedure.

Companies that intend to take part in public bids should note that: The FSR applies to public procurement procedures taking place after 12 July 2023, and notifications are required for those that will take place after 12 October 2023, if jurisdictional thresholds are satisfied.

For bidders participating in large European procurements, bidders will need to have compiled a detailed assessment of the subsidies they have received globally.

Bidders are recommended to: Assess their involvement in upcoming EU tenders and identify if the pipeline will involve qualifying tenders.

Conduct a mapping exercise of all potential subsidies received across the organization.

This is likely to be a significant undertaking, and it is recommended to put in place a system for tracking the receipt of foreign subsidies and develop a detailed database to capture the necessary information.

An equivalent assessment will need to be undertaken for subcontractors and bidding partners.

To the extent there is an existing contract with a contracting authority which may soon be expiring, or it is known that a tender is about to commence, clarify with the relevant contracting authority the impact of the FSR requirements on proposed tender timings.

Consider any additional compliance checklists and obligations that consortia participation  or other institutions overseeing participation in public procurement procedures  might impose in relation to foreign subsidies.

The FSR will affect companies who rely on supply chains or consortia bidding arrangements in public procurement.

Given that the ECs ability to screen extends to subcontractors, bidders who rely on bidding partners and subcontractors are likely to be more selective in their choice of partners."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for Public Procurement Tenders Goes Live,"Given that the ECs ability to screen extends to subcontractors, bidders who rely on bidding partners and subcontractors are likely to be more selective in their choice of partners.

As a result, companies that often act as subcontractors can expect more extensive due diligence from contractual partners.

Contracting authorities whose tenders may fall within the scope of the FSR will need to balance the requirements of the FSR with achieving their procurement objectives.

This is likely to impact tender processes.

For example, it is to be expected that contracting authorities may look to be more selective in reducing the bidder pool when down-selecting in multistage procurements, and bidders should anticipate enhanced requirements to provide greater transparency of pricing components in their financial models and pricing offers.

In addition to exploiting the remedies and challenge routes prescribed under the EUs procurement directives, it can be expected that disgruntled bidders also could look to use the FSR as an alternative basis of challenge to contract awards.

This is likely to extend the duration of legal challenges and may result in delays to contract awards.

Cooley,IRS Releases Guidance on Cryptocurrency ‘Staking’ Rewards,"On July 31, 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released Revenue Ruling 2023-14 , which addresses the US federal income tax treatment of cryptocurrency units (commonly referred to as coins or tokens) that are received by a taxpayer as a reward for validating transactions that occur on a blockchain network utilizing a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism (staking rewards).

The long-anticipated ruling definitively sets forth the IRS position that staking rewards are income for US federal income tax purposes.

Background Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that utilizes cryptography to secure transactions that are digitally recorded on a distributed ledger.

Many cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology, a specific type of distributed ledger technology.

The integrity of the blockchain must be maintained in order to preserve the cryptocurrencys function and utility.

That blockchain integrity is maintained by nodes  or individual computers that hold copies of the distributed ledger, run the related software and validate transactions that occur on the blockchain.

Validation occurs when blockchain transactions are determined to be legitimate and are recorded as new blocks on the blockchain.

The process of validating a transaction usually involves the participation of multiple validators who are selected to participate in the validation process by the blockchain protocol.

Validators typically are rewarded with tokens that are native to the blockchain network when the protocol determines that the validation process occurred properly, and they can be penalized through slashing, or forfeiture, of tokens if validation is conducted in a manner that is detrimental to the blockchain.

The protocols that make up the validation process are referred to as consensus mechanisms.  

Two common categories of consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake.  

The proof-of-work consensus mechanism involves using highly specialized and energy-intensive computers to solve and publicly share the solution to a cryptographic puzzle.

Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

Persons who successfully validate bitcoin transactions receive bitcoins as a reward through a process known as mining.

As discussed in this October 2019 Cooley alert on IRS guidance for cryptocurrency, under FAQ #8 of IRS Notice 2014-21 , a taxpayer who mines bitcoin or other virtual currency on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism generally must include in gross income the fair market value of the virtual currency received in connection with the mining activity.

Notice 2014-21 and subsequent IRS guidance do not specifically address staking rewards received under a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism differs from proof of work in that validators are selected to participate in the validation process based on a variety of factors  one of which includes the quantum of the validators staked coins or tokens, meaning those that the validator locks up for a certain period of time for use in the validation process.

The staked tokens are collateral to ensure that the validators conduct the validation process in the manner required by the protocol.

Coins or tokens that a validator stakes cannot be traded during that period and are subject to slashing.

Proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms generally are viewed as more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work consensus mechanisms because the staking process is not as energy intensive.

Holders of cryptocurrency on proof-of-stake blockchains that do not participate in the validation process do not earn rewards."
Cooley,IRS Releases Guidance on Cryptocurrency ‘Staking’ Rewards,"Holders of cryptocurrency on proof-of-stake blockchains that do not participate in the validation process do not earn rewards.

Revenue Ruling 2023-14 Revenue Ruling 2023-14 describes a situation in which a taxpayer on the cash method of accounting owned 300 units of an unspecified cryptocurrency, staked 200 of such units, validated a new block of transactions on the blockchain associated with such cryptocurrency, and received two units as a staking reward (reward units), which were nontransferable for a short period of time (lock-up period).

On the day following the lock-up period, the taxpayer had the ability to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of the reward units.

The IRS ruled that the taxpayer was required to include the fair market value of the reward units in gross income after the lock-up period because the taxpayer had an accession to wealth when the taxpayer gained dominion and control over the reward units.

The taxpayer was held to have gained dominion and control over the reward units on the day following the lock-up period, when the reward units became freely transferable.

Analysis The IRS view set forth in Revenue Ruling 2023-14 that the receipt of staking rewards is taxable is directionally consistent with prior guidance in Notice 2014-21, which indicates that cryptocurrency rewards received as a result of mining on a proof-of-work blockchain network are taxable upon receipt.

Revenue Ruling 2023-14 implicitly rejects an alternative position advanced by certain taxpayers and practitioners that would treat staking rewards comprised of newly minted tokens as self-created property that should not be taxable until the taxpayer disposes of them in a taxable transaction.

For example, in Jarrett v. United States , the taxpayer filed a claim for a refund relating to a staking reward previously included in gross income in the year of receipt.

Before the case was considered by the court, the IRS granted the taxpayers request for a refund.

The taxpayer attempted to reject the refund granted by the IRS in an effort to preserve his claim at the district court.

However, the district court dismissed the taxpayers case as moot because the refund had been granted and therefore did not consider the merits of the taxpayers argument.

The case is currently on appeal .

It is not entirely clear why the IRS granted the taxpayers refund request in Jarrett, but it apparently preferred to establish principles through subregulatory guidance rather than through the courts.

The ruling states that it does not address issues that may arise under rules not specifically cited, such as section 83.

Under Internal Revenue Code section 83(a), if a taxpayer receives property in connection with the performance of services, that property is generally valued and included in income by the service provider at the first time the rights of the person having beneficial interest in such property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier.

If section 83 applied to the reward units in Revenue Ruling 2023-14, it would appear the taxpayer should have been subject to tax upon receipt, not upon expiration of the lock-up period, because the ruling does not indicate that the reward units were subject to any substantial risk of forfeiture.

The ruling, however, gives no explanation as to why the dominion and control test, rather than section 83, applies to the reward units.

Although Revenue Ruling 2023-14 and prior IRS guidance clarify certain aspects of cryptocurrency transactions, a number of US federal income tax questions regarding cryptocurrency remain unresolved.

Revenue Ruling 2023-14 is limited to the staking rewards received by a validator and does not address the taxation of other types of transaction fees, such as gas fees paid to the validator for the cost of the computing power used in the validation process."
Cooley,IRS Releases Guidance on Cryptocurrency ‘Staking’ Rewards,"It also does not provide guidance on how units received as staking rewards should be valued for purposes of calculating the validators taxable income.

Cryptocurrency holders and exchanges should continue to consult with tax advisers to ensure compliance with applicable tax laws."
Cooley,"FCA, Federal Reserve Share Concerns About AI in Financial Services","Senior regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK and at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) in the US publicly shared remarks regarding their concerns about artificial intelligence.

Following a 17 July 2023 joint statement by US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra and Commissioner for Justice and Consumer Protection of the European Commission (EC) Didier Reynders, this continued messaging demonstrates that regulators and enforcement authorities remain committed to a collaborative approach for addressing consumer protection risks that are shared globally.

Key issues highlighted by the FCA

In a speech from London, Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, expressed concerns about the use of AI and the role Big Tech companies play in gatekeeping financial data .

In particular, Rathis comments focused on the risks that Big Tech may pose operationally for payments, retail services and financial infrastructure, as well as risks related to impacting consumer behavioral biases.

Rathi also acknowledged the potential benefits that partnerships with Big Tech could offer, noting specifically the possibility of increasing competition and innovation.

However, Rathi expressed caution about the role of critical third parties and their access to comprehensive data sets, such as browsing data, biometrics and social media.

For example, Rathi noted that two-thirds of UK firms use the same few cloud service providers and stated that the FCA, alongside the Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority, plans to regulate such critical third parties to ensure their security and resilience.

Risks created by Big Tech offering financial services Rathi also discussed benefits and trade-offs that he believes the use of AI introduces into the markets  including risks affecting integrity, pricing, transparency and fairness of the financial markets.

Rathi addressed the rapid increase in intraday volatility in trading across markets, especially since the 2008 financial crisis and particularly in the context of fraud, cyberattacks and identity fraud.

These risks are increasing in sophistication and effectiveness across the globe.

While certain AI solutions may help prevent these risks, some fear that AI could lead to more significant problems.

In addition, Rathi noted that the explainability of AI models is a high-priority item for UK regulators, with a particular emphasis on potential problems involving data bias.

Nevertheless, Rathi also highlighted other benefits of using AI in financial services  including improving financial models, providing more accurate financial information and advice, offering personalized products and services to customers, and tackling fraud and money laundering more effectively.

New regulations and resources for financial services In his closing remarks, Rathi called for a globally coordinated approach to regulating AI that fosters innovation while maintaining trust and confidence in financial services.

Rathi highlighted that the FCA established a Digital Sandbox earlier this summer that allows fintech companies and other innovators to test new technologies using real transactions, social media and other synthetic data on the platform.

Due in part to this outcome-based approach, frameworks have emerged to address issues that accompany AI technology.

The Consumer Duty, effective 31 July 2023, stipulates that firms must design products and services that aim to secure good consumer outcomes throughout all stages of the supply chain.

The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) likewise makes clear that senior managers are the ones ultimately accountable for the activities of a firm, including activities related to AI."
Cooley,"FCA, Federal Reserve Share Concerns About AI in Financial Services","The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) likewise makes clear that senior managers are the ones ultimately accountable for the activities of a firm, including activities related to AI.

There also have been recent suggestions from the UK Parliament that there should be a bespoke SM&CR-type program for the most-senior individuals managing AI systems  particularly individuals who may not have typically performed roles subject to regulatory scrutiny but who will now be increasingly central to firms decision-making and the safety of markets.

US regulatory issues related to AI and mortgage underwriting Across the pond, speaking at the National Fair Housing Alliances national conference in Washington, DC, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board Michael Barr expressed similar concerns about the use of AI in mortgage origination and underwriting .

Barr noted that advancements in mortgage origination and underwriting technology could lead to discriminatory practices and violations of legislation, such as the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

Barr indicated concern that AI programs could perpetuate or even amplify certain biases by drawing from data that is flawed or incomplete to reach inaccurate conclusions about prospective borrowers based on their protected characteristics.

Although Barr mentioned the potential for new AI technologies to expand credit opportunities to underrepresented groups, he stated that inadequate technology could result in reverse redlining risk, where underrepresented borrowers are steered toward more expensive or lower-quality financial products.

Barrs comments align with similar concerns expressed by other regulators in DC, including Chopra, who has been critical of the risks in AI-based underwriting and customer engagement.

Whats next?

These comments by top regulators in the UK and US demonstrate a continued commitment to international collaboration amongst agencies to address perceived consumer protection risks, including those in the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape for financial services companies that use AI, raising the bar  and the risk  for those entities that are using such technology.

As regulators continue to focus on these sorts of legal and compliance risks, it will be important for companies using AI to do the same, including understanding the potential for bias and other fair lending risks within their models and considering resources like digital sandboxes to test and train their models."
Cooley,New York State Amends Its WARN Act Regulations,"At the end of June 2023, the New York Department of Labor (DOL) issued final amended regulations to the states Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (NY WARN) Act.

The amendments, which are now effective, impose significant new requirements on employers conducting mass layoffs.

Similar to, but more expansive than, its federal counterpart, NY WARN requires certain New York businesses to provide at least 90 days notice of employment loss to affected employees (and other government entities) in the case of plant closings, mass layoffs, relocation, and certain reductions in work hours.

According to the DOL , the amendments address the post-pandemic employment climate, and simplif[y] language to ensure businesses better understand their obligations.

Weve outlined the key updates below.

Labor commissioner determination of eligibility for exceptions The most significant change of the regulations is the new process by which employers seek an exception from the 90-day notice period requirement.

Under this new process, an employer seeking an exception must submit certain required documentation demonstrating eligibility for the exception to the states labor commissioner, who will then decide whether an exception is warranted.

The required documentation  which must be submitted within 10 business days of the notice being provided to the commissioner  includes, among other things: A statement describing the reason for the need to close the business, perform a layoff or reduce work hours.

A description for the basis of the reduced period of notice.

Relevant documents.

An affidavit attesting to the truth of the documents.

After completing an investigation, the commissioner may notify the employer of its determination or, if the investigation determines that the employer failed to establish the elements of any exception, the commissioner will continue the enforcement action for determining the employers liability for violation of the [a]ct.

To gather additional information, the commissioner also can convene an investigative conference at which an employer may be accompanied by a lawyer or other representative.

Pandemic-related updates to employer coverage, unforeseeable business circumstances exception NY WARN applies to employers with 50 or more full-time employees within New York State.

In a nod to the post-pandemic workplace, the regulations now clarify that individuals who work remotely but are based at the employment site will be counted toward this threshold.

However, the regulations do not elaborate on how to determine whether employees are based at a particular employment site in the state.

Further, this expanded definition could cover employers with less than 50 employees working physically in the state, if the employer has remote workers outside the state who report into a New York office.

The regulations also amend the unforeseeable business circumstances exception to the notice requirement to include public health emergencies, such as a pandemic that results in a sudden and unexpected closure as an additional situation that may excuse full compliance with NY WARN.

Temporary and permanent layoff definitions The regulations now distinguish between a temporary layoff (which is excluded from the notice requirements) and a permanent layoff that requires notice under NY WARN.

A temporary layoff does not exceed six consecutive months with a planned return of employees, whereas a permanent layoff is a mass layoff extending beyond a consecutive six-month period.

Expansion of notice recipients NY WARN requires notices to be served on affected employees, employee representatives, the labor commissioner and the local Workforce Investment Board where the site of employment is located.

The regulations now require that notices also are sent to the following: The chief elected official of the unit(s) of local government where the employment site is located.

The school district(s) where the employment site is located."
Cooley,New York State Amends Its WARN Act Regulations,"The school district(s) where the employment site is located.

The locality that provides police, firefighting, emergency medical or ambulance services, or other emergency services to the locale where the site of employment is located.

Expanded content of notices The content required to be contained  and also now be provided electronically  in the notice to the labor commissioner must include: The complete legal business name and any other business names used in the operation of the business.

The business address and email address of the employers representative, whom the state can contact for more information.

The name, address, personal telephone number, personal email address, job title and work location(s) of each employee to be laid off, in addition to information on whether the employee is paid on an hourly, salary or commission basis, whether the employee is full time or part time, and if the employee has any union affiliation.

The total number of full-time and part-time employees in the state and at each affected site, as well as the number of affected employees at each affected site.

Any additional information required by the labor commissioner.

Notably, the regulations also greatly expand the content of the notice required for affected employees, which now broadly comprises [a]ny additional information known at the time of the notice and relevant to the separation.

This includes information on severance packages or financial incentives if the employee remains and works until the effective date of the mass layoff, relocation or employment loss, available dislocated worker assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be temporary, the estimated duration.

Payment in lieu of notice Under the existing framework, employers can reduce their liability for failing to provide the required 90 days notice by making voluntary and unconditional payments that are not otherwise required pursuant to a contract or law, or by paying wages and benefits for the violation period.

The regulations now provide that an employer also may make payments in lieu of notice of separation or layoff if all of the following conditions are met: The employer maintains an employment agreement or a uniformly applied company policy that requires that the employing unit give the employee a definite period of notice before a layoff or separation.

The employee is laid off or separated without the required notice.

The employer pays the employee a sum equal to the employees regular wages and value of the costs of any benefits, for the required period of the notice.

As this new section does not materially alter the existing framework for employers to reduce their liability by paying wages and providing benefits for the violation period, it appears that this latest amendment was intended to provide an additional method for reducing an employers liability under NY WARN, such as in the case of a preexisting employment agreement providing for notice periods or payments in lieu of such notice periods.

Notification in sale of business situation The regulations also amended the notice provisions with respect to a sale of all or part of a business.

Notably, if the transfer of employees is a condition of the purchase agreement, and that condition is not upheld by the purchasing employer (i.e., the purchaser does not employ the sellers employees), the purchasing employer is obligated to provide the required notice.

Next steps Although its not part of the amended regulations, New York employers should note that in May 2023, the DOL launched an updated WARN portal , which employers now may use to submit required notices and other documents under NY WARN, as described above.

Employers considering layoffs should consult with counsel as soon as possible to ensure compliance with the additional onerous burdens imposed by the updated regulations."
Cooley,"Q2 2023 Venture Financing Report – Deal Count and Invested Capital Increase, Along With Down Rounds and Recapitalizations, While Late-Stage Pre-Money Valuations Decline","Cooley handled 206 reported venture capital financings in Q2 2023, representing $6.2 billion of invested capital, an increase from 192 reported financings and $4.7 billion of invested capital in Q1 2023.

The slight increase in these numbers in Q2 2023 ends the steady decline we have seen since Q4 2021, but the numbers were still lower than those from Q3 2022.

These slight increases were reflected more in later-stage rounds.

Median pre-money valuations remained mostly steady  with some slight upward trends  for most stages of financing.

Valuations for Series Seed deals generally remained high, consistent with levels seen since mid-2021.

Series A valuations were generally still higher than pre-pandemic levels, Series B valuations were trending up and aligned with valuations seen in mid-2022, and Series C valuations aligned with valuations seen throughout 2021 and 2022.

The percentage of deals (at all stages) with a median pre-money valuation of $100 million or more was at 25% of deals in March 2023 and continued to rise in Q2 2023 to 33% of deals in June 2023.

Despite the aforementioned good news, the percentage of down rounds continued to increase in Q2 2023, reaching 21% of deals for the quarter.

This is the first time the percentage of down rounds has surpassed 20% since Q2 2016.

The percentage of up rounds rose slightly to 77% of deals for Q2 2023  up from 73% last quarter  though still significantly down from the high percentages seen in 2021 and early 2022.

Flat rounds represented just 2% of deals during the quarter, down from 11% last quarter and back in line with numbers seen during 2021 and early 2022.

Deal terms  while overall still favorable for companies  did show some less favorable trends for companies in Q2 2023.

The percentage of deals involving a recapitalization rose to 2.91% of deals in Q2 2023.

This number has exceeded 2% of deals only two times during the history of our reporting, the last time being in Q3 2014.

The percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision remained low at 5.3% of reported deals.

However, it is rare that this number is above 5%, and prior to this year, the number had not exceeded the 5% mark since Q3 2020.

Despite these two trends, the number of reported deals having non-participating preferred stock remained favorable to companies, at 95% of reported deals for Q2 2023.

In PitchBooks Q1 2023 Global League Tables , Cooley was named the #1 law firm overall in the US and globally for venture capital financings and held the #1 rank in the US and globally for representation of companies in venture capital financings.

In addition, Cooley ranked as the most active law firm in late-stage venture financing deals, as well as in various industry sectors, including pharma and biotech, healthcare (services and systems), and IT hardware.

Spotlight on technology Deal volume and invested capital for technology company venture financings rose slightly in Q2 2023 to 118 reported financings, representing $3.1 billion of invested capital, as compared with 108 reported financings of technology companies, representing $2.9 billion of invested capital, in Q1 2023.

Excluding Q1 2023, Q2 2023 represents the lowest deal volume for technology companies since Q3 2018, when Cooley handled 115 reported deals, and the lowest amount raised since Q1 2019, when Cooley handled 123 reported deals, representing more than $2.8 billion of invested capital.

As with all industries, the deal count and invested capital for technology company venture financings is down significantly since one year ago, when Cooley handled 213 reported venture financing deals for technology companies, representing more than $12.3 billion of invested capital, in Q2 2022.

The average reported deal size decreased slightly during the quarter for venture financings of technology companies to just under $26.4 million, compared to just more than $28 million in Q1 2023  both down from more than $57 million a year ago in Q2 2022."
Cooley,"Q2 2023 Venture Financing Report – Deal Count and Invested Capital Increase, Along With Down Rounds and Recapitalizations, While Late-Stage Pre-Money Valuations Decline","Spotlight on life sciences In Q2 2023, Cooley handled 49 reported venture financings of life sciences companies, representing $1.9 billion of invested capital.

Both numbers are slightly up from Q1 2023, when Cooley handled 47 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies, representing more than $996 million of invested capital.

Reported deal sizes for venture financings of life sciences companies also increased slightly to an average deal size of more than $38.3 million, compared with $21.2 million in Q1 2023.

Despite these increases from the previous quarter, the numbers for venture financing deals for life sciences companies are down compared to one year ago, in Q2 2022, when Cooley handled 54 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies with invested capital of $2.5 billion and an average deal size of more than $45 million.

The percentage of life sciences venture financings structured in tranches remained high at 24% of reported deals.

The number of venture financings for life sciences companies structured as tranches has now equaled or exceeded 20% for the last four quarters.

Before Q3 2022, the last time the percentage of reported life sciences venture financings structured in tranches exceeded 20% was during Q3 2020.

View the interactive visualization on Cooley GO Key insights from Steve Harrick On public financing in Q3 and Q4 2023:

There is still a lot of capital available that has been raised by venture funds, but it is a difficult deal environment when the last round prices were as high as they were in 2020 and 2021.

On investor attitudes toward AI: Our belief is that the value from artificial intelligence and machine learning will be enormous, but it will play out over the next several years.

On investor reactions to market contraction: What is different from some other cycles is  although the tourists have left, as they usually do when markets contract  the consistent venture practitioners raised a lot of money that will eventually need to find a home.

Cooley,Consumer IoT Devices: Get Ready for the US Cyber Trust Mark,"American consumers have benefited in countless ways from Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Unfortunately, cyberattacks have sharply increased in recent years, often through vulnerabilities in IoT devices.

In an effort to curb such attacks, the Biden-Harris administration proposed the creation of the US Cyber Trust Mark to help consumers identify products that are less vulnerable to cyberattacks.

The US Cyber Trust Mark will be a voluntary program under which conforming IoT products that meet certain cybersecurity criteria developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology will be officially certified under a process adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Certified products will be permitted to include the US Cyber Trust Mark logo on product packaging alongside a QR code.

The QR code will link to a national registry of certified devices to provide consumers with specific and comparable security information about smart products.

The administration plans to educate consumers to look for the new label when buying products and has already started encouraging major US retailers to prioritize labeled products when placing them on the shelf and online.

Leading electronics, appliance and consumer product manufacturers have already announced their support for the program.

The details of the US Cyber Trust Mark program are still being developed.

Interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on specifics, like the criteria devices must meet to be certified and how the program will be enforced.

Proposals are likely to include requirements for unique and strong default passwords, secured data transmissions, access controls, the ability to update software and incident detection capabilities.

Also expected are requirements to give consumers the ability to set and change passwords and delete their data.

Depending on the specific rules adopted, compliance with the new program could impose significant additional costs on product manufacturers.

The FCC will release a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) , which will contain specific proposals for the US Cyber Trust Mark program.

Device creators, manufacturers, retailers, consumers and other interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on the proposals in the NPRM.

After comments are received, the FCC will vote to adopt the new rules.

The program is expected to be up and running in 2024.

For more information about the US Cyber Trust Mark program and the FCCs proposed implementation, please reach out to one of the Cooley attorneys listed below."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"On July 26, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted at an open meeting to adopt final rules to mandate standardized cybersecurity disclosures by public companies .

The final rules will: Require a company to disclose specified material information about a material cybersecurity incident under new Item 1.05 of Form 8-K within four business days of the company making the determination that the cybersecurity incident was material, subject to a narrow exception for disclosures that would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety.

An instruction to Item 1.05 will require a company to make their materiality determinations without unreasonable delay, while an additional instruction will require a company to include a statement identifying any required information that is not determined or unavailable at the time of the required filing, and then file an amendment to the initial Item 1.05 Form 8-K containing such information within four business days after such information becomes available.

Require annual disclosure in reports on Form 10-K pursuant to Item 106 of Regulation S-K regarding: A companys processes, if any, for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

Whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect a companys business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.

The board of directors oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.

Managements role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

The final rules will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Companies other than smaller reporting companies will be required to comply with the incident disclosure requirements in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K on the later of 90 days after the date of publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register or December 18, 2023.

Smaller reporting companies will have an additional 180 days and will be required to comply with Item 1.05 on the later of 270 days from publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register or June 15, 2024.

All companies will be required to comply with the annual disclosure requirements in Item 106 of Regulation S-K beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023.

Therefore, for calendar year-end companies, the first report requiring compliance with Item 106 will be the Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year filed in 2024.

The following table compares at a high level the requirements proposed versus those adopted in the final rules.

Item Proposed requirement Adopted requirement Form 8-K Item 1.05  Material cybersecurity incidents Companies would be required to disclose any cybersecurity incident they experience that is determined to be material and disclose,to the extent known at the time of filing:

When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing.

A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident.

Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose.

The effect of the incident on the companys operations.

Whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.

An Item 1.05 Form 8-K would be required to be filed within four business days of determining an incident was material.

Companies must disclose any cybersecurity incident they experience that is determined to be material and describe the material aspects of its: Nature, scope and timing.

Impact, or reasonably likely impact, on the company, including its financial condition and results of operations.

An Item 1.05 Form 8-K must be filed within four business days of determining an incident was material, subject to a narrow exception if disclosure would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"To the extent information required by Item 1.05 is not determined or is unavailable at the time of the required filing, companies must include a statement to that effect, and then file an amendment to the initial Form 8-K to disclose such information within four business days after determining such information or after such information becomes available.

An untimely filing of an Item 1.05 8-K will not result in a loss of Form S-3 eligibility.

Regulation S-K Item 106(d)  Updated incident disclosure Companies would be required to quarterly disclose in Forms 10-Q and 10-K: Any material changes, additions or updates to the information disclosed under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K that had occurred within the applicable reporting period.

When a series of individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate.

Removed.

Note: The definition of cybersecurity incident was extended to a series of related unauthorized occurrences, which would still require companies to aggregate incidents under certain circumstances.

Regulation S-K Item 106(b)  Risk management and strategy Companies would be required to describe their policies and procedures, if any, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats including, but not limited to, operational risk, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers, violation of privacy laws, other litigation and legal risk, and reputational risk.

Companies must describe their processes, if any, for the assessment, identification and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats and describe whether any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, their business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.

Regulation S-K Item 106(c)  Governance Companies would be required to: Describe the boards oversight of cybersecurity risks.

Describe managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity-related risks, as well as its role in implementing the companys cybersecurity policies, procedures and strategies.

Companies must: Describe the boards oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.

Describe managements role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

Regulation S-K Item 407(j)  

Cybersecurity expertise Companies would be required to disclose the cybersecurity expertise (if any) of members of the companys board.

Removed.

Please see the SECs press release for the final rules and the condensed fact sheet for further details.

For more background on the final rules and information on the SEC commissioners views and statements regarding the rules, which passed by a vote of 3  2 along party lines, see our July 2023 PubCo blog post .

Background Under the existing public company reporting framework, there are no explicit disclosure requirements relating to cybersecurity matters.

However, there are several disclosure requirements under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X that may require disclosure with respect to cybersecurity matters  such as risk factors, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, description of business, legal proceedings, board leadership structure and role in risk oversight, financial statements, and disclosure controls and procedures.

In 2011, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance (Corp Fin) published interpretive guidance to provide direction to companies on how cybersecurity risks and incidents should be discussed under the existing disclosure rules, as well as examples of when disclosure may be required."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"Recognizing the growth in cybersecurity incidents, the SEC published additional interpretive guidance in 2018 to reinforce and expand upon the earlier Corp Fin staff (Staff) guidance  and to discuss the importance of disclosure controls and procedures in addressing cybersecurity risks and incidents, as well as the application of insider trading prohibitions and Regulation FD in the context of cybersecurity incidents.

For more information on the 2018 interpretive guidance, refer to this March 2018 Cooley client alert .

According to the SEC, while cybersecurity disclosures improved following the issuance of the interpretive guidance, the Staff had observed, among other things, that disclosures, in terms of content and timing, were inconsistent.

Accordingly, the SEC adopted these final rules.

Despite adoption of the final rules, however, the 2011 and 2018 interpretive guidance will remain in place.

Final rules Cybersecurity incident reporting The final rules add new Item 1.05 to Form 8-K, which requires disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents within four business days of the company making the determination that the cybersecurity incident is material  not discovery of such incident.

In a change from the stricter language proposed, an instruction to Item 1.05 will require companies to make their materiality determinations without unreasonable delay.

Notably, the disclosure requirement also applies to cybersecurity incidents on third-party systems a company uses that have a material impact on the company.

In the adopting release, the SEC made clear that the materiality determination for cybersecurity incidents will remain consistent with existing case law  i.e., information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider this information important in making an investment decision, or if the information would have significantly altered the total mix of information made available.

1

The release also notes that a materiality analysis should take into consideration qualitative factors alongside quantitative factors in assessing the materiality of the cybersecurity incident, such as harm to a companys reputation, customer or vendor relationships, or competitiveness, or the possibility of litigation or regulatory investigations or actions.

In many circumstances, a company may not be able to make such a determination until after a thorough investigation is performed by a forensic firm on the companys systems.

In reporting a material cybersecurity incident, a company will be required to describe, to the extent known at the time of filing:

The material aspects of the nature, scope and timing of the incident.

The material impact, or reasonably likely material impact on the company, including its financial condition and results of operations.

New Item 1.05 also will include an instruction providing that to the extent any required information is not determined or is unavailable at the time of the required filing, a statement to this effect should be included in the initial Form 8-K followed by an amendment to the Form 8-K with this missing information within four business days after the information becomes available or is determined by the company, without unreasonable delay.

In addition, new Item 1.05 will include an instruction providing that a company does not need to disclose specific or technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident.

Importantly, the final rules allow for a delayed filing under Item 1.05 in cases where the US attorney general has notified the SEC in writing that the disclosure poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"Initially, the delay would only last for a time period specified by the attorney general, up to 30 days following the date when the disclosure was otherwise required.

The delay may be extended for an additional 30 days if the attorney general determines that disclosure continues to pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety and notifies the SEC in writing.

In extraordinary circumstances, disclosure may be delayed for a further 60 days if the attorney general determines that disclosure continues to pose a substantial risk to national security and notifies the SEC in writing.

Beyond these 120 days of potential delay, if the attorney general indicates that further delay is necessary, the SEC will consider additional requests and grant any relief through an SEC exemptive order.

However, Item 1.05 will not allow for a reporting delay for other federal agencies or non-federal law enforcement agencies.

In addition, note that this provision does not relieve a company of its obligations under other securities laws, such as Regulation FD.

There is an additional narrow delay provision when the disclosure would conflict with a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule for breaches of customer proprietary network information.

This provision allows for a delayed filing of the Item 1.05 Form 8-K up to the seven-business day period following the required notifications specified in the applicable FCC rule, with written notification to the SEC via an EDGAR correspondence filing no later than the date when the disclosure would have otherwise been required under Item 1.05.

However, the final rules do not provide for a delay where the incident may be subject to any other federal requirements or regulators.

While the SEC did not adopt a definition for cybersecurity, it did include definitions for cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat and information systems, which would apply to disclosures required in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K and Item 106 of Regulation S-K. Cybersecurity incident is defined as an unauthorized occurrence, or a series of related unauthorized occurrences, on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.

The SEC reiterated in the adopting release that, in general, it believe[s] that an accidental occurrence is an unauthorized occurrence, and that an accidental occurrence may therefore be a cybersecurity incident under its definition, even if there is no confirmed malicious activity.

Cybersecurity threat is defined as any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.

Information systems are defined as electronic information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations.

Lastly, disclosure under Item 1.05 on Form 8-K will be required to be filed, rather than furnished, with the SEC, but an untimely filing will not impact a companys eligibility to use registration statements on Form S-3."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"Further, the final rules amended Rules 13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to include new Item 1.05 disclosure in the list of Form 8-K items eligible for a limited safe harbor from liability under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act of 1934 Risk management, strategy and governance reporting The final rules add new Items 106(b) and (c) to Regulation S-K, which require companies to disclose in an annual report on Form 10-K matters related to cybersecurity risk management and strategy, board oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, and managements role in assessing and managing the companys material risks from cybersecurity threats.

Risk management and strategy With respect to risk management and strategy, a company will be required to describe its processes, if any, for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats in sufficient detail for a reasonable investor to understand those processes.

The final rules provide that this disclosure should include, as applicable, a discussion of: Whether and how the described cybersecurity processes have been integrated into the companys overall risk management system or processes.

Whether the company engages assessors, consultants, auditors or other third parties in connection with any of these processes.

Whether the company has processes to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with its use of any third-party service provider.

The final rules also clarify that this list is nonexclusive, and that companies should also disclose whatever information is necessary, based on their facts and circumstances, for a reasonable investor to understand their cybersecurity processes.

In addition, the final rules will require companies to disclose [w]hether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition and if so, how.

Governance Board oversight: Under the final rules, companies will be required to: Describe the boards oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.

If applicable, identify the board committee or subcommittee responsible for this oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.

Describe the processes by which the board or this committee is informed about these risks.

Managements role: Companies also will be required to describe managements role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

In crafting this description, the final rules direct companies to consider including, but not limited to, disclosure of the following information: Whether and which management positions or committees are responsible for assessing and managing these risks, and the relevant expertise of such persons or members in enough detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.

The processes by which such persons or committees are informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.

Whether such persons or committees report information about these risks to the board or a committee or subcommittee of the board.

In determining the relevant expertise of a person for purposes of the governance-related disclosures, the final rules add an instruction to Item 106(c) that explains that this may include, for example, prior work experience in cybersecurity, any relevant degrees or certifications, or any knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity.

Structured data Under the final rules, companies will be required to tag information specified in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K and Item 106 of Regulation S-K in Inline XBRL format, using block text tagging for narrative disclosures and detail tagging for any quantitative amounts disclosed within the narrative disclosures."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"(There are no explicit quantitative disclosure requirements in the final rules, but companies may nonetheless disclose quantitative amounts if material.)

Compliance with the Inline XBRL requirements will be required one year after initial compliance with the related disclosure requirement, described above.

Foreign private issuers The final rules apply similarly to foreign private issuers (FPIs), subject to certain differences as a result of the different reporting regimes.

FPIs are not required to file current reports on Form 8-K; however, the final rules add material cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic under Form 6-K that may trigger the filing of a Form 6-K. In addition, the final rules add new Item 16K to annual reports on Form 20-F, which will require cybersecurity disclosures that are consistent with the requirements in Item 106 of Regulation S-K discussed above, but these disclosure requirements were not added to Form 40-F filings.

For reporting material cybersecurity incidents on Form 6-K, if triggered, FPIs will be required to comply on the later of 90 days after the date of publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register or December 18, 2023.

FPIs must comply with the annual disclosure requirements in Item 16K beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023.

Therefore, for calendar year-end companies, the first report requiring compliance will be the Form 20-F for the 2023 fiscal year filed in 2024.

Observations and commentary

The final rules make changes from the initial proposal in mostly welcome ways.

The final rules make changes from the proposed rules in ways that streamline the disclosure requirements and better mitigate the possibility that the disclosures provide additional information to threat actors and expose the company to additional cybersecurity incidents.

In this regard, the final rules focus the disclosure on the impacts of a material cybersecurity incident, rather than on specific details regarding the incident itself.

The new delaying provision for national security and public safety also may benefit some companies, though it has a narrow application, and the release was not clear about how companies would contact the attorney general for this determination.

In addition, while the final rules removed the requirement for companies to provide quarterly disclosure in Form 10-Qs (or Form 10-Ks for the fourth quarter) regarding updates with respect to previously disclosed incidents or disclosure when a series of individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate, separate incidents may still need to be aggregated given the extension of the definition of cybersecurity incident to a series of related unauthorized occurrences.

In another helpful change, the disclosures required under Item 106 related to risk management, strategy and governance were streamlined from the proposal and provide companies with more flexibility in disclosing their cybersecurity processes, although these disclosures will still require careful consideration when drafting.

Lastly, the final rules removed the proposed addition of the requirement to disclose the cybersecurity expertise of a companys board.

While leaving this requirement out of the final rules provides companies with more flexibility in determining how they would like to manage and disclose this expertise, this disclosure is still requested by proxy advisory firms and many institutional investors, and disclosure regarding the expertise of management or committees responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks is still required under the final rules.

Review existing cybersecurity-related processes and internal controls.

Companies should promptly conduct a legally privileged review of their existing cybersecurity-related policies, procedures, controls and incident-response measures in light of the final rules and each companys own threat environment."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"We note that conducting such reviews under legal privilege, where possible, is highly advised, as such reviews often identify issues that should be addressed.

The final rules include an extensive disclose-what-you-do framework that will require companies to disclose their cybersecurity processes.

With the increased scrutiny this disclosure may draw from the SEC and investors, public companies and companies looking to go public in the near term should assess or reassess  as the case may be  how they identify and manage cybersecurity risks.

Companies that do not have cybersecurity processes should consider the impact of this new reporting framework and should work toward designing and implementing them.

Companies that do have cybersecurity processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks should reflect on how they will disclose and describe those processes and whether any updates may be advisable in response to any of the features highlighted in the final rules.

In addition, for companies that have not yet done so, now is the time to closely evaluate whether there are any gaps in their control environment and implement additional controls where needed, which should also occur going forward on a regular basis.

Recent SEC enforcement actions have applied the internal control provisions of the Exchange Act expansively to include policies and procedures concerning the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents.

This trend  combined with the incident disclosure requirements in the final rules  makes it even more critical that companies have internal controls and processes in place for identifying and reporting cybersecurity incidents.

Review existing governance structure and risk management framework in relation to cybersecurity matters.

Companies also should undertake a legally privileged review of their current governance structure and risk management framework in relation to cybersecurity matters in light of their own threat environment.

This review may include assessing whether any updates may be advisable in relation to cybersecurity oversight at the board or committee level, and in relation to managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.

While many companies have assigned cybersecurity oversight to the audit committee, the publication of these rules may be a good occasion to consider whether this delegation is aligned with the committee members expertise and is appropriate in light of the bandwidth of each board committee.

In addition, companies may elect to implement additional processes to ensure that cybersecurity is receiving sufficient attention  including ensuring timely communications are made on material cybersecurity matters and adequate time is dedicated to such discussions at the board or committee level  and that address the areas highlighted in the final rules, such as management reporting to the responsible board or committee and information related to management expertise and reporting structures.

For companies where cybersecurity matters are mission-critical risks, the company should consider tailoring its governance structure and risk management framework to appropriately reflect the heightened importance that is placed on these matters from a board oversight and fiduciary duties perspective.

Some best practices in this regard include, among many others:

Ensuring that the board is regularly and adequately informed regarding the companys cybersecurity risk management and incident-response preparedness.

Implementing a direct reporting line from the chief information security officer to the board.

Documenting the boards role in and oversight of the cybersecurity and incident response program.

Modernizing applications and overall IT systems.

Conducting regular threat assessments and mock breach exercises.

Approving a written security road map for enhancing cybersecurity oversight, which should be continuously reassessed to confirm its ongoing efficacy."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"Approving a written security road map for enhancing cybersecurity oversight, which should be continuously reassessed to confirm its ongoing efficacy.

Lastly, the requirement to discuss managements expertise may well increase demand for chief information officers and chief information security officers, so companies considering hiring for these positions are advised to act promptly.

In addition to soliciting new disclosures on cybersecurity risk management, similar to the proposed climate disclosure rules, the final rules ask for discussion of the integration of cybersecurity processes into overall risk management systems.

For many companies, any such discussion would be their first substantive public disclosure regarding their enterprise risk management processes.

As a result, companies may want to consider how they will disclose and describe these processes and evaluate the robustness and formality of their general risk management systems and related stakeholder expectations.

Review existing disclosures and board expertise.

Companies should review their existing disclosures relating to the boards role in risk oversight as required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S-K. In addition, despite the removal of the requirement to describe the boards cybersecurity expertise, many investors still expect board skills matrices and disclosures concerning board expertise or knowledge relating to cybersecurity matters.

Therefore, in order to gather this information, companies should consider adding questions to their directors and officers questionnaires that are similar to the questions regarding the qualification of audit committee financial experts.

Companies that do not have cybersecurity expertise on their board may feel pressure to prioritize this expertise in searches for new director candidates.

Consequently, director candidates with cybersecurity expertise will likely continue to find themselves in high demand.

In addition to identifying and recruiting directors with existing expertise, companies also should consider additional management and board education and training on cybersecurity matters, including disclosure requirements under the new rules.

Review incident response plans and playbooks as they relate to cybersecurity incident response, escalation, materiality and disclosure.

While the 2018 interpretive guidance encouraged companies to assess the sufficiency of their disclosure controls and procedures as they relate to cybersecurity disclosure, companies should review their existing disclosure controls and policies in light of the new mandatory reporting requirement for material (whether individually or in the aggregate) cybersecurity incidents to ensure that the appropriate channels are in place so that relevant information about cybersecurity incidents is processed and reported to appropriate personnel for making disclosure decisions.

Given the four-day requirement from the date of determination of materiality, these controls should ensure the information flows in a timely manner to the disclosure decision-makers, while taking appropriate steps to preserve the legal privilege wherever possible.

Appropriate personnel, including those in IT and information security, also should be made aware of these requirements and appropriately and regularly trained.

Companies also should assess their processes for the evaluation of incident materiality.

In connection with this, companies should consider business-specific factors that may impact materiality determinations and be prepared to articulate standards for incident materiality to the Staff.

Be prepared to regularly review the evolving impacts of cybersecurity incidents to determine if current or periodic disclosure is appropriate.

Under the final rules, a companys materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident must be made without unreasonable delay after discovery of the incident."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Comprehensive Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements,"Under the final rules, a companys materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident must be made without unreasonable delay after discovery of the incident.

In addition, to the extent that information required by Item 1.05 of Form 8-K is not determined or is unavailable at the time of the required filing, companies are required to include a statement to this effect, and then file an amendment to the initial Item 1.05 8-K containing such information within four business days after the company, without unreasonable delay, determines such information, or within four business days after such information becomes available.

Practically speaking, given the complexity and duration of cybersecurity incident investigations, it might take weeks or months for a company to understand the full scope and impact of such an incident.

The SEC stated in the adopting release that, other than with respect to the previously undetermined or unavailable information referenced in the initial Form 8-K filing, the final rules do not separately create or otherwise affect a registrants duty to update its prior statements.

As a practical matter, however, and as additional material facts come to light during such an investigation, companies should be prepared to regularly review and, depending on the circumstances, consider whether to update existing cybersecurity incident disclosures  even before the next periodic or annual report  to avoid having outdated information in the public domain or having the accuracy or completeness of their initial disclosures questioned.

Companies also should continue to review and enhance their broader Forms 10-K and 10-Q disclosures in light of any material cybersecurity incidents to ensure the description of risks remains fulsome and accurate.

In this respect, we expect that, in practice, companies that have previously disclosed material incidents may find it necessary to discuss those incidents and updates thereto on a quarterly basis, including in management discussion and analysis, legal proceedings, risk factors and notes to financial statements, as applicable.

Cooley,Latest CFPB Supervisory Highlights Identify Novel Violations Across Host of Financial Products and Services,"On July 26, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued its Summer 2023 Supervisory Highlights describing key findings and violations identified during examinations conducted between July 2022 and March 2023.

The findings cover a broad range of areas  including debt collection, deposits, fair lending, information technology, payday and small-dollar lending, remittances, auto origination and servicing, and mortgage origination and servicing.

The report also describes the CFPBs efforts to assess how technology used by supervised entities may impact consumers and affect compliance with federal law.

Although certain practices are attributed to the offering of a specific financial product or service, the themes from each section are worthy of consideration, as many are generally applicable and can help with the internal assessment of practices that might be criticized as unfair, deceptive or abusive.

Auto lending and servicing With respect to auto lending, examiners identified as deceptive auto finance origination practices whereby lenders utilized advertisements for loan offers that depicted larger, newer and more expensive cars for which the offers did not actually apply.

On the auto servicing side, examiners identified as unfair and abusive practices where auto servicers collected and retained interest on add-on options that were financed into the loan amount even though the vehicle securing the loan did not contain those options.

Examiners also identified as unfair situations where servicers suspended recurring payments without providing adequate warnings, as well as where they cross-collateralized loans and required consumers to pay off other debts before redeeming repossessed vehicles.

Furnishing credit report information Examiners found a host of technical violations associated with furnishing consumer report information to credit reporting agencies.

This included failing to: Periodically review and update policies and procedures to facilitate the accuracy and integrity of furnished information.

Conduct reasonable investigations of direct disputes.

Notify consumers that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.

Provide adequate address-related disclosures for notices of inaccuracy.

The CFPB directed these institutions to revise policies and procedures, update furnishing systems and train staff regarding dispute handling.

Fair lending Examiners identified fair lending concerns with respect to mortgage lender administration of pricing exceptions and consideration of criminal records and public assistance income in underwriting criteria.

In the mortgage origination space, examiners identified that mortgage lenders were less likely to grant pricing exceptions for competitive purposes to protected class consumers, including with respect to race, national origin, sex or age.

Lenders were criticized with respect to enforcement of pricing exception policies and procedures, failing to take corrective action to address observed disparities, failing to maintain sufficient documentation to justify the exceptions and offering inadequate training about pricing exceptions.

With respect to underwriting practices, the CFPB indicated that consideration of prior contact with the criminal justice system creates a heightened risk of disparate impact and identified concerns with respect to incorporation of this factor in mortgage origination, auto lending, credit card offerings and small-business lending.

Regarding consideration of public assistance income, examiners identified instances where lenders inappropriately excluded certain types of public assistance income from consideration or imposed stricter standards on income derived from public assistance programs."
Cooley,Latest CFPB Supervisory Highlights Identify Novel Violations Across Host of Financial Products and Services,"The CFPB also highlighted concerns with respect to failing to consider Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program income, not offering mortgage credit certificate benefits and maintaining extended continuity-of-income requirements for public assistance income.

Debt collection Examiners identified Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) violations where debt collectors continued collection attempts for work-related medical debt, despite receiving information that the debt was no longer collectible under state workers compensation law.

This is consistent with the CFPBs continued focus on issues related to the collection of medical debt and recent announcement that it is partnering with other agencies to address how medical debt is impacting consumers.

Examiners also identified situations where debt collectors told consumers they would reverse accrued interest if a debt was paid by a certain date, but then did not actually waive that interest.

Deposits Examiners identified as unfair the practice of assessing both a nonsufficient funds (NSF) fee and a line of credit transfer fee on the same transaction.

The CFPB noted that the supervised institutions believed they had controls in place to avoid charging two fees on the same transaction, but system-programming limitations failed to prevent the practice.

Payday lending Examiners identified as unfair, deceptive and abusive practices where lenders drafted language in loan agreements that prohibited consumers from revoking their consent for the lender to call, text or email the consumer about collection attempts, or where lenders made false collection threats to garnish the wages of borrowers when they did not have the authority to do so.

Examiners also identified risks associated with lenders failing to determine, before engaging in a transaction, whether a consumer was protected pursuant to the Military Lending Act.

Remittances Examiners found that institutions failed to develop and maintain proper error resolution policies and procedures for remittance transfers.

As an example, some institutions utilized an anti-money laundering policy and procedure in lieu of a remittance rule policy that failed to cover all requirements of the remittance rule.

Information technology and privacy Examiners determined certain institutions engaged in unfair acts by failing to implement adequate IT security controls that could have prevented or mitigated cyberattacks.

The lack of controls caused harm due to bad actors gaining unauthorized access to consumer bank accounts and withdrawing substantial amounts of funds.

The CFPB directed these institutions to implement multifactor authentication and enhance password management practices.

Mortgage lending Examiners determined institutions inappropriately based loan officer compensation on the terms of a transaction where they maintained a policy of varying compensation based on whether a product was brokered out rather than originating in house, even where the brokered product could not be originated by the lender.

Examiners also identified a technical violation of Regulation Z where an institutions loan origination system was not programmed to properly round the interest rate on a promissory note and reflect the terms of the legal obligation.

Mortgage servicing Examiners identified a host of technical violations regarding: The timing, as well as representations regarding the timing, for processing loss mitigation applications.

Ensuring customer service personnel were sufficiently available to borrowers, or were able to timely access information regarding a borrowers account.

Failing to credit payments after a servicing transfer.

Failing to identify missing information after a servicing transfer.

Examiners also found that a servicers Spanish-language acknowledgement notices lacked regulatory-required information, even though the English-language notices contained the required information."
Cooley,Latest CFPB Supervisory Highlights Identify Novel Violations Across Host of Financial Products and Services,"Examiners also found that a servicers Spanish-language acknowledgement notices lacked regulatory-required information, even though the English-language notices contained the required information.

Nonbank supervisory authorities The Supervisory Highlights also touched upon other nonbank supervisory developments, including with respect to larger market participants and organizations identified based on the CFPBs risk-based analysis.

The CFPB states that, to date, it has already issued several Notices of Reasonable Cause to commence risk-based supervision, and in some cases, after discussion with supervision, entities voluntarily agreed to be supervised."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - July One-Minute Reads,"SEC Adopts Final Rules on Cybersecurity Disclosure On July 26, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission voted at an open meeting to adopt final rules to enhance and standardize cybersecurity disclosures by public companies.

The final rules will: Require a company to disclose specified material information about a material cybersecurity incident under new Item 1.05 of Form 8-K within four business days of the company making the determination that the cybersecurity incident was material, subject to a narrow exception for disclosures that would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety.

An instruction to Item 1.05 will require a company to make their materiality determinations without unreasonable delay, while an additional instruction will require a company to include a statement identifying any required information that is not determined or unavailable at the time of the filing and then file an amendment to the initial Item 1.05 Form 8-K containing such information within four business days after the information becomes available.

Require annual disclosure in reports on Form 10-K pursuant to Item 106 of Regulation S-K regarding: A companys processes, if any, for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

Whether any risks from cybersecurity threats  including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents  have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect a companys business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.

The board of directors oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.

Managements role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

The final rules will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Companies other than smaller reporting companies will be required to comply with the incident disclosure requirements in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K on the later of 90 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register or December 18, 2023.

Smaller reporting companies will have an additional 180 days and will be required to comply with Item 1.05 on the later of 270 days from publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register or June 15, 2024.

All companies will be required to comply with the annual disclosure requirements in Item 106 of Regulation S-K, beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023.

Therefore, for calendar year-end companies, the first report requiring compliance with Item 106 will be the annual report for the 2023 fiscal year filed in 2024.

SEC enforcement director speaks on cyber resiliency Leading up to the adoption of the final rules, the SECs enforcement director spoke on June 22 about cyber resilience , which he defined as a concept recognizing that breaches and cyber incidents are likely going to happen, and that firms must be prepared to respond appropriately when they do.

In his comments, Grewal cited a recent poll in which more than a third of executives reported that their organizations accounting and financial data was targeted by cyber adversaries last year.

He then shared five principles that the SEC has been using to ensure that registrants take their cybersecurity and disclosure obligations seriously, including that: The SEC considers the investing public to also be potential victims of cyberattacks on publicly traded companies or other market participants; therefore, in addition to ensuring the target responds appropriately, the SECs goal is to prevent additional victimization by ensuring that investors receive timely and accurate required disclosures.

Having generic check the box cybersecurity policies is not sufficient  firms need to design and implement policies that work in the real world."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - July One-Minute Reads,"Having generic check the box cybersecurity policies is not sufficient  firms need to design and implement policies that work in the real world.

Companies need to regularly review and update all cybersecurity policies to keep up with constantly evolving threats.

When a cyber incident occurs, the relevant information must be reported up the chain to those making disclosure decisions; otherwise, it doesnt matter how robust the cybersecurity policies are.

The SEC has zero tolerance for instances where decision-makers prioritize concerns of reputational damage over informing customers and shareholders.

In outlining these principles, Grewal cited recent SEC enforcement actions as pertinent examples and as information companies should look to when determining what good cybersecurity compliance looks like.

Grewal also reiterated the potential benefits to companies if they meaningfully cooperate with SEC investigations, a theme he has discussed often and that has resulted in no civil penalties being levied against charged companies  including a California-based manufacturer of smart windows and the manufacturing company in the case mentioned below  in recent actions.

For more information on Grewals speech, refer to this July 5 PubCo post .

SEC brings another executive perks case On June 20, 2023, the SEC announced settled charges against a manufacturing company for failing to disclose perquisites it provided to certain executives, in the latest of a string of perks cases brought by the SEC.

As in some other recent cases, the perquisites were mainly expenses associated with the executives use of a corporate aircraft.

Notably, no civil penalty was imposed against the company, which self-reported the perquisite disclosure failures and other conduct potentially implicating the federal securities laws, cooperated with the SECs investigation, and implemented remedial measures.

To learn more about the charges, refer to the SECs order .

The SEC also announced charges against a former executive for causing the manufacturing company to violate proxy solicitation and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.

In addition to being another perks case, this case is another recent example of the SEC rewarding self-reporting and cooperation, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal noted that this decision reaffirms the divisions commitment to incentivizing self-reporting and cooperation when entities and individuals discover violations of the federal securities laws.

SEC continues enforcing revenue recognition, insider trading Grewals division also has brought recent actions targeting two of the SECs other focus areas: revenue recognition and insider trading.

On June 27, the SEC announced charges against numerous executives for engaging in improper revenue recognition practices to achieve revenue growth that was demanded by their former CEO.

Per the revenue recognition complaint, the executives fraudulently and prematurely recognized revenue for orders that remained in the companys control.

The complaint also alleged that another executive should have known that the company prematurely recognized certain revenues and overstated other revenue by misclassifying customer credits as advertising expenses.

On June 29, the SEC separately announced insider trading charges against five individuals arising from trading before the announcement of a tender offer by a pharmaceutical company to acquire another company.

Per the insider trading complaint , a vice president at the offering company tipped confidential information about the acquisition to his friend, who then tipped others, with the recipients of the tips purchasing stock and/or call options of the target company prior to the announcement based on the information received.

Once the acquisition was announced, the target companys stock price increased more than 130%."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - July One-Minute Reads,"Once the acquisition was announced, the target companys stock price increased more than 130%.

FW Cook publishes findings on pay-versus-performance disclosures On July 13, FW Cook published an alert on its findings from a review of the pay-versus-performance disclosures in proxy statements filed by S&P 500 companies as of June 1.

Key findings from the report include: Profit (56%), revenue (17%) and shareholder returns (12%) were the most common financial performance measures that companies chose as their company-selected measure in the required tabular disclosure.

Most companies included profit (88%), total shareholder return (55%) and revenue (51%) in their tabular list of most important financial measures they use, while only 21% included nonfinancial performance measures.

76% of companies used their Form 10-K industry or line-of-business index as their total shareholder return peer group.

Most companies included additional financial performance measures beyond the tabular lists minimum requirement of three.

91% of companies used graphs for the description requirements, with the remaining 9% using a narrative-only description.

PCAOB issues audit committee resource On June 21, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board issued a new resource for audit committees , which includes questions that may be relevant to audit committee members to consider or discuss with their independent auditors in light of todays economic and geopolitical landscape.

The publication divides the questions by topic and includes questions relating to risk of fraud, risk assessment and internal controls, auditing and accounting risks, digital assets, merger & acquisition activities, using the work of other auditors, talent and its impact on audit quality, independence, critical audit matters, and cybersecurity.

Court concludes Disney board within business judgment rule when speaking out on social issues On June 27, the Delaware Chancery Court published a decision that concluded the Disney board had made a business decision in its determination to publicly oppose Floridas Dont Say Gay bill.

The case involved a books and records demand from a stockholder who asserted there was a potential breach of fiduciary duty by the board when speaking out on the bill.

In its decision, the court denied the plaintiffs request, holding that he had not provided a credible claim of wrongdoing, and he had not demonstrated a proper purpose to inspect books and records.

Under Delaware law, directors have significant discretion in making business decisions to guide the company  and the court confirmed here that the boards decision was within the scope of the business judgment rule.

In reaching this finding, the court asserted that choosing to publicly speak on policy issues is an ordinary business decision.

Importantly, the court also concluded that a board may consider the interests of nonstockholder stakeholders where those interests are rationally related to building long-term stockholder value.

Cooley,The Main Institutions of International Arbitration,"International arbitrations may be conducted under the administration of an institution and pursuant to its institutional arbitration rules (institutional arbitration), or they may be subject to the arbitration rules that lack the support of an arbitral institution (ad hoc arbitration).

Both options present advantages and disadvantages, but on balance, the more structured and predictable approach of institutional arbitration is generally preferred.

Ad hoc versus institutional arbitration Parties to an ad hoc arbitration are free to agree to existing ad hoc rules (e.g. the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) or establish their own rules of procedure and to tailor the procedure to their needs.

Ad hoc arbitrations are usually less expensive than institutional proceedings, as there is no need to pay institutional fees.

The main disadvantage of ad hoc arbitrations is that they could be derailed by uncooperative parties.

For instance, a counterparty may refuse to appoint its own arbitrator or fail to agree with you on the selection of the arbitral seat, which can lead to a procedural deadlock.

The advantage of institutional arbitrations is that they do not depend on the parties cooperation to be effective.

Institutional rules have been designed and refined through decades of practice to avoid procedural breakdowns when parties are unwilling to arbitrate.

Therefore, when a party fails to appoint an arbitrator, the institution steps in to assist.  

Another advantage of institutional arbitrations is that they are administered by specialist staff in charge of all administrative matters, from collecting the arbitrators fees to organizing the logistics of the hearings.

The main arbitral institutions There are many reputable institutions that parties may consider when opting for administered arbitration.

Those institutions include, but are not limited to: International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA)

Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)

Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Arbitration Institute (SCC) Swiss Chambers Arbitration Institution (SCAI)

The International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR), in the international branch of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) Arbitration Center of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

When selecting an institution, one factor to consider is whether the institution has developed rules with a specific kind of dispute in mind.

For example, this is the case for WIPO with respect to intellectual property (IP) and domain name dispute.

Another factor to be considered is the geographic location of the institution with respect to the dispute.

For instance, the AAA is the leading arbitral institution in the US, with considerable experience in administering US domestic arbitrations and international disputes through its ICDR body.

SIAC was established in 1991 as a dispute resolution center for disputes in or around Singapore, although it has since expanded into a global forum for international disputes.

HKIAC and CIETAC are more focused on Chinese-related disputes, while European parties are probably most familiar with the ICC, LCIA, SCC and SCAI rules.

Common features and key provisions of the main arbitral rules Each institution has developed its model form of arbitration clause that may be incorporated into the main contract if the parties agree to choose that institution.

Each institution also has adopted its own set of arbitral rules that will apply to the arbitrations it administers."
Cooley,The Main Institutions of International Arbitration,"Each institution also has adopted its own set of arbitral rules that will apply to the arbitrations it administers.

All of these arbitral rules have similar features  from interim relief rules to fallback provisions for the appointment of missing arbitrator(s) or the selection of the arbitral seat  but significant differences still remain with respect to other crucial elements, such as confidentiality, emergency arbitrator provisions, default number of arbitrators, scrutiny of awards and fees.

Confidentiality Many arbitration rules impose an express duty of confidentiality on both parties and arbitrators, while the WIPO rules contain more extensive confidentiality provisions.

Other institutions, such as the ICC, only provide for the privacy of the hearing and the award, absent a partys request for an order concerning the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings.

Emergency arbitrator Most modern rules provide for emergency arbitrators to issue urgent interim relief even before the arbitral tribunal is constituted (ICC, LCIA, ICDR, WIPO, SCAI, SIAC, SCC, HKIAC and CIETAC).

Default number of arbitrators The majority of arbitral rules provide for the appointment of a sole arbitrator, but some provide for a three-member tribunal (CIETAC), while others contain no presumption at all (SCC and HKIAC).

Specialized roster of arbitrators Some institutions maintain a database of specialized arbitrators for certain kinds of disputes, such as IP and patent disputes (WIPO, LCIA, ICDR, SIAC and HKIAC), while others, like the ICC, do not maintain a public roster of arbitrators.

Scrutiny of awards The ICC, SIAC, and CIETAC rules provide for the review of draft arbitral awards before they are released to the parties to ensure proper form and that the tribunal has dealt with all issues before it, but without interfering with the merits of the arbitrators decision or affecting the independence of the arbitral tribunal.

Fee-shifting provisions Most institutional rules give arbitrators discretion to decide the final allocation of arbitration costs between the parties (ICC, ICDR, SIAC, HKIAC, WIPO and SCC), while others adopt the default rule that the unsuccessful party shall bear the arbitration costs (LCIA, SCAI, PCA and CIETAC).

Arbitrators and administrative fees Arbitral institutions assess fees by reference to the amount in dispute (ICC, SCAI, ICDR, SIAC, SCC, WIPO and CIETAC) or to the time spent on the case (LCIA and PCA), or they leave the parties the option to select one of these two cost regimes (HKIAC).

The choice of an arbitral institution is one of the key considerations in drafting an arbitration clause.  

Fortunately, there are many capable arbitral institutions throughout the world that can administer international arbitrations.  

If parties do not believe institutional administration is necessary, or they want a bespoke arbitration regime for the needs of a transaction, they can agree to ad hoc arbitration.  

Parties selecting ad hoc arbitration should, however, consider if any additional protections are needed given the lack of institution backing (e.g., designation of an appointing authority should there be a problem in selecting arbitrators)."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for M&A Deals Goes Live,"The European Unions new screening tool for third-country subsidies introduces a novel form of mergers & acquisitions scrutiny.

Companies worldwide need to account for timing and execution risks arising from this system when M&A deals involve businesses with activities in the EU.

The EUs Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) applies to deals agreed after 12 July 2023, and the European Commission (EC) now has the power to ex officio investigate potentially distortive subsidies granted by third countries.

The FSR takes full effect on 12 October 2023, when certain M&A deals must be notified, reviewed and cleared before they can be consummated.

Like familiar systems of premerger control, the FSR establishes mandatory notification requirements, backed by standstill obligations, and compliance is subject to potentially severe financial penalties.

Notwithstanding the fact that the final Implementing Regulation (FSR-IR) streamlined the requirements of notification  consistent with overwhelming consultation feedback  the reporting burden on firms will be significant.

Compliance with the FSR should therefore form an early and integral part of M&A transaction planning.

Whats the purpose of the new system?

The goal of the FSR is to level the playing field with respect to unfair advantages that third-country (non-EU) government subsidies may cause in the context of M&A deals.

A simple example would be an acquirer outbidding rivals in a controlled M&A auction by offering a superior acquisition price supported by state-backed financing that does not reflect market terms.

But the notion of a subsidy is broad, and many more nuanced scenarios also are in scope.

The FSR is relevant to all companies that are active in the EU  not only state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or firms that have benefited from substantial direct third-country support.

EU-based firms also are affected, to the extent that they (or subsidiaries anywhere in the world) have obtained foreign subsidies.

As a matter of course, the EC must authorize all state aids by EU Member States before such schemes are put into effect.

The EU clearly does not have the same powers with respect to schemes outside the EU, but the FSR aims to address competitive distortions, within the EUs internal market, of such foreign subsidies.

That is a tall order, especially in the present economic climate, when governments worldwide (including major EU trade partners) are introducing lavish support schemes for key sectors, such as energy, transport and technology.

The FSR supplements  and will be applied in parallel to  the EUs existing regulatory toolbox for M&A and competition scrutiny, including merger control and foreign direct investment, as well as EU rules on state aid and public procurement.

The FSR also includes specific rules for participation in public procurement tenders.

What deals are in scope for review?

The transaction types that are in scope are the same as for the EU Merger Regulation    concentrations  essentially acquisitions of control, mergers and the creation of full-function joint ventures.

Such transactions must be notified to the EC for prior approval when two thresholds are satisfied: EU-wide turnover exceeding 500 million euros, in the most recent financial year, that is attributable to the target being acquired, one of the merging parties or the joint venture.

Third-country financial contributions exceeding 50 million euros, in the three years preceding the deal, that are awarded to the transaction parties, taken together.

The notion of a financial contribution is key, but it is not comprehensively defined.

The FSR gives examples of certain categories of contributions: the transfer of funds or liabilities, foregoing of revenues otherwise due, and the provision of goods or services  to name a few  where the benefit was provided by a third-country government or entity."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for M&A Deals Goes Live,"This is a broad notion indeed, and all contributions received by the parties should be considered, even though they may not have been tracked in the ordinary course of business.

Beyond the specified notification requirements, the EC may also launch an ex officio investigation, if it considers that a foreign subsidy  irrespective of its value  could distort competition in the EU.

What does the review involve?

A transaction that is notifiable under the FSR is subject to a standstill obligation, such that it cannot close unless and until the EC clears the deal.

The maximum penalty, in case of failure to comply with that obligation, is a fine of up to 10% of the firms aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year.

The review process and timeline align generally with the EU Merger Regulation: An initial phase I review of 25 working days (WDs) that may be followed by an in-depth phase II review of 90 105 WDs.

The review may be suspended if the parties fail to respond fully to an information request.

A notable difference, compared to the merger review process, is that any remedy commitments are formally addressed only in phase II.

Parties are encouraged to engage early on in confidential prenotification discussions with the EC to ensure that the submission of the filing is deemed complete as promptly as possible in order for the clock to start.

The EC may request additional information during the review.

Prenotification contacts also are the appropriate forum to discuss any waivers with respect to information to be included in the filing.

A designated notification form (Form FS-CO) specifies the information to be provided on the parties, the transaction and the relevant financial contributions, as well as an analysis of their impact.

As with respect to notifications under the EU Merger Regulation, many transaction-specific and internal business documents also are to be annexed.

Different levels of detail are required for different categories of third-country financial contributions.

Extensive information is to be included in respect of any contributions categorized among those deemed most likely to be distortive (see below), with a view to focus resources on areas of potential concern.

Other financial contributions are subject to a lesser reporting burden.

When is a third-country subsidy problematic  and is there a fix?

As mentioned, the jurisdictional and notification requirements reference third-country financial contributions.

But the actual review concerns subsidies, meaning financial contributions by a third country that, directly or indirectly, confer benefits on a party conducting business in the EU and are selective in the sense that they are limited as to the number of beneficiaries or industries.

This is a broad notion.

A foreign subsidy is deemed to be distortive of the EUs internal market if it is liable to improve the competitive position of an undertaking in the internal market, and where, in doing so, that foreign subsidy actually or potentially negatively affects competition.

This assessment depends on several factors, including the subsidys amount, nature, purpose and any conditions attached to it.

The following rules of thumb can be discerned:

Naturally, factors pertaining to the beneficiarys situation also are important, including the competitive landscape of the markets, the sectors involved, and the nature and degree of the beneficiarys presence in the EU.

The assessment ultimately involves a balancing test between, on the one hand, the competitive advantage conferred by any distortion caused by the subsidy and, on the other hand, any positive effects for the relevant subsidized economic activity, as well as broader policy considerations.

The parties may propose remedies to address any actual or potential distortions arising from foreign subsidies, but formal offers may only be put forward during an in-depth review."
Cooley,EU’s Foreign Subsidies Check for M&A Deals Goes Live,"The parties may propose remedies to address any actual or potential distortions arising from foreign subsidies, but formal offers may only be put forward during an in-depth review.

Any remedies should be tailored to the harm and may, for instance, involve: Foreign subsidy repayment.

Corporate governance commitments.

Access or licensing commitments.

Capacity or market presence reductions.

Investment restraints.

Divestment commitments.

Dissolution of concentration.

The EC may decide to accept remedies that parties propose, but it also may impose other redressive measures that it deems necessary and proportionate to remedy the distortion fully and effectively.

Takeaways for dealmakers The new FSR adds complexity  for sellers and buyers alike  in devising regulatory strategies for M&A deals.

Immediate points of note are that: The FSR applies to deals agreed after 12 July 2023, and notifications are required for deals that close after 12 October 2023, if jurisdictional thresholds are satisfied.

The pre-transaction diligence requirements flowing from the FSR can be quite cumbersome.

Given their relevance during transaction negotiations, buyers and sellers will optimize negotiation positions by advance preparation.

By way of example: Companies need a system to track financial contributions and subsidies.

In an acquisition, information concerning all third-country financial contributions that a member of the acquirers and targets respective corporate groups obtained three years prior to a transaction.

That information would be necessary  in addition to more readily available turnover data  to determine whether the transaction meets the mandatory FSR notification requirements.

Where the acquisition triggers an FSR notification, the buyer and seller will need to ensure that the transaction documentation accounts for the timing and execution risks that follow from the ECs mandatory review  in addition to any reviews under merger control and foreign investment rules.

Any such risk arising from FSR review depends on whether the third-country financial contributions amount to foreign subsidies that distort the internal market.

By undertaking a comprehensive feasibility analysis, the transaction parties can draw the necessary documentation consequences for transaction risk, cooperation and timing.

Potential beneficiaries of subsidies may do the same individually to assess FSR risk in M&A settings.

Regulatory strategies also should include proactive engagement with the EC, as in merger review, in confidential prenotification contacts.

Given the novelties of the FSR review system, it is imperative to allow for such discussions when deals qualify for review.

Cooley,GP-Led Secondary Transactions and Continuation Funds,"Secondary transactions led by a general partner (GP) have gained significant traction as an alternative liquidity solution for venture capital managers managing out their older vintage funds with valuable  but often illiquid  assets.

Aside from commercial considerations of valuation and terms on fund economics, as well as having to navigate and manage for significant conflict of interest issues, which are obviously key considerations, venture capital managers must also take into account various structuring considerations to ensure limited partner (LP) alignment, while preserving the long-term value of the funds assets.

In addition, US tax considerations for a venture funds LPs, which initially may be overlooked by non-US GPs, also play a critical role in determining a successful outcome for these transactions.

We highlighted below a number of options GPs can consider when crafting a compelling proposition for existing LPs and attracting new investors to participate in a secondary transaction.

Option 1  Restructuring through LP transfers An LP transfer is the classic approach for funding secondary transactions  i.e., a buyer acquiring an existing LPs interest and assuming obligations to meet additional capital calls.

Illustrative structure chart for option 1 With the existing fund coming close to its term, the fund manager may offer liquidity solutions to its LPs, while holding on to the remaining assets of the fund for longer without forming a new fund vehicle, by doing the following: Causing the amendment of the existing funds governing document to extend the fund term and reset fund economics (e.g., fee and carry structure), as appropriate.

Cashing out existing LPs by facilitating transfers of fund interests, including through GP-led tender offers, and offering fund interests to new investors (optional).

Continuing to manage the existing funds remaining assets, making follow-on and/or new portfolio investments.

Key US tax considerations for option 1 The transferor is treated as disposing of the partnership interest in a taxable transaction, recognizing gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the transferee pays for the interest and the transferors adjusted tax basis in the interest being sold (often referred to as outside basis).

The transferees outside basis in the interest it acquires initially equals the price the transferee pays for the interest.

The transferee inherits the transferors book and tax capital accounts, as well as the transferors share of the existing funds tax basis in its assets (often referred to as inside basis).

This almost always results in a disparity between the transferees outside and inside basis.

If the existing fund vehicle makes (or has previously made) an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, the existing fund will make a special basis adjustment that is intended to eliminate the disparity between the transferees outside and inside basis,which will generally be beneficial to the transferee.

Option 2  Restructuring through preferredequity Restructuring through preferred equity could take place either at the portfolio company level or at the fund level.

First, lets examine portfolio company-level restructuring, which well label as option 2(a).

Funding is provided to the underlying portfolio companies (and indirectly to the existing funds investors) through preferred instruments that subordinate interests in common equity held by the LPs of the existing fund.

Illustrative structure chart for option 2(a)

The typical restructuring steps taken are as follows: In-kind contribution of a portion of the existing funds assets to a newly established special purpose vehicle (NewCo) in exchange for equity interest in the NewCo.

The underlying assets so transferred could be a strip (e.g., a particular percentage) of portfolio securities then held by the existing fund."
Cooley,GP-Led Secondary Transactions and Continuation Funds,"The underlying assets so transferred could be a strip (e.g., a particular percentage) of portfolio securities then held by the existing fund.

Cash contribution by providers of liquidity in exchange for preferred equity interest in the NewCo, which could be achieved through the NewCos adoption of a multi-tier distribution waterfall with preferred returns.

The NewCo then distributes cash generated by the preferred equity instrument to the existing fund, achieving liquidity for its LPs.

Compared to an outright strip sale of portfolio assets, by structuring the deal this way, the existing funds LPs retain future upsides of the underlying assets held by the NewCo, so long as preferred return with respect to the providers of liquidity has been achieved.

Key US tax considerations for option 2(a)

The contribution of cash by preferred equity providers and the existing funds assets to the NewCo generally will be nontaxable to the NewCo, the preferred equity providers and the existing fund.

The distribution of cash from the existing fund to an LP will be taxable to that existing LP to the extent the cash distributed exceeds the LPs outside basis and will reduce the existing LPs outside basis.

Now, lets examine a structuring alternative, option 2(b), for the preferred equity providers to fund the existing fund directly (which requires amendment of the existing funds operating agreement/fund-level LP consents) and not through any intermediate vehicle.

Illustrative structure chart for option 2(b) Under option 2(b), LPs of the existing fund will usually have multiple ways to participate in the fund restructuring, as follows:

Selling its entire LP interest in the existing fund and being cashed out.

Staying as an LP holding common equity interest in the existing fund and agreeing to the new fund economics (and governance terms, potentially).

Subscribing for preferred equity interest in addition to its existing common equity portion.

Key US tax considerations for option 2(b)

Selling LPs generally are treated the same as in option 1 i.e., they would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale of their interest.

Option 3  Restructuring through annex fund

The fund manager may establish a new fund vehicle to invest in portfolios of the existing fund.

Existing LPs have the option to participate in the annex fund, or to remain invested in the existing fund without participating in the annex fund.

Illustrative structure chart for option 3 The main restructuring purpose here is to provide liquidity to the underlying portfolio of the existing fund, and the valuation of such portfolio is key to the transaction.

Combined with GP-led secondary transactions (i.e., LP transfers to investors looking to subscribe into the annex fund), this option could also provide liquidity to existing nonparticipatingLPs.

Key US tax considerations for option 3 Contributions of cash by the existing participating LPs and new investors to the annex fund generally are nontaxable to the existing participating LPs, new investors and the annex fund.

GP-led secondary transactions would generally give rise to the same tax consequences as in option 1 and option 2(b) i.e., selling LPs would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale of their interest.

Option 4  Restructuring through continuation fund As a fund is coming close to its end of term, the fund manager usually looks around for (best) buyer bids available for liquidation of fund assets, which, in a market short of liquidity or in the event that the fund manager believes that the value of certain portfolio assets have not been fully extracted, could lead to the formation of a continuation vehicle, often managed by the same fund manager or its affiliates.

Illustrative structure chart for option 4 Formation/fundraising of a continuation vehicle and purchase of the existing funds underlying assets by the continuation vehicle usually take place in parallel."
Cooley,GP-Led Secondary Transactions and Continuation Funds,"To provide additional liquidity and flexibility, LP transfers may be combined with the offering of an annex fund, and preferred equity may also be combined with GP-led secondary transactions (e.g., acquisition of continuation fund interest by a preferred equity provider, or the transfer of continuation fund interests to the existing fund in partial consideration for the existing funds assets, followed by a distribution of those interests to the rolling LPs).

Depending on negotiation leverage, a fund manager may be able to structure the offering of its continuation vehicle concurrently with a new fund raised by such fund manager  i.e., a stapled transaction (especially given the liquidity its existing LPs are about to obtain through the secondary deal).

Key US tax considerations for option 4 Depending on the structure of the transaction, transfer of existing fund assets to the continuation fund is generally treated as a partnership merger in which the existing fund LPs may recognize gain or loss.

The rolling LPs contribution of cash to the continuation fund for continuation fund interests (or receipt of continuation fund interests distributed by the existing fund) is generally nontaxable to the rolling LPs and the continuation fund.

Conclusion GP-led secondary transactions are highly tailor-made, as the facts and circumstances of each particular fund and its portfolio will dictate the proper structure and terms of any GP-led secondary deal.

With that said, no matter what structure is used, one of the key transactional goals and concerns is to minimize tax leakage.

Also, it is more often than not the case that the restructuring plans give rise to material conflict of interest concerns and require the fund manager to obtain approval from the LP advisory committee and/or the LPs.

Cooley,Information Exchange With Competitors,"There are many situations where you may need to share information with your competitors  for example, in the context of research and development agreements, joint commercialization agreements or joint bidding arrangements.

Competition laws recognize that the exchange of information between competitors may be beneficial.

However, you must be careful that any exchanges of information do not breach competition law and expose the company to significant fines, reputational damage and/or potential private damages actions, in addition to criminal sanctions for individuals.

Competition concerns arise when the information exchanged reduces strategic uncertainty, making it easier for competitors to predict one anothers behaviour and adjust their own.

For example, if competitors exchange competitively sensitive information on future prices, this could ultimately lead to price fixing in the market  a form of cartel that is strictly prohibited under competition law.

Information is particularly sensitive and more likely to cause concerns when shared, especially if it is nonpublic and relates to strategic commercial decisions, such as current or future pricing, changes in production volumes or product launches.

In practice, assessing what can be legally exchanged is not always easy.

Below we set out some first principles and practical examples to bear in mind.

The form of the exchange does not matter.

Competitively sensitive information can be exchanged privately (e.g., in a meeting), publicly (via published material) or through a third party, such as a trade association.

No written or express agreement is required.

A single meeting or conversation is enough to break competition law.

There is no need for bilateral exchanges  one-way communication is enough.

The mere attendance at a meeting where a rival discloses its future pricing plans is enough, even if there was no response from another attendee and even where there is no explicit agreement between the attendees.

The impact on the market is presumed.

If you receive unsolicited competitively sensitive information from a competitor  whether in an email or a single meeting  it is presumed that you have accepted and acted on the information in breach of competition law, unless there is a clear statement that the information is not wanted or rejected.

The fact that  All our competitors are doing the same or I did not know that this type of behaviour was illegal  is no excuse.

Proportionality is key.

If the information exchange occurs for a procompetitive reason, it may not be problematic.

Nonetheless, the amount and type of information exchanged must be proportionate to the procompetitive objective pursued.

What types of information exchanges may be prohibited?

There is no exhaustive or definitive list of the types of information that can or cannot be shared with competitors.

However, the table below summarises the sorts of information that carry a higher risk versus a lower risk of breaching competition law.

For example, exchanging information regarding current and future business activities carries a higher risk than exchanging historical information.

High risk Low risk Confidential, nonpublic information Public information Individualised information Aggregated and anonymised information Current or future commercial information on: Company pricing, including actual prices, costs, discounts, profit margins and rebates.

Marketing and business strategy.

Output and sales information, including production capacities, volumes, turnovers and market shares.

Research and development programs.

Historical information Particular customer or supplier information General industry trends Practical tips for exchanging information with a competitor Always decide your commercial strategy independently.

Ensure employees are trained on what they can and cannot discuss with competitors.

At meetings with competitors: Have a preset agenda that (ideally) has been reviewed by a lawyer."
Cooley,Information Exchange With Competitors,"Ensure employees are trained on what they can and cannot discuss with competitors.

At meetings with competitors: Have a preset agenda that (ideally) has been reviewed by a lawyer.

Participate only at the formal meeting and avoid informal gatherings before and after the meeting.

Ensure someone takes minutes of the meetings.

Discuss only noncompetitively sensitive information.

If you have concerns that a particular discussion may be infringing competition law, request the discussion to stop, and if it does not, leave immediately and request that the minutes reflect your departure.

After the meeting, review the minutes.

Email communications: If you receive an email with competitively sensitive information, it is important that you distance yourself from the information immediately.

Do so by sending an immediate email reply to confirm that you have not read it or acted upon the information and tell the sender to refrain from sending such information ever again.

Do not distribute the information further unless it is to notify a lawyer about your concerns."

Cooley,SDNY Rules Ripple’s XRP Token Was – and Was Not – a Security,"On July 13, 2023, US District Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple Labs token, XRP, was a security when sold to institutional investors and not a security when sold to retail investors using digital asset exchanges or when used for service providers.

Judge Torress analysis in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Ripple Labs, Inc. relied on the Supreme Courts Howey test, which outlines the standard for an investment contract and, therefore, a security under federal securities laws.

Judge Torres rejected many of the novel arguments made by Ripple but ultimately decided in its favor, except for one category of token sales.

This alert looks solely at the courts analysis of XRP as an investment contract.

In SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. , the Supreme Court stated that an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act [of 1933] means a contract, transaction or scheme.

In analyzing whether XRP, a digital asset, was an investment contract, Judge Torres looked at the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding each offer and sale of the underlying asset.

The subject itself is not necessarily a security, but how it is used in the circumstances determines whether it meets the Howey requirements.

The Howey test consists of three criteria that must be met for an investment contract to be considered a security: It must be an investment of money.

The investment must be in a common enterprise.

There must be an expectation of profits derived primarily from the efforts of others.

Background The SEC commenced its action against Ripple on December 22, 2020, alleging that the company engaged in various sales and distributions of XRP in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

The sale and distribution of XRP by Ripple fit into three categories between 2013 and 2020:

Institutional Sales, which were primarily to institutional buyers, hedge funds and on-demand liquidity customers, pursuant to written contracts for which Ripple received $728 million in proceeds.

Programmatic Sales, which were blind bid/ask transactions on digital asset exchanges for which Ripple received $757 million in proceeds.

Other Distributions, which were a form of payment for services under written contracts for which Ripple recorded $609 million in consideration other than cash.

The offers and sales of XRP by two of Ripples executives  Christian Larsen (former CEO and current executive chairman) and Bradley Garlinghouse (current CEO)  were categorized as ""Programmatic Sales,"" which totaled $450 million and $150 million, respectively.

The decision Before the court were the parties cross-motions for summary judgment.

Weve outlined the courts conclusions below.

1. Ripples Institutional Sales of XRP constituted unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Securities Act Section 5 First, the court rejected the defendants argument that all investment contracts must contain three essential ingredients: (1) a contract between a promoter and an investor that establishe[s] the investors rights as to an investment, which contract (2) impose[s] post-sale obligations on the promoter to take specific actions for the investors benefit and (3) grant[s] the investor a right to share in profits from the promoters efforts to generate a return on the use of investor funds.

The court looked at the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the offers and sales of XRP to institutional buyers and concluded that they constituted investment contracts.

The court found that the institutional buyers had made an investment of money.

Applying the horizontal commonality test, the court found they had done so in a common enterprise because the institutional investors assets were pooled, and their fortunes were tied to the fortunes of other investors and the success of the enterprise."
Cooley,SDNY Rules Ripple’s XRP Token Was – and Was Not – a Security,"Finally, the court found that the institutional investors had a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of Ripple.

2. Ripples Programmatic Sales of XRP didnt constitute offer and sale of investment contracts The court found that the Programmatic Sales did not satisfy Howey s third prong because such buyers could not reasonably have expected that Ripple would use the proceeds of the sales to improve the XRP ecosystem and thereby cause an increase in the price of XRP.

Citing SEC v. Telegram Group Inc. , the court stated that this inquiry turns on the promises and offers made to investors and not each buyers motivation, making the blind bid/ask aspect of the transactions a key consideration.

Ripple did not make any promises or offers because it did not know who was buying the XRP, and the purchasers did not know who was selling it.

Even if the motive was to turn a profit, these buyers did not derive that expectation from Ripples efforts (as opposed to other factors, such as general cryptocurrency market trends) for that same reason.

The court further differentiated the Programmatic Sales from Institutional Sales based on the sophistication of the buyers and other factors, such as the contractual provisions and promotional materials relating to the Institutional Sales.

3.

Ripples Other Distributions didnt constitute offer and sale of investment contracts ""Other Distributions"" did not satisfy Howey s first prong requiring an investment of money as part of the transaction or scheme.

The court, citing International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel , stated that a buyer must give up some tangible and definable consideration in exchange for the security.

Here, the record showed an inverse of this relationship, where Ripple paid out XRP to the service providers and never received payments from those XRP distributions.

Significance

Although this decision likely will be appealed, it provides stakeholders with a fresh perspective on the offer and sale of digital assets.

Companies with ongoing commercial projects now have support for the position that not all digital assets are securities.

To avoid the characterization of a token as a security, a token issuer would nonetheless still have to ensure that the sale does not satisfy the Howey elements, similar to the analysis the court went through with the Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions of XRP.

If the project is raising money in a manner similar to the Institutional Sales, securities laws limitations would likely apply, at least until such time as there is rulemaking or legislation providing otherwise."
Cooley,Draft Revised Merger Guidelines Foreshadow More Aggressive Antitrust Enforcement,"On July 19, 2023, the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission released draft revised merger guidelines in an effort to support the Biden administrations aggressive antitrust enforcement agenda.

The draft guidelines, which are subject to public comment for 60 days, spell out novel theories of harm that the Biden DOJ and FTC have pursued in recent enforcement actions and speeches.

Of particular note, the draft guidelines: Lower the concentration thresholds, and introduce a 30% combined share threshold, to trigger a presumption that a merger is anticompetitive.

Create a structural presumption of unlawfulness for vertical mergers when a firm controls 50% or more of a related market such that it could foreclose rivals access to a related product on competitive terms.

Seek to prevent the acquisition of potential competitors with a reasonable probability of entering a concentrated market.

Focus on roll-up strategies and serial acquisitions.

Address competition in labor markets to block mergers that may result in lower wages, benefits or layoffs.

Highlight concerns raised by minority or partial ownership.

Address multisided platforms to limit Supreme Court precedent requiring analyses of all sides of such platforms.

The proposed guidelines would replace separate horizontal and vertical merger guidelines.

Government merger guidelines, first issued in 1968 and last revised in 2010 and 2020, have historically been valuable tools explaining the governments analysis and influential to the extent they have been perceived as persuasive, though not binding on courts.

According to the DOJ , [t]he goal of this update is to better reflect how the agencies determine a mergers effect on competition in the modern economy.

It remains to be seen whether these guidelines, if made final in their current form, will have such influence, as they attempt to introduce new structural presumptions while relying on older case law and ignoring more recent precedents.

Unlike recently announced changes to the Hart-Scott-Rodino form , which will only be effective once the agencies issue a final rule, these proposed guidelines will not be made final for several months, after the public comment period.

However, as they are reflective of the DOJ and FTCs current thinking, companies should be taking them into account immediately with regard to proposed transactions.

Highlights from draft revised merger guidelines The draft guidelines purport to analyze how does competition present itself and how might a proposed transaction risk lessening that competition substantially now or in the future.

The guidelines spell out 13 principles that the DOJ and FTC may use when analyzing a transaction.

Weve provided some key highlights below.

1. Adopting lower market share and concentration thresholds to support presumption of harm The draft guidelines lower the market concentration thresholds that trigger a presumption by the agencies that a merger is anticompetitive.

Concentration remains measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI, defined as the sum of the squares of individual firms market shares), but the threshold would be reduced from 2,500 to 1,800, from which the threshold was raised in 2010 to reflect actual enforcement more accurately.

The draft guidelines also adopt a new 30% market share threshold, to stop mergers said to present an impermissible threat of undue concentration regardless of the overall level of market concentration.

Anticompetitive presumption 2010 horizontal merger guidelines 2023 draft revised merger guidelines Indicator 1 HHI greater than 2,500 HHI greater than 1,800 and HHI greater than 100

Indicator 2 N/A Combined share greater than 30% and HHI greater than100"
Cooley,Draft Revised Merger Guidelines Foreshadow More Aggressive Antitrust Enforcement,"Indicator 2 N/A Combined share greater than 30% and HHI greater than100

While using market concentration statistics as a proxy to assess the competitive impact of a transaction is not new, the draft guidelines lower the concentration threshold and place more emphasis on the merging parties combined market share as an indicator that may independently support a presumption that a merger is anticompetitive.

In recent years, the guidelines thresholds largely have been understood to establish safe harbors and the starting point for analysis, not as creating strong presumptions.

The draft guidelines endorse a more rigid reliance on these indicators, and they state that any merger meeting the relevant indicators triggers a structural presumption that the merger may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly (i.e., the standard for when a merger is anticompetitive under the Clayton Act).

In contrast, the 2010 guidelines provided that mergers meeting the relevant thresholds will be presumed to be likely to enhance market power, but noted that the purpose of these thresholds is not to provide a rigid screen to separate competitively benign mergers from anticompetitive ones.

The draft guidelines focus on whether the firms have engaged in head-to-head competition, but also advise that a merger that eliminates even a relatively small competitor creates undue risk that the merger may substantially lessen competition.

Even where a market is not highly concentrated, the revised guidelines still attribute risk of anticompetitive effects in markets that are moderately concentrated (which, for example, includes a market with 10 firms all having a roughly 10% share).

If adopted, the change could lead the agencies to investigate transactions that would have been previously deemed low risk.

2. Adding structural presumption, new theories of harm for vertical transactions The draft guidelines introduce a 50% bright-line rebuttable presumption for when a vertical merger should be deemed unlawful.

The guidelines reason that there is a sufficient basis to conclude a merger is anticompetitive where a combined firm will hold more than 50% share in a market for a product, service, or customer that rivals use to compete (i.e., a related product or service).

The revised guidelines identify two theories of competitive harm: Where the combined firm may have the ability and incentive to raise rivals costs, foreclosing or limiting rivals access.

Where the transaction would facilitate access to rivals nonpublic competitively sensitive information.

Importantly, it is unclear whether the guidelines new structural presumption and theories for vertical mergers will gain traction with the courts.

The structural presumption in particular has no support in case law.

To date, courts have largely rejected the governments efforts to block vertical mergers, in part because the theories of harm in such cases are more abstract  and the benefits are often clearer than in mergers between competitors.

3. Protecting potential competition The draft guidelines suggest the antitrust agencies will increase efforts to block acquisitions by dominant firms of nascent and potential competitors.

The draft defines a firm as dominant if it has a 30% or higher market share (following the European Unions approach to mergers) or can take unilateral action to raise price, reduce quality, or impose favorable terms that it could not achieve but for its market position.

The draft defines a firm as a nascent competitor if it could grow into a significant rival, facilitate other rivals growth, or otherwise lead to a reduction in dominance.

The guidelines advise that a merger involving a firm with a 30% share will get a close look, and the higher the market concentration, the lower the probability of entry that gives rise to concern."
Cooley,Draft Revised Merger Guidelines Foreshadow More Aggressive Antitrust Enforcement,"The guidelines advise that a merger involving a firm with a 30% share will get a close look, and the higher the market concentration, the lower the probability of entry that gives rise to concern.

The government is thereby signaling an intent to seek to block mergers involving even early stage research and development and pipeline products in highly concentrated markets by firms with a large market share.

Whether this approach will gain traction in the courts, which have been skeptical of potential competition claims, is unclear.

4. Entrenching a dominant position The draft guidelines suggest strict scrutiny for mergers involving a dominant incumbent (e.g., with 30% or higher market share), whether the merger is characterized as horizontal or vertical.

The guidelines advise that concerns from mergers involving dominant firms can arise in any way that may entrench or extend the dominant position.

The guidelines focus on bundling that may make it more difficult for customers to switch away from the dominant firms product or service.

5. Roll-up strategies and serial acquisitions

The draft guidelines call out serial acquisitions and roll-up strategies as warranting particular scrutiny, with the agencies asserting that they may analyze historical evidence of acquisition practices of merging parties both in the markets at issue and in other markets, to reveal any overall strategic approach to serial acquisitions.

While the concept that the agencies will review the current transaction in light of past acquisitions, both by the parties and by others in the industry, is not new, the guidelines go further by providing that the agencies will investigate pattern[s] or strateg[ies] of multiple small acquisitions  even if no single acquisition on its own would  (emphasis added) be anticompetitive, taking into account even unconsummated acquisitions and future plans.

The guidance also suggests that an acquirers history of consolidating other industries would inform the analysis.

6.

Assessing harm to labor markets The draft guidelines for the first time set forth how the agencies will assess the competitive effects of a merger in labor markets.

The revisions indicate that the government will challenge mergers that may substantially lessen competition for workers, including through lower wages, slower wage growth, diminished benefits or working conditions, or workplace quality.

Just as defining a relevant product or service market has been a necessary predicate to analyzing the lawfulness of mergers in output product and service markets, the revisions contemplate defining labor input markets.

The guidelines advocate that labor market definitions account for alternative job opportunities by employers supplying the relevant type of labor, geographies based on worker preference, and employee willingness to switch jobs based on wage and nonwage related criteria.

The draft guidelines assert that labor markets are often relatively narrow based on unique characteristics, such as switching costs and worker needs and preferences.

We expect that that scrutiny likely will be greater where the merging firms employees have highly specialized skills (e.g., specialized engineering or technical skills) such that the merger may reduce the employment options for such employees.

7.

Concerns regarding minority or partial ownership The draft guidelines analyze minority or partial acquisitions largely as in the current guidelines, focusing on: Control or influence of the target firm.

The incentive to compete with the target firm.

Access to nonpublic competitively sensitive information that may facilitate coordination.

The draft guidelines include two notable expansions.

First, they suggest that even nonvoting interests may provide opportunities to prevent, delay, or discourage important competitive initiatives, or otherwise impact competitive decision making."
Cooley,Draft Revised Merger Guidelines Foreshadow More Aggressive Antitrust Enforcement,"First, they suggest that even nonvoting interests may provide opportunities to prevent, delay, or discourage important competitive initiatives, or otherwise impact competitive decision making.

Second, they suggest that in addition to coordination, a partial owner may use nonpublic competitively sensitive information to preempt or appropriate a rivals competitive business strategies for its own benefit.

The draft guidelines theorize that access can dampen the target firms incentives to innovate, thereby reducing competition between them over time.

8.

Assessing competition in deals involving multisided platforms For the first time, the draft guidelines address mergers involving multisided platforms  i.e., firms providing different products or services to two or more groups or sides that may benefit from each others participation  which include such diverse products as newspapers, magazines and television stations serving readers or viewers as well as advertisers, to ride-sharing platforms serving drivers and riders.

The agencies assert their intention to comprehensively account for harm to competition whether it is between platforms, on a platform, or to displace the platform.

The draft guidelines suggest that harm to competition between platforms may occur through: Elimination of head-to-head competition between platforms, including up-and-coming platforms with specialized technology or services.

The acquisition of platform participants.

The acquisition of firms facilitating participation on competing platforms.

The acquisition of firms providing inputs to competing platforms.

The draft guidelines highlight that self-preferencing as a harm to competition on platforms may occur when a platform operator acquires a platform participant.

Such an acquisition may raise conflicts with respect to advantaging the controlled participant vis--vis noncontrolled participants.

The guidelines also suggest harm to competition to displace a platform may occur by acquiring nonplatform firms that compete with less than the full platform (i.e., a service provided by the platform).

The draft guidelines attempt to cabin the Supreme Courts 2018 decision in Ohio v. American Express , which held that [e]valuating both sides of a two-sided transaction platform is  necessary to accurately assess competition, to platforms satisfying narrow criteria, to allow the agencies to assess only one side of a platform where evidence suggests a harm to competition on just one side of the platform.

Implications for dealmakers The draft guidelines reflect the Biden administrations efforts to expand and aggressively enforce the antitrust laws.

The draft follows the FTCs announcement of dramatic changes to the HSR form itself, and on the tail of lawsuits that push the boundaries of the existing law.

While there will no doubt be extensive comments submitted criticizing the draft revised guidelines, if past is prologue, final revised guidelines will be issued before the end of the Biden administration.

In the meantime, it is clear that the guidelines reflect the DOJ and FTCs current thinking regarding merger review and the theories that the agencies will pursue in investigations.

What level of influence the guidelines will have over the courts once issued, however, will remain an open question."
Cooley,"CFPB, European Commission Announce Cooperation to Strengthen Consumer Financial Protection","On July 17, 2023, US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra and Commissioner for Justice and Consumer Protection of the European Commission (EC) Didier Reynders published a joint statement announcing the beginning of an informal dialogue to take place at least once a year, focusing on strengthening consumer financial protection.

According to the statement, the dialogue is intended to address key challenges created by the increasing digitalization of financial products  from pricing and customer service to competition and privacy.

The agencies noted their growing concerns about the potential consumer protection risks tied to these developments by citing, for example, the increasing use of automated decision-making and artificial intelligence (AI), new products such as buy now, pay later offerings, and the role of Big Tech in digital payments.

The joint statement highlights that while policymakers are responding to these issues, the regulatory and enforcement agencies believe that more must be done in order to compete with the pace of evolving markets and consumer needs.

Key issues highlighted in joint statement The dialogue aims to facilitate better policy coordination and exchange of insights and experience on a range of financial consumer protection issues, some of which are outlined below.

Automated decision-making and processing of data in financial services Consistent with recent statements and publications by the CFPB  e.g., Chopras comments in May 2023 when he stated that the CFPB has been intensifying its AI regulation efforts as it has already started some work to continue to muscle up internally, and the CFPBs June 2023 spotlight analysis on AI chatbots in banking  the joint statement referenced concerns about transparency, financial privacy and fair lending as consumer protection risks.

New forms of credit, such as buy now, pay later products The bureau cites concerns about the over-consumption of new forms of credit and over-indebtedness of consumers  themes flagged repeatedly by the CFPB in connection with such products, including in its March 2023 consumer use survey .

Similarly, the EC adopted a legislative proposal in June 2021 to revise the existing Consumer Credit Directive to cover buy now pay later products and services, to ensure increased transparency and better consumer protection, resulting in higher consumer confidence.

Fair choice and access to financial services for unbanked and underbanked consumers Referencing themes of fair lending and equal access often cited by the bureau, the statement also identifies as consumers at risk those who want to protect their own data.

The statement aligns with the continued focus on more regulatory oversight as evidenced by the ECs proposed reform of the current European Union rules on Distance Marketing of Consumer Financial Services published in May 2022, which aims to bring EU regulation in line with the digitalized financial sector by strengthening consumer rights and fostering the cross-border provision of financial services in the single market.

Consumer protection risks created by Big Tech offering financial services The agencies listed several issues  data privacy and security, unfair competition, and financial stability  in committing to further dialogue focused on potential risks in Big Tech.

This too ties to concerns cited repeatedly by the CFPB, including its announcement of an inquiry into data brokers in March 2023 and the release of a report in June 2023 identifying issues with increased use of digital payment applications in the servicemember community.

Whats next?

The agencies are expected to meet at least once a year, with staff discussions, including bilateral meetings between senior staff and subject matter experts, and roundtables involving the appropriate stakeholders and industry representatives."
Cooley,"CFPB, European Commission Announce Cooperation to Strengthen Consumer Financial Protection","The joint statement also states that it is expected the dialogue will occur in parallel with other forms of cooperation and exchanges between the European Union and the United States on various digital and financial services policies and regulation.

The announcement further emphasizes the continued focus on these priority agenda items across borders, and the significant efforts and resources being dedicated to monitor, regulate, and enforce compliance in these areas.

Cooley,NYC Releases FAQ on City’s AEDT Law,"On June 29, 2023, the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) released an FAQ regarding the citys Automated Employment Decisions Tool (AEDT) law .

As we discussed in this October 2022 alert on proposed regulations and this May 2023 alert on final regulations , the AEDT law requires NYC employers (and employment agencies) to comply with extensive requirements before using an AEDT, including completing an independent bias audit of the tool and providing notice regarding the tool to candidates and employees.

The FAQ clarifies some important points regarding the law, which are outlined below.

AEDTs used in the city

The law applies only to employers that use an AEDT in the city.

The DCWP clarified that this means the law applies only where the job location involves working in an office in NYC, at least part time, or the job is fully remote, but the location associated with it is an office in NYC.

Unfortunately, the agency did not provide clarity on how employers should determine whether a remote position is associated with an office in NYC.

Outreach and recruitment to potential candidates The FAQ confirms that the law only applies when an AEDT is used to assess individuals who have actually applied for a specific position.

Thus, the law does not apply where an AEDT is used to scan a rsum bank, conduct outreach to potential candidates or invite applications.

Data requirements Historical data The FAQ clarifies that multiple employers can rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data of other employers if the employer provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the auditor conducting the audit, or it is the employers first time using the AEDT.

The FAQ also clarifies that there is no additional requirement that the companies providing historical data used the AEDT to hire or promote for the same type of position.

The FAQ points out, however, that if historical data is limited in any way, including to a specific region or time period, the audit should explain why.

Test data Test data can be used if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit (e.g., where an employer does not collect demographic data or has minimal historical data from its own use of an AEDT), and the required summary of audit results explains why test data was used and includes the source and description of the data.

The agency acknowledged it has not set requirements for test data to allow for flexibility and development of best practices in this rapidly developing field, and it has not set a specific requirement for statistical significance, leaving that determination up to the auditor.

Vendors may conduct bias audits The FAQ clarifies that a vendor can have an independent auditor conduct a bias audit of its tool or assist in the collection of data for use in conducting a bias audit.

However, while a vendor who created an AEDT is permitted to conduct a bias audit, the FAQ makes clear that these vendors are not responsible for the audit, and that employers bear the ultimate responsibility for ensuring a bias audit was done before using the tool.

Notice requirement The FAQ reminds employers that the laws notice requirements (unlike the audit requirement) apply only to employees and candidates who are NYC residents.

The agency clarified that notices provided in a written policy or procedure, or via an employers website, do not have to be position-specific.

Discrimination complaints The AEDT law does not require any specific actions based on the results of a bias audit.

However, individuals can complain to the agency regarding any violations of the law (e.g., an employers use of an AEDT without an audit and required notices), and the agency will refer any claims of discrimination (e.g., if the audit results indicate a disparate impact to individuals in protected categories) to the New York City Commission on Human Rights."
Cooley,NYC Releases FAQ on City’s AEDT Law,"Next steps The DCWP started enforcing this law as of July 5, 2023, and it is critical that employers using qualifying AEDTs comply with its requirements.

Employers that have not yet conducted a bias audit should not use an AEDT in hiring or promotion decisions until an audit has been completed.

Employers with bias audit results indicating potential disparate impact on individuals in protected categories should consult with counsel regarding best steps forward to mitigate risks."
Cooley,UK Government Publishes Second Annual Report on National Security and Investment Regime,"On 11 July 2023, the UK government published its second annual report on the operation of the UKs National Security and Investment (NSI) regime.

The report covers the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, making it the first report to cover a full year since the regime came into force on 4 January 2022.

Overall, the second annual report reaffirms the general conclusions from the first report published in June 2022 ( see Cooleys client alert coverage ) indicating that the regime appears to be operating well, with the vast majority of clearances obtained within the statutory time frame.

No penalties have been imposed for noncompliance, and there have been no criminal prosecutions or judicial reviews of decisions under the new regime.

Strikingly, however, over the past year, the government has intervened on 15 occasions, with the issue of final orders to block, unwind or impose conditions on acquisitions, which is higher than initially anticipated and higher than the intervention rate of other UK regulatory regimes, such as merger control.

Significant highlights from the report include: The government received 866 notifications during the period  671 mandatory, 180 voluntary and 15 retrospective validation applications.

This is fewer than the 1,000 to 1,830 notifications per year that the government had originally estimated.

The majority of notifications (60%) related to investment from the UK, followed by investment from the US, France, Canada and Germany.

Investment from China represented less than 5% of accepted notifications, confirming once again the buyer-agnostic approach of the UK regime.

The defence sector represented the highest proportion of mandatory and voluntary notifications, which is perhaps unsurprising given the breadth of the defence sector definition under the NSI rules, which stretches beyond nonmilitary applications.

Both mandatory and voluntary notifications were accepted as complete within four working days (median), with the vast majority (93%) of notifications cleared within a 30-working day review period.

Of the 866 notifications received, 43 were rejected, with the principal reason being use of the wrong form (i.e., parties using a mandatory notification form for a voluntary notification).

Sixty-five transactions were called in for further review, which again is slightly lower than the 70 to 95 call-ins originally estimated by the government.

The majority (37) of the call-ins emanated from mandatory notifications, 17 were from voluntary notifications, one transaction was called in after being retrospectively notified and 10 were called in from non-notified transactions.

The vast majority concerned targets active in the sectors of military and dual use (37%), defence (29%) and advanced materials (29%).

More than 40% of deals called in for further assessment related to investment from China, followed by 32% from the UK and 20% from the US.

Out of the 65 transactions called in, the government used the additional 45 working days to complete its assessment in more than 40% of transactions and an additional voluntary period (i.e., a time period agreed between the Secretary of State and the acquirer) in at least 15% of cases.

However, the reported time frame does not consider information notices and/or attendance notices that were issued during the assessment period, which will pause the clock, meaning that the actual time frame for assessing called-in transactions may be much longer in reality.

The vast majority (nearly 80%) of called-in transactions were cleared via a final notification (i.e., without remedies).

Fifteen final orders (remedies or prohibition decisions) were issued during the period, with five blocked and the remaining 10 subject to conditions (one of which was ultimately revoked).

The main sectors affected were military and dual use, communications, energy, defence, computing hardware and advanced materials."
Cooley,UK Government Publishes Second Annual Report on National Security and Investment Regime,"The main sectors affected were military and dual use, communications, energy, defence, computing hardware and advanced materials.

More than half of the final orders (eight out of 15) related to investment from China  four clearances subject to conditions and four prohibitions.

The fifth prohibition related to an investment from Russia.

The majority of the prohibitions (three out of five) were made after Grant Shapps became Business Secretary in October 2022.

What does this all show?

Reflective of our experience to date, the findings in the annual report show that the government is able to clear the vast majority of transactions within the initial 30-working day screening period and is not afraid to use its powers under the regime to call in non-notified transactions and/or to extend time periods.

Interestingly, in the last 12 months, 15 final orders were issued out of 866 notified transactions  i.e., less than 2% of cases.

The NSI regime therefore casts a wide net to ultimately intervene in a small minority of transactions.

This raises the question of whether the regime is correctly calibrated to achieve the governments stated objective of being as business-friendly and pro-investment as possible.

Moreover, while the regime is country-agnostic and applies equally to UK and foreign investments, it is striking that notifications from Chinese investors represented less than 5% of total notifications yet the majority of call-ins and four out of the five prohibition decisions.

This mismatch again raises the question of whether the regime effectively captures deals raising national security risks while otherwise preserving an open investment environment.

Finally, while the annual report provides some helpful additional information that goes beyond what is required under statute, it is noted that it does not discuss the governments approach to remedies, nor the substance of the NSI review process, including engagement with parties and third parties.

While this is not totally unsurprising, it means that there is still a long way to go to ensuring transparency and predictability about the regime.

Please reach out to us if you have any questions about the UK NSI regime.

Cooley,OFCCP Publishes CSAL for Construction Contractors,"In June 2023, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) published a new Corporate Scheduling Announcement List (CSAL) for construction contractors.

The latest CSAL identifies 250 federal contractors, federally assisted contractors and federally assisted subcontractors for compliance evaluations.

While the agency is not required to publish the CSAL, it serves as a courtesy notification to contractors who are selected by the OFCCP for a compliance evaluation.

According to the OFCCP, the CSAL provides contractors with notice to prepare for the compliance evaluation and encourages them to take advantage of the agencys compliance assistance offerings .

In addition to publishing the CSAL, the agency also released information regarding its methodology for selecting such contractors.

As per the OFCCP, the latest CSAL was developed by downloading federal construction contracts valued at more than $10,000 from the USAspending database , an official open data source of federal spending information, including information about federal awards, such as contracts, grants and loans.

The US Department of Transportation also provided relevant information to the OFCCP.

The agency then retained contract records with estimated start dates prior to May 15, 2022, and end dates after May 15, 2025, and removed contractors that were currently under review, in a monitoring period pursuant to a conciliation agreement or within the exemption period following a closed review.

The agency refined the resulting list by selecting those contractors with the highest aggregated contract value for all contract work performed in their assigned OFCCP district offices jurisdiction, making adjustments for staffing considerations.

Next steps Contractors should review the CSAL to see if they have been selected for a compliance evaluation.

Because contractors receiving CSALs are scheduled for audits in most cases, those appearing on the CSAL should begin to prepare for the audit as soon as possible, including by contacting counsel as appropriate.

The OFCCP notes that contractors who believe they should not have been selected for evaluation should send an email to the agencys scheduling mailbox ."
Cooley,EU’s 11th Sanctions Package Cracks Down on Sanctions Circumvention,"On 23 June 2023, the European Commission adopted its 11th package of sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus .

The new package focuses on tackling the circumvention of trade sanctions through third countries and increasing the number of items subject to the European Union transit ban.

The package also includes expansion of restrictions on the sale and export of certain goods and technology, as well as targeted sanctions against individuals and entities.

Below we set out the key measures of the package.

Combatting sanctions circumvention One critical element of this sanctions package is the introduction of a new anti-circumvention mechanism.

The EU has identified that several prohibited goods are still being sold to Russia via certain third countries, undermining the effectiveness of the prohibitions and sanctions in place.

In response to this ongoing issue, the EU has taken significant steps to introduce for the first time this anti-circumvention tool.

The tool enables EU Member States to restrict the sale, supply, transfer or export of specified sanctioned goods and technology to certain specified third countries to be listed in a new annex to Regulation 833/2014.

It also prohibits the provision of technical assistance, financial assistance and brokering services related to the listed goods, as well as the sale, licence or transfer of intellectual property rights or trade secrets relating to goods being sold to those countries.

The mechanism only applies to sensitive dual-use goods and technology  or goods and technology that might contribute to the enhancement of Russias military, technological or industrial capacities or to the development of Russias defence and security sector  which will be specified by the European Council.

These items must present a high and continuous risk of being sold, supplied, transferred or exported from third countries to Russia via the EU.

The third countries targeted by the mechanism have not yet been named but will be those identified by the European Council as having systematically and persistently failed to prevent the sale, supply, transfer or export to Russia of goods and technology exported from the EU.

The decision will be based on a technical analysis by the European Commission on the circumvention issues in question  including available trade data demonstrating that the alternative measures taken have been ineffective  and information about efforts carried out by the EU to address the matter with the third country that have been unsuccessful.

The EU will be required to seek the views of the government of the third country on the technical analysis and the intended remedial action.

The European Council will then only be able to adopt a decision after the final outreach to the third country has concluded.

However, there is no clarification regarding what is meant by high and continuous risk or systematically and persistently failed to prevent, so it remains to be seen how the mechanism will operate and be interpreted in practice.

The package also strengthens the anti-circumvention provisions in relation to individuals and entities subject to an asset freeze and travel ban.

The package includes a requirement for the competent authorities of EU Member States to process and exchange information without delay, particularly when they detect instances of a breach or circumvention  or attempts at a breach or circumvention of sanctions.

Sharpening existing tools Transit ban The EU has extended its transit ban to include goods and technology that might contribute to Russias military and technological enhancement or to the development of its defence and security sector, goods and technology for use in aviation or the space industry, and jet fuel and fuel additives.

This ban seeks to prevent such goods and technology from being transported from the EU via Russia to third countries."
Cooley,EU’s 11th Sanctions Package Cracks Down on Sanctions Circumvention,"This ban seeks to prevent such goods and technology from being transported from the EU via Russia to third countries.

Import-export controls and restrictions The package adds 87 entities to the list of entities that are military end-users, form part of Russias military-industrial complex, or that have commercial or other links with or otherwise support Russias defence and security sector.

These entities are targeted end-users to which deliveries of dual-use goods and technology  and goods and technology that might contribute to Russias military and technological enhancement  may not be authorised by the competent authorities under the relevant derogations.

A total of 585 entities are now covered by the restrictions, with the list covering entities registered in Hong Kong, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Syria and Armenia.

The package also expands the list of restricted items considered to contribute to Russias technological and military enhancement, or to the development of its defence and security sector, which are prohibited from being sold, supplied, transferred or exported to persons or entities in Russia or for use in Russia, to include: Electronic components.

Semiconductor materials.

Manufacturing and testing equipment for electronic integrated circuits and printed circuit boards.

Precursors to energetic materials and precursors to chemical weapons.

Optical components.

Navigational instruments.

Metals used in the defence sector and marine equipment.

Broadcasting The European Council has extended the suspension of broadcasting licences by five additional media outlets: RT Balkan, Oriental Review, Tsargrad, New Eastern Outlook and Katehon.

Roads and ports The package extends the prohibition to transport goods into the EU by road to trailers and semi-trailers registered in Russia, including when hauled by trucks registered outside of Russia.

In addition, vessels that engage in ship-to-ship transfers where the Member States competent authority has reasonable cause to suspect that the vessel is in breach of the Russian oil import ban or G7 coalition price cap will be prohibited from accessing EU ports and locks.

Any vessel suspected of illegally interfering with, switching off or otherwise disabling its shipborne automatic identification system at any point when transporting Russian oil also will be prohibited from accessing EU ports or locks.

Intellectual property rights There is now a ban on selling, licensing or transferring intellectual property rights and trade secrets to entities or persons in Russia or for use in Russia, where they are related to: Dual-use goods and technology.

Goods and technology that might contribute to Russias military and technological enhancement, or to the development of the defence and security sector.

Firearms and their components.

Items relating to oil pipelines and related equipment.

Goods and technology used in oil refining and liquefaction of natural gas.

Goods and technology for use in aviation or the space industry.

Maritime navigation goods and technology.

Luxury goods.

Goods that could contribute, in particular, to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities.

The intended aim of this provision is to prevent the sanctioned goods from being manufactured outside the EU and provided to Russia.

Energy

The package ends the temporary derogation previously granted to Germany and Poland for the supply of crude oil from Russia through the northern section of the Druzhba oil pipeline.

Other measures The existing ban on the export of luxury cars has been extended to include all new and secondhand cars with an engine size above 1,900 cubic centimetres, as well as all electric and hybrid vehicles."
Cooley,EU’s 11th Sanctions Package Cracks Down on Sanctions Circumvention,"Importers also now are required to provide evidence of the country of origin of iron and steel inputs used for processing of iron and steel products in a third country to ensure that such items imported to the EU from third countries do not incorporate inputs from Russia.

Individual listings: travel ban and asset freeze The EU has sanctioned a further 71 individuals and 33 entities, bringing the totals to 1,572 and 244, respectively.

The additions include  amongst others  senior Russian decision-makers, businesspersons, Russian IT companies providing critical technology and software to Russian intelligence, and banks operating in the occupied territories (MRB Bank and CMR Bank).

The individuals face a travel ban and an asset freeze in the EU.

Cooley,Supreme Court Clarifies Standard for Employers Evaluating Religious Accommodation Requests,"On June 29, 2023, the US Supreme Court issued a decision clarifying the standard employers must apply in considering an employees religious accommodation request under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

In Groff v. DeJoy , the justices unanimously ruled that Title VII requires employers who deny such requests to demonstrate that granting the request would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.

Under this heightened standard, it will be more difficult for employers  who have historically relied on a less burdensome more than a de minimis cost standard  to deny religious accommodation requests.

Case background Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian and former postal worker with the United States Postal Service (USPS), adhered to a religious belief that Sundays must be devoted to worship and rest.

Accordingly, when USPS required him and co-workers to deliver packages on Sundays, he sought a religious accommodation to avoid working on Sunday.

Although USPS redistributed some of Groffs Sunday shifts to other staff, it denied fully granting his requested accommodation on the basis that it would impose an undue hardship.

Groff was subject to progressive discipline for failing to work on Sundays, leading to his resignation.

Groff sued under Title VII, asserting that USPS could have accommodated his Sunday Sabbath practice without undue hardship on the conduct of [USPSs] business.

The district court dismissed the case and the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed, finding that it was bound by the Supreme Courts 1977 ruling in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison , which held that an employer need only show that it would bear more than a de minimis cost to demonstrate that a religious accommodation is an undue hardship under the law.

The Third Circuit held that this standard was not a difficult threshold to pass, as exempting Groff from Sunday work imposed a burden on his coworkers, disrupted the workplace and workflow, and diminished employee morale.

The Supreme Court granted Groffs petition for certiorari and heard oral arguments in the case in April 2023.

Ruling The Supreme Court revisited the Hardison standard and concluded that lower courts had erroneously interpreted that decision as requiring only a de minimis standard to establish an undue hardship.

Instead, the Supreme Court found that the decision referred repeatedly to substantial burdens, which better explains the correct standard.

Therefore, the ruling clarified that an employer demonstrates an undue hardship when the burden of granting a religious accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.

In its ruling, the Supreme Court held that the application of this heightened standard is a fact-specific inquiry, taking into account all relevant factors at hand, such as the particular accommodations at issue and their practical impact in light of the nature, size, and operating costs of an employer.

Notably, merely showing that an accommodation would impose some additional costs would not be sufficient; rather, the requisite burden or adversity must rise to an excessive or unjustifiable level.

The justices declined to apply the context-specific application of the undue hardship to the facts at hand, and instead remanded the case for the lower courts consideration.

The Groff ruling also made additional clarifications regarding recurring Title VII issues, in light of the heightened standard.

First, the ruling clarified that an accommodations impact on co-workers may be relevant to the analysis, but only insofar as it impacts the conduct of the employers business.

Indeed, the ruling stated that a hardship attributable to employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in general or to the notion of accommodating religious practice is not undue."
Cooley,Supreme Court Clarifies Standard for Employers Evaluating Religious Accommodation Requests,"Indeed, the ruling stated that a hardship attributable to employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in general or to the notion of accommodating religious practice is not undue.

Second, the Supreme Court held that Title VII requires an employer to reasonably accommodate an employees practice of religion  not merely address the reasonableness of a particular accommodation.

This includes consideration of other possible accommodations, such as voluntary shift swapping in the case of Groff .

Implications for employers In light of the heightened burden on employers in demonstrating an undue hardship, employers should very carefully and seriously consider requests for religious accommodations moving forward, including requests for exemption to employer vaccine mandates, grooming and dress policies, and work scheduling changes as in Groff .

Employer vaccine mandates will face particular scrutiny in light of this heightened burden and the significant increase in claims asserting religious discrimination arising out of such mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For example, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recently reported an increase of more than 600% in charges asserting religious discrimination in fiscal year 2022, versus fiscal year 2021, which the agency attributes to a significant increase in vaccine-related charges filed on the basis of religion.

Notably, these vaccine-related charges made up nearly 20% of the agencys 2022 charges (compared to 3.4% in 2021).

Blanket policies or practices uniformly denying accommodation requests are unlikely to pass muster under the clarified standard articulated by the Supreme Court.

Employers should prepare for the impact of the ruling by taking the following steps: Update applicable policies in compliance with the heightened standard with respect to religious accommodations.

Educate and train human resources professionals and management regarding the heightened standard, including reevaluating procedures used to evaluate such requests.

Evaluate possible accommodations other than the one requested by the employee, similar to an employers obligations for disability accommodation requests under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  while the Supreme Court expressly declined to adopt the ADA standard (which defines an undue hardship as an action requiring significant difficulty or expense in light of factors identified in the law), the practical effect of the ruling is that employers should treat such requests similarly to how they treat disability accommodation requests.

Document the impact of any requests on specific business operations, including costs  as the Supreme Court noted, such costs now must rise to an unjustifiable level, which may be more difficult for larger employers with more resources to demonstrate.

Refer to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions guidance as a helpful starting point in considering accommodations, but look out for revised guidance from the agency in accordance with the Groff decision.

Comply with all applicable laws for the jurisdiction(s) in which the business operates, as some state laws may impose even more protective standards, including those similar to, or the same as, the protective standard required under the ADA."
Cooley,UK Government Announces Upcoming Changes in Employment Law,"In this alert, weve highlighted some of the key developments in UK employment law and explain what they may mean for employers.

Limits on noncompetition restrictions The UK government has announced its intention to limit the duration of noncompete post-termination restrictions in employment contracts to a maximum of three months.

Noncompete covenants are designed to provide business protection to an employer by seeking to restrict a former employee from undertaking employment with a rival competitor for a defined period following the termination of their employment.

Noncompetition covenants are common in employment contracts with senior or key employees, and they have been upheld by the courts for durations of up to 12 months.

The governments intended statutory cap will impose a limit of three months.

At present, there are no details about when the statutory cap will be introduced or how it will work, but we will keep a close eye on developments.

The government is not proposing to reform an employers ability to use paid notice periods, gardening leave, or other forms of post-termination restrictions (such as nonsolicitation or non-dealing covenants), so there will remain a range of options for employers to protect their business.

Similarly, the statutory cap on noncompetes only will apply in the employment context and not, for example, to shareholder agreements.

Family-friendly rights Parents and unpaid carers will receive new employment law protections through legislation that has received Royal Assent, as outlined below.

The Carers Leave Act 2023 will give one week of unpaid leave per year for employees who are caring for a dependant with a long-term care need.

It came into force on 24 May 2023, but it requires further regulations setting out how the entitlement will work.

The regulations are expected to come into force no earlier than April 2024.

The Protection From Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act 2023 will extend current protection given to employees on maternity leave, shared parental leave or adoption leave.

Currently, employees on such types of leave have special protection and the right to be offered a suitable alternative vacancy, if one is available, before being made redundant ahead of other at risk of redundancy.

The new law will extend the priority status to pregnant employees, employees who have recently suffered a miscarriage, or employees who have returned from a period of maternity, adoption or shared parental leave.

The length of the protection is to be confirmed, but it is expected to be six months following return to work.

The extended protection will come into force on 24 July 2023; however, it will require further regulations setting out how the protection will work.

The regulations are expected to come into force no earlier than April 2024.

The Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay) Act 2023 will provide up to 12 weeks of paid neonatal care leavefor parents with children in neonatal care.

It came into force on 24 May 2023, but it requires further regulations setting out how the entitlement will work.

The regulations are expected to come into force no earlier than April 2025.

We recommend that employers update their policies and procedures to reflect these changes once the new protections come into force.

Flexible working Under existing law, employees must have accrued a minimum of 26 weeks of service before becoming eligible to submit a statutory flexible working request.

Currently, a request only can be made once per year and the employer must notify the employee of the outcome within three months.

The UK government has announced its intention to make the right to request flexible working a day one right for employees.

Under the proposals, employees also will be able to submit up to two requests each year, and employers must provide a response within two months."
Cooley,UK Government Announces Upcoming Changes in Employment Law,"Under the proposals, employees also will be able to submit up to two requests each year, and employers must provide a response within two months.

What remains unchanged under the proposals is that employers will be able to refuse a flexible working request if they have one of eight statutory business reasons for doing so (and those business reasons will remain unamended from their present form).

It is anticipated that the proposals will become law in late 2023.

Proposed reforms to TUPE

The government is consulting on proposals to remove the requirement to elect employee representatives for the purposes of Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 2006, or TUPE, consultations for: Businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

Transfers affecting fewer than 10 employees (regardless of the size of the employer).

This proposal would allow businesses which satisfy these criteria to consult directly with affected employees and reduce the complexities surrounding the election of representatives.

At present, only micro-employers with fewer than 10 employees can inform and consult affected employees directly in respect of a transfer of a business or service provision change.

Proposed reforms to holiday entitlements Currently, employees in the UK are entitled to a statutory minimum of 5.6 weeks (28 days) of holiday leave.

This is made up of two separate holiday entitlements  four weeks (20 days) of leave derived from European Union law and an additional 1.6 weeks (eight days) derived from UK law.

The government is proposing to merge these entitlements to form a simplified single annual leave entitlement.

While that might not seem controversial at first glance, it could have a material impact on the calculation of holiday pay and holiday carry-over entitlements.

For example, at present, the 1.6 weeks of holiday derived from UK law can be paid at the basic rate of pay, whereas the four weeks of holiday derived from EU law must be paid at the rate of normal remuneration, which may include elements of on-call payments, bonus, overtime and commission within the calculation.

It is unclear how the government plans to address that differential.

The government also is consulting about changing the method for calculating holiday entitlement during the first year of employment so that new hires would accrue their annual leave entitlement at the end of each pay period during the first year of employment.

It remains to be seen what reforms the government will propose after the consultation, but we will provide an update when there is further clarity.

Proposed reforms to rolled-up holiday pay Rolled-up holiday pay is the practice of paying workers an additional sum in their basic pay that represents pay due during holiday periods.

In other words, basic pay and holiday pay are rolled-up together, meaning that a worker is not paid when they take holiday.

Currently, the practice of rolling-up holiday pay is unlawful because it is deemed to deter workers from taking holiday time.

However, the UK government is consulting on making rolled-up holiday pay lawful.

It is anticipated that the changes will simplify the calculation of holiday pay for casual and temporary workers.

Working time records Under the Working Time Regulations 1998, employers must maintain adequate records showing compliance with the maximum working time limit rules for employees who have not opted out of the 48-hour limit on the average working week and those completing night work.

However, a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union cast doubt on whether this was sufficient when it held that member states must require employers to have a reliable and accessible system to measure the maximum weekly working time and daily and weekly rest periods.

The government is proposing to remove the requirement to maintain a record of daily working hours, which would address the current uncertainty about record-keeping requirements."
Cooley,UK Government Announces Upcoming Changes in Employment Law,"The government is proposing to remove the requirement to maintain a record of daily working hours, which would address the current uncertainty about record-keeping requirements.

We do not expect this change to have a material impact on employers current practices because we suspect that, in practice, few employers keep adequate records at present.

The governments consultation on changes to TUPE, holiday and working time closed on 7 July 2023.

We will provide an update when the government has responded to the consultation.

Reasonable adjustments on mental health grounds from ACAS Employers are increasingly aware of the importance of protecting and supporting employees mental health in the workplace, and the impact this can have on well-being, productivity and retention.

Under current legislation, there is a legal duty for employers to make reasonable adjustments where a worker (or job applicant) is considered disabled for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.

An employee will be considered disabled if they have a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial adverse long-term impact on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.

Mental health conditions (as well as physical health conditions) may constitute a disability for the purposes of the legislation.

The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), which is an independent public body, has published guidance on best practice for employees and employers with respect to reasonable adjustments on mental health grounds.

Employers should review the full guidance and consider it when handling reasonable adjustments for mental health in the workplace."
Cooley,"CFPB, HHS and Treasury Request Information on Medical Payment Products","On July 7, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and US Department of the Treasury (collectively, the agencies) published a request for information (RFI) on financial products used to pay for healthcare, including medical credit cards and installment loans.

The agencies indicated that they are seeking input from stakeholders to assess the rationales behind why healthcare providers may promote certain financial products and services  and whether the proliferation of such products and services may contribute to consumer harm.

Beginning with the passage of the No Surprises Act in 2021, which provides protections for consumers from surprise medical bills, controlling healthcare costs and managing consumer medical debt has been a priority for all three branches of government.

Thus, the RFI is the latest in a series of actions by Congress, federal agencies and the Biden administration seeking to study healthcare costs and protect consumers from paying inaccurate medical bills.

Background The use of medical payment products by consumers has evolved in recent years from a method of financing used primarily to pay for care outside of the coverage of health insurance plans to a more widespread tool used in connection with a broader set of services, including emergency room visits and primary and specialty care.

As suggested in the RFI, and highlighted in CFPB Director Rohit Chopras remarks to Congress on July 11 , the agencies are concerned that the broader adoption of these services is a response to the growing financial challenges associated with paying for medical care.

Given these market factors, the agencies note that the extension of credit in connection with the provision of healthcare may have unintended negative downstream consequences for consumers and healthcare providers.

The RFI lists several associated concerns, including: The proliferation of medical payment products may create a negative experience for patients.

The agencies note that patients trust their healthcare providers to offer healthcare-related expertise and may place similar trust in the financing products offered by those providers.

However, healthcare providers or their staffs may not have the requisite information or proficiency needed to answer patients questions about the terms and conditions of financial products.

Furthermore, patients may feel pressure to make financial decisions while under physical or emotional stress associated with their healthcare needs.

Medical payment products may create the wrong incentives for healthcare providers.

The agencies suggest that healthcare providers may be incentivized to promote medical credit cards and loans because these products result in faster payment and reduced administrative costs compared to alternatives like financial assistance or provider-administered payment plans.

In addition, tax-exempt hospitals may steer patients to more profitable medical payment products and away from certain financial assistance for low-income patients required by the Affordable Care Act.

Finally, payment products may enable healthcare providers to charge higher prices to uninsured, self-paying or out-of-network patients who would otherwise be unable to pay such prices and might instead seek more affordable care.

Tying payment products to healthcare can be used to restrict access to care.

As it is, the RFI notes that people may delay or avoid medical care out of concern about costs or debt, or because they believe they will be turned away due to their unpaid medical bills.

If payment products contribute to higher healthcare costs, they also may act as a deterrent for patients seeking care.

Information requested The RFI seeks information on the use of medical payment products, the terms of these products and their impact on consumers."
Cooley,"CFPB, HHS and Treasury Request Information on Medical Payment Products","Information requested The RFI seeks information on the use of medical payment products, the terms of these products and their impact on consumers.

In particular, the agencies appear most interested in understanding both the present impact of these products on consumers and how the structure of the market may inform future trends.

To this end, the agencies are broadly requesting information, such as: Total outstanding consumer debt on medical credit cards, medical installment loans and other medical payment products.

Demographic information regarding consumers who use these products.

Market concentration in the industry.

The types of financial entities that offer medical credit cards and loans.

How plans and issuers billing and reimbursement practices impact healthcare providers decisions to offer and promote medical payment products.

Terms and conditions, as well as disclosures, related to such products.

Furthermore, each agency included specific questions to commenters.

The CFPB, in particular, focused on the mechanics of these payment products, including through requests related to the use of credit or propensity to pay scores, debt collection practices and underwriting procedures.

This RFI is consistent with two broader trends in financial services regulation under the Biden administration.

First, agencies are taking a collaborative approach to consumer protection, through supervision, information gathering and enforcement.

Second, the CFPB continues to spearhead efforts focused on broader financial markets, with a specific emphasis on protecting populations the CFPB believes to be vulnerable  a focus that also is evident in this RFI.

Cooley,CFPB’s Annual Fair Lending Report Highlights Robust Oversight of Traditional and Innovative Lending Practices,"On June 29, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued its annual fair lending report to Congress, confirming that although there was relatively little public fair lending enforcement in 2022, the CFPB and other financial regulatory agencies are engaged in significant nonpublic oversight, examination, and enforcement activities, in addition to ongoing rulemaking initiatives.

These oversight activities extend to virtually all consumer lending products, as well as small business loans.

And, while the CFPB is focused on bias with respect to advanced and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and automated valuation models, the report details a host of regulatory activities around technical noncompliance with protections beyond customer race and ethnicity, with a particular focus on age discrimination and public assistance discrimination.

CFPBs fair lending supervision and enforcement spans wide set of credit markets, with focus on traditional and new technologies The CFPB brought only one fair lending enforcement action in 2022  a joint settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and attorneys general over claims of redlining in the Philadelphia region.

However, the report also reflects that the CFPB devoted significant resources to fair lending oversight in the past year, and it is engaging in substantial nonpublic examinations and investigations of lending activity across a wide range of products.

Specifically, the CFPB indicates it is conducting active fair lending investigations in product markets including student lending, payday lending, credit cards and mortgage lending for evidence of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) and/or

Equal Credit Opportunity Act(ECOA) violations.

In the mortgage space, the CFPB notes it is looking at redlining, reverse redlining, and pricing exception and home valuation practices.

Finally, the CFPB says it is using its ECOA and UDAAP authority to look at bias in automated systems and models, including the targeting of vulnerable populations.

Multiple financial services regulatory agencies focusing on fair lending practices The annual fair lending report states that the bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) collectively referred 23 potential fair lending violations to the DOJ in 2022, with the FDIC accounting for 12, the CFPB and the NCUA accounting for five each, and the FRB accounting for one.

Those referrals covered mortgage lending, consumer lending, auto pricing and credit cards.

The referral activity also shows that, while agencies have concerns about historic areas of focus  redlining and discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity in underwriting and pricing practices  there is also a significant focus on compliance with other ECOA protections.

In particular, the agencies are looking at improper consideration of consumer marital status, age, public assistance income, familial status and a consumers exercise of rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

What to expect The report makes clear that the CFPB and other agencies are focused on risks of discrimination associated with new or advanced technologies.

In its statement about the future of fair lending, the CFPB flags discrimination risks associated with sophisticated digital marketing, fraud screens and underwriting models reliant on artificial intelligence and machine learning, and chatbots and behavioral analytics that impact post-origination consumer interactions.

To that end, the bureau notes it is increasing its expertise in data science and analytics to ensure it is able to hold creditors and service providers accountable for complying with fair lending laws.

The CFPB also calls out big tech platforms, which collect data that are now fueling highly complex, black box algorithms."
Cooley,CFPB’s Annual Fair Lending Report Highlights Robust Oversight of Traditional and Innovative Lending Practices,"The CFPB also calls out big tech platforms, which collect data that are now fueling highly complex, black box algorithms.

Yet the examination and investigation statistics contained in the report also make clear that agencies continue their focus on traditional fair lending risks, or fair lending risks associated with traditional credit offerings.

Thus, while institutions should consider stretching their fair lending programs to reflect advanced technologies, they still should be mindful of ECOAs protections and procedural requirements."
Cooley,IRS Announces Transition Guidance for Stock Buyback Excise Tax,"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 added Internal Revenue Code Section 4501, which imposes a 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock of publicly traded US corporations effected after December 31, 2022.

As described in a January 2023 Cooley M&A blog post , this stock buyback tax may apply to certain transactions that are not conventionally regarded as stock buybacks, in addition to straightforward repurchases by public companies.

The US Treasury Department and the IRS intend to issue forthcoming regulations addressing the application of the stock buyback tax, including rules for determining the amount of the stock buyback tax owed, and procedures for reporting and paying the tax.

The IRS has announced in transition guidance that, until the time to be specified in the forthcoming regulations, taxpayers are not required to report or pay the stock buyback tax.

Note: The IRS transition guidance only suspends the reporting and payment of the stock buyback tax temporarily.

The tax is still expected to apply to repurchases after December 31, 2022, and taxpayers are instructed to monitor and record any such transactions.

For any taxable year ending after December 31, 2022, but prior to publication of the regulations, the regulations are expected to provide that any liability for the stock buyback tax for such taxable year will be reported on the Form 720 (Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return) due for the first full quarter after the date of publication of the regulations, and the deadline for payment will be the same as the filing deadline.

There will be no addition to tax for failure to file a return reporting the stock buyback tax, or for failure to pay the tax, before the time to be specified in the forthcoming regulations.

For subsequent taxable years, the regulations are expected to provide that the stock buyback tax will be reported and paid once per taxable year on the Form 720 due for the first full quarter after the close of the taxpayers taxable year.

The forthcoming regulations also are expected to require corporations subject to the stock buyback tax to keep complete and detailed records regarding any stock repurchases that are completed after December 31, 2022  including repurchases that are completed before the regulations are finalized  and to retain these records as long as their contents may become material."
Cooley,New UK Legislation Raises Prospect of 1.5% Stamp Tax Charge on Equity Financings,"The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 became law in the UK on 29 June 2023.

Broad in scope, the Revocation and Reform Act will, with effect from the end of this year, sweep away a number of European Union-derived laws and rights that survived Brexit, unless positive steps are taken to retain those laws or rights.

The UK may therefore be on course to repeal legislation that preserves in UK law an EU-derived prohibition on imposing UK stamp taxes (at a rate of 1.5%) on issuances and certain transfers of shares to a depositary receipt issuer or clearance service.

This prohibition has benefited a number of businesses  including UK-parented groups with American depositary shares listed on US exchanges, or whose shares trade directly through the Depository Trust Company  for more than a decade, and it has helped ensure that the UK remains an attractive jurisdiction in which to establish public companies.

The Revocation and Reform Act confers powers on the UK government to save particular laws or rights from repeal, if it wishes to do so  it is therefore hoped that steps will be taken sooner rather than later to retain the current legal position so that the 1.5% stamp tax charge will not apply in respect of issuances of shares or transfers of shares which are integral to a raising of capital (whether by using these powers or by some other means, such as via new legislation).

An opportune moment to do this would be on tax Legislation Day (18 July 2023), when draft legislation to be included in a forthcoming Finance Bill is expected to be published.

However, in the absence of a clear indication from the government as to its stance from a policy perspective  beyond a simple reference to the matter on a government dashboard  there remains considerable uncertainty as to what the outcome will be.

Cooley is among those working to ensure that the UK government is aware of the importance of the government clarifying its policy in respect of this issue as soon as possible  and taking action before the end of the year to retain the current position."
Cooley,EU Launches Groundbreaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation,"In September 2020, the European Commission adopted a digital finance package with the aim of creating a supportive regulatory framework to enable the digital transformation of the European Unions financial industry.

It established the groundbreaking piece of regulation  the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR)  to provide a harmonised regulatory framework for crypto-assets in the EU.

MiCAR came into force on 29 June 2023, almost three years later, and soon will become applicable.

The key dates are: 30 June 2024 , which is when provisions governing in-scope stablecoins become applicable.

30 December 2024 , which is when provisions governing the remaining crypto-assets become applicable.

If your business issues or deals with crypto-assets in the EU, understanding MiCAR now and achieving compliance before the relevant deadline will be crucial, as the regulation may significantly impact your business compliance procedures and transparency obligations.

This alert provides a high-level summary of what MiCAR is, the scope of the regulation, and the key requirements for businesses currently dealing, or intending to deal, with crypto-assets in the EU.

1.

What is MiCAR?

In January 2019, two reports  Advice on Initial Coin Offerings and Crypto-Assets from the European Banking Authority (EBA) and Report With Advice for the European Commission on Crypto-Assets from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)  highlighted the issue of a majority of crypto-assets falling outside the scope of existing EU financial services legislation, such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014 (2014/65/EU) , also known as MiFID II, and the E-Money Directive (2009/110/EC) , or EMD2.

Given the increasing popularity of markets in crypto-assets, the lack of rules regulating crypto-assets and related services raises concerns that it will set back fair competition and innovation due to the following intercorrelated reasons: Holders of crypto-assets are exposed to significant risks.

Holders of crypto-assets will lose confidence in such assets as a result of the risks.

Market integrity is put at risk.

Development of markets in crypto-assets will be hindered.

Innovation of digital services (e.g., establishing new alternative payment instruments of funding sources for EU companies) will be hindered.

The European Commission recognised the urgent need to establish a dedicated and harmonised framework at the EU level to address such risks.

Against this backdrop, MiCAR was introduced to establish a comprehensive set of rules and standards for the regulation of such unregulated crypto-assets in order to provide legal clarity, consumer protection and market integrity (e.g., deterring market abuse and financial crime).

A few key features of MiCAR aim to achieve the following: Promote financial stability and the smooth operation of payment systems by placing focus on crypto-assets that have a direct effect on existing financial markets, financial stability, consumer rights and monetary sovereignty (e.g., stablecoins).

Address any monetary policy risks arising from crypto-assets that stabilise their price in relation to a specific asset or basket of assets (e.g., stablecoins).

Address proportionately any risks inherent in related crypto-assets and related services so that less risky crypto-assets will be subject to lighter rules, while stricter rules will apply to crypto-assets that are considered riskier (i.e., those that have a potentially systemic role in financial stability and monetary sovereignty).

Generate equal opportunities in respect of market entry, as well as the ongoing and future development of markets in crypto-assets.

2.

What is MiCARs scope?

Entities affected by MiCAR MiCAR will apply to: Issuers , which means those that engage in the issuance, offering to the public and admission to trading of in-scope crypto-assets."
Cooley,EU Launches Groundbreaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation,"Entities affected by MiCAR MiCAR will apply to: Issuers , which means those that engage in the issuance, offering to the public and admission to trading of in-scope crypto-assets.

Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), which means those that provide certain crypto-asset services in the EU, such as providing advice on crypto-assets, crypto wallet providers, exchanges and platforms.

Crypto-assets falling within MiCARs scope

The regulation defines crypto-assets as a digital representation of a value or of a right that is able to be transferred, and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technology, 1 and will apply to three categories of crypto-assets, as listed below.

Asset-referenced token (ART) is sometimes referred to as a stablecoin, and it tracks its value by referring to other assets or a combination thereof (this can be the value of official currencies or commodities).

2 Electronic money token (EMT) is a stablecoin which tracks its value against a single official currency, 3 and should not be confused with electronic money that falls within the scope of the EMD2, with the key difference being that EMTs use DLT or similar technology, while the latter dont.

All other crypto-assets which are not an ART or an EMT, and are not excluded from the scope of MiCAR.

Exceptions to MiCAR There are several entities that MiCAR does not apply to, 4 including: Crypto-asset services provided exclusively for their parent companies, their own subsidiaries or for the parent companys subsidiaries.

The European Central Bank and European investment banks.

Public international organisations.

The scope of MiCAR excludes any crypto-assets that are already adequately regulated by other EU financial services legislation (e.g., MiFID II or EMD2).

5 3.

What are MiCARs key requirements?

MiCARs framework aims to ensure financial stability and market integrity, with some of the key provisions to achieve this including the following: Issuers are required to publish a white paper 6 (essentially a report) on their crypto-assets which must include, among other things, information on risk, the offeror, the issuer and detail on the crypto-asset project.

CASPs are subject to capital requirements, governance standards and other supervisory conditions (e.g., being required to act honestly fairly and professionally in the interest of their clients, to name a few) 7 .

Issuers and CASPs are required to ensure investors are informed about potential risks and be diligent in preventing market fraud and manipulation.

8 CASPs are subject to authorisation and operating conditions.

Issuers of ARTs and EMTs are subject to authorisation requirements.

Detailing powers of competent authorities (i.e., the EBA and ESMA).

Issuers of significant ARTs and EMTs MiCAR places more stringent rules on issuers of significant ARTs and EMTs.

An ART or EMT becomes significant if it meets certain criteria, such as (non-exhaustive list 9 ):

The number of holders of the ART exceeds 10 million.

The value of the ART issued, its market capitalisation or the size of the reserve of assets of the issuer of the ART is higher than 5 billion euros.

The same issuer issues at least one additional ART or EMT, and it provides at least one crypto-asset service.

Such significantARTs and EMTs are considered to be at risk of raising specific challenges in terms of financial stability, monetary policy transmission or monetary sovereignty.

Therefore, issuers of significant ARTs and EMTs will be subject to more stringent rules relating to: Higher capital requirements.

Interoperability requirements.

A requirement to establish a liquidity management policy.

Falling within the supervision of the EBA.

Significant CASPs Meanwhile, CASPs become significant when they have at least 15 million active users in the EU on average in one calendar year.

CASPs which have reached that threshold must notify their competent authorities, who will then notify ESMA."
Cooley,EU Launches Groundbreaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation,"CASPs which have reached that threshold must notify their competent authorities, who will then notify ESMA.

4.

What are next steps?

MiCAR will apply from 30 December 2024 in all EU member states, and we can expect further published guidance from the EBA and ESMA by that date as well.

If your business currently issues or deals with crypto-assets, or intends to do so, it may be important to start considering if you have any obligations under MiCAR.

As noted above, this alert only provides a high-level summary of the scope and key requirements of MiCAR.

If you need further guidance, Cooley can provide regulatory advice on whether you fall within the scope of MiCAR and, if so, the steps your business should be taking to ensure compliance by the relevant deadline.

Cooley,What Employers Should Know About Protecting Confidential Information in England,"Confidential information is one of a business most prized and valuable assets.

However, it is rarely something that can be locked in a safe, because employees often require access to it for the purposes of carrying out their duties.

Below we consider how confidential information is protected in England and what options are available when confidential information is misused.

Trade secrets In the absence of express contractual confidentiality restrictions, the English courts will act to protect and prevent former employees from using trade secrets.

This category is limited to confidential information of the highest degree, such as secret manufacturing processes, chemical formulas or confidential methods of construction.

An often-cited example of a trade secret is the recipe for Coca-Cola.

The hurdle for information to be considered a trade secret is high but, if reached, such information will be protected after termination of employment even in the absence of express confidentiality restrictions, and there is no time limit on the protection.

Mere confidential information Information that falls short of being considered a trade secret will be mere confidential information, either because an employee is informed that the information is confidential or because they are aware it is (for example, because of the nature of their job or because the information is marked as confidential).

In the absence of an express confidentiality protection, such confidential information will only be protected against misuse during employment but not after its termination.

What will amount to confidential information is fact-specific and is, at best, a nebulous concept.

After employment terminates, an employee is permitted to use their skill, experience, general knowledge and know-how, which can include commercially sensitive information.

The distinction between whether information is a trade secret or an employees skill and knowledge can be complex.

However, what is clear is that information that is rightfully in the public domain (and not unlawfully disseminated) cannot be protected.

Implied contractual duty of confidentiality All employees owe an implied duty of fidelity and good faith to their employer.

This includes a duty not to disrupt their employers business and an obligation not to misuse their employers confidential information.

Statutory directors, partners, trustees and certain senior staff in a position of trust in relation to their employers assets or employees also owe fiduciary duties, including a core obligation of loyalty.

The existence of these implied obligations can be helpful in protecting trade secrets and mere confidential information to the extent permitted by common law; however, it is advisable for an employer to put in place an express contractual protection of confidential information.

Express contractual confidential provisions The best method of providing clarity is to include express confidentiality provisions in the employment contract that clearly define what constitutes confidential information and provide for it to be protected after employment terminates.

The definition of confidential information should be tailored to each companys individual needs.

If a company can demonstrate a legitimate proprietary interest in information, then it can be protected; information in the public domain (other than because of unlawful disclosure) cannot.

In addition to specific express protection of confidential information, a well-drafted employment contract should also include the right to require delivery up of company property and confidential information at any time, including on termination.

Equally, it should include obligations on employees to delete information they may have stored on any personal devices upon request and upon termination, as well as producing evidence of having done so, as an employer may reasonably request."
Cooley,What Employers Should Know About Protecting Confidential Information in England,"Post-termination restrictive covenants Above and beyond the basic contractual protection of confidential information, it is advisable for employment contracts to include post-termination restrictions designed to prevent an employee from working for a competitor  or from soliciting or dealing with clients, suppliers or former colleagues for a period of time after employment terminates.

Post-termination restrictions must be tightly drafted and go no further than is reasonably necessary to protect legitimate business interests, but well-defined provisions (in terms of duration, scope and tailoring to an employees seniority, role and responsibilities) can provide excellent business protection.

By way of example, legitimate business interests may include protecting an employers confidential information and trade secrets, client contacts, business relationships with external stakeholders, goodwill and general stability of its workforce.

Consequences of breach If there are concerns that confidentiality may have been breached, then the first step will be to establish  with strong evidence  what confidential information has been misappropriated or misused, by whom, when and to what extent.

It is imperative for an employer to act quickly and efficiently with its investigation to minimise the potential ramifications of the breach (or suspected breach)  and because delay in seeking injunctive relief can be fatal to achieving that protection.

It will be equally important to identify the express or implied confidentiality protections that have been breached.

It is likely that the next step will be to put the (most likely former) employee on notice of the claim (unless there is a real risk that doing so will place the confidential information at further risk).

There also may be a cause of action against a former employees new employer (or another third party) for inducing breach of contract.

The most common outcomes of confidential information action are as follows: Contractual undertakings (if a claim has not been issued) or undertakings to the court (if a claim has been issued) to deliver up and to not use the confidential information in question.

Injunctive relief to restrain a former employee from using (or continuing to use) the confidential information.

This will require the former employer to give a cross-undertaking in damages to the court in case it later transpires that it was inappropriate to grant the injunction  for example, because the information was not truly confidential.

It is possible to apply for an interim injunction, which can be obtained on an urgent basis.

Damages in respect of the financial loss that the former employer has suffered because of the former employees breach(es) of contract.

In practice, such damages can be difficult to quantify.

Trade Secrets Regulations

The European Union Trade Secrets Directive was transposed into English law on 9 June 2018 by means of the Trade Secrets Regulations 2018.

The directive was designed to address the significant variation in trade secret protection across the EU.

Accordingly, it introduced a statutory definition of trade secret for the first time as being confidential information that: Is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among, or readily accessible to, persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question.

Has commercial value because it is secret.

Has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret.

Under the Trade Secrets Regulations, the acquisition, use or disclosure of a trade secret is unlawful where the acquisition, use or disclosure constitutes a breach of confidence in confidential information."
Cooley,What Employers Should Know About Protecting Confidential Information in England,"The regulations do not affect the remedies available at common law for breach of confidence, but they do provide some potentially helpful additional tools in a confidential information dispute  for example, the possibility for the court to order, at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of information concerning the judgment.

The court has used that power in one case to order a defendant to display a statement on its website about its misuse of the claimants confidential information.

Final thoughts Express contractual protection of confidential information is fundamental but, on a practical level, restricting key information to a limited group of employees and ensuring that it is clearly marked as confidential and  where necessary  password-protected will all help limit the risks of a leak and assist any argument that the information has the necessary nature of confidence."
Cooley,US Supreme Court Ruling Limits Extraterritorial Reach of Lanham Act,"On June 29, 2023, the US Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Abitron Austria GmbH v. Hetronic International, Inc. , limiting the extraterritorial reach of provisions of the Lanham Act prohibiting trademark infringement to domestic use.

In reaching its decision, the court applied a two-step analysis.

First, the court examined whether 15 US Code 1114(1)(a) and 1125(a)(1)  provisions of the Lanham Act that prohibit trademark infringement  are extraterritorial and concluded they are not.

Second, the court determined that the focus of these provisions is not the effect of the alleged trademark infringement (creating a likelihood of consumer confusion), but rather the infringing conduct itself (the use of the mark in commerce).

Thus, the decision suggests that the critical question moving forward will be where the infringing use took place, not where consumer confusion may have resulted.

Background Hetronic, a US manufacturer of remote controls, uses the colors black and yellow to identify its wireless remote controls.

Abitron, a collection of foreign companies, initially operated as a licensed distributor of Hetronics goods.

It later created and sold its own products, using Hetronics black and yellow branding as its own.

While Abitrons sales were mainly within Europe, it also sold some products directly into the US.

Hetronic sued Abitron for violations of the Lanham Act.

The lower court awarded Hetronic approximately $96 million in trademark infringement damages.

This amount reflected infringement not only for Abitrons direct sales into the US, but for foreign sales with ultimate delivery destinations in the US and foreign sales that did not enter the US.

On appeal, the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit affirmed the award, finding that the Lanham Act extended to all of Abitrons foreign infringing conduct because of the conducts impact on the US.

On appeal, the question facing the Supreme Court was the extent to which 15 USC 1114(1)(a) and 1125(a)(1) apply to foreign conduct.

Applying the presumption against extraterritoriality Applying the presumption against extraterritoriality application involves a two-step process: Determining whether a specific provision is extraterritorial.

If not, determining whether the suit seeks a domestic or foreign application of the provision.

Step 1 turns on whether Congress has affirmatively and unmistakably instructed that the provision applies to foreign conduct or whether there is a clear indication that the provision is meant to apply abroad.

The court reasoned that the Lanham Act does not explicitly regulate foreign conduct, and there is no other indication from Congress that it should apply extraterritorially.

Although the Lanham Act references commerce (which, as Hetronic argued, includes foreign commerce), that was not enough to overcome the presumption that the provisions only apply to domestic conduct.

Finding that these infringement provisions of the Lanham Act were not extraterritorial, the court then turned to Step 2: whether Hetronic sought a domestic (permissible) or foreign (impermissible) application of the provisions.

This required the court to determine the focus of the provisions and assess whether the conduct relevant to that focus occurred within the US.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her concurrence noted that the focus of the two Lanham Act provisions is consumer confusion.

In her view, if the infringing conduct created a likelihood of consumer confusion in the US, regardless of where the actual infringing conduct took place, application of the provisions is permissible.

According to the majority, however, because both provisions prohibit the unauthorized use of a protected trademark in commerce, the relevant conduct is use in commerce.

Certainly, the conduct must create confusion to be actionable, but it is simply a necessary characteristic of an offending use, not a separate requirement."
Cooley,US Supreme Court Ruling Limits Extraterritorial Reach of Lanham Act,"Certainly, the conduct must create confusion to be actionable, but it is simply a necessary characteristic of an offending use, not a separate requirement.

The court held that it is where use in commerce actually occurs, not where confusion may be felt, that forms the dividing line separating foreign and domestic applications of these provisions.

Significance The Supreme Courts decision is likely to limit the ability of US trademark owners to pursue trademark infringement that occurs entirely outside the US, even if it results in consumer confusion within the US.

Although the decision does not limit application of the Lanham Act when infringing goods or services are sold directly into the US, purely foreign conduct is not subject to 15 USC 1114(1)(a) or 1125(a)(1).

If the infringing conduct takes place outside the United States, US trademark owners may need to file trademark infringement actions in foreign jurisdictions to enforce their rights.

As this will sometimes require ownership of trademark registrations in specific foreign jurisdictions, US brands should consider seeking trademark registrations outside the US, particularly in countries where they plan to do business and in countries that have known counterfeiting concerns.

Cooley,"FTC Proposes Sweeping Changes to HSR Rules That Could Substantially Increase Burden, Time to Prepare Filings","On June 27, 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposal for a radical overhaul to the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) premerger notification program that, if adopted, would dramatically increase costs, burden and the time required to prepare filings for transactions that must be notified to the government.

Under the HSR Act, parties to transactions are required to notify the FTC and the Department of Justice (DOJ) of most transactions valued above the size-of-transaction threshold  currently $111.4 million  and observe a waiting period before closing.

The HSR premerger notification program allows the FTC and DOJ to review transactions that meet the statutory thresholds to determine whether to investigate any particular transaction that may substantially reduce competition.

For transactions that raise serious substantive antitrust concerns, the government may request additional information by issuing a second request, which extends the waiting period before the deal can close, allowing the agencies to complete their review and challenge the transaction, if warranted.

FTC Chair Lina Khan indicated in a statement accompanying the announcement that the changes are intended to fill key gaps that our staff most routinely encounter, such as inadequate information about deal rationale or the details of how a particular investment vehicle is structured.

The changes also are intended to capture information about key aspects of competition, such as labor markets or research and development activity.

The current rules require notifying parties to provide a basic description of the transaction, as well as information about their subsidiaries and affiliates and certain revenue data used to identify competitive overlaps.

The HSR form also requires submission of certain deal-related documents created by or for officers or directors that address competition-related issues.

This information is used by the FTC and DOJ to determine whether further investigation is warranted, or to allow the transaction to close within the initial waiting period.

The FTCs proposed overhaul of the HSR program takes an everything but the kitchen sink approach, effectively requiring transacting parties to produce documents and information that today are only required if the agencies issue a second request for additional information.

Currently, second requests are issued in only about 2% to 3% of all transactions notified.

Indeed, historically, the FTC and DOJ granted early termination in 80% to 90% of notified transactions, indicating that the vast majority of notified transactions do not raise competitive concerns  though the Biden administration ceased granting early termination.

The new rules, if implemented, would impose a substantial burden on transacting parties, even for deals that do not raise substantive antitrust issues.

The FTC estimates that adoption of the new rules will increase the time filers need to prepare the form by 12 to 222 additional hours per filing, depending on the complexity of the filing.

Among other requirements, the FTCs proposal would require filing parties to submit the following additional information and documents: Narrative descriptions of the strategic rationales for the transaction and information regarding the key dates and conditions for closing.

Narrative descriptions of the horizontal overlaps and supply relationships between the filing persons.

Details about investment vehicles, corporate relationships and the structure of entities involved (such as private equity investments) that could require private equity and venture capital firms, in particular, to disclose additional holdings.

A more extensive disclosure of minority holdings, including limited partners in partnerships and minority holders of any entities within the control chain of the acquiring entity."
Cooley,"FTC Proposes Sweeping Changes to HSR Rules That Could Substantially Increase Burden, Time to Prepare Filings","A more extensive disclosure of minority holdings, including limited partners in partnerships and minority holders of any entities within the control chain of the acquiring entity.

A more extensive production of transaction-related documents (including drafts) and ordinary course business documents (e.g., describing market conditions) collected from a broad range of individuals at each notifying party.

Details regarding previous acquisitions (including transactions that were not required to be notified to the agencies under the HSR Act).

Identification of all officers, directors and board observers of the acquiring person and acquired entity to assist the agencies in identifying interlocking directorates.

Information to assess the potential impact of the transaction on labor markets, including questions about the merging parties employees and the services employees perform.

Identification of penalties or findings issued against the filer by the Department of Labor, National Labor Relations Board or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) during the previous five years.

Identification of pipeline or pre-revenue products and overlaps for such products anticipated to have annual revenue totaling more than $1 million within two years.

The changes to the HSR form also would implement provisions of the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act adopted by Congress in December 2022.

That statute requires filers to disclose whether they have received subsidies from a foreign entity of concern, which includes countries or entities that are strategic or economic threats to the United States.

While the HSR rules and the form have undergone numerous changes throughout the HSR Acts history, the FTC calls this the first time that the government has undertaken a top-to-bottom review of the HSR form since the act became law in 1976.

Khan argues that much has changed in the 45 years since the HSR Act was passed, justifying these new rules.

In particular, Khan maintains that Congress estimated the statute would require notification of the largest 150 mergers annually, and the agencies often now receive more than 150 filings each month.

But rather than raise the filing thresholds to reduce the number of notified transactions back to 150, Khan is proposing to increase the burden on a huge number of transactions.

Khan also argues that many of the updates in the proposal are consistent with data already collected by antitrust authorities around the world.

But those jurisdictions typically require only a small number of transactions to be notified.

The European Commission, for example, receives only approximately 10% of the number of filings made in the US every year.

In the US, there were 3,250 HSR notifications submitted in FY2021, all of which would be subject to the increased costs and burdens associated with the proposed changes.

Other jurisdictions also often allow submission of a short form filing for transactions that meet the statutory thresholds but do not raise substantive concerns.

The FTCs proposed changes do not allow for a short form filing  the new rules would apply equally to all transactions.

While timing for implementation of the HSR changes is uncertain, it is not expected until the end of 2023.

The FTCs Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, issued with the concurrence of the DOJ, will be subject to public comment for 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

Following that, the FTC will evaluate the public comments and issue final rules."
Cooley,Supreme Court’s Affirmative Action in Education Ruling Leaves Employment Diversity Initiatives Untouched – for Now,"On June 29, 2023, the US Supreme Court held in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College (decided with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina, et al. )

that race may not be used as a factor in college admissions.

Although the case related solely to higher education, employers should remain alert to the ripple effect that the ruling could have on employment law.

Background In 2014, an organization opposing affirmative action, Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), sued Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, alleging that both improperly used race as a factor in their admissions processes.

Specifically, SFFA claimed that Harvard violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by favoring Hispanic and Black applicants, thereby discriminating against Asian Americans in admissions.

The SFFA similarly claimed that UNC violated Title VI by discriminating against white and Asian American students and, as a public institution, violated the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.

Both universities use race and ethnicity as one of many factors in their admissions processes.

The universities argued that because race is just one of many plus factors in a comprehensive process, their affirmative action programs tracked the Supreme Courts 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision.

In Grutter , the Supreme Court held that race may be used as one of many factors in college admissions because of the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.

However, the courts ruling in Grutter recognized the remedial nature of using race as a factor in admissions, expressing its expectation that in 25 years, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest of fostering diversity in higher education.

The lower courts in both the UNC and Harvard cases held that the universities respective admissions policies complied with the standards set forth in Grutter and upheld the universities programs.

SFFA argued before the Supreme Court that Grutter should be overturned because permitting universities to consider race in admissions violates equal protection principles, delays the development of a colorblind society, and discriminates against Asian American and white students.

SFFA also argued that neither admissions policy met the standards set forth in Grutter for using race as a factor in college admissions.

Ruling The Supreme Court held on June 29 that both universities admissions programs did not comply with the standards set forth in Grutter because the programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

As a result, the programs violate the equal protection clause.

Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court, wrote that students must be evaluated based on their experiences as an individual  not on the basis of race, thereby effectively ending the use of race as a factor in college admissions.

The court noted, however, that nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicants discussion of how race affected the applicants life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university.

The court did not explicitly overrule Grutter , although Justice Clarence Thomas noted in his concurring opinion that Grutter was at least implicitly overruled.

Implications for employment Other than sharing a name, affirmative action in the employment context has no relation to affirmative action as the term is used in higher education.

Indeed, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are expressly forbidden from using race, ethnicity, gender or any other protected characteristic in personnel decisions, with a couple of limited exceptions."
Cooley,Supreme Court’s Affirmative Action in Education Ruling Leaves Employment Diversity Initiatives Untouched – for Now,"Still, there may be significant ramifications from the courts ruling that affect employment policies related to diversity.

Permissible uses of race, ethnicity and gender in employment Employers that can demonstrate a manifest imbalance of an underrepresented group within their workforce may voluntarily institute an affirmative action policy.

In order to take protected category status into account in an employment decision (hiring, recruiting, promoting, etc.), the employer must be able to establish that: There has been a manifest imbalance among its workforce involving an underrepresented group.

The measures implemented to correct the imbalance are narrowly tailored and do not unnecessarily impinge upon the rights of other groups (i.e., employers cannot implement a quota).

The affirmative action program is temporary.

Although the courts holding did not affect the propriety of these voluntary affirmative action programs, the ruling may spark challenges to such programs.

Additionally, private employers that contract with the federal government have certain affirmative action requirements under the Department of Labors Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).

Federal contractors must conduct a statistical analysis of their employment decisions to ensure that no particular race, ethnicity or gender is adversely impacted, and they must institute diversity-focused recruiting of women, minorities, veterans and disabled individuals.

Federal contractors, however, are prohibited from considering race, ethnicity, veteran status, disability or any other protected trait in making employment decisions.

As with voluntary affirmative action programs, while OFCCP requirements have not changed, the reasoning underscoring the courts June 29 ruling could be used in efforts to end federal contractor affirmative action requirements.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives The Supreme Courts holding in the Harvard and UNC cases also could have a cascading effect on support for employer DEI initiatives.

Many employers have built DEI programs around efforts to increase employment opportunities, community and innovation at their companies, with a particular focus on broad recruitment efforts to ensure opportunities are promoted to qualified applicants from varying backgrounds.

The courts decision says nothing about the legality of these programs.

Indeed, in a statement issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) addressing the courts holding , the agency stated, [i]t remains lawful for employers to implement diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs that seek to ensure workers of all backgrounds are afforded equal opportunity in the workplace.

However, despite the clear distinction between the higher education and workplace contexts, and applicability of different laws governing employers and colleges, potential future plaintiffs could read the decision as casting doubt on the effectiveness or propriety of DEI programs, such as diversity-focused recruitment, mentoring programs, diversity metrics and other policies intended to promote diversity in the workplace.

Potential challengers of DEI programs could use the courts ruling to argue that such efforts are no longer needed and even have a negative effect on racial diversity by disfavoring certain groups at the expense of promoting other groups.

Others may view DEI programs as fundamentally unfair, which also can affect employee morale.

In addition, employers may see an increase in reverse discrimination claims, and a chilling effect among leadership in efforts to promote diversity.

Considerations for employers Employers must be careful that they do not institute quotas or make any personnel decisions in which an individuals protected class status is a factor, and they must ensure that hiring managers receive thorough training."
Cooley,Supreme Court’s Affirmative Action in Education Ruling Leaves Employment Diversity Initiatives Untouched – for Now,"Employers also should be ready to defend the justification for and effectiveness of their DEI initiatives in the face of increased scrutiny of strategies used to increase diversity.

While the Harvard and UNC holdings in no way affect the legality of DEI initiatives, employers should expect backlash and have a response strategy ready.

As a final consideration, employers may need to think broadly about their recruiting efforts.

If, as many predict, the courts decision results in decreased representation of members of underrepresented racial groups in higher education, employers applicant pools also may change.

Supporting workplace community, fostering innovation, and meeting client needs remain crucial goals that are supported by a pipeline of qualified and diverse future workers.

Employers should reevaluate their recruitment efforts and think creatively about how to reach applicants from diverse backgrounds.

As EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows observed in her statement, diversity helps companies attract top talent, sparks innovation, improves employee satisfaction, and enables companies to better serve their customers."
Cooley,Considerations in Cross-Border Intellectual Property License and Transfer Agreements,"In todays global economy, emerging companies often enter into agreements with vendors, suppliers, partners, distributors, and other individuals or entities in different countries that require licenses or transfers of intellectual property (IP agreements).

Engaging in cross-border transactions can provide opportunities to expand into new markets, establish a cost-effective supply chain and obtain access to new and advanced technologies.

However, each country  and jurisdictions within a country  may have different approaches to contract terms (such as warranties and enforceability), as well as different rules relating to the licensing, transfer and ownership of intellectual property.

While courts in most countries will respect the parties agreement to apply a specific governing law to a contract, it is still important to understand the laws of the applicable jurisdictions of the counterparty when negotiating cross-border IP agreements, as those laws may still apply to certain aspects of the agreement.

This article is intended to identify some  but not all  considerations to keep in mind when negotiating cross-border transactions, focusing specifically on IP agreements.

Formalities Understand what formalities are required under the laws of the applicable jurisdictions.

For example, certain jurisdictions may require IP agreements to be in writing, while others require specific proscribed language to effectuate such license or transfer.

In some cases, IP agreements need to be registered with a government entity to ensure the parties (or sublicensees) are able to avail themselves of certain benefits.

There also are jurisdictions that require contracts to be translated into the native language of the foreign entity or individual.

Intellectual property rights Understand which rights are protectable and enforceable within each applicable jurisdiction.

Different countries recognize different intellectual property rights and concepts.

For example, the work-for-hire doctrine, a copyright principle under US laws, is not recognized by a number of countries outside the US.

Where those laws are not recognized by applicable foreign jurisdictions, it is important to clearly state the intention of the parties with respect to transfer of intellectual property rights.

Further, countries may apply the same legal concept differently.

The concept of moral rights in copyright law  while recognized in European Union countries and in the US  is applied much more broadly in the EU, where protection is provided to all copyrightable works, rather than just visual works, which is the case in the US.

To avoid any ambiguity, the parties should specifically set forth the rights agreed to be covered by the contract.

Simply relying on certain terminology may not be adequate in memorializing the parties intent.

Warranties and limitations of liability Understand how and whether different laws allow you to exclude express and implied warranties or limit your liability under a contract.

Not only do different statutes imply different warranties or prohibit certain warranties or liability to be excluded by law (despite any contractual agreement to the contrary), but also the way statutes approach warranties and liability may vary depending on whether you are contracting with a consumer or another business.

Many jurisdictions have extensive laws that apply to the way you contract with consumers in that jurisdiction (and may even prohibit your ability to deny a consumer the right to litigate in his or her home court).

Generally, there are fewer restrictions  or less rigid restrictions  that are imposed by laws with respect to contracting with a foreign business."
Cooley,Considerations in Cross-Border Intellectual Property License and Transfer Agreements,"Generally, there are fewer restrictions  or less rigid restrictions  that are imposed by laws with respect to contracting with a foreign business.

However, there still may be restrictions (such as a requirement to countersign limitations or exclusions, or a requirement to ensure such limitations or exclusions are conspicuous) or prohibitions on excluding certain types of warranties under contracts  although in certain cases, such risks can be mitigated or managed in other ways under the contract.

It is important to be mindful that merely including certain limitations or disclaimers in a contract does not ensure the enforceability of those limitations or disclaimers under applicable laws or when litigating in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Dispute resolution Understand how your rights and liabilities under an IP agreement may be affected by application of different legal frameworks and dispute resolution mechanisms.

Selecting one governing law over another may have a significant impact on your ability to protect or enforce your rights to intellectual property under a contract.

As mentioned previously, even if the parties agree to apply the laws of a specific jurisdiction, foreign laws may still be applicable and need to be taken into consideration.

Similarly, the dispute resolution process you agree to under a contract may impact the manner in which the provisions under your contract  and applicable laws  are interpreted.

A court in one jurisdiction may apply certain laws, rules or regulations differently than a court in another jurisdiction.

Arbitrators, who may not be bound by court rules or procedures, generally have more flexibility in interpreting relevant statutes and rendering judgments.

While that flexibility may be desirable in certain instances, in others, it may be more favorable to apply a strict interpretation of a statute.

Moreover, you must consider costs related to any such dispute resolution process, including travel expenses, fees for arbitrators and the costs of filing motions or other documents.

There are numerous other factors to consider before entering into a cross-border IP agreement,  including commercial considerations and other legal considerations, such as tax, competition and antitrust, export, privacy, and data-related issues."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - June One-Minute Reads,"Corp Fin issues new CDIs on Rule 10b5-1 On May 25, 2023, the Division ofCorporation Finance posted three new Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (CDIs) regarding the affirmative defense to insider trading under Rule 10b5-1, after the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted related final rules in December 2022 imposing new conditions on the availability of the affirmative defense.

As outlined below, the new CDIs provide more clarity with respect to compliance dates for the new disclosure requirements within the final rules and comment on the need for a cooling-off period for an individual with two Rule 10b5-1 plans who terminates the earlier-commencing plan.

Question 120.26 expressly lists the compliance dates for the disclosure requirements contained in new Item 408 and Item 402(x) of Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies (SRCs) and non-SRCs with a December 31 or June 30 fiscal year-end, which are included in the table below for easy reference.

Question 120.27 addresses when companies are required to begin including the disclosures in proxy statements for transition purposes, clarifying that the disclosure must be provided in proxy statements for the first annual meeting for the election of directors (or information statements for consent solicitations)

after completion of the first full fiscal year beginning on or after April 1, 2023, for non-SRCs or October 1, 2023, for SRCs.

Question 120.28 relates to a situation where a person maintains two separate Rule 10b5-1 plans at the same time, which is allowed under the final rules only if trading pursuant to the later-commencing plan is not authorized to begin until after all trades under the earlier-commencing plan are completed or have expired without execution.

The CDI states that if the individual terminates the earlier-commencing plan instead of it ending by its terms, the later-commencing plan will be subject to an effective cooling-off period before trading can begin  starting on the termination date of the earlier-commencing plan  and will last for the time period specified in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(ii)(B).

For officers and directors, that means the later of 90 days or two business days following the disclosure of the companys financial results in a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as applicable, for the fiscal quarter in which the earlier-commencing plan was terminated (but not to exceed 120 days).

For non-officers or directors, its 30 days.

By contrast, if the earlier-commencing plan ends by its terms without action by the individual, the cooling-off period for the later-commencing plan is not reset, and trading may begin as soon as the plans original cooling-off period is satisfied, which could be immediately after the earlier-commencing plan ends, depending on when the later-commencing plan was adopted.

Federal court invalidates California board diversity statute Our June 2022

One-Minute Reads discussed the California state court decisions to enjoin implementation and enforcement of Californias board gender diversity law (Senate Bill 826) and Californias board racial and ethnic diversity law (Assembly Bill 979), holding that the statutes violate the equal protection provisions of the California constitution.

These decisions are currently on appeal.

At an earlier hearing on the same case, the court dismissed (without issuing an opinion) the plaintiffs facial challenge to the constitutionality of SB 826, but it allowed the facial challenge to AB 979 to go forward.

Now, a California federal court has granted summary judgment to a plaintiff challenging AB 979 on federal grounds, holding that the law violates the equal protection clause of the US Constitution and the Civil Rights Act.

Notably, the same plaintiff is challenging the SECs approval of Nasdaqs board diversity listing rule in a case pending in the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

It remains to be seen how this federal court decision potentially influences the ongoing appeals, in addition to legislation regarding board diversity in other states.

Nasdaq, NYSE delay effectiveness of clawback listing standards Our March 2023 One-Minute Reads discussed the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange proposed listing standards implementing the SECs Dodd-Frank clawback policy rule, which had an effectiveness deadline of June 11 and would have required listed companies to adopt compliant clawback policies by August.

Despite this, Nasdaq and the NYSE published amendments to their proposed listing standards the week of June 5.

These amendments were subsequently approved by the SEC, delaying the effectiveness of the listing standards by nearly four months to October 2.

This means that companies subject to the clawback rules  which is nearly all of them, with few exceptions  will have until December 1, 2023 (60 days following the listing standard effective date) to adopt compliant clawback policies.

In addition to delaying the effectiveness of the listing standards and the deadline for policy adoption, the NYSE amendment: Provides for a cure period in the event of additional instances of noncompliance with the listing standard (beyond failure to adopt a clawback policy within the required time period), including when the listed company has not recovered erroneously awarded compensation reasonably promptly.

Revises Section 303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to make it clear that certain categories of listed companies, including foreign private issuers, are required to comply with the clawback listing standards.

The Nasdaq amendment is more limited in scope and only provides for the delay in the effective date.

Both sets of proposed listing standards, as amended, are otherwise substantively unchanged from the original Nasdaq and NYSE proposals.

SEC ratchets up crypto enforcement A prominent issue under the current SEC administration has been its critical view of securities laws compliance within the crypto industry and its associated active enforcement agenda.

In the first week of June, the SEC made its highest-profile moves yet, bringing civil enforcement actions against two of the worlds largest crypto exchanges, as outlined below.

First, on June 5, the SEC announced 13 charges against Binance  the largest crypto exchange in the world  and its US arm and founder for a variety of securities laws violations.

Per the press release, in addition to alleged control issues and concealment of these from investors, the complaint alleges violations of critical registration-related provisions of the federal securities laws, including with operating unregistered national securities exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing agencies, and the unregistered offer and sale of Binances own crypto assets.

Then, on June 6, the SEC filed a civil enforcement action against Coinbase  the largest crypto exchange in the US.

The SEC alleges that Coinbase has acted as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency, and also alleges that Coinbase has offered and sold securities without registering those offers and sales.

Many commentators  including The Associated Press , The Wall Street Journal and National Public Radio  have highlighted these developments as the most important crypto-related actions to date, the outcomes of which may have significant ramifications for the future of the crypto industry.

In a more positive development regarding the SECs stance toward crypto, on June 23, the SEC approved the first leveraged bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), with several asset managers, including BlackRock, recently filing with the SEC for a spot bitcoin ETF.

US Supreme Court requires tracing in Slack direct listing case On June 1, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Slack Technologies v. Pirani in favor of Slack, holding that, even in a direct listing registration, the Securities Acts Section 11 liability extends only to shares that are traceable to an allegedly defective registration statement.

This reverses the Ninth Circuit ruling and remands the case for reconsideration in light of the decision.

Section 11 provides standing to sue for misstatements in a registration statement to any person acquiring such security."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - June One-Minute Reads,"Section 11 provides standing to sue for misstatements in a registration statement to any person acquiring such security.

While direct listings allow a company to simultaneously sell newly registered shares at the same time that existing shareholders sell their existing unregistered shares on the open market for the first time, this mix of registered and unregistered shares makes it nearly impossible for open market buyers to know whether the shares they acquired are registered or unregistered.

The difficulty in tracing combined with Section 11 present the issue in this case: whether purchasers of shares in a direct listing have standing to sue under Section 11 liability.

The primary legal point in this case was whether to interpret the statutory language  such security  as only referring to a security issued pursuant to a misleading registration statement, or if it also can encompass a security that was not issued pursuant to a misleading registration statement.

The court found the narrower interpretation more persuasive, stating that every court of appeals to consider the issue has reached the same conclusion: To bring a claim under 11, the securities held by the plaintiff must be traceable to the particular registration statement alleged to be false or misleading.

While its a monumental holding for determining Section 11 liability, the decision still leaves an uncertain path forward.

For one, the court didnt opine on the question of whether Section 12 liability must be interpreted the same way, stating that the best course is to vacate its judgment with respect to Mr. Piranis 12 claim as well for reconsideration in the light of our holding today about the meaning of 11.

In doing so, we express no views about the proper interpretation of 12 or its application to this case.

Nor do we endorse the Ninth Circuits apparent belief that 11 and 12 necessarily travel together, but instead caution that the two provisions contain distinct language that warrants careful consideration.

Another key question arising out of the decision is whether Congress or the SEC will take steps to address the tracing issue, and the seeming loophole for companies to go public via a direct listing while being effectively immune from Section 11 liability.

Cooley,"Minnesota Set to Ban Most Noncompete Agreements Beginning July 1, 2023","Minnesota has joined a number of other states in cracking down against noncompete agreements  a trend growing increasingly common.

On May 24, 2023, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed SF 3035 , a bill that prohibits most covenants not to compete between employers and employees or independent contractors.

Nondisclosure agreements, nonsolicitation agreements, agreements designed to protect trade secrets or confidential information, and noncompete agreements agreed to as part of a sale or dissolution of a business are explicitly exempted from the law.

Upon a violation of the law, SF 3035 provides for injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys fees.

The prohibition on noncompete agreements goes into effect on July 1, 2023.

This alert reviews the main requirements of the law and highlights key considerations.

Individuals covered by SF 3035 SF 3035 is broadly written and bans all noncompetes between an employer and an employee or independent contractor  unless, as described below in further detail, the noncompete is tied to sale or dissolution of a business.

The statute defines a covenant not to compete as an agreement that would restrict a former employee or independent contractor from: Working for another employer within a certain time frame.

Working in an agreed-upon geographic area.

Working for another employer that is in the same field as the former employer.

The statute defines an employee as any individual who performs services for an employer, including independent contractors.

Pursuant to the statute, an independent contractor is any contracted individual for whom the employer does not complete a W-2, as well as any corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership, or other corporate entity when an employer requires an individual to form such an organization for purposes of entering into a contract for services as a condition of receiving compensation under an independent contractor agreement.

The inclusion of independent contractors within the scope of the noncompete ban renders Minnesotas noncompete restrictions broader than those of most other states, which exclude independent contractors from the scope of their noncompete restrictions.

In addition, unlike other states that limit their noncompete restrictions to individuals who earn less than a designated minimum earnings threshold, Minnesotas law encompasses all employees, regardless of compensation level.

Agreements not covered by SF 3035 SF 3035 does not apply to agreements that fall outside of Minnesotas definition of a covenant not to compete.

Minnesotas noncompete statute either affirmatively lists or appears to permit several types of agreements that are not noncompete agreements and that remain valid under the law, including: Customer nonsolicitation agreements that prohibit departing employees from soliciting a former employers clients and customers.

Employee nonsolicitation agreements that prohibit departing employees from soliciting the services of, or recruiting, their former co-workers.

Nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, including those agreements regarding trade secrets and inventions.

The continued enforceability of confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements gives employers the ability to protect their trade secrets, customer relationships, confidential information, business reputation and goodwill from competitors.

Additionally, the ongoing validity of employee and customer nonsolicitation agreements allows employers to prohibit departing employees from poaching clients or other employees post-termination.

Generally, employers in Minnesota will have the continued ability to limit some risks associated with competition from a departing employee."
Cooley,"Minnesota Set to Ban Most Noncompete Agreements Beginning July 1, 2023","Generally, employers in Minnesota will have the continued ability to limit some risks associated with competition from a departing employee.

Effective date, nonretroactive effect of Minnesota noncompete ban As of July 1, 2023, nearly all noncompete agreements between an employer and an employee or independent contractor will be rendered void and unenforceable (except for such agreements falling within the statutes exceptions, as described below).

Notably, Minnesotas noncompete statute is not retroactive  any noncompete agreements entered into prior to the July 1, 2023, effective date will continue to be evaluated pursuant to Minnesota common law, which provides for the enforcement of covenants not to compete that are reasonable in scope.

Sale of business and dissolution of business exceptions As noted above, noncompete agreements related to the sale of a business, or in anticipation of the dissolution of a business, continue to be valid and enforceable under the statute as long as they are reasonably limited in duration and geographic scope.

This provision bears some resemblance to Californias noncompete ban, which includes similar exceptions for agreements entered into in relation to the sale of a business interest or the dissolution of a partnership or limited liability company.

Severability and blue penciling Importantly, an unenforceable noncompete provision within a Minnesota agreement will be severable and should not render the rest of the agreement void and unenforceable.

In addition, SF 3035 is silent on blue penciling, a practice by which a court modifies or rewrites a contested contract.

This type of modification is allowed in Minnesota and has been utilized in the past to narrow overly broad noncompetes into reasonable restrictions.

In circumstances that meet the statutes exceptions for permissible noncompetes, it is possible that Minnesota courts may still modify and narrow existing agreements.

Choice of law and venue SF 3035 prohibits employers from including contractual provisions that would require an employee who primarily resides and works in Minnesota to adjudicate claims elsewhere or deprive them of the substantive protection of Minnesota law.

This prohibition applies to litigation and arbitration and is designed to foreclose creative attempts to circumvent the law.

Any such provision within a contract agreed upon after July 1, 2023, is void and unenforceable.

Consequently, all disputes involving Minnesota noncompete agreements will be adjudicated in Minnesota and under Minnesota law.

While it appears that choice of law and venue provisions were meant to apply only to prohibited noncompetes, these restrictions could be interpreted to apply more broadly to all employment agreements  even those without noncompete provisions.

Penalties for noncompliance SF 3035 is largely silent on specific penalties or remedies for noncompliance.

However, the statute does specifically authorize injunctive relief and any other remedies available in the event of a violation.

In addition, the law provides that any employee or independent contractor who seeks to enforce their rights under the law may receive reasonable attorneys fees.

Next steps and practical considerations for employers Employers should promptly review their employment-related agreements and remove any noncompete and venue provisions that would violate Minnesota law.

Employers also should evaluate any customer or client nonsolicitation provisions to assess whether a court might consider such provisions overreaching and de facto noncompetes.

Additionally, employers should focus on alternative methods to protect their confidential and trade secret information, such as confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions, as well as narrowly tailored nonsolicitation restrictions."
Cooley,"Minnesota Set to Ban Most Noncompete Agreements Beginning July 1, 2023","Finally, employers with national workforces, which include employees in many states, should make it a priority to stay abreast of changes in the permissibility of restrictive covenants in the states where they have employees.

On June 20, 2023, the New York Legislature passed a bill that would ban all noncompete agreements for all workers , regardless of salary level or job function.

If signed into law, a ban on noncompetes in New York would become effective within 30 days.

We expect to see more states crack down on nonsolicit and noncompete restrictions in the future.

Cooley,"EU Sustainability Disclosure Rules Impacting US, Asian and Other Non-EU Portfolio Companies","At Cooley, were increasingly speaking to clients in the US, Asia and elsewhere who are surprised by the intensity of environmental, social and governance (ESG) requests and covenants coming from their investors.

Often these requests stem from the disclosure obligations imposed on investors by the European Unions Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

Dont be caught off guard  read our FAQ below.

1.

What are the European financial sustainability disclosure rules?

The SFDR began to apply in 2021, although many of its obligations only became mandatory in 2022 and 2023.

It requires fund managers and other financial market participants to make certain disclosures on their investment decisions and financial products, including the extent to which sustainability information is taken into consideration in investment decisionmaking and advisory processes.

One of the main objectives of the SFDR is to make it easier for investors to distinguish and compare financial products available in the EU.

2.

To whom does the SFDR apply?

The scope of the SFDR is relatively broad, and most EU-based fund managers and investment advisers are required to comply.

In addition, US, Asian and other non-EU fund managers or advisers that market financial products in the EU or provide portfolio management services or investment advice to EU funds need to comply with the SFDR for each product they market to their EU-based clients or EU funds they manage or advise.

3.

How does the SFDR impact US, Asian and other non-EU portfolio companies?

Investors that are in scope of the SFDR are likely to require non-EU portfolio companies to provide information, and possibly also agree to ESG covenants, to enable them to comply with their own obligations under the SFDR.

Clients increasingly are receiving hefty ESG data requests (e.g., for their emissions data or to explain how their activities are aligned with the EU taxonomy).

Clients also are receiving requests to perform certain duties, such as keeping emissions below a certain level, that ultimately can be traced back to investors who are implementing their own SFDR compliance processes.

4.

What kind of information requests can non-EU portfolio companies expect?

To comply with the SFDR, investors and fund managers that are in scope will need certain information from their non-EU portfolio companies, even if those non-EU portfolio companies are not covered by the SFDR.

In our experience, the information requested encompasses a variety of ESG indicators, such as: Environmental  This may include the carbon footprint of the portfolio company, share of nonrenewable energy consumption and nonrenewable energy production of portfolio companies from nonrenewable energy sources compared to renewable energy sources, tonnes of emissions to water generated, and tonnes of hazardous or radioactive waste generated by portfolio companies.

Social  This may include the share of investments in companies without workplace accident prevention policies, share of investments in portfolio companies without any supplier code of conduct (against unsafe working conditions, precarious work, child labour and forced labour), and share of investments in entities without a human rights policy.

Governance  This may include the share of investments in portfolio companies involved in violation of the United Nations Global Compact principles or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises.

EU taxonomy  Portfolio companies often are asked to provide information on the extent to which their activities are aligned with the EU taxonomy, which is a classification system that establishes a list of activities qualifying as environmentally sustainable to the EU.

5.

What disclosures are required from non-EU fund managers?"
Cooley,"EU Sustainability Disclosure Rules Impacting US, Asian and Other Non-EU Portfolio Companies","5.

What disclosures are required from non-EU fund managers?

Non-EU fund managers are required to make fund-level disclosures in respect of funds that they market in the EU, or to which they provide investment advice or portfolio management services.

Certain exemptions apply  e.g., funds selling to EU investors by reverse solicitation generally only will be exempt from the disclosure requirements.

Weve outlined some types of disclosures required of non-EU fund managers with funds covered by the SFDR below.

Pre-contractual disclosures These include explanations of whether and how a financial product considers principal adverse impacts (PAIs) on sustainability factors.

Additional pre-contractual disclosure obligations apply to financial products that promote environmental or social characteristics (sometimes called Article 8 funds or light green funds), and financial products that have sustainable investment as their objective (Article 9 funds or dark green funds).

Periodic reports These include descriptions of the way sustainability risks are integrated into their investment decisions and the results of the assessment of the likely impacts of sustainability risks on returns of their financial products.

Certain fund managers also will have to include in their periodic report an explanation of whether and, if so, how the financial product considers PAIs on sustainability factors.

Again, additional disclosure obligations apply to light and dark green funds.

Website disclosures These include, for light green funds, a description of the environmental or social characteristics of the product and, for dark green funds, the sustainable investment objective of the product.

The European Commission has adopted Regulatory Technical Standards that provide templates for pre-contractual and periodic disclosures.

6. Are there any changes on the horizon?

The European authorities are currently consulting on the review of EU Regulatory Technical Standards , which would have the effect of expanding the SFDR disclosure framework.

This could involve, for example, extending the list of social indicators for PAIs and amendments on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets.

The consultation also aims to address issues with the workability of the SFDR, such as simplification of the templates.

Feedback is open until 4 July 2023.

On 13 June 2023, the European Commission proposed a sustainable finance package that would introduce the following new measures: A proposed regulation on ESG ratings to increase transparency requirements for ESG ratings, with the aim of enabling investors to make better-informed investment decisions.

The adoption of a second EU Taxonomy Delegated Act that would set the criteria for environmentally sustainable activities connected to the following objectives: sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.

This is expected to be adopted shortly and will apply from January 2024.

7.

What other ESG disclosures are required in the EU?

In addition to the SDFR, there is a new law in the EU called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires listed and non-listed companies, including US, Asian and other non-EU parent companies that meet the thresholds, to report on a whole range of ESG metrics, such as climate, pollution, their own workforce, workers in the value chain and business conduct.

Financial market participants and financial advisers may be subject to both disclosure regimes, unless they are explicitly exempted (e.g., alternative investment funds are exempted from the CSRD reporting).

Companies in scope of the CSRD also will need to disclose information on how and to what extent their activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the EU taxonomy."

Cooley,Ephemeral Messages Muddy the Compliance Waters for Cos.,"Authored by Matthew Krengel, Luke Cadigan, Ruth Hauswirth, Andrew Goldstein, this article was originally published in Law360 .

In today's fast-paced business world, the use of messaging apps has become ubiquitous, allowing for quick and efficient communication among employees, executives and directors.

However, the rise in popularity of ephemeral messaging has raised significant regulatory concerns.

Recent warnings from the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have highlighted the potential dangers and compliance issues associated with these communication platforms  and businesses should take note.

In today's business world, employees, executives and directors often don't think twice about what communication platform they're using  and how those choices might be viewed by regulators.

Scenarios like these are common: From a boardroom on the 22nd floor, a CEO sends a message to a member of her board of directors regarding an upcoming product launch using Telegram Messenger, her board's preferred means of communication.

At an industry conference, a vice president of sales, eager to tell a customer about newly unveiled software, fires off a text over Signal using the customer's desired means of communication, as part of a companywide effort to meet the customer where they're at.

Regulators want companies to start paying attention.

Through public statements and recent enforcement actions, the DOJ and the SEC have become increasingly vocal in warning organizations about the dangers inherent in some communication applications  in particular, ephemeral messaging platforms  and have not hesitated to act when they perceive wrongdoing, as recently evidenced in charges and penalties imposed upon financial firms HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. for failing to preserve information required of broker-dealers.

What Is Ephemeral Messaging?

Ephemeral messaging apps are communication platforms offering features that, when enabled, allow users to automatically delete messages after they have been read or after a short amount of time.

While ephemeral messaging has several real-world benefits, including privacy and security, it can be problematic for businesses that need to preserve information for regulatory compliance, litigation or legal holds, or other reasons.

Similar communication mediums and features  such as text messages, in-application chats, end-to-end encryption and direct messages in social media accounts  also raise compliance issues for companies due to their decentralized and inaccessible nature, with the messages often residing on users' devices or accounts beyond the reach of company controls.

Courts and regulatory agencies such as the DOJ have taken notice, cautioning organizations on the potential hazards of using messaging apps for business activities without sufficient policies and procedures in place to monitor compliance and preserve communications when necessary.

Warnings From Regulators At the American Bar Association 's 38th White Collar Crime National Institute in March, senior DOJ officials offered their most expansive guidance yet about the dangers of using ephemeral messaging for company communications.[1]

Officials noted that when evaluating a company's conduct, DOJ prosecutors will consider a company's use of ephemeral and encrypted applications, whether the company preserved those communications and whether those messages are accessible for the investigation, as well as company policies governing such apps.

They also warned in no uncertain terms that if a company does not turn over these types of communications, ""prosecutors will not accept that at face value.

""[2] Where a company fails to produce such communications, prosecutors will further scrutinize the company's ability to access those communications and how they are stored, among other things."
Cooley,Ephemeral Messages Muddy the Compliance Waters for Cos.,"""[2] Where a company fails to produce such communications, prosecutors will further scrutinize the company's ability to access those communications and how they are stored, among other things.

Officials made clear that ""[a] company's answers  or lack of answers  may very well affect the offer it receives to resolve criminal liability.""

The DOJ's most recent comments follow a memorandum from September 2022, recommending that companies institute compensation clawback measures to ensure employees adhere to corporate compliance policies, including policies governing employee use of personal devices and third-party messaging apps, such as Signal, Telegram, Confide and others.[3]

The memo noted that corporations with robust compliance programs should have these types of policies governing use of devices and messaging apps, provide training to employees on the policies and enforce the policies when violations are identified.

It also cautioned that ""[h]ow companies address the use of personal devices and third-party messaging platforms can impact a prosecutor's evaluation of the effectiveness of a corporation's compliance program, as well as the assessment of a corporation's cooperation during a criminal investigation.""

Additional DOJ guidance provided in December 2022 zeroed in on encrypted and ephemeral messaging apps, observing that while there may be legitimate uses for those tools for company business, they can present significant challenges to a company's ability to ensure it has a well-functioning compliance program and, more importantly, the ability to access those communications when required.[4] The DOJ's guidance on messaging apps comes against the backdrop of a renewed focus on corporate enforcement and vigilance against corporate malfeasance.

This is not the first time the DOJ has focused on use of ephemeral messaging apps.

As early as 2017, the DOJ published guidance that organizations being investigated for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations could obtain a cooperation credit only if they disallowed the use of ephemeral messaging by employees.[5]

However, noting that many organizations use ephemeral messaging for legitimate business reasons, the DOJ later softened its stance, instead requiring organizations using ephemeral apps to have safeguards in place to ensure information is properly retained.[6] Actions Against Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers In May, the SEC announced resolutions with registered broker-dealers HSBC Securities and Scotia Capital ""for widespread and longstanding failures by both firms and their employees to maintain and preserve electronic communications.

""[7]

The failures stemmed from employees' use of what the SEC called ""off-channel"" communications, discussing securities matters on their personal devices using messaging applications such as Signal.

According to the SEC, a substantial majority of these communications some from supervisors and senior executives were neither maintained nor preserved.

The SEC found that the conduct violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder, which require broker-dealers to preserve for at least three years originals of all communications received and copies of all communications sent ""relating to its business as such.

""[8]

As a result of the violations, the firms were ordered to pay penalties of $15 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

The penalties were significantly reduced due to the firms' voluntary disclosure of violations and cooperation with the investigation.

Under similar circumstances in September 2022, the SEC and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission reached settlements totaling $1.8 billion with 15 broker-dealers and an investment adviser related to a failure to preserve electronic

communications.[9

]"
Cooley,Ephemeral Messages Muddy the Compliance Waters for Cos.,"communications.[9

]

Regulators again focused on the widespread use of off-channel messaging communications  in particular, text messages and messaging apps  that were not preserved as required of broker-dealers and investment advisers by SEC and CFTC recordkeeping regulations.

In December 2021, the SEC announced a $125 million fine against another large financial institution related to failures to preserve staff communications on personal mobile devices and messaging applications.

The SEC previously highlighted concerns related to ephemeral messaging in a risk alert issued in December 2018[10] reminding registered investment advisers of their retention obligations pursuant to SEC rules.[11]

Noting an increase in the use of text messaging and chat apps to communicate, the SEC recommended that advisers review their policies and processes related to electronic messaging to ensure compliance with retention rules.

In October 2021, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal indicated that companies ""need to be actively thinking about and addressing the many compliance issues raised by the increased use of personal devices, new communications channels, and other technological developments like ephemeral apps.

""[11]

Litigation Pitfalls Messaging apps  particularly those with ephemeral features  and text messages also have created problems for parties in litigation, particularly in the context of preservation obligations in discovery.

In 2019's Herzig v. Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Western District Of Arkansas,[12] the defendant alleged that the plaintiffs decided to install and use the ephemeral messaging application Signal to intentionally destroy discoverable evidence, despite the fact that they were subject to legal holds.

The court found that the Signal communications were most likely responsive and that the plaintiffs' decision to use Signal was done in bad faith.

Organizations that do not have controls or effective legal hold policies in place also run the risk of increased costs, as the focus of the case shifts away from the merits to expensive discovery disputes that could result in case-ending sanctions.

Because ephemeral messaging apps are so popular, it is imperative that companies have enforceable policies and controls in place to minimize legal and compliance risks from employee use of them.

Below are some actions that companies can take: Create and implement practical retention policies for electronic messaging applications that are authorized by the company and ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations.

This includes monitoring compliance and addressing noncompliant use of prohibited applications for business purposes.

These policies also need to harmonize with the organization's acceptable use policies for technology and clearly define business communications and messaging guidelines.

Design functional mobile device policies and administer mobile device managementsoftware to manage applications on devices used for business purposes, including personal devices that are used under a bring-your-own-device policy.

Personal devices, in particular, introduce additional challenges when it comes to preservation and collection of information needed in an investigation and litigation.

Even if a company does not approve use of a certain application, be wary of the popularity of such messaging applications and address usage in a policy.

Establish proactive legal hold response procedures to prepare for potential litigation or regulatory activity.

Develop training programs to educate employees regarding company policies and permissible communication applications, as well as prohibited applications for business purposes.

Empower employees to understand their role in helping the company manage risk."
Cooley,Ephemeral Messages Muddy the Compliance Waters for Cos.,"Empower employees to understand their role in helping the company manage risk.

Conclusion Given the increased attention being paid by regulators, opposing parties and judges, organizations must take great care in navigating these increasingly challenging waters with vigilance, education and well-conceived and executed policies and processes.

Cooley,One Step Closer to a European Law Regulating Artificial Intelligence,"On 14 June 2023, the European Parliament adopted its negotiating position on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act.

The European Parliaments vote on the AI Act proposal marks a significant milestone toward the regulation of AI within the European Union, as it sets the baseline for inter-institutional negotiations, as further discussed below.

The proposed AI Act follows a risk-based approach, banning AI applications that pose an unacceptable level of risk and imposing a strict regime for high-risk use cases.

It also establishes obligations for AI providers and those deploying AI systems that are tailored to the level of risk posed by the AI.

The European Parliament expanded its initial list of AI systems with an unacceptable level of risk to include bans on intrusive and discriminatory uses of AI  such as real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces, biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, religion and/or political orientation), predictive policing systems (based on profiling, location or past criminal behavior), emotion recognition systems in law enforcement, border management, the workplace and educational institutions, or untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage to create facial recognition databases.

Providers of foundation models  i.e., AI modelstrained on a large amount of unlabeled data that can be adapted to many applications  will have to assess and mitigate possible risks to health, safety or fundamental rights and register their models in an EU database before releasing them on the EU market.

In addition to this, it will be mandatory for generative AI systems based on such models to comply with a series of transparency requirements, including an obligation to disclose when content is AI-generated and to ensure safeguards against generating deep fake content.

On the other hand, the European Parliaments position adds exemptions for research activities and AI components provided under open-source licenses, as well as the establishment in every EU member state of at least one regulatory sandbox  a controlled environment established by a public authority that facilitates the safe development, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their placement on the market or putting them into service pursuant to a specific plan under regulatory supervision.

As far as citizens rights are concerned, the European Parliaments position recognizes the right to file complaints about AI systems and receive explanations of decisions that are made based on high-risk AI systems that significantly impact citizens fundamental rights.

Following the European Parliaments adoption of its position on the AI Act, the inter-institutional negotiations with the European Council, European governments representatives and the European Commission in the so-called trilogue will take place.

The negotiations will kick off on 21 June, with a deal expected to be reached by November 2023.

Expected to enter into force no later than the beginning of 2024, the AI Act will not only have an extraterritorial reach  as it will be applicable to providers and users outside the EU when the output produced by the system is used within the EU  but it also foresees fines of the higher of up to 40 million euros or up to 7% of a companys total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year.

Cooley,EU’s New Mandatory ESG Reporting Rules: Don’t Miss Your Chance to Comment,"In January 2023, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires EU and non-EU companies with activities in Europe to file annual sustainability reports.

These reports need to be prepared in accordance with European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).

On June 9, 2023, the European Commission published a draft of the first set of ESRS .

The draft runs 247 pages long and includes 12 standards in total: 10 topical standards (summarised below) and two cross-cutting standards that provide more detail on how to prepare the sustainability report.

The draft standards The table below summarises the 10 topical environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, each of which sets out the data points to be reported and explains when reporting is mandatory and when it is voluntary.

Environmental E1 Climate change Disclosures on climate change mitigation, climate   change adaptation and energy consumption.

Disclosures on climate change   mitigation relate to the entitys endeavors to limit global warming to 1.5C in line with the Paris   Agreement and disclosures on Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas   emissions and transition risks.

E2 Pollution Disclosures on pollution of   the air, water, soil, living organisms and food resources, as well as the use   of substances of concern and microplastics.

This standard covers pollutants   generated or used during production processes and that leave facilities as   emissions, products, or as part of products or services.

E3 Water and marine resources Disclosures on consumption,   withdrawal and discharge from and into water (including ground and surface water)   and marine resources.

It also requires consideration of the extraction and   use of marine resources.

E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems Disclosures covering areas   such as the drivers of biodiversity loss, impact on species, and impacts and   dependencies on ecosystems.

E5 Circular economy Disclosures on resource   inflows, outflows, waste, resource optimization and risks of the transition to   a circular economy.

A circular economy is one in which the value of products,   materials and other resources in the economy are maintained for as long as   possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, and thereby   reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the   release of hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle.

Social S1 Own workforce Disclosures on the companys   own workforce  including freedom of association, working conditions, access   to equal opportunities and other work-related rights.

S2 Workers in the value   chain This standard is similar to   ESRS S1 in content but requires consideration of the workers in the companys   value chain(s).

S3 Affected communities Disclosures on the impact of   a companys own operations and value chain  including its products and   services, impact on indigenous rights, civil rights, and social and economic   rights, including water and sanitation, among others.

S4 Consumers and end-users Disclosures on the impacts of a companys products   and/or services on consumers and end-users.

This includes access to quality   information, privacy and the protection of children.

Companies are not   required to consider the unlawful use or misuse of products or services.

Governance G1 Business conduct Disclosures on   anti-corruption and anti-bribery practices, the protection of whistleblowers,   political lobbying and the management of relationships with suppliers   (including payment practices).

Value chain reporting The CSRD and reporting standards require EU reporting entities to consider and  where necessary  report on the impacts of their business, and their upstream and downstream value chain, on each of these topics.

This is broader than other reporting frameworks.

Materiality The materiality assessment is the starting point for reporting under the ESRS."
Cooley,EU’s New Mandatory ESG Reporting Rules: Don’t Miss Your Chance to Comment,"This is broader than other reporting frameworks.

Materiality The materiality assessment is the starting point for reporting under the ESRS.

Companies are required to assess and report on material sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) in their value chain under each of the 10 topical standards outlined above.

If, following the materiality assessment, a given sustainability matter is assessed to be material, the company must disclose against the relevant topical ESRS.

The CSRD follows the double materiality principle, meaning that businesses need to consider what is material from both: The investor perspective , which means reporting on ESG matters material to the companys value creation.

The wider stakeholder perspective , which means reporting on ESG matters material to the companys impact on the economy, environment, nature and people.

A sustainability matter is material for CSRD reporting if either of the two is satisfied.

Compared to previous drafts of the ESRS, there is a move away from mandatory disclosures and more of a focus on materiality (e.g., it is only mandatory to disclose climate IROs if material for the business or its value chain).

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group is currently working on guidance to provide more explanations on how companies should conduct their materiality assessments.

Reporting risks Outside of the mandatory disclosures, the draft ESRS do not require businesses to disclose any information that is nonmaterial to the business.

The draft ESRS explain that nonmaterial information is only permitted in narrow circumstances to avoid obscuring material information with puffery.

Businesses should be aware of this when drafting their sustainability reports to avoid risks of greenwashing allegations.

Mandatory disclosures Irrespective of a companys materiality assessment, the company will always be required to report in full against the disclosure requirements and data points, which are set out in the ESRS on general disclosures.

Mandatory disclosures include the role of management on sustainability matters, the integration of sustainability-related performance incentive schemes and an explanation of the processes used to identify the companys IROs, how materiality was assessed, and how those IROs deemed material interact with the companys strategy and business model.

Permitted exclusions Companies are not required to disclose specific information on intellectual property, know-how or results of innovation, even if such information is material.

In addition, certain EU member states may, at national law, also permit companies to omit information on impending developments or matters under negotiation.

In each case where a company relies on an exemption, it must disclose this to be the case.

Next steps Following the public consultation, which closes on July 7, 2023, the European Commission may amend the draft ESRS.

The updated draft will then be formally approved and adopted into EU law, which we anticipate before the end of 2023.

The law will take the form of an EU regulation that will apply directly in all 27 EU member states.

Other sets of standards will be adopted in the coming years for businesses operating in high-risk sectors, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and non-EU parent companies.

This is the last time the standards will be open for comment, so stakeholders are encouraged to provide input .

Cooley,CMA Review Could Help Shape UK's AI Landscape,"Editor's note: Authored by Anna Caro, Leo Spicer-Phelps and Claire Temple, with contribution from Caroline Hobson, this article was originally published in Law360 .

On May 4, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority announced the launch of an initial review of the market for artificial intelligence foundation models.[1]

Through this initial review, the CMA aims to establish an early understanding of the competition and consumer protection principles that could best guide the development of the market for AI foundation models in the U.K.

The initial review is taking place against the background of the CMA's role as the U.K.'s competition and consumer protection regulator and is in line with its continued focus on the digital sector in the U.K.

The review follows the publication of the U.K. government's March 2023 white paper on AI,[2] which sets out the government's proposed framework on regulating AI.

It also gives instructions to the CMA to consider how the innovative development and deployment of AI can be supported against five overarching principles: Safety, security and robustness; Appropriate transparency and explainability; Fairness; Accountability and governance; and Contestability and redress.

Depending on the CMA's findings, the initial review may be a precursor to a more in-depth investigation into the U.K. market for foundation models.

Any findings are highly likely to be used by the CMA to feed into its recommendations to the U.K. government concerning future legislative and regulatory changes affecting this sector.

In this context, the CMA has also recently published a response to the government's white paper, which provides some insights into the CMA's emerging views on the subject.

Foundation Models Broadly speaking, foundation models are a class of AI system that are trained on massive unlabeled datasets and require significant compute resources to enable such training.

These models can be fine-tuned or trained within specific contexts to serve as the basis or foundation of various potential deployed AI applications, which may ultimately be used by consumers or business users.

Prominent examples include: Open AI's ChatGPT-4and other large language models, which can be used to generate natural language responses to user prompts and engage in dialogues with users in a coherent and conversational manner; and Stability AI's Stable Diffusionand other text-to-image models, which can be used to generate hyperrealistic images based on users' text prompts.

Scope of CMA's Initial Review The launch document of the review published by the CMA emphasizes that ""the best way to help emerging technologies reach their maximum potential for people and businesses is by enabling them to develop in open, competitive markets.""

Consequently, the CMA is focusing its initial review on three core areas: Competition and barriers to entry in the development of foundation models, e.g., in respect of accessing the requisite data and compute resources necessary to train these models, access to talent and funding, and the ways in which these foundation models could disrupt or reinforce the position of the largest firms; The impact foundation models may have on competition in other markets, e.g., the implications of certain foundation models and associated capabilities, which may be controlled by a limited number of large organizations, becoming necessary for companies to compete effectively in other markets, such as search or productivity; and Consumer protection, e.g., in respect of risks arising from the use of foundation models in products and services made available to consumers, including in relation to false or misleading information generated as outputs from technologies supported by such models.

Within the scope of its review, the CMA will not only consider the current conditions but also how the market may develop in the near future."
Cooley,CMA Review Could Help Shape UK's AI Landscape,"Within the scope of its review, the CMA will not only consider the current conditions but also how the market may develop in the near future.

The relatively narrow scope of this review is consistent with the CMA's mandate as the U.K.'s competition and consumer protection regulator.

However, the CMA's announcement emphasizes that the review is intended to operate in line with the U.K. government's March 2023 white paper on AI,[3] which sets out the government's policy plans for the development of a pro-innovation approach to AI regulation in the U.K. CMA's Next Steps In addition to collating and evaluating existing research in the area, the CMA will rely on various sources of evidence to perform its analysis in the focus areas noted, including: Voluntary submissions: The CMA has invited interested parties to make submissions on the review.

Stakeholder information requests: The CMA plans to issue information requests to key stakeholders.

This is to includedevelopers, researchers and suppliers of inputs such as compute and data, as well as customers and investors.

Meetings: The CMA also plans to hold bilateral meetings with key interested parties.

The evidence and analysis will inform a written report that will set out the CMA's findings.

The report may include recommendations to the government on implementing the legislative and regulatory aims set out in its recent white paper, as well as guidance to suppliers, developers, businesses and end users.

The CMA plans to publish its findings in early September.

Potential Effects and Outcomes Any outcomes from the CMA's initial review could help shape the U.K.'s burgeoning AI sector and determine the U.K.'s and U.K. businesses' role in the global AI landscape.

It also could have a material impact on any U.K. and international businesses looking to do business in the AI sector or leveraging AI-enabled technologies or solutions in the U.K. In preparing next steps, the CMA will want to ensure that it is taking actions and recommending next steps that protect U.K. consumers against any harmful effects from AI.

However, scrutiny of its recent merger decisions may increase the pressure on the CMA to avoid overly prescriptive regulation, and it will have to strike a balance between using its tools to prevent harm to U.K. consumers and encouraging a thriving ecosystem that fosters innovation in a nascent market.

In this context, the CMA's response to the government's white paper on AI regulation[4] might foreshadow some of the effects and outcomes from its review.

In its response, the CMA gave its support to the government's proposed approach of leveraging and building on existing regulatory regimes while also establishing a central coordination function for monitoring and support in regulating AI.

The CMA also expressed its support for the government's proposal of placing the five overarching principles for the development and deployment of AI on a nonstatutory footing in the first instance, in contrast to the approach taken by the European Union , which has proposed regulating AI through the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act.

However, in light of more recent commentary, including from U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, emphasizing the existential risks posed by AI,[5] the U.K.'s AI strategy may ultimately move away from the nonstatutory approach outlined in the white paper.

The CMA also noted that as a result of the cross-sector and cross-discipline impact of AI, it saw value of coordination across regulators, either through the government's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and independent regulator, or through a more informal body akin to the existing U.K. Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, which was established in 2020 to ensure greater cooperation between regulators on digital matters."
Cooley,CMA Review Could Help Shape UK's AI Landscape,"This is consistent with an ongoing regulatory trend in the EU and U.K. of using cross-sectoral tools and regulations to address concerns in the digital sector, such as with the EU Digital Markets Act and the draft U.K. Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill.

If the CMA identifies any competition or consumer protection issues in respect of the U.K.'s market for foundation models or related industries, it may investigate these further, e.g., through a lengthier market investigation.

While market investigations can be effective tools to introduce regulation to markets that are not working well, their length 18 months from the date of reference may make one unappealing in this instance.

If the CMA receives evidence that entities active in the sector have breached competition or consumer requirements, it also could launch enforcement action into suspected breaches.

The U.K.'s focus on AI, as evidenced by the launch of the initial review, the government's white paper and recent guidance from other regulators, such as the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office , is consistent with large-scale regulatory scrutiny and activity in this sector across the globe.

While it is expected that the U.K. will take steps to regulate AI, whether through legislative measures or on the basis of voluntary measures, and despite the U.K. wishing to set itself apart as a pro-innovation AI hub, the CMA's recommendations and U.K. government's policy in this area may well end up being shaped, to a greater or lesser degree by the policy and regulatory approaches adopted by authorities in other key markets, notably, the U.S. and EU.

Indeed, it appears that that process may already be underway, with a seemingly increased appetite within the U.K. government to implement more prescriptive regulatory constraints around the development and deployment of AI.

The U.K. government is also expected to act swiftly to seek to foster international cooperation on this topic, e.g., the U.K. and U.S. recently issued the Atlantic Declaration, setting out an intention to cooperate to ensure the safe and responsible development of AI technologies.[6]

Given this backdrop, it appears that there is potential that certain elements of the CMA's initial review may be overtaken by a fast-changing landscape.

The world that the CMA was instructed to review earlier this year may look significantly different come September.

Cooley,Banking Regulators Release Guidance on Third-Party Partnerships,"On June 6, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued final joint guidance on managing risks associated with third-party relationships.

Promulgated after the publication of and comments from stakeholders on the July 2021 proposed guidance , this final guidance details a risk-based approach to evaluating, negotiating and monitoring third-party partnerships under which banks are expected to provide more scrutiny to partnerships that are more complex, risky or operationally critical.

While the guidance specifically notes the significant benefits of third-party partnerships, such as those with fintechs, the regulators emphasize the risks that third-party relationships present  and they note that the use of third parties does not relieve a banking organization of its responsibility to comply with existing laws and regulations.

This guidance replaces each agencys existing guidance on third-party relationships.

Risk-based approach to third-party partnerships The guidance emphasizes that to facilitate sound risk management, banks should adopt risk management practices that are commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their respective third-party relationships.

As such relationships present different levels and types of risk, not all third-party relationships require the same extent of oversight or risk management, and it is the responsibility of each banking organization to determine the risks associated with each third-party partner and calibrate its risk management processes accordingly.

The guidance does not prescribe specific requirements for oversight of third parties, but it sets forth principles and examples of considerations that may be relevant to banking organizations throughout the course of a risk management life cycle based on its specific third-party relationships.

For example, the regulators suggest that banks consider: Maintaining a complete inventory of their third-party relationships and conducting periodic risk assessments of each relationship.

Conducting proper due diligence, including evaluating whether a third party has the proper licenses or approvals to operate and the third partys subcontracting arrangements.

Reviewing whether contracts specify the legal obligations of each party to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The guidance specifically addresses the growing prevalence of fintech partnerships under new or novel arrangements with banking institutions.

Suggesting the potential for new or increased risk due to, for example, the differing roles and responsibilities of fintechs and banks as compared to other third-party relationships and the different levels of interaction with customers of each party, the guidance notes that banks must understand how the arrangement with a third party  is structured so that the banking organization may assess the types and levels of risks posed and determine how to manage those third-party relationships accordingly.

This guidance extends to any business arrangement between a banking organization and another entity, including those not structured by contract.

Despite comments from industry suggesting the term business arrangement (which is meant to be synonymous with the term third-party relationship) was overly broad, the regulators suggest that the terms are intentionally expansive, intended to capture not only the full range of third-party relationships that may pose risk to banking organizations, but also types of partnerships that may develop in the future."
Cooley,Banking Regulators Release Guidance on Third-Party Partnerships,"In addition, the FDIC clarified in a Financial Institution Letter issued along with the guidance that relationships between banks and their direct customers of traditional bank products and services (such as deposit accounts or retail or commercial loans) would not be addressed in a third-party risk management framework and are covered by the various risk management processes and rules that apply to traditional lending and deposit relationships.

However, bank relationships with third parties engaged in lending, payment or deposit activities for the benefit of the bank or through the bank should be evaluated by banks using both the third party risk management guidance and the various risk management processes and rules that apply to traditional lending and deposit relationships.

Historical and continued focus on third-party risks While prudential regulators have a long-standing history of emphasizing the potential risk of third-party partnerships (such as through the now rescinded 2008 FDIC guidance on third-party risk, the 2013 Fed guidance, and the 2013 OCC guidance and 2020 FAQs), we have seen enhanced activity in this arena likely due to the rise of banking as a service, digital banking, and increased vendor usage and the associated increase of third-party relationships.

In March of this year, the FDIC took action against a bank that made loans in connection with a fintech partnership, suggesting the bank engaged in  unsafe or unsound banking practices related to its compliance with applicable fair lending laws and regulations.

The consent order requires the bank to implement third-party compliance oversight and internal controls, including conducting a risk assessment of all third-party relationships to identify fair lending risks and obtaining the FDICs approval for any new third-party partners, among other requirements.

Similarly, the OCC in September 2022 assessed penalties against a bank for unsafe or unsound practice(s), including those relating to third-party risk management.

The agreement with the OCC requires the bank to, among other things, implement and thereafter adhere to a written program to effectively assess and manage the risks posed by third-party fintech relationships  commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of those partnerships.

Fintech companies that partner with banks likely will see enhanced compliance obligations and oversight as banks continue to see increased regulatory scrutiny in connection with such partnerships."
Cooley,FCC Extends Accessibility Requirements to Videoconferencing Services,"Under the provisions of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (CVAA), communications providers and manufacturers of communications equipment generally must make their services and equipment accessible to and usable by people with all types of disabilities, including vision, hearing, and physical and cognitive challenges.

Accessibility requirements apply to virtually all equipment and technologies that allow consumers to communicate, even when the communications function is an ancillary feature, such as player in-game texts and chats using a video game console or a communications device in an automobile.

However, because of uncertainty about a specific word in the CVAA, accessibility requirements have not been applied to videoconferencing.

That is about to change.

On June 12, 2023, the Federal Communications Commission released a report and order, notice of proposed rulemaking, and order that requires access to videoconferencing by people with disabilities.

In the report and order, the FCC finds that the existing accessibility requirements for advanced communications services (ACS) apply to commonly used videoconferencing services.

Those accessibility requirements include record-keeping requirements, an annual compliance certification and performance objectives.

The performance objectives require manufacturers and service providers to ensure their equipment and services are accessible to, usable by and compatible with people with disabilities as defined by the FCCs rules.

For example, input and control functions must be identifiable and operable by users with limited vision, hearing, speech, color perception, manual dexterity, reach and strength, or cognitive skills.

Videoconferencing providers that cant meet one or more of the FCCs ACS accessibility requirements will need to seek waivers of the applicable rules and should start laying the groundwork now with the FCC to get those waivers granted.

Providers of videoconferencing services and equipment will have one year and 30 days from Federal Register publication of the report and order to come into compliance with the FCCs current ACS accessibility requirements.

In addition to requiring videoconferencing providers to comply with the general ACS rules, the FCC is proposing the addition of specific performance objectives for videoconferencing in areas such as speech-to-text capabilities, text-to-speech capabilities and enabling the use of sign language.

The FCC is asking for public comment on its proposals, as well as comment on whether additional performance objectives are needed to support individuals with disabilities other than vision or hearing and on the integration of telecommunications relay services with videoconferencing.

Comments and reply comments on the FCCs proposals will be due 30 and 60 days, respectively, after the notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal Register.

Cooley,FCC Adopts New Rules for Field Disturbance Sensor Devices Operating in 60 GHz Band,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a Report and Order that updates its rules for the 60 gigahertz (GHz) band, which spans 57 to 71 GHz.

The new rules permit the use of unlicensed field disturbance sensors (FDS) in the 60 GHz band to support a wide array of new applications.

Field disturbance sensors are devices that establish a radio frequency field in their vicinity and detect changes in that field resulting from the movement of people or objects within range.

These sensors can help detect children left in dangerously hot cars, enhance the ability of unmanned aircraft (UA) to sense and avoid people and obstacles, and enable touchless control of devices, among many other uses.

The new rules: Clarify the relationship between radars and FDS applications by classifying radars as a subcategory of FDS.

Permit various power levels for specific uses and sub-bands.

Permit FDS operation on board UA flying less than 400 feet above ground level.

Specifically, the FCC will permit the following for FDS devices: Up to 20 decibels per milliwatt (dBm) peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for indoor operation, and up to 30 dBm peak EIRP for outdoor operation, including all vehicular applications, within the 57.0  59.4 GHz band.

Up to 3 dBm peak EIRP for all operations within the 57.0 to 61.56 GHz band.

Up to 20 dBm peak EIRP for all operations within the 57.0 to 61.56 GHz band, subject to a 50% duty cycle.

Up to 14 dBm peak EIRP for all operations within the 57 to 64 GHz band, subject to a 22.7% duty cycle.

Up to 20 dBm peak EIRP for fixed outdoor operations or vehicular applications (except in-cabin vehicular use cases) within the 57 to 64 GHz band, subject to a 50% duty cycle.

The new rules will be effective 30 days after the order is published in the Federal Register.

Six months after the rules go into effect, all current 60 GHz waivers will be terminated, and devices approved under the waivers will need to comply with the new rules before they can be marketed and sold in the US.

Although the FCC is terminating 60 GHz waivers, devices that were certified to be marketed and operate under the waiver can continue to be used, so long as they do not cause harmful interference.

If you would like additional information on the new rules, please contact one of the Cooley lawyers listed below."
Cooley,Key Principles From EEOC’s Latest Guidance on Employers’ Use of AI Tools,"Recently, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) made clear that it intends to make discrimination caused by artificial intelligence (AI) tools an enforcement priority over the next four years.

This enforcement priority follows the EEOCs 2021 announcement of its Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative , which launched an agencywide effort to ensure AI tools and other emerging technologies used in making employment decisions comply with the federal civil rights laws that the EEOC enforces.

In keeping with the agencys new focus on this issue, on May 18, 2023, the EEOC issued a technical assistance document that provides employers using AI in employment decisions with guidance on compliance considerations under Title VII.

This recent guidance follows the agencys technical assistance document on AI and the Americans with Disabilities Act issued last May.

While neither guidance document has the force of law, they represent warnings from an agency that has focused on employers use of automated systems.

Although Title VII applies to all employment practices, the scope of the recent guidance is limited to employers use of algorithmic decision-making tools (i.e . , types of software or applications that incorporate a set of instructions intended to accomplish a defined end goal) in selection procedures  including hiring, promotion and firing, and the potential for such use to have adverse or disparate impacts on the basis of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of persons.

As the guidance makes clear, employers and software vendors using AI to help, develop or implement algorithmic decision-making tools need to analyze these tools to confirm their use is not adversely impacting any group protected under Title VII.

Below are key principles for employers.

1.

A wide variety of AI tools are subject to EEOC scrutiny The agency identified various examples of algorithmic decision-making tools that may incorporate AI (i.e., AI tools) and result in disparate impacts that trigger Title VII violations.

These AI tools  which implement algorithmic decision-making at different stages of the employment process  include: Rsum scanners that prioritize certain keywords.

Employee-monitoring software that rates employees on the basis of keystrokes or other factors.

Virtual assistants or chatbots.

Video interviewing software.

Testing software that provides job fit scores for applicants regarding their personalities, aptitudes, cognitive skills or perceived cultural fit.

2. Selection procedures using AI tools must be job-related and consistent with business necessity While the focus of the guidance is on AI tools, the agency recognizes that the algorithmic decision-making tools discussed may not actually rely on AI to accomplish the defined goal.

As such, the guidance is directed at all algorithmic decision-making tools  not just those that employ AI.

The agency makes clear that employers use of algorithmic decision-making tools can constitute selection procedures subject to the EEOCs 1978 Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (which provides guidance for employers in determining whether their tests and selection procedures are Title VII-compliant) when the tools are used to make or inform decisions about whether to hire, promote, terminate or take similar actions.

Thus, the guidance confirms the agencys expectation that employers assess whether their selection procedures incorporating the use of such tools have an adverse impact on a particular group and, if the use is not job-related and consistent with business necessity, take appropriate remedial measures."
Cooley,Key Principles From EEOC’s Latest Guidance on Employers’ Use of AI Tools,"Further, the guidance indicates that even if an employer can demonstrate that a selection procedure is job-related and consistent with business necessity, they should still assess other less discriminatory alternatives available that would be comparably as effective, but not disproportionately exclude individuals of protected classes.

3.

The four-fifths rule is a general rule of thumb but is not dispositive in all circumstances The EEOC also noted that the four-fifths rule  a rule that states a selection rate for one group is substantially different from the selection rate of another group if the ratio between the two rates is less than four-fifths (or 80%)  can continue to be used as a general rule of thumb to assess whether a selection process could have a disparate impact.

However, the agency clarified that it may not be appropriate in all circumstances.

For example, relying on the rule may be inappropriate where an employers actions have discouraged individuals from applying disproportionately on grounds of a protected characteristic, or where it is not a reasonable substitute for a test of statistical significance.

To that end, the agency recommends that employers ask software vendors whether they relied on the four-fifths rule or on a standard such as statistical significance, where applicable.

4. Employers are responsible for use of algorithmic decision-making tools The agencys guidance makes clear that employers cannot rely on the representations of outside vendors or developers of AI tools regarding any disparate impact assessments, as employers can be held responsible for the actions of vendors who act on their behalf.

The guidance notes, if the vendor is incorrect about its own assessment and the tool does result in either disparate impact discrimination or disparate treatment discrimination, the employer could still be liable.

The agency recommends that employers ask vendors if steps have been taken to evaluate whether the tools use causes a substantially lower selection rate for individuals with a protected characteristic.

5.

Employers should proactively conduct self-analyses of AI tools for discrimination issues The guidance concludes with the recommendation that employers conduct ongoing self-analyses of their AI tools for potential discrimination issues.

The EEOC recommends that employers who discover a tool would have an adverse impact take steps to reduce the impact, or select a different tool to avoid potential Title VII violations.

Next steps The EEOCs latest guidance follows the agencys recent pledge with other federal agencies against discrimination and bias in automated systems, as noted in this May 2023 Cooley alert on New York City and automated employment decision tools .

Along with increasing federal focus, employers using AI in employment processes should be on the lookout for developments regulating the use of these tools from the state and local levels, including in New York City.

Employers using or considering conducting self-audits of their AI tools should consult with their Cooley employment attorney."
Cooley,"See You in Court? Not so Fast … State Secrets Litigation Traps for the Unwary, Overreaching Federal Contractor","GRID Networks LLC v. Quantum Leap Research LLC, et al. , a recent case from the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA), is a fascinating illustration of the litigation challenges government contractors face when they attempt to sue their competitors and/or involve, even tangentially, their intelligence community customers in the process.

The Quantum Leap Research case, on its face, had all the hallmarks of a classic commercial dispute between competitors  but with a twist.

GRID, an entity that assists government customers with telecommunications infrastructure, internet protocol (IP) networking and secure communications in the area of national security, was started by a well-known founder and operator in the national security government contractor community.

In 2018, Peraton, a large government contractor, acquired GRID (then, Strategic Resources International).

A year after the acquisition, the GRID founder departed GRID and founded Quantum Leap Research, another entity providing national security services to federal intelligence community customers.

Thereafter, GRID threatened to sue Quantum Leap Research.

In June 2020, GRID and Quantum Leap Research reached a resolution of their differences, under which Quantum Leap Research agreed that it would not  before April 2022  hire any GRID employee or any person that was a GRID employee in the six months preceding the hire.

Almost immediately prior to the expiration of that agreement, in April 2022, GRID again threatened to sue, claiming that Quantum Leap Research violated the parties agreement  allegations that Quantum Leap Research denied.

On June 21, 2022, GRID filed a lawsuit in the Fairfax County Circuit Court (a Virginia state court) against Quantum Leap Research and several of its employees, claiming that they breached their contractual obligations to GRID, and that they tortiously interfered with GRIDs contractual expectancies with employees and customers.

GRID sought $14 million in damages, citing the alleged loss of a strategic and lucrative contract with one of its government customers purportedly due to GRIDs employee churn.

GRID also submitted with its complaint extensive discovery requests seeking detailed information concerning Quantum Leap Researchs customer contracts, as well as details around its products and services provided to those customers.

Given the classified nature of the work that GRID and Quantum Leap Research perform for their government customers, and the fact that the GRID complaint (and discovery requests) put these matters squarely at issue, Quantum Leap Research removed the matter to federal court  the EDVA  in July 2022.

Specifically, the removal motion asserted that the matter implicated a substantial question of federal law under the 150-year-old, so-called Totten Rule and/or the state secrets privilege.

Totten v. United States , 92 US 105 (1875), is a seminal US Supreme Court case, rooted in the Constitution, that prevents courts from hearing cases to the extent that litigating them could involve disclosure of contracts that provide secret services to the US government.

The state secrets doctrine, on the other hand, is an evidentiary privilege that may be invoked only by the US to prevent disclosure of information in litigation if doing so would harm national security  see United States v. Reynolds , 345 US 1 (1953).

In the case at hand, Quantum Leap Research asserted that neither party could litigate the matter without delving into classified material in discovery and seeking to introduce such sensitive information as evidence in the litigation.

GRID opposed the removal and sought to remand the matter to state court, arguing that the parties could use unclassified code names to refer to the contracts and customers at issue.

Within a week of Quantum Leap Researchs removal, the US government filed a notice that it was evaluating a potential intervention in the matter."
Cooley,"See You in Court? Not so Fast … State Secrets Litigation Traps for the Unwary, Overreaching Federal Contractor","Within a week of Quantum Leap Researchs removal, the US government filed a notice that it was evaluating a potential intervention in the matter.

(The US government can intervene in any civil suit to which it is not a party for the purpose of asserting the state secrets privilege.)

Three months later, the government moved to intervene, without yet formally invoking the state secrets privilege (although the government submitted classified memoranda to the EDVA, presumably laying out its initial national security concerns implicated by GRIDs filing).

The EDVA, for its part, effectively stayed substantive briefing on the matter, pending the governments lengthy evaluation of the state secrets privilege against the allegations of GRIDs complaint.

On March 3, 2023, nearly seven months after it first noticed its potential intervention, the government formally invoked the state secrets privilege and moved to dismiss GRIDs complaint in its entirety  a move the US government typically seeks to avoid by instead engaging in an informal process with the parties directly.

The governments filing included supporting declarations from no less than two Cabinet officials  the director of national intelligence (DNI) and the secretary of defense.

Under settled law, the state secrets privilege may only be invoked after a privileged claim has been lodged by the applicable head of the government department that had control over the matter after actual personal consideration by that officer Reynolds , at 7-8 (emphasis added).

The DNIs supporting declaration stated that disclosure of the information implicated by this litigation could result in serious, and potentially grave, damage to the security of the United States, including sources, methods, capabilities, activities or interests of the intelligence community that could be damaging to US national security.

Similarly, the secretary of defense concluded that disclosure of the information implicated by GRIDs complaint would pose an unacceptable risk to sensitive military and intelligence programs.

On March 31, 2023, the EDVA denied GRIDs motion to remand, thereby confirming that the US governments invocation of the state secrets privilege required the matter to remain in federal court.

Apparently recognizing the practical futility of further litigation on the pending motions to dismiss (the governments on state secrets grounds and Quantum Leap Researchs on the merits), GRID filed a notice of dismissal, and the EDVA dismissed the matter without prejudice on April 11, 2023  almost exactly a year after the dispute began.

Historically, few cases involving the governments invocation of the state secrets privilege proceed after the government brings a motion to dismiss.

This case is a master class on the pitfalls of overreaching in litigation.

Despite the fact that the essence of GRIDs underlying complaint was a routine employee poaching concern, GRIDs attempt to assert a creative theory of damages unwittingly doomed its own litigation position  and potentially harmed its standing with its own customer base.

Thus, let this case be a cautionary tale for the unwary federal contractor to the intelligence community.

The key lessons that every federal contractor should take from this matter are these: Of course, commercial disputes arise, regardless of the industry.

But if you are a federal contractor, think twice before suing your competitor if your work implicates national security.

If there is a reasonable path to a commercial resolution of a dispute with your competitor, take it.

If a resolution is truly not possible, carefully assess the litigation risk and formulate a strategy around the risk that you or your opponent will find it necessary to disclose classified information as part of the litigation process.

Understand that if it is necessary for you or your opponent to implicate intelligence community customers in your litigation, you probably have a losing strategy."
Cooley,"See You in Court? Not so Fast … State Secrets Litigation Traps for the Unwary, Overreaching Federal Contractor","Understand that if it is necessary for you or your opponent to implicate intelligence community customers in your litigation, you probably have a losing strategy.

If employee attrition (particularly to a competitor) is a concern, carefully review your employment agreements with employees (and transaction documents covering your M&A activities) to ensure you have appropriately tailored restrictions.

But understand that even with careful drafting, enforcing those restrictions is procedurally challenging (as illustrated by this case).

Additionally, many states have passed legislation making post-termination noncompetition agreements increasingly difficult to enforce.

Finally, realize that the best path to staving off employee attrition is to look inward, and ensure that your culture and compensation structures are designed to attract and retain your best talent."
Cooley,Supreme Court Ruling Confirms Limits on Parody Defenses to Trademark Claims,"On June 8, 2023, the US Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Jack Daniels Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products that confirms limits on the scope of parody defenses in certain trademark cases.

The Supreme Court held that the Rogers test for identifying protected fair uses of trademarks in expressive works does not apply if the challenged mark is used as a mark.

That is, if a trademark infringement claim is based on how an alleged infringer designates the source of its own goods or services, then a court must conduct the standard likelihood of confusion analysis for trademark infringement, even where the alleged infringement constitutes a parody or other commentary.

Relatedly, if a trademark dilution claim is based on the use of a challenged mark as a mark, then it is not protected by the statutory noncommercial exclusion to trademark dilution, even if that challenged use is parody.

Background VIP Products manufactures dog toys, including plush toys in the shape of bottles and cans that consist of well-known beverage brands reimagined for dogs.

One such product is a dog toy that looks like a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey.

The toy is the same shape as a bottle of Jack Daniels and around the same size as the original, with a black label with white stylized text that mimics elements of the Jack Daniels label.

In response, VIP sued Jack Daniels, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Bad Spaniels dog toy neither infringed nor diluted the Jack Daniels trademarks.

Jack Daniels countersued for trademark infringement and trademark dilution by tarnishment, alleging that the toys association with dog excrement would harm the reputation of Jack Daniels mark.

VIP argued that the Rogers test required dismissal of Jack Daniels infringement claim, and because the Bad Spaniels toy was a parody of the Jack Daniels trademarks, it fit within a statutory exception to dilution for noncommercial uses of a mark.

Critically, VIP alleged in its complaint that it owned and used the Bad Spaniels trademark and trade dress to indicate the source of VIPs own products.

Limiting the Rogers test The Rogers test originated in Rogers v. Grimaldi , 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), and has been applied by many courts in various circuits.

When applied, Rogers requires dismissal of a trademark infringement claim regarding the use of a mark in an expressive work as fair use, unless the complainant can show one of the following: The challenged use of a mark has no artistic relevance to the underlying work.

The challenged use of a mark explicitly misleads as to the source or content of the work.

In its June 8 decision reversing the fair use ruling of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court held that the Rogers test does not apply when a mark is used to designate the source of goods or services.

Because VIP used features of the Jack Daniels marks to identify VIPs own products,the Supreme Court rejected application of the Rogers test and remanded for a standard analysis regarding likelihood of confusion.

Dilution by tarnishment Dilution by tarnishment is an association that arises from the similarity between a famous mark and a second mark that harms the famous marks reputation, 15 USC  1125(c).

There are several statutory exceptions to dilution, including noncommercial use of a mark.

VIP argued that because its Bad Spaniels dog toy is a parody, it constitutes noncommercial use of the Jack Daniels marks under the dilution statute.

The Supreme Court did not need to determine whether the toy is, in fact, a parody of Jack Daniels marks."
Cooley,Supreme Court Ruling Confirms Limits on Parody Defenses to Trademark Claims,"The Supreme Court did not need to determine whether the toy is, in fact, a parody of Jack Daniels marks.

Instead, the Supreme Court found that the noncommercial exclusion of liability for dilution does not apply if the challenged mark is used to identify the persons own goods or services, regardless of whether the challenged mark is a parody.

Significance The Supreme Courts decision limits the defenses available to companies that engage in parodies in some contexts.

Those who intend to use parodies should be aware that they may not be able to simply sidestep the standard trademark infringement and dilution analyses by invoking the Rogers test to argue that their expressive works are fair use.

If a company uses a mark to identify its own goods or services, the Rogers test will not apply, even if that mark is part of a parody.

A trademark infringement claim involving such parody marks will turn on whether there is a likelihood of confusion about the source of a product or service.

Further, those who use parodies to identify their own goods or services will be unable to claim that the noncommercial exception to dilution applies.

Importantly, the Supreme Courts decision does not limit fair use arguments where the parody itself is not functioning as a trademark  e.g., where a parody conveys an informational message without indicating the source of goods or services.

The decision also does not limit the argument in infringement cases that parody makes consumer confusion less likely, nor does it limit the argument in dilution by tarnishment cases that parody will not harm the reputation of a famous mark.

Cooley,NYSE and Nasdaq Delay Effectiveness of Clawback Listing Standards,"On Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Stock Market filed amendments to their proposed clawback policy listing standards.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued an order approving and soliciting public comments on the amendments.

Critically, among other revisions, the amendments delay the effective date of the listing standards by nearly four months, from June 11, 2023, to October 2, 2023.

This means that issuers will have until December 1, 2023  60 days from the new effective date  to adopt and begin enforcing policies regarding the recovery of erroneously awarded, incentive-based compensation received by current and former executive officers.

The text of the proposed listing standards, as amended, can be found here: NYSE and Nasdaq .

In their discussions of the amendments, both exchanges stated that the decision to push out the effective date of the listing standards was consistent with the goal of prompt implementation of the final clawback rule, and it also was more in line with issuers expectations that the proposed standards would take effect one year after the SECs adoption of the final rule.

SEC staff had stated in the adopting release for the final clawback rule that issuers [would] have more than a year from the date the final rules [were] published in the Federal Register  i.e., November 28, 2022  to prepare and adopt compliant recovery policies.

In addition to delaying the effectiveness of the listing standards and the deadline for policy adoption, the NYSE amendment includes the following updates and clarifications: Cure period for other noncompliance.

The original proposed listing standard (Section 303A.14 of the Listed Company Manual) established a cure period in the event that a listed issuer failed to adopt a clawback policy within the required time period.

The amendment also provides for a cure period in the event of other instances of noncompliance with the listing standard, including when the listed issuer has not recovered erroneously awarded compensation reasonably promptly.

Clarification regarding covered issuers.

The amendment revises Section 303A.00 of the Listed Company Manual to make it clear that certain categories of listed issuers, including foreign private issuers, are required to comply with the clawback listing standards.

The Nasdaq amendment is more limited in scope and only provides for the delay in the effective date.

Both sets of proposed listing standards, as amended, are otherwise substantively unchanged from the original NYSE and Nasdaq proposals.

Issuers will now have adequate time to prepare for the application of the listing standards and the development of recovery policies, including  in some cases  the renegotiation of certain contracts and review of equity grant documentation.

Although companies now have more breathing room to adopt clawback policies, the additional time should be used to thoughtfully evaluate the appropriate go-forward approach for compliance with the rules.

Delayed effectiveness also means that it may be easier to present a compliant policy to the board or compensation committee for adoption at a regularly scheduled board or committee meeting in the fall, rather than being forced to convene an off-cycle board or committee meeting.

Cooley,QSBS Considerations for Cash Management Policies,"Stock issued by a corporation is treated as qualified small business stock (QSBS) only if, among other requirements, at least 80% of its assets (by value) are used by the issuing corporation in the active conduct of one or more qualified trades or businesses (the active business requirement) during substantially all of the applicable investors holding period for such stock.

This requirement has become particularly relevant to many startup and emerging companies that have been reevaluating their cash management policies following recent events in the banking sector, as described in this April 2023 Cooley alert .

This alert further explains two aspects of the active business requirement  the working capital exception and the portfolio stock limitation  with some illustrative examples below.

The working capital exception Under the working capital exception set forth in the Internal Revenue Code, Section 1202(e)(6), certain passive assets may be treated as used in the active conduct of an issuing corporations qualified trade or business if they are held as part of the reasonably required working capital needs of a qualified trade or business of the corporation, or held for investment and are reasonably expected to be used within [two] years to finance research and experimentation in a qualified trade or business or increases in working capital needs of a qualified trade or business.

After an issuing corporation has existed for at least two years, no more than 50% of its assets can qualify as used in an active trade or business by reason of the working capital exception (the 50% restriction ).

The portfolio stock limitation Under the portfolio stock limitation, a corporation that otherwise satisfies the active business requirement will be treated as failing to do so for any period during which more than 10% of the value of its assets (in excess of liabilities) consists of portfolio stock or securities, other than assets qualifying under the working capital exception.

Portfolio stock or securities generally means stock or securities of other corporations where the issuing corporation does not own more than 50% of such other corporations stock (by vote or value).

Accordingly, if the issuing corporations portfolio stock and securities constitute working capital, such holdings are potentially problematic for purposes of the active business requirement, only if the 10% portfolio stock limitation is exceeded after the issuing corporation has been in existence for more than two years and to the extent the issuing corporations working capital (including eligible portfolio stock and securities) exceeds 50% of its assets.

1

As discussed in the April 2023 Cooley alert on QSBS, interests in money market funds are likely to be treated as portfolio stock for this purpose Calculating asset value The QSBS provisions do not provide guidance on how to calculate the value of an issuing corporations assets for purposes of the active business requirement, the working capital exception or the portfolio stock limitation  unlike specific valuation rules applicable to certain other QSBS tests (e.g . , use of tax basis for purposes of the $50 million aggregate gross asset value test).

Some commentators suggest that, for these purposes, the aggregate value of the issuing corporations assets (including intangibles) during any particular period could be determined by starting with the then-fair market value of the issuing corporations capital stock, determined from time to time, and adding to such value the amount of any liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of the issuing corporation and its subsidiaries.

The valuations should, in any event, take into account the fair market value of all of the issuing corporations assets, including those that may not be reflected on the balance sheet (e.g., goodwill).

Corporations that intend to issue QSBS should discuss valuation methodologies with their tax advisers."
Cooley,QSBS Considerations for Cash Management Policies,"Corporations that intend to issue QSBS should discuss valuation methodologies with their tax advisers.

Illustrative examples The application of the working capital exception and the portfolio stock limitation are illustrated by the following series of examples.

Assumptions In each of the examples below, corporation (C) has been in existence for at least two years, the fair market value of Cs total assets is $100, C has no liabilities and all of Cs assets would qualify as either assets held as part of the reasonably required working capital needs of a qualified trade or business, or assets held for investment and reasonably expected to be used within two years to finance research and experimentation in, or increases in working capital needs of, a qualified trade or business.

In each case, we also assume that investments in money market funds are treated as portfolio stock.

For purposes of these examples, we will refer to assets that are used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business, other than those qualifying under the working capital exception, as business assets.

Business assets may include fixed assets, intangible assets, etc.

Example 1 Cs cash exceeds the 50% restriction under the working capital exception, and C does not have other active business assets sufficient to meet the active business requirement.

Facts: Cs assets consist of $71 in cash and $29 of business assets.

Analysis:

Under the 50% restriction, no more than 50% of Cs total assets ($50) can qualify as active assets under the working capital exception.

Accordingly, $50 of Cs cash and all $29 of Cs business assets, or $79 of Cs total assets (79%), constitute active assets.

C does not meet the 80% test of the active business requirement during the period when its total active assets are below such threshold.

Example 2 Cs money market fund investments exceed both the 50% restriction and the 10% portfolio stock limitation.

Facts: Cs assets consist of $61 in money market fund investments and $39 of business assets.

Analysis:

Under the 50% restriction, no more than 50% of Cs total assets ($50) can qualify as active assets under the working capital exception.

Accordingly, $11 ($61 minus $50) of Cs money market fund investments are not treated as active assets under the working capital exception.

Therefore, 11% of Cs total assets are portfolio stock, and the 10% portfolio stock limitation is exceeded.

This is the case even though $50 of Cs money market investments and all $39 of Cs business assets, or $89 of Cs total assets (89%), constitute active assets.

C does not satisfy the active business requirement during the period when C has exceeded the 10% portfolio stock limitation.

Example 3 Cs cash and money market fund investments collectively exceed the 50% restriction, and Cs money market fund investments may exceed the 10% portfolio stock limitation depending on application of the working capital exception.

Facts: Cs assets consist of $50 in cash, $11 in money market fund investments and $39 of business assets.

Analysis:

Under the 50% restriction, no more than 50% of Cs total assets ($50) can qualify as active assets under the working capital exception.

Accordingly, as in Example 2, $89 of Cs assets (89%) constitute active assets; however, C may fail the active business requirement as a result of the portfolio stock limitation: Cs active assets include $39 of business assets, together with $50 of investment assets, which could consist of either $50 of Cs cash, or $11 of Cs money market fund investments and $39 of Cs cash (or a different mix of cash and money market fund investments)."
Cooley,QSBS Considerations for Cash Management Policies,"If all $50 of Cs cash is treated as active, because Cs money market fund investments that are not treated as active assets under the working capital exception (all $11 of Cs money market fund investments) constitute 11% of Cs total assets, the 10% portfolio stock limitation is exceeded, and C does not meet the active business requirement during the period when C has exceeded the 10% portfolio stock limitation as a result of such treatment of Cs money market fund investments.

If all $11 of Cs money market fund investments is treated as active, along with $39 of Cs cash, C meets the active business requirement during the period when the above facts and such treatment of Cs money market fund investments are applicable.

The 10% portfolio stock limitation does not apply to Cs remaining assets that are not treated as active assets under the working capital exception ($11 of Cs cash).

2 Example 4 Cs cash and money market fund investments collectively exceed the 50% restriction, but Cs money market fund investments do not exceed the 10% portfolio stock limitation.

Facts: Cs assets consist of $30 in cash, $30 in money market fund investments and $40 of business assets.

Analysis:

Under the 50% restriction, no more than 50% of Cs total assets ($50) can qualify as active assets under the working capital exception.

Accordingly, $90 of Cs assets (90%) constitute active assets: $40 of Cs business assets, together with a total amount of $50, which could consist of either: $30 of Cs cash and $20 of Cs money market fund investments.

$30 of Cs money market fund investments and $20 of Cs cash.

C meets the active business requirement in both alternatives during the period when the above facts apply.

In the first alternative, the assets that are not treated as active assets under the working capital exception ($10 of Cs money market fund investments) fall within the 10% limitation permitted under the portfolio stock limitation.

In the second alternative, the 10% portfolio stock limitation rule does not apply to Cs remaining assets ($10 of Cs cash), which are not treated as active assets under the working capital exception.

Notes This guidance assumes that if portfolio stock and securities constitute working capital, the working capital exception exempts from the portfolio stock limitation only the portfolio stock and securities that satisfy the 50% working capital test.

Under an alternative reading of the statute, all assets meeting the definition of working capital can be excluded from the 10% portfolio stock limitation, not merely those that are excludable after application of the 50% test."
Cooley,QSBS Considerations for Cash Management Policies,"Nevertheless, given the lack of guidance on the interaction of these tests  and significant stakes for shareholders if QSBS status is lost  as a planning matter, it is prudent to apply the portfolio stock limitation taking into account the 50% limitation (if applicable).

As noted in footnote 1, it would be prudent to take the 50% restriction under the working capital exception into account when calculating a corporations stock and securities investments that may be disregarded for purposes of the 10% portfolio stock limitation.

It also would be prudent to first treat investment assets other than portfolio stock or securities as working capital before including money market funds and other portfolio stock or securities, given that there is no authority on how to coordinate the working capital exception with the portfolio stock limitation."
Cooley,"Ninth Circuit Upholds Delaware Forum-Selection Clause, Dismisses Federal Derivative Action","On June 1, 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in a split en banc decision that forum-selection clauses requiring shareholders to file derivative claims in the Delaware Court of Chancery are enforceable as applied to claims asserted derivatively under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Because Section 14(a) claims can only be brought in federal court, the upshot of this decision is that shareholders cannot assert derivative claims under Section 14(a) in any court.

As the Ninth Circuit observed, its decision in Lee v. Fisher relates to a modern trend in which plaintiffs file derivative claims that normally arise under state law in federal court in order to invoke exclusive federal jurisdiction and avoid any forum-selection clause pointing to a state forum.

This highly awaited decision is significant because a shareholder filing a derivative suit within the Ninth Circuit can no longer avoid forum-selection provisions by tacking on Section 14(a) claims.

The majority opinion also admittedly created a split with the Seventh Circuit, which last year held that a similar forum-selection clause was unenforceable.

Background This decision, which terminated a Gap shareholders lawsuit, follows several years of litigation regarding the enforceability of forum-selection clauses.

In 2013, the Delaware Chancery Court held that forum-selection provisions relating to the internal affairs of the corporation (including derivative claims), are valid under Delaware General Corporation Law Section (DGCL) 109(b) , which broadly permits bylaws relating to the business of the corporation, the conduct of its affairs, and its rights or powers or the rights or powers of its stockholders, directors, officers or employees.

The court explained that forum-selection provisions plainly relate to the conduct of the corporation by channeling internal affairs cases into the courts of the state of incorporation and are designed to bring order to what the boards  say they perceive to be a chaotic filing of duplicative and inefficient derivative and corporate suits against the directors and the corporations.

Two years later, Delaware codified this holding in DGCL Section 115.

Most recently, in Salzberg v. Sciabacucchi , the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the validity of forum-selection provisions requiring shareholders to bring claims under the Securities Act of 1933 in federal court, but indicated that forum-selection provisions would not be enforceable or valid in all circumstances.

In this case, Gaps bylaws contain a forum-selection clause providing that the Delaware Chancery Court is the sole and exclusive forum for derivative actions.

Noelle Lee, a putative Gap shareholder, filed a derivative action in California federal court alleging that Gap and its directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 by making false and misleading statements about the companys commitment to diversity in certain proxy statements.

The district court upheld Gaps forum-selection clause and dismissed the case.

A panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed  and, in doing so, created tension with another federal appeals court.

Just last year, the Seventh Circuit held in Seafarers Pension Plan v. Bradway that a similar forum-selection provision was invalid, reasoning that enforcing the provision would prevent the plaintiffs from bringing their federal derivative claims in any forum.

In light of this tension, the Ninth Circuit elected to rehear the case en banc .

The decision In upholding Gaps forum-selection provision, an en banc majority of the Ninth Circuit concluded the following:

1. Gaps forum-selection clause does not violate the Exchange Acts anti-waiver provision.

The US Supreme Court has explained that the anti-waiver provision of the Exchange Act, Section 29(a), prevents waiver of the substantive obligations imposed by the Exchange Act."
Cooley,"Ninth Circuit Upholds Delaware Forum-Selection Clause, Dismisses Federal Derivative Action","The US Supreme Court has explained that the anti-waiver provision of the Exchange Act, Section 29(a), prevents waiver of the substantive obligations imposed by the Exchange Act.

Lee argued that the forum-selection provision would prevent her from bringing a derivative Section 14(a) claim in any forum, thus waiving Gaps compliance with the substantive obligations imposed by Section 14 of the Exchange Act.

The en banc majority rejected this argument, reasoning that because the forum-selection provision only applies to derivative actions, Lee could still bring a direct Section 14(a) claim in federal court.

2. Gaps forum-selection clause does not violate the federal public policy of providing a forum for shareholders to bring federal Section 14(a) derivative claims.

In the Ninth Circuit, forum-selection provisions are enforced unless certain exceptional circumstances apply  for example, where enforcing the forum-selection clause will contravene a strong public policy of the forum where the suit is brought.

The Ninth Circuit rejected Lees attempts to invoke this exception and held that she did not show the extraordinary circumstances required to disregard Gaps forum-selection provision.

3. Gaps forum-selection clause is valid and enforceable under Delaware law.

The Ninth Circuit also rejected Lees argument that the forum-selection provision was invalid under Delaware law.

Specifically, DGCL Section 115 permits bylaws that require a plaintiff to bring internal corporate claims in the courts in [Delaware], consistent with applicable jurisdictional requirements, and disallows bylaws that forbid a plaintiff from bringing such claims in Delaware state courts.

The majority concluded that Section 115 does not apply to Section 14(a) claims because, according to the Delaware Supreme Court, federal claims are not internal corporate claims.

As a result, Section 115 does not prohibit forum-selection clauses that require federal claims be brought in Delaware state court.

The Ninth Circuit majority noted its disagreement with the Seventh Circuits Seafarers opinion and acknowledged that its conclusion would create a split between the two circuits.

In contrast, the en banc dissent echoed aspects of Seafarers , observing that as a result of the majoritys decision, the federal claims at issue could not be asserted derivatively in any forum.

Significance

As a result of this decision, a shareholder filing a derivative suit within the Ninth Circuit can no longer skirt forum-selection provisions requiring derivative actions to be filed in Delaware by bringing federal claims under Section 14(a).

At the same time, this decision creates considerable uncertainty as to whether forum-selection clauses will be upheld in other jurisdictions and tees up an important question that appears ripe for review by the US Supreme Court."
Cooley,New York’s Minimum Wage Increases for 2024 and Beyond,"On May 3, 2023, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation into law increasing New Yorks minimum wage for most employees beginning January 1, 2024, through 2026.

Enacted as part of the states budget legislation , increases to the minimum wage beginning in 2027 and beyond will be indexed to the consumer price index.

Below, weve outlined what employers should know about this development.

Minimum wage increases, 2024  2026

The states minimum wage will increase for all employees (excluding home care aides and certain other industry employees) as follows: Effective date of minimum wage increase New York City, Long Island and Westchester Remainder of New York state Current $15 $14.20 January 1, 2024 $16 $15 January 1, 2025 $16.50 $15.50 January 1, 2026 $17 $16 Notably, unlike prior increases , the new rates do not differ based on employer size and lump together the rates for New York City, counties on Long Island and Westchester County.

Minimum wage increases beginning in 2027

The legislation also provides that minimum wage increases beginning in 2027 will be indexed to the US Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for the Northeast Region (CPI-W).

Specifically, the minimum wage will increase based on a three-year moving average of the CPI-W. However, the minimum wage will not necessarily increase every year beginning in 2027.

For example, the rate will not increase if the CPI-W for the most recent period is negative, or the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more.

The states Department of Labor will be required to annually publish the adjusted minimum wage rates no later than October 1, for rates effective January 1 of the next year.

Adjustments to exempt salary thresholds

The legislation also will cause an increase to the exempt salary threshold for administrative and executive employees, though the actual amounts have not been announced.

If the historical salary basis threshold of 75 times the minimum wage remains the same, the 2024 exempt salary threshold for such employees in New York City, Long Island and Westchester would increase from $1,125 weekly (or $58,500 annually) to $1,200 weekly (or $62,400 annually).

Similarly, the exempt salary threshold for the remainder of the state would increase in 2024 from $1,064.25 weekly (or $55,341 annually) to $1,124 weekly (or $58,500 annually).

Next steps New York employers who employ minimum wage workers should be prepared to comply with the increase beginning next year and update their budgets accordingly.

Employers with exempt executive and administrative employees should determine whether to raise their salaries to retain the exemption, or reclassify them as nonexempt employees entitled to overtime pay."

Cooley,UK Government Publishes National Semiconductor Strategy,"On 19 May 2023, the UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology published the National Semiconductor Strategy , setting out the UKs 20-year vision to grow deep foundations in semiconductor technology, while also bolstering the UKs national security and resilience in an industry that has suffered supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions.

Below we examine some of the key aspects of the strategy and their implications on the semiconductor sector.

1.

Growing the domestic sector The strategy recognises the importance of semiconductor technology to the growth of the UK economy and sets out several ambitious initiatives to achieve growth in the industry, including investments of up to 1 billion over the next decade, increased support for new semiconductor startups through a dedicated incubator programme, and development of training, research and education in semiconductor-related fields.

However, questions remain regarding whether the planned initiatives go far enough to ensure that the UK semiconductor industry keeps apace with other jurisdictions.

For example, when compared to other regimes, the 1 billion investment pales in comparison to the proposed US investment of $52 billion and the European Union investment of 43 billion euros into semiconductor technology.

Ultimately, the impact of the UK governments investment will depend on how the funding is allocated and applied, which currently is not detailed in the strategy.

2. Protecting national security The strategy clearly demonstrates the increasing importance of national security in the development of industrial policy in the UK, as well as the changing nature of threats posed to UK interests.

The strategy defines semiconductors as a class of materials which are used to create the hardware that underpin electronic devices ...

they are the basis upon which integrated circuits, or computer chips, are built.

They are also used in discrete devices, such as those involved in power management, radio frequency, lasers and sensors.

The strategy highlights that while semiconductors are critical to UK national security, they also give rise to several risks.

In particular, the strategy focuses on two main areas of risk  namely, the acquisition of sensitive UK semiconductor companies and technologies by hostile states to build up their own defence and military capabilities to the detriment of UK national security, and the use of semiconductors as a vector for cyberattacks.

To mitigate these risks, the strategy highlights the following tools: National Security and Investment Act 2021 (NSI Act) : The NSI Act came into force on 4 January 2022 and introduced for the first time a mandatory notification and preclosing clearance requirement for transactions in specified sectors.

The broad range of sectors (17 in total) captured certain acquisitions and investments of target companies engaged in the sectors of computing hardware and advanced materials, which would include companies working in the semiconductor industry in the UK.

In addition to introducing a mandatory notification regime, the NSI Act also provides the UK government with wide powers to call in transactions (including asset acquisitions) that pose a risk to UK national security and enables parties to voluntarily notify their transactions to the government.

In the first year of the NSI Acts operation, the UK government made a number of decisions to block or impose conditions on investments in the semiconductor industry  for example, in the acquisition of Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia BV .

The strategy notes that the areas where the government has seen some issues potentially arising vis--vis semiconductor activities are: UK-developed research and technology that is a building block for future applications, which could be deployed in ways contrary to UK security interests and values.

Activity in the compound semiconductor industry, which can be used commercially and for defence and security."
Cooley,UK Government Publishes National Semiconductor Strategy,"Activity in the compound semiconductor industry, which can be used commercially and for defence and security.

Semiconductor assets that are used explicitly for UK defence purposes.

The government clarifies in the strategy that it will continue to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, with the focus of its review being on national security risk.

It also commits to improving, within the next six to 12 months, the transparency of the NSI Acts operation in relation to semiconductors by reviewing the scope of the definitions of computing hardware and advanced materials, as well as providing more guidance on which elements are considered to be more sensitive.

In highlighting the NSI Act as a key tool in protecting the UK against security risks, the strategy emphasises the importance of the NSI Act being deployed as a central and critical plank of the UK national security architecture.

This also shows that the government recognises the importance of focusing on national security issues in the context of a rapidly expanding and developing sector.

Export controls : Noting the national security risks presented by exports in the semiconductor sector, the strategy highlights the UK export control regime as the mechanism by which exports that pose a security concern can be controlled.

This regime includes the enhanced military end-use control provisions , which were introduced in 2022 and permit the government to prevent exports for military end-use in an embargoed destination (regardless of the nature of the item).

This proposal is set against the backdrop of the decision by the US in October 2022 to impose new export controls on advanced computing and semiconductors to China .

By committing to review and expand the export control regime, the strategy reinforces the governments enhanced security focus.

Building on hardware strengths to improve cybersecurity : The strategy identifies the risks of hostile actors tampering with semiconductors before they are fabricated into wafers (i.e., a thin slice of semiconductor material used for the fabrication of integrated circuits), thereby opening a security backdoor or causing a deliberate failure in the device.

As such, the strategy sets out key actions for the government to: Prioritise hardware security during chip design stages (as outlined in the National Cyber Strategy ).

Reduce risks at the chip level with continued government investment in and support of the Digital Security by Design programme , which aims to ensure the memory safety of software and secure the compartmentalisation of applications to block most cyberattacks.

3. Mitigating the risk of supply chain disruptions The strategy recognises the complexity of the semiconductor supply chain, and the fact that different countries hold specific specialities means that it will be necessary for the UK government to work domestically and internationally to improve resilience of supply.

The strategy sets out actions that the government will take, including: Publishing semiconductor resilience guidance to improve the sectors understanding of the potential risks to supply chains and the steps they can take to prevent future disruption.

Establishing a cross-government and industry forum to help mitigate supply chain disruptions.

Engaging with external suppliers to critical industries on risks to chip supply.

Identifying the supply chains for critical sectors around the world that are most at risk of being impacted by a semiconductor-related supply chain shock.

The safety and resilience of semiconductor supply is crucial in ensuring that expansion and growth in the sector can occur in the UK.

Conclusion The publication of the strategy was long-awaited and represents an important step in the UKs efforts to secure its position as a global leader in the semiconductor industry  while also safeguarding its economic and national security interests."
Cooley,UK Government Publishes National Semiconductor Strategy,"The measures in the strategy to diversify supply chains and promote domestic manufacturing, whilst also protecting national interests and enforcing minimum security requirements, demonstrate a proactive approach from the government to reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing control over critical semiconductor technologies.

Time will tell whether the proposed level of investment goes far enough to enable the UK to build its competitive position on the global stage, but what is clear is that investments into the sector will face continued close regulatory and security scrutiny.

Cooley,"Supreme Court Rules FCA Liability Turns on Subjective Belief, Not Objective Reasonableness","In a much-anticipated opinion released on June 1, 2023, the US Supreme Court held that the scienter element of the False Claims Act (FCA) turns on the defendants knowledge and subjective beliefs  not on what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed.

The unanimous decision in the consolidated cases, United States ex rel.

Schutte v. Supervalu Inc. and United States ex rel.

Proctor v. Safeway Inc. , held that what matters for an FCA case is whether the defendant knew the claim was false.

The Supreme Courts application of this subjective standard appears to preclude scienter defenses based in objective reasonableness  a key argument FCA defendants had frequently relied on to seek early dismissal of cases.

Going forward, defendants may expect to face discovery probing their knowledge and state of mind before a court may deem dismissal is warranted.

Background FCA liability arises where a person  knowingly presents  a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval .

To establish an FCA violation, a plaintiff  the government or qui tam relator  must prove both that the claim was false and that the defendant knew it was false (scienter).

Here, the petitioners claimed that the two supermarket chains defrauded Medicaid and Medicare when seeking reimbursements that were limited by regulation or contract to the pharmacies usual and customary prices.

According to the petitioners, the pharmacies offered discounted prices to their customers but reported higher retail prices when submitting reimbursement claims to the federal benefits programs.

The petitioners presented evidence that ostensibly demonstrated the pharmacies believed their claims to be inaccurate, but still submitted them.

At summary judgment, the district court ruled that the pharmacies discounted prices were their usual and customary prices, and so their claims reporting the retail prices were false.

However, the district court held that the pharmacies could not have acted knowingly, because their position was objectively reasonable at the time.

As a result, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the pharmacies.

The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying in large part on a prior Supreme Court case interpreting the term willfully in the context of a different federal statute.

The Seventh Circuit reasoned that the defendants actual knowledge was irrelevant if their actions were consistent with any objectively reasonable interpretation of the relevant law, and that the defendants subjective belief should only be considered if their acts were objectively unreasonable.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the pharmacies on the grounds that their acts were consistent with an objectively reasonable interpretation of usual and customary, which could have referred to the retail price, rather than the discounted price.

The Supreme Courts decision The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the question of whether the pharmacies could have the scienter required by the FCA if they correctly understood the relevant standard and believed their claims were inaccurate  regardless of what an objectively reasonable person would believe.

Relying on the text of the FCA and its common-law roots, the Supreme Court answered that question in the affirmative.

The Supreme Court held that [w]hat matters for an FCA case is whether the defendant knew the claim was false  not what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed (emphasis added).

The opinion also made clear that FCA defendants cannot rely on after-the-fact interpretations that might have rendered their claims accurate  the crucial question is what the defendant knew when submitting the claim .

Of course, discerning what a defendant knew at a moment in time is not necessarily straightforward."
Cooley,"Supreme Court Rules FCA Liability Turns on Subjective Belief, Not Objective Reasonableness","Of course, discerning what a defendant knew at a moment in time is not necessarily straightforward.

Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the Supreme Court, stated that scienter under the FCA captures defendants who were  conscious of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that their claims are false, but submit the claims anyway.

Yet the Supreme Court declined to provide guidance on what constitutes a substantial and unjustifiable risk, or how a defendant would identify that type of risk when confronted with an ambiguous regulation.

Relatedly, though the Supreme Court acknowledged that the phrase usual and customary is not clear on its face, it rejected all of the pharmacies arguments urging it to adopt the Seventh Circuits reasoning that because other people might make an honest mistake, defendants subjective beliefs become irrelevant.

Instead, the Supreme Court concluded that, it does not matter whether some other, objectively reasonable interpretation of usual and customary would point to [the pharmacies] higher prices.

For scienter, it is enough if [they] believed that their claims were not accurate.

Significance In practice, the Supreme Courts command to focus on subjective belief may stymie early dismissal of FCA cases, which had often been based on scienter arguments related to objective reasonableness.

FCA defendants may instead be exposed to expansive and costly discovery exploring the defendants state of mind at the time claims were submitted.

Litigants may also see protracted disputes as lower courts begin to address questions left unanswered  including whether a defendant faced with an ambiguous regulation was aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the claims submitted were false.

As this new landscape unfolds, companies will have to consider whether and how to create contemporaneous records documenting their interpretations of ambiguous regulations at the time claims are submitted.

Defendants who can demonstrate good faith in their decision-making process may still be able to have success at summary judgment."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – May One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts final rules regarding share repurchase disclosures On May 3, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules to require enhanced disclosure about issuer share repurchases under the Exchange Act.

The final rules will require quarterly tabular disclosure of an issuers daily repurchase activity, instead of disclosure one business day after execution of a share repurchase, as was initially contemplated in the proposed rules.

This tabular disclosure must contain specified information about the repurchases broken out by day and will be provided in an exhibit to Forms 10-Q and 10-K for issuers filing on domestic forms, or in new Form F-SR for issuers filing on foreign private issuer (FPI) forms.

The final rules also: Require an issuer to disclose quarterly via a checkbox whether any of its Section 16 officers or directors  or senior management or directors for FPIs  purchased or sold shares that are the subject of an issuer share repurchase plan or program within four business days before or after the announcement of the plan or program, or announcement of an increase to an existing plan or program.

Revise Item 703 to eliminate the current requirement in Item 703 of Regulation S-K to disclose monthly repurchase data and require an issuer to disclose in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K: The objectives or rationales for its share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the amount of repurchases.

Any policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of the issuers securities by its officers and directors during a repurchase program, including any restrictions on those transactions.

Note: Corresponding narrative disclosure requirements also will be added to Item 16E of Form 20-F. Add new Item 408(d) to Regulation S-K to require quarterly disclosure in Forms 10-Q and 10-K of an issuers adoption, material modification or termination of Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements, as well as a description of the material terms of the trading arrangements.

Issuers filing on domestic forms will be required to comply with the amendments to Forms 10-Q and 10-K beginning with the first filing covering the full fiscal quarter beginning on or after October 1, 2023.

This means that the first report requiring compliance for calendar year-end companies will be the 2023 Form 10-K filed in 2024 , as it relates to repurchases made during the quarter ending December 31, 2023.

FPIs filing on FPI forms will be required to comply with the amendments in new Form F-SR beginning with the first filing covering the full fiscal quarter that begins on or after April 1, 2024.

This means that the first Form F-SR requiring compliance for calendar year-end companies will need to be filed beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

The amendments to the Form 20-F narrative disclosure will be required starting in the first Form 20-F filed after the FPIs first Form F-SR has been filed.

Survey highlights board cybersecurity oversight In March, The Wall Street Journal and the National Association of Corporate Directors published their findings from a survey of 472 public and private company directors regarding various aspects of board cybersecurity oversight.

Key highlights from the survey include: Only 30% of directors rated their boards ability to oversee a cyber crisis as advanced or expert, despite more than three-quarters (76%) of boards having at least one cyber expert.

Among companies with no cyber experts on their board, 67% of directors said they planned to educate existing board members with cybersecurity certificates or credentials and/or develop knowledge among all members of the board.

22% of public companies responded that they lack cyber expertise; of those, 31% plan to hire an independent director with cyber expertise."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – May One-Minute Reads,"22% of public companies responded that they lack cyber expertise; of those, 31% plan to hire an independent director with cyber expertise.

Cyber-specialist board directors increased overall board awareness of cyber risk in 62% of companies surveyed, but they were sometimes unable to contribute more widely to board discussions.

90% of larger businesses that have a chief information security officer or chief information officer deliver their cyber risk briefing agreed that the information allows them to effectively oversee cyber risk, showing a strong correlation between the role of the executive delivering the cyber risk briefing and the boards ability to effectively oversee cyber risk.

Less than half of all respondents (48% for public and private companies) said their board had taken part in a tabletop exercise related to cyber-attacks.

US Supreme Court hears oral argument in Slack direct listing case On April 17, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Slack Technologies v. Pirani , presenting the question of whether shareholders in a direct listing have standing to sue under Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act.

Previously, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling that the plaintiff did have standing to sue under Sections 11 and 12, even if they could not definitively trace the securities that they acquired to the registration statement.

Slack appealed the decision, contending that tracing to the registration statement is required under Section 11.

As this Cooley PubCo blog post discusses in further detail , the oral arguments possibly signaled a potential resolution to the case, with the justices differentiating between Sections 11 and 12.

SEC announces charges for Regulation A violations On May 16, the SEC announced charges against 10 microcap companies for offering and selling securities in violation of Regulation A, which provides a limited exemption from registration under the Securities Act for smaller offerings, subject to certain conditions.

According to the press release, each of the companies obtained qualification from the SEC for their securities offerings under Regulation A but later made significant changes to their offerings that did not meet the requirements of the exemption.

The changes included improperly increasing the number of shares offered, improperly increasing or decreasing the price of shares offered, failing to file updated financial statements for ongoing offerings, and engaging in prohibited at the market or delayed offerings, which resulted in the companies offering and selling unregistered securities, according to the SEC.

All 10 companies agreed to settle the charges, which serves as an important reminder to companies conducting a Regulation A offering to ensure that any fundamental changes after the offering statement has been qualified by the SEC still satisfy the exemption conditions.

Delaware state bar proposes amendments to DGCL The Delaware State Bar Association recently recommended legislation proposing to amend the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which is expected to be considered by the Delaware General Assembly during its 2023 regular session.

Most notably for public companies, the amendments would revise Section 242 of the DGCL to: Eliminate the need for a default vote of stockholders for charter amendments effecting specific types of forward stock splits and associated increases in the authorized number of shares.

Reduce the minimum stockholder vote required to authorize a charter amendment that increases or decreases the authorized shares of a class or effects a reverse split of the shares of a class, where the shares are listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the amendment becomes effective and meet the listing requirements of the exchange after the amendment becomes effective."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – May One-Minute Reads,"These proposed amendments would be particularly helpful for companies with large retail shareholder bases, as they would lower the required vote threshold for the specified amendments  from the current threshold of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote  to one based on votes cast, provided the specified conditions are met.

In addition, the proposed amendments would, among other things: Confirm that a corporation is not required to receive the statutory minimum consideration (typically the par value) for a disposition of treasury shares.

Simplify the requirements for the filing of certificates of validation in connection with the ratification of certain defective corporate acts.

Provide greater certainty regarding the stockholders who must be given a notice of a non-unanimous action by consent of stockholders.

Reduce the vote required to consummate a domestication, transfer or continuance of a Delaware corporation to a non-US entity.

Revise the provisions governing statutory appraisal rights, including to add such rights in connection with a transfer, continuance or domestication of a Delaware corporation to a non-US entity.

Provide that no vote of stockholders is required to authorize a sale, lease, or exchange of collateral securing a mortgage or pledge under specified circumstances.

If enacted, the amendments would become effective on August 1, 2023, subject to certain specified exceptions.

Refer to this publication from Richards, Layton & Finger for more information on the proposed amendments."
Cooley,Assessing Overlapping Boards After DOJ Crackdown,"Editor's note: Authored by Howard Morse, Parker Erkmann and Nicollette R. Kirby, this article was originally published in Law360 .

Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice has garnered headlines by issuing press releases announcing that directors have stepped down from 10 company boards, in response to DOJ concerns that their roles violated the Clayton Act's Section 8 prohibitions on interlocking directorates.

In October 2022, the DOJ announced the resignation of directors from the boards of five companies.[1] Another round of resignations was announced in March 2023:

Five directors resigned from four corporate boards, and one company declined to exercise board appointment rights.[2] Antitrust DivisionAssistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanterhas argued that cracking down on interlocking boards is ""probably the most effective way of deconcentrating the United States economy today.""[3]

At the American Bar Association 2023 Antitrust Spring Meeting, Kanter said that the DOJ now has a ""vibrant Section 8 enforcement"" program with nearly 20 open investigations and ""many additional opportunities out there for investigation and enforcement.

""[4] This scrutiny should cause corporations to look at the makeup of their boards and investors to look at the boards on which they sit, and to adopt policies to minimize the risk of the government finding an antitrust violation.

Questions have been raised following the DOJ announcements as to when Section 8 applies: When will companies be considered competitors?

Does the statute reach potential competitors?

Does it reach different representatives of investors on the boards of competitors?

How can companies avoid charges that directors have fixed prices or divided markets?

After discussing the law underlying DOJ's recent actions, we explore these questions.

The DOJ has issuedpress releases, but hasn't taken enforcement action.

It is notable that these DOJ actions have led to directors resigning, with the DOJ issuing press releases naming the companies but not identifying the individual directors by name, and without lawsuits or civil penalties.

While Section 8 does not provide the government with authority to seek monetary relief, the DOJ could sue to obtain injunctive relief to prevent future violations, and the Federal Trade Commission could obtain cease-and-desist orders in administrative litigation.

Both agencies have done so at times in the past.

A violation of such orders could result in contempt or civil penalties, as well as costs and attorney fees.

The DOJ, moreover, has not obtained judicial decisions.

To the extent DOJ is seeking to expand the law, the precedential value of its actions is limited.

Clayton Act Section 8 is a strict liability statute.

Section 8 is a strict liability federal antitrust law that prohibits a person from concurrently serving as an officer or director of competing corporations i.e., an interlocking directorate  unless de minimis exemptions apply.

Companies cannot defend an action on the basis that there has been no adverse effect on competition.

Rather, asthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York noted its 2003 Reading International Inc. v. Oaktree Capital Management LLC decision, quoting precedent,Section 8 seeks to prevent ""'incipient violations of the antitrust laws by removing the opportunity or temptation to such violations through interlocking directorates.

'""[5]

The proscriptions of Section 8 are largely dictated by the language of the statute  in contrast to the flexible language of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit agreements in restraint of trade and monopolization, that rely on common law interpretation.

The statute prohibits all interlocks between ""corporations"" engaged in commerce that are, ""by virtue of their business and location of operation, competitors, so that the elimination of competition ... between them would constitute a violation of any of the antitrust laws."""
Cooley,Assessing Overlapping Boards After DOJ Crackdown,"The statute does require that the corporations have ""capital, surplus, and undivided profits"" of more than $45,257,000, adjusted annually for changes in gross national product.

And the law exempts interlocks when the ""competitive sales"" of corporations do not meet certain thresholds.

""Competitive sales"" is defined in the statute to mean the gross revenue for all the products and services ""sold by one corporation in competition with the other,"" in each corporation's last completed fiscal year.

Thus, the statute does not prohibit an interlock if: Either corporation's competitive sales are less than $4,525,700, adjusted annually; Either corporation's competitive sales are less than 2% of the company's total sales; or Each corporation's competitive sales are less than 4% of its total sales.

Importantly, these de minimis exceptions mean that Section 8 will not apply to startup companies that do not yet earn any revenue.

Moreover, the statute provides for a one-year grace period from the date of an intervening event  e.g., sales in the last fiscal year exceeding the threshold, or a transaction that results in competitive sales over the threshold  that makes continued participation on the board of both firms unlawful.

All of this, and the DOJ's recent actions, raise questions about the scope of Section 8, including when companies will be considered competitors, whether the statute reaches potential competitors, and whether it reaches different representatives of investors on the boards of competing corporations.

What is a competitor under Section 8?

What constitutes a competitor under Section 8 is fact-specific, and the government and the courts look at a variety of factors.

Horizontal Relationship Courts interpreting Section 8 have generally required an interlock to involve two corporations that are in a horizontal market relationship.

Involvement in different aspects of the same industry has not been sufficient to establish the competitive relationship for a Section 8 interlock due to the absence of competitive sales.

Strict Application to Corporations By its terms, Section 8 prohibits interlocks involving corporations.

The application of Section 8 to limited liability companies has not been addressed by the courts, and the antitrust agencies have not taken an explicit position on the issue.

However, even if an interlock involving an LLC may be permissible under Section 8, companies should consider whether such a relationship could lead to allegations of a conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act before allowing one.

Assessing Competitive Sales In assessing whether there are competitive sales, courts have also looked to the market definition analyses used in claims brought under the Sherman and Clayton Acts to see, in the words of the U.S.District Court for the Northern District of California in its 1976U.S. v. Crocker National Corp. decision, if companies have ""common sales in the same product or geographic market.""

Thus, courts have looked to whether two products compete because they perform reasonably interchangeable functions, and whether customer demand is highly elastic between the two products.[6] Other courts, however, have said that relying on interchangeability of use and cross-elasticity of demand may be too restrictive, especially ""[i]n a developing industry in which product variation is just beginning and customer needs are not yet standardized,"" as the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit articulated in its 1981TRW Inc. v. FTC decision.[7]"
Cooley,Assessing Overlapping Boards After DOJ Crackdown,"Thus, courts also have relied on more subjective evidence that companies sought to sell similar products to the same prospective customers.[8] Descriptions of a Company as a Competitor Notably, in the DOJ's recent announcements of resignations, several of the matters involved public corporations that had directors identified in their proxies as serving on the boards of companies that were identified as ""competitors"" in the companies' other U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Other investigations appear to have stemmed from merger investigations, where one corporation potentially identified the other corporation as a competitor in internal documents submitted with a merger filing.

These actions suggest companies should pay close attention to these issues before making SEC and HSR filings.

Section 8 does not apply to potential competitors.

As noted above, companies' competitive sales must exceed the de minimis threshold for a Section 8 violation.

Thus, it is not surprising that Section 8 has not been applied to potential competitors.

Indeed, a dated but recently cited FTC report states that Section 8 ""leaves unchallenged interlocking directorates between corporations, both large and small, that have not been competitors in the past but might become so in the future.

""[9]

Courts have followed this guidance, including the Southern District of New York in its 1966 Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Baldwin-Montrose Chemical Co. decision, reasoning that a corporation's ""plans or intentions to engage in the production of"" the relevant product did not ""make it a competitor  within the meaning of Section 8,"" and therefore Section 8 was not""violated by [the director's] membership on the boards of both companies.

""[10]

This should provide some comfort to companies before they have competitive sales, but companies should still be alert to avoiding agreements not to compete or to divide markets through board members.

The scope of the DOJ's representation theory remains uncertain.

The DOJ's press releases note that directors resigned where two different individuals associated with the same venture capital or private equity firm served on the boards of competing corporations.

In announcing the resignations, DOJ referred to the board members as ""representatives"" of the investment firm.

The legal boundaries of this theory of Section 8 liability are not well developed.

The statute defines a ""person"" to include a corporation, but it can still be argued that only an individual can ""serve"" as a director.

While it can be said that no court has yet found a violation of Section 8 based on the representative theory, the Southern District of New York in Reading Internationaldenied a motion to dismiss a case asserting a deputization theory.

The court adopted a strict standard, holding that a plaintiff must demonstrate that the directors were not serving in their ""individual capacities, but as ... puppets or instrumentalities of the corporation's will.

""[11]

Under that reasoning, if a director performs their duties independently, it will be difficult to conclude that the director is serving as an instrumentality of a particular investor.

The representation theory may be even more difficult to apply if a director sits on the board of a public company and has been elected by its public shareholders.

Since the DOJ's press releases identify board members merely as representatives of the investment firm, it is difficult to discern whether the DOJ is applying the rigorous standard for deputization discussed in Oaktree Capital, or a lower standard, where a board member's affiliation with an investment firm is enough to establish an interlock.

Indeed, adopting policies or procedures limiting the exchange of confidential information between board members affiliated with the same investment firm would presumably bolster the argument that Section 8 has not been violated.

Section 8 enforcement will continue."
Cooley,Assessing Overlapping Boards After DOJ Crackdown,"Section 8 enforcement will continue.

The DOJ has said that Section 8 investigations are ongoing.

These investigations may lead to additional scrutiny.

If a Section 8 investigation uncovers evidence of price-fixing or market allocation facilitated through the unlawful interlock, it is likely that the DOJ would take enforcement action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act  leading to potential civil and even criminal actions.

Companies should be aware that Section 8 has also captured the attention of members of Congress, who have encouraged the DOJ and the FTC to investigate interlocking boards in the life sciences industry.

However, the de minimis exceptions would prevent application of Section 8 to companies in the development stage without sales.

To minimize the risk of a Section 8 enforcement action and the potential for further antitrust scrutiny, companies should conduct regular assessments of the business relationships of their board members and consider antitrust policies or guidelines and training to prevent anticompetitive coordination at the board level.

For example, companies might ask each board member and officer on an annual basis to identify other companies for which they serve as an officer or director, and review such lists for competitors.

For board members affiliated with private equity, venture capital or other investment firms, identification of competitors in which others affiliated with the same firm hold board seats might also be considered.

Companies should then consider if the de minimis thresholds apply.

In addition, companies may want to provide guidance to prevent unlawful coordination through such board positions.

Cooley,Companies Implementing ‘Super-Voting Preferred Stock’ as Stockholder Meeting Solution,"Increasingly, many small-cap and microcap public companies are failing to secure stockholder approval of critical proposals, particularly for reverse stock splits and authorized share increases.

With heavy concentration of shares held in street name (i.e., by retail investors in US brokerage accounts), these companies historically have relied on brokerage firms to vote retail shares both to establish a quorum  the minimum threshold in voting power of shares that must be present to validly convene a stockholder meeting  and to pass what are known as routine proposals (proposals on which brokers have discretionary authority to vote shares held in street name when they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner).

Recently, several large brokerage firms have eliminated discretionary voting, which has had the effect of significantly decreasing the number of shares represented at stockholder meetings.

As a result, companies with substantial retail concentration are finding it difficult to establish a quorum, leading to increased stockholder solicitation costs, multiple meeting adjournments and/or failed routine proposals  including proposals that, while routine under stock exchange rules, are consequential, such as charter amendments to implement reverse stock splits designed to assist in regaining or maintaining compliance with stock exchange minimum price requirements and authorized share increases intended to enable companies to opportunistically pursue equity financing.

As retail holders generally do not have substantial holdings in any given company, they are viewed as displaying rational apathy when it comes to voting  that is, their level of economic interest does not warrant the time and effort that would be required to review proxy materials and cast an informed vote.

Without broker discretionary voting, these routine proposals, despite being approved by the holders of a majority of the shares actually voted at the meeting, frequently fail due to the higher voting threshold (typically a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares) required to pass the proposal.

Affected companies have sought creative solutions, including unilaterally amending their bylaws to decrease the number of shares required to achieve quorum, as the laws of Delaware and many other states permit quorum to be reduced to one-third of the voting power of the outstanding stock, and shifting from a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy standard to a lower majority of the votes cast standard for all matters other than those on which the charter or applicable law requires a different or greater vote.

But reducing quorum or the default voting standard does not solve the greater hurdle of securing the requisite vote of stockholders to approve critical proposals subject to heightened voting requirements.

As a result, many companies, particularly those listed on Nasdaq, have begun implementing super-voting preferred stock as a means of magnifying the vote of stockholders who remain active and engaged, and thereby bolster the prospect of achieving heightened voting standards.

What is super-voting preferred stock?

In this context, super-voting preferred stock refers to a series of preferred stock, designated through a resolution of the board of directors using the blank check authority provided by the charter, that carries with it a disproportionately large number of votes per share (e.g., 250,000,000 votes per share of preferred) in comparison to the existing outstanding classes or series of a companys stock.

The super-voting preferred stock is issued in advance of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting, and it is designed to give its holder the power to vote for certain routine proposals that would likely otherwise fail due to low participation among stockholders  typically retail investors."
Cooley,Companies Implementing ‘Super-Voting Preferred Stock’ as Stockholder Meeting Solution,"While there are numerous variations, in cases where the company issues shares of super-voting preferred stock to one or more new investors, the super-voting preferred stock typically will be designated with the following rights, powers and preferences (and corresponding restrictions and limitations):

The power to vote together with the common stock (or other outstanding classes or series of voting stock) as a single class on the proposal(s) for which it was designated.

The super-voting preferred stock will be voted in the same proportion as the votes cast by the shares of common stock (or other outstanding classes or series of voting stock) on such proposal, with no other voting rights except for those required by the applicable state law.

Either restrictions on the right to convert into shares of any other class or series of stock of the company, or on the right to convert into common stock only after stockholder approval of the proposal(s) for which the super-voting preferred stock was adopted.

A 1x liquidation preference and no dividend entitlement.

An automatic redemption by the company immediately following the approval of the proposal(s) for which it was adopted (or optional redemption, if the super-voting preferred stock is convertible into common stock).

Regulatory landscape Stock exchange requirements Super-voting preferred stock is generally prohibited under stock exchange rules.

Nasdaq Listing Rule 5640 and Section 313 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual prohibit corporate actions that would disparately reduce or restrict existing stockholder rights, including through the issuance of super-voting preferred stock.

However, a company seeking to implement super-voting preferred stock in the stockholder meeting context may be able to do so under the circumstances described below in consultation with the applicable exchange.

In contrast to Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange requirements for US companies, both exchanges will accept an action or issuance by a non-US company relating to its voting rights structure that is not prohibited by the companys home country law.

Formal guidance from Nasdaq and the NYSE on super-voting preferred stock is unavailable.

However, through consultation with Nasdaq and Nasdaq consultants and a review of recent filings by Nasdaq-listed companies, weve determined that three criteria are necessary for Nasdaq compliance, as outlined below.

1. Separate quorum For the proposals on which the super-voting preferred stock will vote, the company must achieve quorum without relying on the super-voting preferred stock.

Typically, the quorum requirement is specified in the companys bylaws and requires the presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote, except where otherwise provided by statute or the companys certificate of incorporation.

Sidebar:

In response to the increasing challenge of achieving quorum for stockholder meetings, many companies have unilaterally reduced their quorum threshold where the quorum requirement is specified solely in their bylaws (and thus not requiring a charter amendment and separate stockholder approval).

As noted above, for Delaware corporations, a quorum can be reduced to not less than one-third of the votes represented by shares outstanding on the record date for the stockholder meeting.

Reducing the quorum requirement is not without risk and should involve a careful assessment of the specific companys unique circumstances, including stockholder activism and takeover risks.

2.

Mirror voting The super-voting preferred stock must be voted in the same proportion as the votes cast by the shares of common stock on the proposal(s) for which the super-voting preferred stock is entitled to vote.

This often requires issuing a super-voting preferred stock with what may seem like an inordinately high number of votes."
Cooley,Companies Implementing ‘Super-Voting Preferred Stock’ as Stockholder Meeting Solution,"This often requires issuing a super-voting preferred stock with what may seem like an inordinately high number of votes.

For example, assume a company has 10,000,000 outstanding shares of common stock, each entitled to one vote per share, and, prior to its stockholder meeting, issues one share of super-voting preferred stock having 400,000,000 votes, with the super-voting preferred stock being entitled to vote only on a reverse stock split proposal.

The companys quorum requirement has been reduced to one-third of the voting power of the voting stock, but the company still needs the proposal to be approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of all stock.

Assuming only the minimum one-third of the voting power of the common stock is represented at the meeting (satisfying the separate quorum requirement), and 51% of such shares of common stock are voted in favor of the proposal, the super-voting preferred stock would cast 204,000,000 votes in favor of the proposal, resulting in an aggregate of 205,700,001 total votes in favor of the proposal, just slightly more than the 205,000,001 votes needed to pass the proposal.

3. Limited purpose

The super-voting preferred stock must only have voting rights on the proposal(s) for which it is designated.

Upon passing of the proposal(s), the super-voting preferred stock will have no voting rights, except for those required by the applicable state law, and consequently typically will be redeemed (sometimes automatically) or converted into regular common stock.

In addition, the only two proposals for which Nasdaq has pre-blessed the use of super-voting preferred stock are an authorized shares increase and a reverse stock split , assuming in each case that such proposal is not related to another proposal (e.g., a reverse stock split in connection with a reverse merger transaction).

It is possible that Nasdaq would permit the use of super-voting preferred stock to pass other proposals where the need to solicit stockholder approval stems solely from state law, but those would need to be discussed with Nasdaq on a case-by-case basis.

Nasdaq has confirmed, however, that in no instance can super-voting preferred stock be used to secure approval of a proposal that requires stockholder approval under Nasdaq rules (e.g., a transaction that requires stockholder approval under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635, such as a change of control and certain equity issuances).

State corporate law In addition to stock exchange compliance considerations, companies should carefully structure the super-voting preferred stock to ensure compliance with their respective organizational documents and the requirements of state corporate law.

Weve summarized key considerations for Delaware corporations below.

The super-voting preferred stock must have a preference over the common stock in order to be considered preferred stock.

A nominal liquidation preference equal to the purchase price of the super-voting preferred stock (which itself may be nominal) is one approach.

The holder of the super-voting preferred stock should be subject to a voting agreement (either in the purchase/issuance agreement or in a stand-alone voting agreement), as automatic voting is of questionable validity.

The applicable voting standard should be evaluated to ensure the super-voting preferred stock can be utilized.

While the voting standard for charter amendments is typically a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares, some companies may have adopted charter provisions imposing greater or additional votes.

For example, the charter may require approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors."
Cooley,Companies Implementing ‘Super-Voting Preferred Stock’ as Stockholder Meeting Solution,"For example, the charter may require approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

In that instance, the company would need to coordinate with the stock exchange to ensure the super-voting preferred stock could be granted the nominal right to vote in the election of directors  otherwise, the super-voting preferred stock would be unable to vote on the key charter amendment proposals  without violating the exchanges listing rules (e.g., by employing design protections that ensure the super-voting preferred stock cannot actually influence the election of directors).

Likewise, affected companies would need to assess whether such nominal right to vote in the election of directors may inadvertently trip a change of control clause under any outstanding equity plan awards, warrants, debt covenants or other agreements.

Careful attention must be given to the class voting requirements.

In Delaware, for instance, certain charter amendments require separate class votes, whether or not the holders of such class would otherwise be entitled to vote thereon.

Pursuant to Section 242(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a class of stock is entitled to vote as a class on any increase or decrease to the authorized number of shares of the class unless the charter itself contains a so-called 242(b)(2) carve out expressly providing that the number of shares of the class may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of outstanding shares of the class) by the holders of a majority of the stock entitled to vote, irrespective of Section 242(b)(2).

Unless the charter of a Delaware corporation includes such a carve out, the super-voting preferred stock may not be used to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock.

While the charters of many venture capital-backed private companies include such provisions, such carve outs do not uniformly appear in public company charters.

Accordingly, any company seeking to use super-voting preferred stock to approve an increase in the authorized common stock will need to confirm that their charter contains a provision that enables the super-voting preferred stock to be included in the vote on the proposal.

The number of votes given to the super-voting preferred stock will be part of the denominator for determining whether a reverse stock split amendment or other charter amendment that does not require a separate common stock class vote has achieved the requisite approval of a majority of the outstanding voting stock.

Accordingly, companies seeking to adopt super-voting preferred stock should first run an exact calculation of the number of votes needed to approve the proposal, factoring in the additional vote count from the super-voting preferred stock.

Sidebar:

Recently, Senate Bill No. 114 was introduced in the General Assembly of the Delaware State Senate to amend Title 8 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

If this legislation is enacted (anticipated as early as August 1, 2023), the threshold to approve a reverse stock split will be reduced from a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares to a majority of the votes cast at the stockholder meeting.

Similarly, the threshold to approve an increase (or decrease) in the authorized number of shares of a class of stock would be reduced to a majority of the votes cast by the affected class of stock.

These amended voting thresholds would apply only to Delaware corporations with securities listed on a national securities exchange, and they would not supersede any higher voting threshold that may be specified in the companys charter."
Cooley,Companies Implementing ‘Super-Voting Preferred Stock’ as Stockholder Meeting Solution,"Proxy adviser considerations In its 2022 proxy season review, ISS identified the use of super-voting preferred stock as an emerging trend in connection with passing certain critical agenda items, but also noted that it is unclear whether super-voting preferred stock will be narrowly used in this way in the future.

ISS and Glass Lewis take a similar negative view of companies with unequal voting rights and multiclass structures, framing them as typically not in the best interests of the common stockholders; ISS generally recommends withhold votes or votingagainst directors individually, committee members or the entire board, while Glass Lewis generally recommends voting against the chair of the governance committee when a company employs a capital structure with unequal voting rights.

However, by narrowly tailoring the super-voting preferred stock so that it has limited application solely to the critical proposals for which a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares is required, and otherwise establishing its terms in a manner that does not harm the common stockholders (e.g., no significant liquidation preference, no favorable redemption rights, no favorable conversion rights, no dividend right

and no additional voting rights), the use of super-voting preferred stock should generally not result in a negative reaction from these proxy advisory firms.

Implementing super-voting preferred stock To date, companies have primarily implemented super-voting preferred stock either through a direct issuance to a select individual or significant stockholder(s) or a dividend to common stockholders.

In each instance, the stock is solely entitled to vote on specific proposals for an upcoming stockholder meeting.

New issuance A company designates the class/series of super-voting preferred stock prior to the record date for the stockholder meeting, then issues the super-voting preferred stock to a select individual (e.g., CEO or board chair) or one or more significant stockholders.

To ensure mirror voting, in addition to a voting requirement included in the certificate of designation, the company also enters into a voting agreement with the purchaser of the super-voting preferred stock.

Dividend approach A company declares a dividend of the newly designated super-voting preferred stock on the outstanding common stock prior to the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on one or more proposals.

In this context, the super-voting preferred stock has certain additional and/or distinct features relative to the new issuance approach, in light of the added complexity introduced by a dividend.

The certificate of designation for the super-voting preferred stock issued under this approach typically provides that: Any shares of super-voting preferred stock that are not represented at the stockholder meeting (as of immediately prior to the polls opening for the meeting) for which the super-voting preferred stock was adopted are automatically redeemed by the company at such time.

The outstanding shares of super-voting preferred stock not so redeemed are separately redeemed following the approval of the proposal(s) for which the super-voting preferred stock was adopted.

The super-voting preferred stock is transferable only if transferred together with the underlying common stock on which it was issued as a dividend.

In this instance, the super-voting preferred stock operates to magnify the vote of the stockholders who participate in the vote.

The structure is premised on a principle of Delaware law that shares reacquired by the company after the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting but before the vote is taken at the meeting are not counted for quorum or voting purposes."
Cooley,Companies Implementing ‘Super-Voting Preferred Stock’ as Stockholder Meeting Solution,"Thus, the shares of super-voting preferred stock that are redeemed prior to the opening of the polls at the meeting cease to count for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and are not included in the denominator for determining the requisite vote.

By contrast, the shares of super-voting preferred stock held by stockholders who are present or represented by proxy at the meeting remain outstanding for quorum or voting purposes.

This structure attempts to provide a direct means of combating the rational apathy problem among retail holders that so many microcap and small-cap companies face.

It does not serve to manufacture the outcome of any vote; rather, it amplifies the voices of the active and engaged stockholders.

Observations and commentary Super-voting preferred stock can be an effective mechanism to secure stockholder approval of certain critical proposals for companies with significant retail stockholder bases and a decline in broker discretionary voting, primarily for proposals that require a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares for approval (e.g., reverse stock splits to regain stock exchange compliance and increases in authorized shares to enable future opportunistic equity financings) in cases where the active and engaged stockholders are supportive of the proposals.

As with any action taken by or on behalf of the companys board of directors, the validity of super-voting preferred stock will be twice tested: once for compliance with technical provisions of corporate law and again in equity.

In addition to the factors outlined above, companies considering the deployment of super-voting preferred stock should consider all equitable factors, assessing, among other things, the factors that may be contributing to the failure of any vote on a proposal as well as the potential consequences of the failure to secure approval.

Companies seeking to implement super-voting preferred stock should carefully plan the process, bearing in mind:

Coordinating with the applicable stock exchange is key.

Although some consistency in practice has developed for Nasdaq-listed companies, a company should carefully consider the structure it intends to adopt and coordinate with the applicable stock exchange to ensure the proposed approach does not violate the applicable stock exchanges rules.

Provisions of state corporation law and the companys organizational documents are equally important, including whether the companys charter would permit the preferred stock to vote with the common stock on an authorized share increase.

Super-voting preferred stock does not solve for the separate need to achieve a quorum of the common stock.

As super-voting preferred stock increases in prevalence, additional guidance from stock exchanges and proxy advisory firms may emerge that could impact the considerations covered in this alert.

In addition, if the Delaware legislation referenced above is enacted, the super-voting preferred stock discussed in this alert may not be relevant or necessary for publicly listed Delaware corporations.

However, for the time being, super-voting preferred stock, where deployed in good faith and in an equitable manner, can be a viable solution for companies impacted by the lack of broker discretionary voting at their stockholder meetings."
Cooley,Supreme Court Affirmance in Amgen v. Sanofi Leaves Legal Standard for Patent Enablement Undisturbed,"The legal standard for enablement  the statutory requirement under 35 USC  112 that a patent must enable those skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention  remains unchanged after the US Supreme Court affirmed the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuits judgment in Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi on May 18, 2023.

In a short opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court that agreed with Sanofi, the government and the lower courts that Amgens patents on its cholesterol drug Repatha were invalid, because the broad genus claims in those patents would require a person of ordinary skill in the art to engage in undue experimentation to make every species of antibody covered by the claims.

The Supreme Courts decision leaves the law on enablement unchanged: a genus patent claim is not enabled unless every species covered by the claim is described in the patent, or the patent describes the genus by sufficient structural details that are shared by every species in the genus.

The reasoning in the Supreme Courts opinion centered on reaffirming the vitality of its earliest decisions on patent enablement dating back to the 1800s.

Recognizing that those cases often dealt with simpler technologies, the Supreme Court emphasized that Section 112s enablement requirement is the same for all technologies and applies equally to technologies old and new.

The opinion also noted that the Patent Acts enablement requirement has been the same since the years after the countrys founding, and that the law has always required patent applicants who claim a lot, to enable a lot.

In other words, to fulfill the quid pro quo implicit in patent law, inventors must provide an ample disclosure of their inventions to the public that is at least commensurate with the scope of the limited monopoly they seek from the government.

The Supreme Courts decision will likely have a muted impact on patent owners.

In reaffirming existing law, the Supreme Court did not announce any new test for evaluating whether the enablement requirement is met  or signal any interest in revisiting the enablement requirement anytime soon.

In practice, the outcome of this appeal means that patent applicants should continue to utilize the same types of strategies that have become commonplace in modern patent prosecution practice.

For example, if a patent covers more than an incremental improvement, a patent applicant should consider investing the resources required to generate a patent disclosure that provides a fulsome description of the full range of embodiments that the applicant desires to claim, and/or sufficient details in the disclosure to enable a skilled practitioner to fill out the full scope of the claims without the need for extensive experimentation or new discoveries.

As Gorsuchs opinion explained, [i]f a patent claims an entire class of processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter, the patents specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the entire class.

And while the Supreme Court acknowledged that this standard does not prohibit some reasonable amount of experimentation to make and use the full scope of a patented invention, it cautioned that the amount required cannot amount to a research assignment.

The determination of what constitutes undue experimentation will continue to be a question of law for lower courts, with outcomes that vary based on the predictability of the technology at issue and the specific facts of each case."
Cooley,Supreme Court Rules Andy Warhol’s Prince Portraits Not Fair Use,"On May 18, 2023, the US Supreme Court, in a much-anticipated decision, held that portraits of the musician Prince by Andy Warhol do not constitute fair use under copyright law.

The 7  2 decision in Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith affirmed the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuits decision, finding that the first fair use factor  the purpose and character of the work  did not favor the Andy Warhol Foundations (AWF) fair use defense to copyright infringement, because AWFs works shared the same commercial purpose as the original photograph of Prince taken by photographer Lynn Goldsmith.

Background of the dispute The works in question consist of silkscreen portraits of Prince derived from Goldsmiths original photograph of the musician.

Although Goldsmith granted a limited, one-time license to Vanity Fair in 1984 to enable Warhol to use it as an artist reference for an illustration in the magazine, Warhol proceeded to create a series of such images (unbeknownst to Goldsmith), which AWF later licensed to Cond Nast in 2016.

An orange silkscreen portrait from the series (Orange Prince) appeared on the cover of a special edition magazine released by the publisher following Princes death, triggering the dispute.

Goldsmith argued that the silkscreen portraits constitute unauthorized derivative works of her original photograph and therefore constitute copyright infringement.

AWF argued that the works in question are transformative and fall within the scope of the fair use defense.

A district court agreed with AWF, finding fair use, and the Second Circuit reversed, siding with Goldsmith  setting the stage for the Supreme Court to weigh in on fair use of a creative work for the first time since its 1994 opinion in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music .

The fair use defense to copyright infringement The defense of fair use is codified in Section 107 of the Copyright Act.

It provides that fair use of a copyrighted work  for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching  scholarship, or research is not an infringement of copyright.

(emphasis added)

The statute outlines four factors courts must analyze to determine whether the use of a work is fair: The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is commercial in nature.

The nature of the copyrighted work.

The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work.

The effect upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

In AWF v. Goldsmith , the Supreme Court considered only the first factor.

It explained that the first fair use factor relates to the problem of substitution, or whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation.

A use that shares the purpose of a copyrighted work is more likely to provide the public with a substitute for the copyrighted work.

Whether the use is commercial in nature also is an additional element of the first factor that must be weighed against the degree to which the use has a further purpose or different character.

The decision Siding with Goldsmith, the Supreme Court held that, in the context of Cond Nasts special edition magazine commemorating Prince, the purpose of the Orange Prince image is substantially the same as Goldsmiths original photograph.

The Supreme Court observed that both images are portraits of Prince used in magazines to illustrate stories about Prince, and that both uses are commercial in nature.

The Supreme Court rejected AWFs argument that Warhols series portrays Prince as a larger-than-life iconic figure, thus conveying a meaning and message that is different from the photorealistic, vulnerable portrayal of Prince in Goldsmiths photograph."
Cooley,Supreme Court Rules Andy Warhol’s Prince Portraits Not Fair Use,"Whatever new impression or meaning a viewer  or Warhol himself  may have intended, the purpose of Orange Prince was still, to illustrate a magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince, and a somewhat different portrayal did not suffice to tip the first fair use factor in AWFs favor.

The Supreme Court distinguished the Prince portraits from Warhols Soup Cans series, depicting cans of Campbells soup.

There, the copyrighted Campbells logo is used to advertise soup, whereas Warhols canvases use the copyrighted work for an artistic commentary on consumerism  a purpose that is orthogonal to advertising soup.

The Supreme Court also discussed the commercial nature of AWFs use, namely AWFs licensing of the image to Cond Nast.

It found that this use was so similar to the photographs typical use that a particularly compelling justification for copying the image was needed to find fair use.

Significance This was the US Supreme Courts first decision relating to whether a creative work constitutes fair use in nearly 30 years.

The Supreme Court was careful to limit its decision to the specific works and specific context of the use at issue in the case.

The decision provides further guidance as to how courts should analyze transformation in the context of fair use, indicating that a use of a copyrighted work that arguably conveys a different meaning or message from the original is not enough to determine that a use is fair, particularly where both works are used for the same commercial purpose.

Ultimately, the decision underscores that the fair use defense is not an impenetrable shield, as well as the need to consider obtaining appropriate licenses when using copyrighted works for commercial purposes untethered to traditional fair use contexts, such as criticism, commentary and parody."
Cooley,"Form I-9 Remote Flexibilities to End on July 31, 2023","On May 4, 2023, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that the temporary COVID-19 flexibilities permitting remote Form I-9 identification inspections will expire on July 31, 2023.

Under a 30-day grace period provided by the agencies, employers will be required to conduct in-person verification of Form I-9 documents by August 30, 2023, for all employees who were virtually verified since March 2020.

Form I-9 flexibilities during COVID-19 In March 2020, the DHS announced that it would temporarily permit employers operating remotely due to COVID-19 to inspect Form I-9 Section 2 documents on a virtual basis, including via video link, fax or email.

The flexibilities eventually were extended to employees operating remotely until they undertook nonremote employment on a regular, consistent, or predictable basis, or until the extension of the flexibilities was terminated, whichever happened earlier.

The end of these Form I-9 flexibilities coincides with the end of the COVID-19 national emergency.

Employers have until August 30, 2023, to complete any remaining in-person inspections for employees who were hired on or after March 20, 2020, and for whom the employer has previously only conducted a remote inspection.

This requirement applies even to companies that continue to operate remotely and do not plan to return to work in office.

Next compliance steps Employers should prepare for the sunset of the Form I-9 flexibilities by performing all the steps below as applicable.

Update Form I-9 After physically inspecting identification documents, employers should enter the following information into the Form I-9 Section 2 Additional Information field: COVID-19 Documents physically examined The date of the physical inspection The name of the person who conducted the physical inspection Employers may refer to ICEs sample mockups of how the physical inspection should be annotated.

If the person who performed the remote inspection also performs the in-person inspection, they should enter their initials in the Additional Information field.

However, if a different person performs the in-person inspection, that person should write their full name and title, instead of their initials.

Consider using an authorized representative Employers continuing to operate remotely may want to designate an authorized representative to complete Section 2 (or 3) of Form I-9 on behalf of the company.

Authorized representatives do not need to be employees of the employer and may be anyone, including agents or notaries public, but cannot include employees attesting to their own documentation.

Employers using authorized representatives should note, however, that employers are still liable for any violations in connection with the form or the verification process.

Manage differing documents appropriately If an employee presents documents for in-person inspection that are different from the ones presented for remote inspection, the employer should do one of the following: Complete Section 2 on a new Form I-9 and attach it to the Form I-9 used for remote inspection.

Provide the document title, document number, issuing authority and expiration date (if any) of the new document in the Additional Information field, and notate that the employee presented this document at physical inspection.

The DHS notes, however, that the first option is a better best practice.

Confirm now-expired documents were unexpired during remote inspection Expired documents are permissible for in-person verification, as long as the employees document was unexpired at the time of remote inspection.

Explain employee separation If an employee has since separated from employment, the employer should include an explanation in the Additional Information field and note the date of the employees separation."
Cooley,"Form I-9 Remote Flexibilities to End on July 31, 2023","Verify employees acquired through corporate transactions Employers who have acquired employees through a corporate transaction and accepted the Form I-9s from the former employer will need to conduct an in-person verification as described above for any employees previously checked remotely.

Maintain written documentation of onboarding and telework policy Employers who took advantage of the remote flexibilities must ensure they maintain written documentation of their remote onboarding and telework policy for each employee, per the DHSs original announcement .

Although the COVID-19 related flexibilities will sunset soon, the DHS published a proposed rule last year that would authorize alternative options for document examination procedures and enable the DHS to respond to emergencies similar to COVID-19.

The comment period on the proposed rule closed on October 17, 2022, and the DHS plans to issue a final rule later this year.

Cooley,10 Actionable Compliance Steps for Massachusetts Employers,"Massachusetts employment laws are notoriously complex.

Employers face the constant challenge of managing their workforces while also complying with the commonwealths ever-evolving legal requirements.

Below we have listed 10 actionable steps that private-sector employers in Massachusetts should take to promote compliance and avoid common pitfalls.

1. Ensure compliance with Massachusetts background laws Pursuant to the Massachusetts Ban the Box law, it is unlawful for employers to ask about an applicants criminal record on an employment application.

In addition, with certain exceptions, employers may not ask about an applicant or employees criminal history.

2.

Fulfill Massachusetts-specific noncompete considerations Employers wishing to secure noncompetition agreements must comply with the Massachusetts Non-Competition Agreement Act, which went into effect on October 1, 2018.

In addition to the minimum drafting requirements set forth by the act (as detailed in our August 2018 client alert ), employers should present a noncompetition agreement alongside an offer letter, at least 10 business days before the start date.

3. Audit employee onboarding documentation practices In addition to workplace posting requirements, numerous notices must be provided to new hires based in Massachusetts.

All Massachusetts employers with at least six employees must provide upon hire and annually to all employees a written copy of the companys sexual harassment policy and provide written notice to employees of their rights under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act via the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination Guidance .

All Massachusetts employers also must provide a copy of the Earned Sick Time Notice of Employee Rights to Massachusetts employees at time of hire, or include any sick time policy in an employee handbook, and provide written information relating to the Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave Law through Department of Family and Medical Leave notices .

4. Conduct annual anti-harassment trainings The Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act encourages employers to conduct anti-harassment trainings for new employees within their first year of employment.

5. Update policies to comply with the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act Through the Massachusetts CROWN Act of 2022, Massachusetts expanded the term race under the Fair Employment Practices Act to include traits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture, hair type, hair length and protective hairstyles.

Employers should review their anti-harassment and equal employment opportunity policies to reference such expanded protected classes.

6. Review family and medical leave policies Qualifying Massachusetts workers are eligible to take up to 26 weeks of paid leave per benefit year under the Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave program (as detailed in our May 2019 , June 2019 and September 2019 client alerts).

For employers offering additional parental leave, it is important to review parental leave policies and confirm that, if desired, all statutory and company-offered leaves are taken concurrently.

7. Review practices regarding separation All employers should be mindful of termination best practices, including: Ensure compliance with final pay obligations.

Involuntarily terminated employees must receive final pay on the separation date, which should include all accrued wages, any accrued but unused vacation, and any earned commissions.

Implement a procedure to ensure prompt and full return of company devices and a review of such devices for suspicious activity.

Remind departing employees of their continuing obligations under any restrictive covenant agreement.

Review and refresh separation agreements, including with respect to the recent National Labor Relations Board decision on nondisparagement and confidentiality provisions, as detailed in our February 2023 client alert."
Cooley,10 Actionable Compliance Steps for Massachusetts Employers,"Distribute the requisite unemployment insurance notice .

8. Review incentive-based compensation plans Employers that offer bonuses, commissions or other forms of incentive-based compensation should review their plans to ensure they clearly define when eligible incentive compensation is earned and when it is paid.

Avoiding such ambiguities can protect against violations of the Massachusetts Wage Act.

9.

Review Fair Labor Standards Act compliance and ensure accurate job descriptions All employers should regularly review job duties and salaries of all employees classified as exempt from overtime under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

Job descriptions should accurately capture job duties to protect the company from potential misclassification claims.

Additionally, employers should ensure that they are tracking hours for non-exempt employees and paying overtime for time worked in excess of 40 hours per week.

10.

Comply with the Massachusetts personnel file law As we explained in a December 2021 client alert , employers with 20 or more employees should maintain personnel files in accordance with the Massachusetts personnel file law, which requires employers to notify an employee within 10 days of any information added to a personnel file that has been or may be used in connection with an adverse employment action.

Employers also must provide a copy of the personnel file to an employee or former employee within five business days of such a request.

If you have questions about addressing any of these issues, please contact the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,NYC Issues Final Regulations on Automated Employment Decision Tools Law,"The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) has adopted final regulations regarding Local Law 144 , the citys Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT) law.

The DCWP will begin enforcing the AEDT law on July 5, 2023.

As we reported in an October 2022 client alert , the AEDT law requires New York City employers to comply with extensive requirements before using an AEDT, including completing an independent bias audit of the tool and providing notice regarding the tool to candidates and employees.

Among other things, the final regulations: Modify the definition of machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to expand the scope of covered AEDTs.

Provide additional standards for the bias audit.

Expand the scope of required information to be included in publishing results of a bias audit.

We discuss these developments in more detail below.

Broadened scope of covered AEDTs The AEDT law defines an automated employment decision tool as any computational process that is derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, and issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for employment decisions that impact people.

The final rules eliminate an earlier requirement that the computer-based technique have inputs and parameters  refined through cross-validation or by using training and testing data, and therefore expand the scope of tools that can be considered qualifying AEDTs.

Additional standards for bias audits The rules also impose additional standards for bias audits.

What needs to be audited?

An employer must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT, even if the tool is used merely to screen at an early point in the application process and not to make a final hiring decision.

Additional bias audit requirements The selection rate and impact ratio must separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories and intersectional categories (e.g., the impact ratio for a selection of Hispanic or Latina candidates versus Black or African American candidates).

The audit must indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

An auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for the impact ratio.

Data used for bias audits The rules confirm that the audit must use data from the New York City employer or agencys own historical use of the tool, with limited exceptions.

Auditors independence The rules clarified questions regarding the level of independence required of the auditor conducting a bias audit by identifying the criteria that would make an auditor not independent.

Publication of bias audit results As described above, the rules expanded the required elements that need to be included in the published summary of bias audits.

Employers and agencies now must make publicly available: The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.

A summary of the results, which should include the source and explanation of the data, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, and the impact ratios for all categories.

The distribution date of the AEDT.

Next steps Employers using a qualifying AEDT should get ahead of the July 5 enforcement date by ensuring their bias audit, notice and publication procedures are compliant with the AEDT law.

The final rules clarified that employers using an AEDT need to have conducted the bias audit by July 5, and annually thereafter.

Employers also should be on the lookout for future laws regulating AI-driven tools used in the employment process, including in California."
Cooley,NYC Issues Final Regulations on Automated Employment Decision Tools Law,"Employers also should be on the lookout for future laws regulating AI-driven tools used in the employment process, including in California.

Various federal agencies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), have expressed concern about potentially harmful uses of automated systems in a recent Joint Statement on Enforcement Efforts Against Discrimination and Bias in Automated Systems .

The EEOC previously announced its plan to target automated systems that intentionally exclude or adversely affect protected groups .

We will continue to monitor developments in this area.

Cooley,Riding the Waves Through Choppy Waters: Scaling Your Company in Today’s Market,"Healthtech executives and investors gathered at Cooleys 13th

Annual Healthtech Conference in early May to discuss market trends and dealmaking, as well as celebrate CEO success stories.

In an opening panel addressing top of mind issues around fundraising and scaling in the current market, Lynne Chou OKeefe (Founder and Managing Partner at Define Ventures), Greg Grunberg (Managing Director at Longitude Capital), Sean Lynden (President, Venture Banking at Pacific Western Bank), and Cooley partner John Sellers addressed best practices for CEOs to navigate current market uncertainties.

Transparency, honesty and effective communication are key to success.

Be honest with management, your board, investors and customers.

Take stock of your current and future business, and build leadership through consensus.

Focus on who you are, and articulate that [position] with clear transparency to your board and investors  .

Your investors are your biggest supporters, shared Chou OKeefe of Define Ventures, which recently closed on a $460 million pair of funds to invest in healthcare-focused companies.

She reminds executives that their investors often will dig deep to support the company in these choppier times, but its important to have a consistent and accurate narrative on the issues, paired with laser-focused execution.

Keep your friends and customers close to drive business and partnerships.

Ensure you are delivering value for current customers.

In some cases, there may be opportunities to leverage customers strategic venture arms or leverage your existing investor relationships to tap into business opportunities.

In this environment, now more than ever its critical to use debt wisely.

Ideally, debt should be a supportive component of your capital structure as opposed to a last resort.

The best course of action is to raise debt when you are at your strongest point, such as after a successful equity funding or a major customer win.

In more challenging situations, Lynden emphasized talk to lenders early and often  the sooner you can bring lenders into the conversation, the better.

Typically, the CEO and CFO will drive conversations with lenders and keep the board informed, but lenders may also want to speak directly with your investors and board members.

Lynden also advised executives to be transparent with their lenders about anticipated challenges to help avoid surprises  and to consider the equilibrium between equity and debt.

While investors in the VC business on the early to mid-stage are of course trying to make money, we succeed when companies succeed, shared Grunberg, who invests in early to growth-stage companies at Longitude, which invests across Health Solutions, Biotech and Medtech.

In this environment, many companies have some level of debt, but with the right frame of reference, you can have a number of stage and risk appropriate capital partners supporting your company.

The fundraising environment has shifted from growth as the highest priority to sustainability and looking toward profitability.

Sellers highlighted that Cooleys Q1 2023 Venture Financing Report reflected deal volume, invested capital and up rounds continuing to decline, while deal terms remained relatively stable.

Grunberg noted he has not seen major changes with regards to deal terms, but for later-stage opportunities, it starts with an honest conversation around pricing.

Lynden shared that he anticipates venture debt terms will get more aggressive, and Chou OKeefe noted a return to a more historical venture norm: A Series A in 2021 may have been $40 million, but that Series A today may be a $10 million to $15 million round.

For companies who are fundraising, be prepared for investors to dive deep into your go-to-market strategy, future P&L and customer base.

Management should be crystal clear about your product, as well as the timing of key commercial milestones.

Investors want to ensure that companies have done their homework."

Cooley,UK CMA Launches Initial Review Which Could Help Shape Nation’s AI Sector Landscape,"On 4 May 2023, the United Kingdoms Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced the launch of an initial review of the market for artificial intelligence foundation models .

Through this initial review, the CMA aims to establish an early understanding of the competition and consumer protection principles that could best guide the development of the market for AI foundation models in the UK.

The launch of the review follows the CMAs instructions from the UK government to consider how the innovative development and deployment of AI can be supported against five overarching principles: Safety, security and robustness.

Appropriate transparency and explainability.

Fairness.

Accountability and governance.

Contestability and redress.

Depending on the CMAs findings, the initial review may be a precursor to a more in-depth market investigation into the UK market for foundation models.

Any findings also may be used by the CMA to feed into its recommendations to the UK government concerning future legislative and regulatory changes affecting this sector.

What are foundation models?

Broadly speaking, foundation models are a class of AI system which are trained on massive unlabelled datasets and require significant compute resources to enable such training.

These models can be fine-tuned or trained within specific contexts to serve as the basis or foundation of various potential deployed AI applications.

Prominent examples include: OpenAIs ChatGPT-4 and other large language models, which can be used to generate natural language responses to user prompts and engage in dialogues with users in a coherent and conversational manner.

Stability AIs Stable Diffusion and other text-to-image models, which can be used to generate hyper-realistic images based on users text prompts.

Scope of CMAs initial review The three core areas of focus for the CMAs initial review are: Competition and barriers to entry in the development of foundation models  e.g., in respect of accessing the requisite data and compute resources necessary to train these models, access to talent and funding, and the ways in which these foundation models could disrupt or reinforce the position of the largest firms.

The impact foundation models may have on competition in other markets  e.g., the implications of certain foundation models and associated capabilities, which may be controlled by a limited number of large organisations, becoming necessary for companies to compete effectively in other markets.

Consumer protection  e.g., in respect of risks arising from the use of foundation models in products and services made available to consumers, including in relation to false and/or misleading information generated as outputs from technologies supported by such models.

The relatively narrow scope of this review is consistent with the CMAs mandate as the UKs competition and consumer protection regulator.

However, the CMAs announcement emphasises that the review is intended to operate in line with the UK governments March 2023 white paper on AI , which sets out the governments policy plans for the development of a pro-innovation approach to AI regulation in the UK.

CMAs next steps  and how you can be involved In addition to collating and evaluating existing research in the area, the CMA will rely on various sources of evidence to perform its analysis in the focus areas noted above, including: Voluntary submissions: The CMA has invited interested parties to make submissions on the review.

Stakeholder information requests: The CMA plans to issue information requests to key stakeholders, including developers, researchers and suppliers of inputs such as compute and data, as well as customers and investors.

Meetings: The CMA also plans to hold bilateral meetings with key interested parties.

The evidence and analysis will inform a written report which will set out the CMAs findings."
Cooley,UK CMA Launches Initial Review Which Could Help Shape Nation’s AI Sector Landscape,"Meetings: The CMA also plans to hold bilateral meetings with key interested parties.

The evidence and analysis will inform a written report which will set out the CMAs findings.

The report may include recommendations to the UK government on implementing the legislative and regulatory aims set out in its recent white paper, as well as guidance to suppliers, developers, businesses and end users.

Potential impacts and outcomes Any outcomes from this initial review could help shape the UKs burgeoning AI sector and determine the UKs and UK businesses role in the global AI landscape.

It also could have a material impact on any UK and international businesses looking to do business in the AI sector or leveraging AI-enabled technologies or solutions in the UK.

If the CMA identifies any competition or consumer protection issues in respect of the UKs market for foundation models or related industries, it may investigate these further (e.g., through a lengthier market investigation).

If the CMA receives evidence that entities active in the sector have breached competition and/or consumer requirements, it also could launch enforcement action into suspected breaches.

The UKs focus on AI  as evidenced by the launch of the initial review, the governments white paper and recent guidance from other regulators, such as the UK Information Commissioners Office  is consistent with large-scale regulatory scrutiny and activity in this sector across the globe.

Despite the UK wishing to set itself apart as a pro-innovation AI hub, the CMAs recommendations and UK governments policy in this area may well end up being shaped (to a greater or lesser degree) by the policy and regulatory approaches adopted by authorities in other key markets (notably, the United States and European Union).

Timings There are several key milestones to keep in mind.

Submitting responses: If you would like to respond to the CMAs invitation to comment and submit responses on the review, the window to do so closes on 2 June 2023.

CMA report: The CMA plans to publish its findings in early September 2023.

How can we help?

Cooley,Intercompany Arrangements Following a Flip Transaction,"Many overseas companies reorganize or flip to create a US parent company or to access US venture financing and customers.

Following a flip, there is a US parent company with one or more overseas subsidiary companies, that often hold most  if not all  of the employees, along with the original business and technology/intellectual property assets.

As the parent holds the funds from the venture financing, it needs to consider: The separate tax treatment of each subsidiary.

Any intercompany licensing arrangements required for each subsidiarys operations.

Documentation of intercompany arrangements between the parent and each subsidiary.

How to fund the subsidiaries to cover local employment and operating expenses.

Its important to remember that the parent and each of its subsidiaries are separate companies that must maintain separate accounting, tax and corporate records and ensure appropriate corporate governance procedures are followed.

This involves managing each companys business and their respective assets in accordance with local legal requirements and establishing systems for local tax and accounting compliance.

Whats the best way to do this?

Several factors will determine the appropriate intercompany arrangements between a parent and each foreign subsidiary.

The companies accounting or tax advisers will need to be involved in this analysis to ensure compliance with applicable tax and transfer pricing requirements.

Theres no one-size-fits-all arrangement, but some key factors to consider include the following: Role of the subsidiary If the subsidiary employs engineers and other technical resources  often at salaries significantly lower than in the US  you may want to keep the engineering function in the subsidiary.

If sales or business development employees have already been hired overseas, some sales activity may also take place out of the subsidiary.

Tax position of the subsidiary If the subsidiary has accumulated tax losses from its operations before the flip, it may make sense to have the subsidiary conduct sales of products or services  so long as profits from those sales can be offset by available tax losses.

This might mean the parent acts as a holding company, providing financing by way of capital contributions (equity) or loans, to cover the subsidiarys operational costs that are not met by the fledgling sales activity.

Intellectual property (IP) ownership Where the business began overseas in what is now a subsidiary of a parent, IP rights, such as those around the technology platform, products or services, are likely owned by the overseas subsidiary.

Initial funding and grants made to the subsidiary, sometimes by government agencies, may impose ongoing requirements  such as, IP assets must remain in the subsidiary, minimum employee numbers in the subsidiary, etc.  to avoid triggering repayment of grants or loss of other benefits.

Moving the IP from the subsidiary to the parent may not be possible because of these restrictions, or it may require careful analysis of the tax consequences of transferring IP assets out of the overseas country (if treated by the countrys tax authorities as a sale of an IP asset to the parent, subject to tax on any increase in value of the IP since its creation).

What are some typical intercompany arrangements?

While each situation is different  and is often based on the companys history, prior funding or personnel resources  some typical alternatives include: Parent as holding company with subsidiary carrying out operations and sales The parent provides capital to the subsidiary through capital and/or loans, and the subsidiary handles operations and sales (where it has the benefit of tax losses and owns the IP/technology, for example).

Both the parent loans and the utilization of tax losses require careful tax and accounting analysis.

Parent as reseller or distributor (in US or more broadly)"
Cooley,Intercompany Arrangements Following a Flip Transaction,"Both the parent loans and the utilization of tax losses require careful tax and accounting analysis.

Parent as reseller or distributor (in US or more broadly)

The parent provides sales, management and administrative functions, funds the engineering operations of the subsidiary and receives a license to the technology from the subsidiary to allow the parent to make sales and receive customer revenues.

The parent acts as a reseller or distributor for the subsidiary, which owns the IP/technology in the products or services.

Parent owns future-developed IP The subsidiary continues engineering and development work, which is assigned to the parent under a research and development services agreement in return for payment to cover the subsidiarys operating costs.

So, while it may not be possible to transfer pre-flip IP to the US parent without a tax cost, this approach could be considered if the initial technology will become obsolete as new products or services are developed.

The parent then sells or licenses to customers and receives revenues.

The parent also might appoint a subsidiary as a limited risk distributor to sell products or services in specific territories.

IP cost-sharing In this model, the parent and the subsidiaries agree to split the cost of developing future IP, which each then owns, often based on geography (for example, the US owns rights to sell in North America, and the subsidiary has rights in the rest of the world).

This is obviously a more complicated structure requiring significant tax planning and implementation.

These kinds of arrangements have become far less common since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed in 2017 and may not be appropriate for early-stage companies.

Intercompany arrangements are documented in one or more intercompany agreements.

Agreements between subsidiaries also may be required, as well as agreements covering administrative or other services around the group.

Intercompany agreements document the transfer of funds, IP or other assets between different companies in the same group.

They require regular review to ensure compliance with the tax regimes and transfer pricing requirements of the US and overseas tax authorities."
Cooley,Recent FCA Speeches Reveal Future Strategy Toward Regulation of Fintech and Digital Assets,"Two recent speeches delivered by the UKs financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), shed light on how the FCA wants to be perceived when it comes to the regulation of fintech and digital assets markets.

In this alert, we summarise the key talking points and expand upon what this means for the FCAs future strategy.

Whilst the speeches underline that the FCAs primary concern is to protect consumers from potential harm, they also highlight how the FCA is keen to drive innovation in these markets and help the UK remain an attractive destination for financial technology investment.

Fintech regulation: FCA as innovator and incubator In a speech given to TheCityUK, a private-sector membership body promoting the UKs financial and related professional services industry, on 26 April 2023 by Emily Shepperd , the FCAs chief operating officer and executive director of Authorisations, the underlying message was that the FCA wants to be seen as here to help.

When asked what regulators can do to make it easier for fintech firms to thrive, Shepperd noted that the temptation might be to rip up all the rules  

[y]et one of the best things that a regulator can do to help innovators is to set firm foundations in place on which business can grow.

She described regulatory compliance as an essential ingredient to growth, noting that as fintech firms grow, they often find themselves moving toward more regulatory scrutiny and eventually, for example, applying for a banking licence.

Shepperd also noted market integrity is protected through the FCAs authorisations gateway.

Last year, the FCA turned away more firms than ever for not meeting the high standards required.

Such high standards provide the solid foundations on which innovators can innovate and investors can invest  with confidence.

Perhaps the most interesting remark made by Shepperd was her claim that the FCA is as much an innovator and incubator as it is a regulator.

She noted that although the perception may be that the FCA are the fun extinguishers of financial services, forever saying no  behind the scenes, we are saying yes or at the very least maybe.

Or more frequently, try again.

This indicates a conciliatory approach that should encourage firms to engage in constructive dialogue with the FCA when their applications are rejected.

The FCAs Regulatory Sandbox Shepperd was keen to highlight the FCAs sandboxes  in particular, its Regulatory Sandbox , where firms can test new ideas in a controlled environment and get access to regulatory expertise and a set of tools to facilitate testing.

The FCAs Innovation Pathways also was mentioned, which assists firms with launching innovative products and services by helping them understand how regulation relates to their activities.

To date, more than 830 firms have been supported through the Regulatory Sandbox and Innovation Pathways services.

Early and High Growth Oversight scheme and CryptoSprints The next stage for newly authorised firms could be the FCAs Early and High Growth Oversight scheme, which works with firms immediately after authorisation to help them move from concept to reality, providing enhanced supervision for firms as they get used to their regulatory status.

Shepperd noted that the FCAs public commitment to extend the scheme to 300 firms has now been met.

Firms do not need to apply to be part of this scheme  the FCA will contact them directly if theyre included.

Lastly, on crypto and emerging tech, Shepperd drew attention to the FCAs CryptoSprint events , which aim to increase the FCAs understanding of emerging cryptoasset market practices and seek views on an appropriate regulatory regime.

A notable focus has seen the FCA helping crypto companies make their fund flows more transparent and compliant with anti-money laundering legislation."
Cooley,Recent FCA Speeches Reveal Future Strategy Toward Regulation of Fintech and Digital Assets,"A notable focus has seen the FCA helping crypto companies make their fund flows more transparent and compliant with anti-money laundering legislation.

The Treasury-led Financial Market Infrastructure, or FMI sandbox, is described as a rapidly evolving project that will test whether and how legislation needs to be amended to adapt to innovations, such as distributed ledger technology and tokenisation.

The speech ended with a reminder that the FCAs first objectives are to protect consumers from harm, maintain market integrity and promote competition.

However, a new secondary objective is being introduced and embedded in the organisation: promoting growth among competitiveness.

This is the ultimate aim of the above sandboxes, pathways, sprints and initiatives, with the FCA described as one cog in a bigger wheel that is trying to drive innovation forwards.

Crypto risks and areas of future regulatory focus In another speech delivered to TheCityUK on 25 April 2023, the FCAs Sarah Pritchard , executive director of Markets and executive director of International, acknowledged how investment in crypto has become mainstream and considered the challenges this poses for the regulator.

She noted that in 2022, 42% of US institutional investors and 67% of European institutional investors held crypto.

In addition, one in 10 individual consumers have owned crypto at some point.

This growth in popularity has led to an increase in cryptocurrency crime, which reached an all-time high last year, with illicit addresses receiving $20.6 billion dollars in 2022, up from $18 billion in 2020.

The number of reports to the FCA of cryptoasset scams went from 1,619 in 2019 to 6,372 in 2021.

Pritchard emphasised how the FCAs current remit over crypto is limited to applying crypto anti-money laundering and counterterrorism legislation, but this could be expanded in the future.

The UKs Money Laundering Regulations require UK-based cryptoasset exchanges and custodians to apply for registration with the FCA  with the FCA refusing nearly three-quarters of all applications.

However, Pritchard noted that the FCA is committed to supporting firms in meeting the right standards, having registered 41 crypto firms of all sizes.

Crypto and financial promotions

In terms of future focus areas, the most tangible change will soon be in the regulation of crypto financial promotions, which will come under the FCAs remit once the relevant legislation is passed.

Pritchard expects that crypto promotions will be treated on par with other high-risk investments, and failure to comply will be a criminal offence.

Like other high-risk investments, consumers will be given a cooling off period to decide whether they want to invest.

The new regulations will apply to all firms marketing cryptoassets to UK consumers, regardless of whether the firm is based overseas or what technology is used to make the promotion.

Sanctions will range from taking down websites to issuing public warnings to enforcement action.

Lastly, the governments consultation on providing the FCA with new powers over those conducting activities related to crypto that do not have origins in the UK but do provide services to UK consumers is described as unchartered territory and an area we will all explore together with interest.

For further details, please refer to our March 2023 client alert on marketing of cryptoassets .

Summary: A shift in public perception?

Whilst both speeches maintain that the FCAs primary role is to protect consumers from harm, the speech by Shepperd, in particular, signifies a recognition by the FCA that it has an important part to play in driving innovation.

Rather than being seen as the enemy of fintech firms, its sandboxes, schemes and sprints demonstrate that it is trying to seek input from industry and better understand the technologies  instead of refusing to authorise firms outright."
Cooley,Recent FCA Speeches Reveal Future Strategy Toward Regulation of Fintech and Digital Assets,"It wants to be seen as a transparent regulator that will no longer hold the UK back but will instead solidify the UKs position as a leading fintech jurisdiction, serving as an innovator and incubator just as much as a regulator.

At the same time, the FCA is alive to the growth in popularity of crypto investment and the new risks it poses for consumers, which the organisation will soon possess new powers to combat.

Cooley,Important Upcoming To-Do List for Federal Contractors: Certify AAP Compliance by June 29 and Implement Revised Disability Self-Identification Form by July 25,"Federal contractors should take note of two recent developments from the US Department of Labors Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).

First, the agencys affirmative action plan (AAP) certification portal is open for this certification year.

Contractors have until June 29, 2023, to certify in the portal that they are meeting the requirement to develop and maintain an AAP for each AAP establishment.

Second, the agency recently issued a revised Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form, which contractors must implement by July 25, 2023.

Certification of AAP compliance As we reported in March 2022 , contractors who employ 50 or more employees and have a single federal contract or subcontract of $50,000 or more must certify whether they have developed and maintained an AAP for each establishment and/or functional or business unit that they currently maintain, under the Rehabilitation Act.

In addition, new federal contractors must develop an AAP within 120 days of entering into a federal contract or subcontract.

Contractors must choose one of three certification statuses in the OFCCP Contractor Portal , which opened for 2023 certifications on March 31: The entity has developed and maintained AAPs for each establishment and/or functional or business unit.

The entity has been party to a qualifying federal contract or subcontract for 120 days or more, and it has not developed and maintained an AAP at each establishment.

The entity became a covered federal contractor or subcontractor within the past 120 days and has not yet developed AAPs for each establishment.

Contractors selecting the third option have 90 days from the development of their AAPs to access the portal and update their certification.

The OFCCP does not require that contractors upload their AAPs to the portal.

Notably for this year, contractors now must provide the coverage period for their AAPs.

It is important to note that contractors must have a current AAP in place at the time of the certification  they cannot certify compliance if their most recent AAP has since expired.

Revised Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form On April 25, 2023, the OFCCP issued a revised Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form to reflect preferred language for disabilities and to include additional examples of disabilities.

This revised form expires on April 30, 2026.

Federal contractors and subcontractors are required to invite each job applicant and employee to self-identify as an individual with a disability using the OFCCPs self-identification form, and they may not vary from this content.

The form must be provided to applicants at the pre-offer and post-offer stages, and to employees at least every five years.

In addition, at least once during this five-year period, employers must remind employees that they may voluntarily update their disability status at any time.

The information gathered by the form responses can be used to track progress toward utilization goals, assess outreach and recruitment efforts, and improve practices related to placement, retention and promotion of individuals with disabilities.

Contractors must keep all self-identification information confidential and cannot compel individuals to self-identify.

Notably, the revised form makes changes in three areas, as outlined below.

Additional disabilities The form includes several new categories of disabilities, such as substance use disorder, neurodivergence, partial or complete paralysis, short stature, mobility impairment, and disfigurement.

Existing disabilities The form updates language describing existing disabilities.

For example, cancer now includes past cancer, and psychiatric conditions has been eliminated in favor of mental health conditions.

Simplified explanatory introduction and response language

The introductory statement has been simplified to state the purpose and use of the form more plainly."
Cooley,Important Upcoming To-Do List for Federal Contractors: Certify AAP Compliance by June 29 and Implement Revised Disability Self-Identification Form by July 25,"Simplified explanatory introduction and response language

The introductory statement has been simplified to state the purpose and use of the form more plainly.

The available responses also have been simplified.

For example, the prior affirmative response of Yes, I have a disability, or have a history/record of having a disability, has been changed to Yes, I have a disability, or have had one in the past.

Next steps Contractors should certify their AAP compliance before June 29 and replace their voluntary self-identification forms with the OFCCPs revised version by July 25.

Contractors who did not certify AAP compliance last year should heed particular caution, as the OFCCP noted in 2022 that such contractors will be more likely to appear on the agencys scheduling list and thus more likely to be selected for audit."
Cooley,Treasury DeFi Report Offers Insight Into BSA Compliance,"Editor's note: Authored by Sean Ruff, Adam Fleisher and Obrea Poindexter, this article was originally published in Law360 .

After a period of rapid innovation and growth in the virtual currency and digital asset space, state and federal regulators have recently issued statements, guidance and reports that articulate specific concerns and corresponding regulatory expectations with respect to digital asset activities.

Case in point is the recent ""Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance""[1] released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury last month.

This report, which is part of the Treasury's recent investigations of digital assets as required by the 2022 executive order on digital assets,[2] reaffirms that the Treasury Department sees significant risks associated with decentralized finance, or DeFi, services and the potential impact on efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

The new report follows the Treasury's March 2022 ""National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,""[3] which first identified DeFi as an illicit finance risk.

That money laundering risk assessment briefly identified illicit finance risks associated with DeFi, noting that ""[c]riminals and professional money launderers continue to use a wide variety of methods and techniques, including traditional ones, to place, move, and attempt to conceal illicit proceeds ...

[including] the ever-evolving world of virtual assets and related service providers, including decentralized finance and the growing use of anonymity-enhancement technologies.

""[4] Unlike the previous risk assessment, however, this new report is focused not only on money laundering and illicit finance risk, but also on addressing the regulation of DeFi activities under the existing Bank Secrecy Act regulatory regime, particularly as applied to money services businesses, or MSBs.

The report's statements regarding vulnerabilities due to the uncertain and inconsistent application of the BSA should be of significant interest to industry participants that may have been waiting for additional guidance regarding whether and to what extent the BSA applies to new and innovative services in the DeFi space.

Regulation of Virtual Currency Activities Under the BSA

The Bank Secrecy Act imposes anti-money laundering, or AML, and countering the financing of terrorism, or CFT, obligations on financial institutions such as banks, broker-dealers and MSBs, which include companies that provide money transmission services  a broad category encompassing significant amounts of fintech and virtual currency activity.

A covered financial institution subject to AML/CFT compliance program obligations must establish and implement an effective AML program and address record-keeping and reporting requirements, including requirements to file suspicious activity reports.

One of the core elements of general AML/CFT compliance  established differently for different financial institution types  is the requirement that the provider of the financial service know the identity of the persons to whom it is providing services.

While some financial institutions, such as banks, have prescriptive requirements for customer identification programs,[5] MSBs are also generally required to have in place risk-based policies and procedures for complying with BSA obligations, including verifying customer identification as applicable.[6] Additionally, financial institutions that are MSBs are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network .[7]

While implementing these types of measures may create operational complexities given the nature of how some services are delivered, the decentralized finance report makes it clear that the Treasury is not sympathetic to such concerns."
Cooley,Treasury DeFi Report Offers Insight Into BSA Compliance,"The Treasury simply states in the report that a ""DeFi service that functions as a financial institution as defined by the BSA, regardless of whether the service is centralized [or] decentralized, will be required to comply with BSA obligations, including AML/CFT obligations.

""[8]

This statement  which characterizes a prevailing theme of the new report  appears consistent with the general messaging from the Treasury, and in particular FinCEN, since virtual currency was first introduced roughly 10 years ago.

FinCEN has long interpreted the MSB designation to apply to activities involving accepting, transmitting, exchanging and issuing virtual currencies.

In particular, in a 2013 administrative ruling, FinCEN explained that it viewed the BSA to apply to activities involving virtual currencies in the same manner as they would apply to activities involving ""traditional"" or ""fiat"" money, i.e., the ""definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies.""

FinCEN added that [a]ccepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.""[9]

Since its 2013 guidance, FinCEN has consistently interpreted BSA regulations to apply to virtual currency activities, and has indicated a willingness to interpret the scope of these regulations broadly to encompass new products, services and innovations in the virtual currency space.

For example, in 2019 guidance, FinCEN addressed the applicability of the BSA regulations to certain business models including peer-to-peer virtual currency exchangers, virtual currency wallets, kiosks  or so-called bitcoin ATMs  anonymity-enhanced CVC transactions, and decentralized (or distributed) applications, which FinCEN characterized as ""DApps.""

With respect to DApps, FinCEN stated that the same regulatory interpretation that applies to other business models  e.g., bitcoin ATMs  applies ""to DApps that accept and transmit value,"" meaning that ""when DApps perform money transmission, the definition of money transmitter will apply to the DApp, the owners/operators of the DApp, or both.""[10

] These statements relating to DApps appear to apply in the context of DeFi more generally.

Application of BSA Requirements to DeFi Services

The report notes that the term ""DeFi"" has no generally accepted definition but ""broadly refers to virtual asset protocols and services that purport to allow for some form of automated [peer-to-peer] transactions, often through the use of self-executing code known as smart contracts based on blockchain technology.

""[11]

The risk assessment observes that ""DeFi services often provide customers with the same services and products as traditional financial institutions, such as lending, borrowing, purchasing, or trading virtual assets, including assets that function as financial products like securities, commodities, derivatives, or others (e.g., insurance).""[12]

It follows, as indicated in the report, that a ""DeFi service that functions as a financial institution as defined by the BSA, regardless of whether the service is centralized [or] decentralized, will be required to comply with BSA obligations, including AML/CFT obligations.

""[13]

That means that if the service meets the applicable definition of a financial institution like an MSB or a broker-dealer, its decentralization ""has no bearing"" on whether the obligations apply.[14]

Not only is decentralization seen as generally immaterial to the analysis of whether activity is subject to the BSA, but also the Treasury Department appears to be skeptical of the notion in the first instance."
Cooley,Treasury DeFi Report Offers Insight Into BSA Compliance,"It cautions in the report that the ""degree to which a purported DeFi service is in reality decentralized is a matter of facts and circumstances, and this risk assessment finds that DeFi services often have a controlling organization that provides a measure of centralized administration and governance.""[15]

Therefore, after noting money laundering and related risks  e.g., ""There have been several instances of actors, including ransomware actors, thieves, scammers, and drug traffickers, using DeFi services to transfer and launder their illicit proceeds""[16]  the report turns to the activities of DeFi services themselves.

TheTreasury's view is that ""DeFi services at present often do not implement AML/CFT controls or other processes to identify customers, allowing layering of proceeds to take place instantaneously and pseudonymously.

""[17]

As a result, the report affirms that obligations for financial institutions under the BSA apply to DeFi services, if those services involve the activities of financial institutions as defined by the BSA.

For example, according to the report, if a DeFi service accepts and transmits virtual assets from one person to another person or location by any means, then it most likely would qualify as a money transmitter, and therefore an MSB, and be subject to the same AML/CFT compliance program obligations as a money transmitter offering services in fiat currency.

On the other hand, the report recognizes that some DeFi services may fall outside the BSA definition of a financial institution, such as, depending on the specific facts and circumstances, some services that enable users who self-custody assets to interface with software that processes transactions automatically.

The Treasury Department's rhetoric in describing such services indicates it is also skeptical of decentralization in this context, noting that many DeFi services ""claim to be disintermediated by enabling automated [peer-to-peer] transactions without the need for an account or custodial relationship.

""[18]

Furthermore, the risk assessment notes that DeFi services that fall outside the scope of the BSA could potentially ""result in gaps in suspicious activity reporting and limit authorities' collection of and access to information critical to supporting financial investigations.

""[19]

Other Risk Assessment Findings The report asserts that bad actors are using DeFi services to transfer and launder their illicit proceeds, largely by capitalizing on vulnerabilities stemming from the lack of AML/CFT controls for DeFi services and lack of compliance with BSA obligations.

The Treasury Department identified several vulnerabilities that bad actors capitalize on, including: Lack of compliance with AML/CFT obligations; Lack of coverage of certain DeFi services by existing AML/CFT requirements; Less rigorous or nonexistent AML/CFT controls in foreign jurisdictions; and Poor cybersecurity controls by DeFi services.

The risk assessment suggests that such vulnerabilities may stem in part from the fact that industry participants may not fully understand how AML/CFT obligations apply to DeFi services.

While the report may provide further clarity regarding federal agencies' views, the Treasury also relays that the agencies  particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , Commodity Futures Trading Commission and FinCEN  have already made their view known ""through public statements, guidance, and enforcement actions.

""[20] As characterized by the report, these agencies have already indicated that ""the automation of certain functions through smart contracts or computer code does not affect the obligations of financial institutions offering covered services.

""[21] Treasury Recommendations, Request for Comment and Implications

The report includes recommendations for U.S. government actions to mitigate the illicit finance risks associated with DeFi services, including: Strengthening AML/CFT regulatory supervision;"
Cooley,Treasury DeFi Report Offers Insight Into BSA Compliance,"The report includes recommendations for U.S. government actions to mitigate the illicit finance risks associated with DeFi services, including: Strengthening AML/CFT regulatory supervision;

Assessing enhancements to the AML/CFT regulatory regime to address gaps; Providing additional guidance for the private sector on DeFi services' AML/CFT obligations, as well as coordinating with industry on threat mitigation and information sharing; and Engaging with foreign jurisdictions to implement the latest global Financial Action Task Forcestandards and to close gaps in FATF implementation governing DeFi.

The Treasury Department also seeks public input on the risk assessment  but does not appear to provide in the report a clear mechanism or process to provide such input  and it poses several questions for comment, including which factors should be considered to determine whether DeFi services are a financial institution under the BSA, as well as recommendations for clarifying the DeFi services covered by the BSA and how AML/CFT obligations should vary based on the different types of DeFi services.

Regardless of whether companies in the DeFi space decide to engage with the Treasury and regulators such as the SEC or FinCEN on these issues, it seems clear that federal regulators believe that DeFi services that enable financial products or services such as payments or lending are on notice that applicable activities are subject to regulation under the BSA.

As a result, companies operating in this space will need to consider  or reconsider  how these regulations may apply and how it may be possible to implement controls to meet BSA requirements in spite of delivering services through new technologies.

Cooley,FCA Releases Consultation Paper on Proposed Reforms to UK Listing Rules,"Following a stream of high-value companies turning to alternative stock exchanges, the UKs financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is taking steps to boost London as an attractive listing venue with wide-sweeping reforms to its Listing Rules.

The urgency is clear, as companies considering listing in London may benefit from the new rules as early as 2024.

On May 3, 2023, the FCA released a consultation paper (CP23/10) proposing significant reforms to the UK listing regime.

The FCAs stated aim is to help encourage a more diverse range of companies to list and grow on UK markets, especially earlier-stage and more innovative or acquisitive companies.

The key proposals are: A single listing category to replace the current standard and premium segments of the Official List.

The removal of eligibility rules requiring a three-year financial and revenue earning track record as a condition for listing, and no longer requiring a clean working capital statement.

Modified and simplified eligibility and ongoing rules requiring that a company has an independent business and operational control over its main activities, to create a more permissive approach to accommodate a range of business models and corporate structures.

Modified rules requiring listed companies to conclude a shareholder agreement with a controlling shareholder to ensure flexibility by moving to a comply or explain and disclosure-based approach, which also would create a more permissive approach for a wider range of business models and corporate structures.

A more permissive approach to dual class share structures.

The removal of compulsory shareholder votes and shareholder circulars for significant transactions.

The removal of compulsory shareholder votes and shareholder circulars for related party transactions, including where a controlling shareholder is involved, and a controlling shareholder agreement is not in place.

The proposals build on the recommendations set out in Lord Hills UK Listing Review conducted in 2021 and represent a continuation of the FCAs late 2021 efforts to introduce changes to the Listing Rules to reduce barriers to companies listing in the UK.

(For more information, refer to our client alerts on Lord Hills review and the FCAs 2021 reforms .)

The FCA acknowledges that further consultation is needed on the proposals in order to move towards draft revised Listing Rules.

In addition, the position of FTSE Russell in respect of the inclusion criteria it applies for the FTSE UK indices (including the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250) after these rule changes will be key.

The FCA notes in its consultation paper that it will remain open to index providers setting higher or different standards, or creating alternative indices reflecting different users preferences, should they wish to supplement the standards required by the reformed Listing Rules.

Summary of key proposals New single listing category The FCA has proposed a new single listing category for equity shares in commercial companies.

The proposed single listing category will replace the current premium and standard listing segments of the Official List and is intended to apply to most commercial companies whether they are UK or non-UK incorporated.

Removed, modified and simplified eligibility and ongoing rules Under the proposed single listing category, certain eligibility criteria specific to the premium listed segment would be removed.

Each case represents an alignment with the less restrictive rules of the standard segment, as outlined below.

Financial information eligibility: It would no longer be necessary for companies to demonstrate that they have a three-year financial track record representing at least 75% of their business or a revenue-earning track record before listing, nor to satisfy the FCA that they have sufficient working capital for at least 12 months."
Cooley,FCA Releases Consultation Paper on Proposed Reforms to UK Listing Rules,"(A working capital statement still will be required in the listing prospectus, but in theory it could be qualified.)

Business model eligibility: The proposals are designed to better accommodate diverse business models.

Currently, applicants for a premium listing need to demonstrate that they carry out an independent business as their main activity and that they exercise operational control over this business.

The single listing category is proposed to be more flexible, accommodating issuers with operational businesses that generate, or have the prospect of generating, revenue from their own activities or ventures.

This is expected to remove barriers to franchise-type models and those companies making minority investments in other entities, among others.

The FCA is exploring a modified form of the current obligations for the new single listing category to achieve these aims.

Dual class share structures Currently, companies listing on the standard segment have flexibility around dual class share structures, whereas since 2021 (see the FCAs 2021 reforms ), companies listing on the premium segment can have a more limited form of dual class share structures.

The FCA is proposing an approach for the single listing segment that is more flexible than the current arrangements for the premium segment, as follows: Enhanced voting rights would be exercisable on all matters and at all times , not just to stop a change of control or to protect a founders position as a director, subject to one exception.

The exception would be a requirement that enhanced voting rights shares revert to one share, one vote to approve the issuance of new shares at a discount in excess of 10%.

Enhanced voting rights should cease to be exercisable after 10 years , and enhanced voting rights shares would convert to ordinary shares with one share, one vote (currently, the FCA has set a maximum sunset period of five years for the premium segment).

Restrictions on transfer remain.

The FCA proposes to maintain a modified form of the transfer-based sunset provision currently permitted in a premium listing, which would mean that shares with enhanced voting rights will automatically convert to ordinary listed shares upon the holder ceasing to be a director.

Enhanced voting rights shares can be held only by directors of the company.

In line with the existing premium listed rules, the FCA proposes that enhanced voting rights can only exist if an individual remains involved in setting the strategic direction of the company for which the FCA uses being a director as a proxy.

There are no specified voting ratio or weighting limits.

The FCA proposes removing limits on the maximum enhanced voting ratio that can be attached to enhanced voting rights shares and leaving it to the market to negotiate a suitable level.

We note that these proposals would still mean that dual class share structures available in the UK would be more limited in certain respects than in the US.

For example, in the US, it would be typical for all pre-IPO shareholders (not just directors) to receive high-vote shares and, while sunset provisions are common, there currently is no mandatory requirement in the US for a time-based sunset.

Controlling shareholders The FCA proposes to reframe the requirement for a controlling shareholder agreement (also referred to as a relationship agreement) under a comply or explain approach.

Under the proposal, where an applicant lacks a controlling shareholder agreement (as would currently be required of premium listed issuers), they would instead be required to make specific disclosures and include a discussion of risk factors in their prospectuses and annual financial reports.

For those listed entities with controlling shareholder agreements, the FCA also plans to introduce a new market notification requirement if such an agreement is altered post-admission."
Cooley,FCA Releases Consultation Paper on Proposed Reforms to UK Listing Rules,"For those listed entities with controlling shareholder agreements, the FCA also plans to introduce a new market notification requirement if such an agreement is altered post-admission.

Significant transactions While the premium segments significant transactions regime will not be abolished, the FCA proposes to amend it for the single listing category such that mandatory shareholder approval of significant transactions and the related shareholder circular preapproved by the FCA will no longer be required (except in the event of a reverse takeover).

While class 2 announcements will be retained, the triggering threshold under the class tests will be replaced by the current class 1 threshold of 25%, rather than the current class 2 threshold of 5%.

The FCA does not intend to require sponsor signoff or FCA preapproval for these announcements, although a sponsor still would need to be appointed to guide the company on the application of the rules.

While the calculation of the class tests themselves is likely to remain largely unchanged, the FCA proposes that the profits test will no longer apply (given the frequent anomalous results produced), and the FCA is proposing to allow sponsors more discretion to apply appropriate modifications to the class test without a submission to the FCA.

Whilst these proposals would considerably reduce the regulatory burden on existing premium listed companies who wish to enter into significant transactions, they will increase the burden on standard listed companies who are not currently subject to the significant transactions regime.

This change in approach towards significant transactions will not impact a companys disclosure obligations under the UK Market Abuse Regulation.

The FCA flagged that it would set out proposals for transactions undertaken by companies in financial difficulty in the new single listing category in a future consultation paper.

Related party transaction (RPT) regimes The new regime proposed for the single listing category would replace the two RPT regimes for standard and premium listed issuers.

The FCA proposes to dispense with mandatory shareholder approval of RPTs and related requirements for shareholder circulars preapproved by the FCA.

The triggering thresholds of the two regimes would be consolidated  meaning that only RPTs exceeding the 5% threshold under the class tests would trigger RPT obligations.

These obligations would comprise a market announcement of the transaction containing certain prescribed details about the RPT and including a statement by the board that the RPT is fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned, and that the directors have been so advised by the sponsor.

Notably, the disclosure regime on RPTs under DTR 7.3 will be retained, as this has a slightly different scope and is not limited to listed companies, although where the RPT falls within both regimes, compliance with the provisions in the revised Listing Rules will be sufficient.

Listing cancellations The current rules governing delisting differ for premium listed and standard listed issuers.

Given the significant impact delisting has on the transparency and liquidity available to shareholders, and the risk that a larger shareholder may exploit their position to take private a company to the detriment of other shareholders, the FCA proposes to retain the requirement for a shareholder vote to cancel listings of shares in the single listing category, including the 75% majority requirement (and additional requirements where a controlling shareholder is involved).

The FCA also proposes retaining requirements for a supporting circular approved by the FCA and the existing notice period of 20 business days following shareholder approval.

These reflect the current rules for premium listed issuers and would therefore increase the burden for issuers with a standard listing."
Cooley,FCA Releases Consultation Paper on Proposed Reforms to UK Listing Rules,"These reflect the current rules for premium listed issuers and would therefore increase the burden for issuers with a standard listing.

Corporate governance The FCA proposes to apply the existing premium listing provisions relating to the UK Corporate Governance Code requiring comply or explain disclosures in the annual report to companies within the new single listing category.

What about special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)?

It is likely that the FCA will, under the new issuer/security-type focused regime, cater for SPACs and other shell companies through a new discrete listing category.

Details remain limited, but they can be expected in Q3 2023.

Among the high-level considerations set out in the consultation paper was the extension of the sponsor regime to this category, requiring issuers to appoint a sponsor to assist with applications to list and reverse takeover transactions thereafter.

Not everything will change The proposed single listing regime will retain aspects of the current Listing Rules.

Fundamental eligibility and ongoing listing obligations currently shared by the premium and standard listing segments (e.g., minimum market capitalisation) are not expected to change.

For reverse takeovers , the requirement for shareholder approval, including the requirement for an FCA-approved circular and readmission with a new prospectus covering the enlarged group will remain.

Equally, shareholder approvals required under other current Listing Rules (e.g., those governing discounted nonpreemptive share offers where the offer price represents a discount of more than 10% to the current share price and those relating to certain share buybacks) will be retained alongside requirements concerning climate-related financial disclosures and diversity disclosures already applicable to premium and standard listings.

Rules governing closed-ended investment funds, other share categories such as deferred and preference shares, and debt capital markets are not expected to change significantly.

The FCA has made clear that it will ensure the depository receipts mechanisms of the UK listed markets will not be disrupted.

Timing The proposed reforms are subject to an accelerated timetable, with possible implementation as early as 2024, but an exact implementation date is yet to be set.

For companies already included on the Official List, a transitional period can be expected, which will allow issuers  particularly those with standard listings and therefore likely subject to additional obligations  time to prepare and implement any necessary changes.

Further detail on transitional arrangements is expected in Q3 2023.

Consultation on the proposed regime is open for public comment until 28 June 2023 and will involve roundtable discussions with interested groups of market participants.

A further consultation on wider reforms to the UK listing regime is expected in Q3 2023.

This will include the draft rules for the single listing category and further detail on proposed approaches to noncommercial companies (i.e., SPACs and other shell companies), among others.

If adopted, the proposed rules will be reflected in a new Listing Rules sourcebook.

If you have any questions about the proposed reforms to the UK listing regime, please reach out to any member of the Cooley team listed below."
Cooley,SEC Final Share Repurchase Disclosure Rules Less Burdensome Than Expected,"On May 3, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted at an open meeting to adopt final rules to require enhanced disclosure about issuer share repurchases under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The final rules will: Require tabular disclosure to be filed quarterly 1 in an exhibit to Forms 10-Q and 10-K of an issuers 2 repurchase activity aggregated on a daily basis, replacing the current requirements in Item 703 of Regulation S-K to disclose monthly repurchase data.

Foreign private issuers (FPIs) filing on forms available exclusively to FPIs will have to disclose quarterly the same daily repurchase data on a new Form F-SR, in place of the current requirements in Item 16E of Form 20-F to disclose monthly repurchase data.

Require a company to disclose quarterly via a checkbox whether any of its Section 16 officers or directors  or senior management or directors for FPIs  purchased or sold shares (or other units) that are the subject of a company share repurchase plan or program within four business days before or after the announcement of the plan or program.

Revise and expand Item 703 to require a company to disclose in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K: The objectives or rationales for its share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the amount of repurchases.

Any policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of the companys securities by its officers and directors during a repurchase program, including any restrictions on those transactions.

For FPIs, corresponding narrative disclosure requirements also will be added to Item 16E of Form 20-F. Add new Item 408(d) to Regulation S-K to require quarterly disclosure in Forms 10-Q and 10-K of a companys adoption, material modification or termination of Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements, as well as a description of the material terms of the trading arrangements.

Companies that file on domestic forms will be required to comply with the amendments to Forms 10-Q and 10-K (for their fourth fiscal quarter) beginning with the first filing that covers the first full fiscal quarter beginning on or after October 1, 2023.

Therefore, for calendar year-end companies, the first report requiring compliance with the amendments will be the 2023 Form 10-K filed in 2024, as it relates to repurchases made during the quarter ending December 31, 2023.

FPIs that file on FPI forms will be required to comply with the amendments in a new form, Form F-SR, beginning with the Form F-SR that covers the first full fiscal quarter beginning on or after April 1, 2024.

For calendar year-end companies, the first Form F-SR would, therefore, have to be filed beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2024.

The amendments to the Form 20-F narrative disclosure will be required starting in the first Form 20-F filed after the FPIs first Form F-SR has been filed.

Please see the SEC press release for the final rules and the condensed fact sheet for further details.

For more background on the final rules and information on the SEC commissioners views and statements regarding the rules, which passed by a vote of 3  2 along party lines, see our May 2023 PubCo blog post .

Final amendments Disclosure of daily repurchase activity The final rules will require tabular disclosure on a quarterly basis of an issuers repurchase activity aggregated on a daily basis.

For each day, the table will include: The purchase execution date.

The class of shares.

Total number of shares purchased.

Average price paid per share.

Total number of shares purchased on that date as part of publicly announced repurchase plans or programs.

Aggregate maximum number of shares (or approximate dollar value) that may yet be purchased under a publicly announced plan.

Total number of shares purchased on the open market.

Total number of shares purchased that are intended to qualify for the safe harbor in Rule 10b-18."
Cooley,SEC Final Share Repurchase Disclosure Rules Less Burdensome Than Expected,"Total number of shares purchased on the open market.

Total number of shares purchased that are intended to qualify for the safe harbor in Rule 10b-18.

Total number of shares purchased pursuant to a plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c).

The final rules also require companies to disclose in a footnote to the table the date of adoption, material modification or termination of any trading plan for the repurchased shares that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c).

For companies filing on domestic forms, this daily repurchase data will be filed in a new exhibit to Forms 10-Q and 10-K. A copy of the required format for this table appears as an exhibit to this client alert and is set forth with the related rules in Item 601 (Exhibits) of Regulation S-K.

In contrast, for FPIs that file on FPI forms, the data will be provided quarterly in a new Form F-SR, which must be filed within 45 days after the end of the FPIs fiscal quarter.

Notably, Form F-SR contains an instruction stating that the information on the form relates to the FPIs securities in ordinary share form, whether the FPI has repurchased the shares itself or depositary receipts that represent the shares.

In addition, an FPI that is required to disclose share repurchase information in its home country and furnishes that information on Form 6-K can incorporate by reference its Form 6-K disclosures into its Form F-SR.

As part of this requirement to aggregate the data by day, the final rules will eliminate the current requirements in Item 703(a) and Item 16E of Form 20-F to disclose monthly repurchase data in periodic reports.

In a change from the proposal, the daily quantitative repurchase data will be treated as filed instead of furnished, with the result that the new repurchase disclosure will be subject to liability under Section 18 of the Exchange Act and Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of potential incorporation by reference into Securities Act filings.

Checkbox regarding trading by officers or directors surrounding announcement of repurchase program The final rules also will require companies to disclose quarterly via a checkbox whether any of its Section 16 officers or directors  or senior management or directors for FPIs  purchased or sold shares (or other units) that are the subject of a company share repurchase plan or program within four business days before or after the announcement of the plan or program, or the announcement of an increase in the size of an existing share repurchase plan or program.

For companies filing on domestic forms, the checkbox will be included above the tabular disclosure of the daily repurchase data, while FPIs that file on FPI forms will check the box in new Form F-SR.

In addition, the release notes that a domestic filer may rely on filed Section 16 reports in determining whether it should check the box, provided that the reliance is reasonable.

Because FPIs are exempt from Section 16 reporting, Form F-SR permits an FPI to rely on written representations from its senior management and directors in making this determination, provided that the reliance is reasonable.

Enhanced narrative disclosure The final rules will revise and expand Item 703 of Regulation S-K to require a company to disclose in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K: The objectives or rationales for its share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the amount of repurchases.

Any policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of the companys securities by its officers and directors during a repurchase program, including any restrictions on those transactions.

Corresponding narrative disclosure changes also will be made to Item 16E of Form 20-F."
Cooley,SEC Final Share Repurchase Disclosure Rules Less Burdensome Than Expected,"Corresponding narrative disclosure changes also will be made to Item 16E of Form 20-F.

In response to comments expressing concern about potential exposure of confidential information, the SEC contended that, although the disclosure requirements should convey a thorough understanding of the [company's] objectives or rationales for the repurchases, and the process or criteria it used in determining the amount of the repurchase, the final amendments do not require [companies] to provide disclosure at a level of granularity that would reveal any competitive or sensitive information beyond what may already be gleaned from other disclosures regarding the business and financial condition of the [company].

Notably, the existing requirements in Item 703 to disclose in a footnote to the monthly table the principal terms of all publicly announced repurchase plans or programs  and the number of shares purchased other than through a publicly announced plan or program, including the nature of the transaction  will still apply.

However, this disclosure will now be required in the main text of the narrative discussion since the monthly table has been eliminated.

Disclosure regarding Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements The final rules will add new Item 408(d) to Regulation S-K, which will require companies to disclose on Forms 10-Q and 10-K their adoption, material modification 3 or termination during the covered quarter of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or arrangement regarding their own securities.

Companies also will be required, pursuant to Item 408(d)(1), to provide a description of the material terms of the trading arrangement (other than pricing terms)  such as the date of adoption, material modification or termination, duration of the arrangement and the aggregate number of securities to be purchased or sold pursuant to the arrangement.

Furthermore, to prevent potential duplication, a note is included in Item 408(d)(1) stating that, if the disclosure provided pursuant to Item 703 contains disclosure that would satisfy the requirements of Item 408(d)(1), a cross-reference to that disclosure will satisfy the Item 408(d)(1) requirements.

FPIs are not required to provide disclosure under Item 408(d).

Importantly, unlike the rules relating to trading arrangements entered into by individuals, the final rules do not require disclosure of any company non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements.

New Item 408(d) will be added to Part II, Item 5, Other Information of Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 9(b), Other Information of Form 10-K. Inline XBRL Consistent with other recent disclosure rules proposed and adopted by the SEC, the final rules require companies to tag information disclosed pursuant to Items 601 and 703 of Regulation S-K, Form F-SR and Item 16E of Form 20-F using Inline XBRL.

The requirements include detail tagging of quantitative amounts disclosed within the tabular disclosures, as well as block text tagging and detail tagging of required narrative and quantitative information.

Observations and commentary The final rules depart from the initial proposal  mostly in a company-friendly way .

Perhaps due to the large number of comments received that opposed the proposed rules, the final rules made changes from the proposal that are largely beneficial to companies.

Most importantly, the final amendments require disclosure of the daily repurchase data to be filed quarterly, instead of one business day after execution of a share repurchase, as was contemplated by the proposal.

This change should greatly reduce the administrative burden of this rulemaking, especially given that companies are already accustomed to providing repurchase information in periodic filings.

The final rules also modified the period used to determine the need to check the box for trading surrounding the announcement of a repurchase program from 10 business days to four business days."
Cooley,SEC Final Share Repurchase Disclosure Rules Less Burdensome Than Expected,"The final rules also modified the period used to determine the need to check the box for trading surrounding the announcement of a repurchase program from 10 business days to four business days.

Companies should review and update internal controls as they relate to share repurchases .Although

companies should already have disclosure controls and procedures in place regarding share repurchases, these controls and procedures will likely require updating to reflect the changes in the final rules from aggregating the repurchase data on a monthly basis to aggregating on a daily basis.

In addition, in order to determine whether to check the box relating to trading surrounding the announcement of a repurchase program, companies will need to establish controls to ensure that Section 16 filings are reviewed on a timely basis  or, for FPIs, that written representations from senior management and directors are timely received.

Furthermore, recent SEC enforcement actions have applied the internal control provisions of the Exchange Act expansively to include policies and procedures concerning the handling of material nonpublic information.

This trend  combined with the fact that daily repurchase information will now be readily available to scrutinize the timing of a companys repurchases  makes it even more critical that companies have internal controls and processes in place that are reasonably designed to ascertain whether the company may be in possession of material nonpublic information at the time of any share repurchase.

FPIs hit with quarterly disclosure requirement .

Although the final rules were better than expected for domestic filers, they present a dramatic change to the reporting requirements for FPIs.

Until now, the long-standing approach of the SEC was to generally defer to an FPIs home country requirements, requiring only the annual filing of a Form 20-F and Form 6-K under specified circumstances.

With the adoption of the disclosure requirement for daily repurchase data on Form F-SR, FPIs will now be subject to regular quarterly reporting that will require careful preparation and additional ongoing work.

In addition, to the extent that FPIs are subject to home country disclosure rules regarding share repurchases, they might now also be subject to multiple, differing or even conflicting disclosure regimes.

Board approvals of share repurchase programs should contemplate the final rules .

Given the expanded disclosure requirements regarding an companys rationale for each repurchase plan or program, and the process or criteria used to determine the amount of repurchases, the board of directors should consider these issues and think about documenting such consideration in the resolutions or minutes when approving a share repurchase program.

In addition, management responsible for a companys SEC disclosures should review the resolutions and/or minutes from the applicable board meeting when crafting the required disclosure to ensure it is accurate and supported by the companys records.

Cooley,International Arbitration Versus Litigation,"While companies  particularly emerging companies  may have limited capacity to address dispute resolution, such terms can be essential in their agreements should a dispute later emerge.  

As no one size fits all, either arbitration or litigation may be appropriate based on several factors, including the type of commercial agreement (and potential disputes), confidentiality concerns or desire for more (or less) discovery.

When the agreement is cross-border, arbitration is likely to be superior to litigation, because enforcing US court judgments abroad can take longer and be more difficult  and also because litigating in a foreign court may involve unfamiliar law and procedures, a foreign language and an unknown judiciary.

On the other hand, litigation may be preferable in the cross-border context for simple disputes (like a nonpayment or collection action), especially if there are assets in the forum jurisdiction or the jurisdiction is in a state that is a party to a multilateral treaty for the enforcement of foreign court judgments (as is the case in the European Union).  

Agreeing to litigation also may be a leverage point to agree to a familiar, favorable and trusted foreign court for resolution.

For either cross-border or domestic agreements, one key benefit of arbitration is that while the various arbitral institutions rules provide default procedures, the parties have flexibility to tailor the dispute resolution process to suit their needs and preferences, as well as the context and needs of the most likely disputes.

For example, if speed is a critical component, the parties can agree to expedited procedures, limited discovery and a sole arbitrator, along with providing a specific timeline to the award.

If confidentiality is important, the parties can agree to keep the existence and contents of the arbitration confidential.

If the dispute is complicated or technical, the parties can include a requirement that the arbitrators have particular technical qualifications or experience.

Taking the time to consider dispute resolution and draft appropriate dispute resolution clauses in agreements can allow parties to optimize the dispute resolution process and avoid time-consuming and costly procedures down the road if there is a breakdown in the parties relationship that cannot be amicably resolved.

The primary pros and cons of arbitration and litigation are summarized below.

Arbitration Enforcement More than 160 countries are parties to the New York Convention, a treaty for the mutual recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.

Reduces risks of national courts Local bias (real or perceived).

Unfamiliar and possibly more limited local court procedures.

Different bodies of law.

Language.

Speed of process (too fast or slow).

Possible due process concerns.

Questions regarding the reliability and sophistication of the system and judges, including lack of familiarity with deal structure and terms.

Privacy and confidentiality Keeps disputes out of the press and public eye.

Can protect brand and reputation.

May help minimize copycat suits.

May help preserve long-term relationships.

More strict confidentiality depending on arbitral rules, where the arbitration is seated and how the clause is drafted.

Finality No error correction or appeal.

Usually limited judicial review, with set aside (or vacatur) of the arbitral award on narrow (i.e., non-merits-based) grounds.

Eliminates risk of protracted appellate process (also a potential downside for the losing party).

May be a leverage point for settlement.

Selection of decision-makers Ability of the parties to choose arbitrators through party nomination or a rank and strike process.

Require specific arbitrator qualifications or background best-suited for the dispute.

May be particularly important in complicated technical disputes where industry or technical experience would be an asset."
Cooley,International Arbitration Versus Litigation,"May be particularly important in complicated technical disputes where industry or technical experience would be an asset.

Limited document disclosure Generally less discovery, which can impact costs and speed, especially in international arbitration.

However, less discovery can make it more difficult to obtain evidence to substantiate a claim.

If there is a desire for more expanded discovery (can be a leverage point), the parties can provide for it in the dispute resolution clause.

Speed Can be faster.

Possibility of expedited rules and agreed-upon time limits in clause.

Consider sole arbitrator.

Less protracted appellate process.

Litigation Enforcement There is no analog to the New York Convention for the enforcement of US court judgments.

While some countries are parties to treaties for the recognition and enforcement of court judgments on a more limited scale, the US is not, which means enforcement of a US court judgment abroad depends on local process (which can be onerous and highly discretionary).

National courts may be preferable (or required) for certain disputes May be beneficial (and faster) for simple disputes (e.g., nonpayment).

May be preferable to have formal rules, procedures and protections  including procedures for summary disposition or early resolution of disputes (e.g., motion to dismiss, dispositive motions)  as litigation has more procedural discipline.
        

o	However, stricter rules come with less flexibility.

Agreeing to national courts may be a negotiation point that allows for a preferred forum (a national forum you trust) where the judgment will be enforceable (e.g., assets readily available in forum).

Not all disputes are arbitrable in all jurisdictions.

Confidentiality Resolution of disputes and decisions may be more public and carry higher possibility of press coverage.

More public nature can be a lever to settle of disputes.
        	

Appellate protections
        o	Ability to appeal/error correction.

May be preferable for large bet-the-company type disputes or disputes concerning intellectual property or trademark where the right of an appeal may be important.

Decision-maker assigned Beholden to random selection by court system.

More extensive discovery possible Broad discovery is often a key component of litigation in many (mainly common law) legal systems.

Due to the enforcement power of judges, easier to obtain discovery from third parties and add third parties to case.

Speed May be faster for simple disputes.

Greater ability to resolve disputes earlier in the case  particularly frivolous disputes or disputes with strong defenses on the merits  through summary disposition (e.g., motion to dismiss, summary judgment)."
Cooley,Considerations in Offshore Software Development,"Software companies often consider whether moving their software development efforts offshore to a third party is a good decision for their business.

Over the past few years, the practice of engaging offshore development companies to provide key development and support functions has been on the rise.

Offshore development involves the engagement of a third-party entity in a country outside the US on an independent contractor basis for the purposes of providing certain software development and related business or operational functions.

For example, you may be interested in hiring a development firm in Turkey to develop a custom software solution or leveraging a firm in India to provide support services during your nonbusiness hours.

These types of arrangements offer many benefits but can also present material risks.

This post is intended to provide a high-level overview of some of those benefits and risks  and provide you with key considerations as you evaluate whether offshoring software development makes sense for your business.

What are some of the benefits of offshore software development?

Cost Outsourcing work offshore is typically much less expensive than outsourcing to US businesses (or doing it in house).

Outsourcing certain functions offshore can result in significant operational cost savings when compared to hiring in-house employees.

Not only could you potentially save on salary and benefit-related costs, but also you might save on talent recruiting expenses, relocation fees, overhead (such as office space), and onboarding and training.

Skill Many offshore development firms employ talented, well-trained and highly skilled programmers and other workers.

Engaging such a firm often provides you with access to an experienced team of individuals with a broad range of skill sets, so that it can serve as a one-stop shop for your outsourcing needs.

It can be a great way to supplement your in-house talent.

Flexibility Offshore development firms are located all over the world, and many have offices in multiple locations.

Having support from teams in different time zones allows your company to ensure that you have coverage for your IT needs outside of your normal business hours.

Engaging a firm in Asia to provide customer support, for example, allows you to expand your customer base outside the US and offer support terms that are practical for your customers business needs.

You also typically have greater flexibility to increase or decrease the size of your team without the associated costs and headaches of doing the same thing with your own employees.

What are some of the risks of offshore software development?

Application of multiple legal frameworks When engaging with an international firm, the intellectual property (IP) laws of multiple countries may govern.

Other countries may have different legal requirements with respect to the protection and enforcement of IP.

Further, in the event of an infringement abroad, you may be stuck trying to enforce your rights in the country where the infringement occurred, which requires significant time and effort (and without a clear understanding of the outcome or how such country enforces its laws).

Limited oversight While offshore development firms provide you with access to a broad range of resources, those resources sometimes do not include a team that is specifically dedicated to your companys needs.

You may need to be flexible in terms of timing or availability of personnel, as many firms juggle multiple competing customer demands.

Further, with the services performed halfway across the world or in different time zones, you have a more limited opportunity to provide oversight over such services than if you are working with an in-house team.

Data issues Many functions you may consider outsourcing offshore likely involve the sharing of personal information or confidential or sensitive business information."
Cooley,Considerations in Offshore Software Development,"Data issues Many functions you may consider outsourcing offshore likely involve the sharing of personal information or confidential or sensitive business information.

Disclosing such information to a third party comes with the risk that the information is mishandled or will be subject to a security breach.  

Further, the offshore development firms access to or processing of certain information may implicate privacy laws, rules and regulations inside and outside the US.

Commitment The commitment of an outsourced team is almost never the same as that of your own employees.

This can manifest in a variety of different ways, including a higher turnover rate for the outsourced team compared to the internal team.

What are some key contractual considerations for engaging with offshore development firms?

IP ownership Owning any developed IP is key in any outsourcing relationship.

As such, it is important to consider and understand the legal framework within the country or countries in which the outsourced tasks will be performed  as it pertains to the protection, enforcement and transfer of IP ownership, as well as how those laws might affect your ability to protect and enforce your IP rights within the US.

Merely selecting US governing law and forum within your contract with the outsourcing firm does not necessarily obviate the need to consider and apply the laws of other applicable jurisdictions.

You also will want to contractually ensure that the deliverables are not entangled with third-party IP, either through open-source contamination or use of other third-party IP.

Confidentiality/data security Think about the types of information or IP you plan to share with the outsourcing firm.

If you are sharing confidential or sensitive IP or information (including any customer data or source code), make sure you are comfortable with the physical, technical and administrative safeguards of the outsourcing firm.

Your commercial agreement with such firm should address these safeguards, restrictions on use and liability arising from security breaches and other misuse or mishandling of information.

If any agreements entered into with your customers include data security and privacy requirements that apply to your subcontractors, those requirements need to flow down in your agreements with the offshore development firm.

Finally, it is important to understand what laws, rules and regulations apply to such firms access to and processing of the information you share  and compliance with those requirements should be addressed in the agreement between your business and the offshore development firm.

Clear objectives Make sure the statement of work or underlying agreement clearly states the parties objectives, including, as applicable, with respect to milestones, timelines, fees, acceptance and rejection procedures, and specifications, among other considerations.

Because you will have limited oversight, it is important to build in contractual rights to ensure that a project or specific set of services will be performed in accordance with your expectations.

The more detail, the better.

Flexibility Make sure you can increase or decrease the size of the team in a way that makes sense.  

Without a contractual right to make these sorts of changes, you lose some of the benefits of offshoring development in the first place.


Of course, there are other important legal considerations in drafting and negotiating an offshore development contract.

Having a solid contract is a key factor in being able to reap the benefits of offshore development."
Cooley,New York Issues Updated Sexual Harassment Prevention Materials,"On April 11, 2023, the New York State Department of Labor finalized updates to the states sexual harassment prevention materials These updated materials include a revised model sexual harassment prevention policy, complaint form and training materials.

Since 2018 , New York employers have been required to either adopt the states model sexual harassment policy or maintain a policy that meets or exceeds the standards set forth in the states model policy.

New York employers also are required to conduct annual sexual harassment prevention training for employees.

We discuss notable changes to these materials below.

Model sexual harassment policy Emphasis on gender diversity and identity  

The model policy now makes clear that sexual harassment includes all forms of gender discrimination, including gender role stereotyping and failing to respect an individuals gender identity.

The policy also includes definitions of cisgender, transgender and nonbinary persons to provide clarity for employers addressing gender discrimination issues.

Addressing the remote workforce  

The model policy addresses issues related to post-pandemic hybrid workplaces, including by explaining that an employers sexual harassment prevention policy must be provided to all employees in person or digitally through email upon hiring, and that for offices operating remotely, the policy also should be made available on the employers shared network.

New legal standard  The model policy revises the standard for harassment to clarify that conduct does not need to be severe or pervasive to be illegal, though it also must rise above petty slights or trivial inconveniences.

This change aligns with the 2019 removal of the severe or pervasive standard in the New York State Human Rights Law.

Additional examples of sexual harassment  The model policy contains several new examples of sexual harassment, making clear that such examples are not exhaustive.

These new examples reflect different work contexts, such as issues related to a remote workforce.

They also mirror the states new emphasis on gender diversity and identity.

For example, remarks regarding an employees gender expression or intentionally misusing a persons preferred pronouns are cited as examples of harassment.

Expanded retaliation section  

The model policy expands its retaliation section to include several new examples of retaliation, such as disparaging someone on social media, publicly releasing personnel files, labeling someone as difficult, refusing to provide a reference or undermining an individuals immigration status.

Emphasis on supervisory responsibilities  In addition to emphasizing that managers and supervisors cannot be passive and must act if they observe harassing behavior, the model policy also now cautions them to be mindful of the impact an investigation may have on victims.

New section on bystander intervention  A new section on bystander intervention now specifically addresses the responsibilities of bystanders who witness harassing behavior.

Reference to the Division of Human Rights (DHR) sexual harassment hotline  

In addition to listing other resources for filing a harassment complaint, the model policy now includes information regarding the DHRs sexual harassment hotline, which was introduced in July 2022.

The model policy explains that individuals can call this hotline for attorney referrals and more information about filing a complaint.

Training and other materials The states training materials and other resources also have been updated to comport with the notable changes to the model policy outlined above.

For example, as in the model policy, the training script and slide deck reiterate that sexual harassment includes all forms of gender discrimination  including gender role stereotyping  and also contain new content on gender identity and bystander intervention."
Cooley,New York Issues Updated Sexual Harassment Prevention Materials,"Next steps New York employers should review the states new sexual harassment materials and ensure that their sexual harassment policies, procedures and training materials are compliant with the latest guidance.

For additional resources, on May 3, 2023, Cooleys employment team issued an alert on 10 Actionable Compliance Steps for New York City Employers .

If you have questions about addressing any of these issues, please contact the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,Further Guidance Published on UK National Security and Investment Regime,"The UK government recently published its second edition of Market Guidance Notes on the National Security and Investment (NSI) regime, which includes new additions and amendments to the previously published guidance of 19 July 2022 (see the Cooley alert on the first edition of Market Guidance Notes ).

Like its predecessor, the guidance is based on the governments analysis of notifications received since the NSI regime came into force on 4 January 2022, as well as feedback from stakeholders.

It reflects the governments willingness to respond to criticism regarding its processes and provides further evidence of the governments desire to engage with parties.

In particular, the new guidance includes additional information on the stages of the NSI assessment process, when to notify and the steps that parties facing financial distress can take in notifying deals, as well as further practical guidance on the stages of the NSI process and completing the notification forms.

The updates are helpfully incorporated into the first edition guidance document, meaning that all of the information is usefully contained in one place.

Overall, the new guidance offers greater clarity regarding the operation of the NSI regime , which is to be welcomed.

Below we summarise the key updates.

Summary Transactions involving parties suffering material financial distress The initial review period for NSI notifications is 30 working days from acceptance of the notification as complete by the Investment Security Unit (ISU), the body responsible for administering the regime.

This can cause significant issues for parties facing financial distress, as notifiable transactions cannot be completed prior to ISU clearance, or they risk being declared void and/or the parties facing criminal or civil penalties.

The Market Guidance Notes provide guidance on the governments approach to parties facing material financial distress and the evidence that should be provided to the ISU.

In particular, parties subject to the regime who are facing financial distress should notify the ISU as soon as possible, especially where the statutory timelines of the regime could exacerbate financial problems.

While the government will consider what evidence of material financial distress is appropriate on a case-by-case basis, analyses by external legal, restructuring and insolvency advisers and auditors in relation to the position of the company will typically be considered.

The Market Guidance Notes further clarify that if the company in distress is part of a larger corporate group, the government also will consider the parent companys ability to provide continued financial support.

Parties also can provide evidence that funding options other than a sale or merger are not feasible or available.

In exceptional circumstances, where evidence of material financial distress gives rise to genuine urgency, it may be possible to expedite the process.

The guidance contains helpful direction regarding evidence of urgent financial distress.

Timing of a notification The new guidance also confirms that a deal does not have to be signed for the parties to submit a notification to the ISU, and that the regime provides some flexibility to the parties in this respect.

Generally, notifications should be made at the point at which the terms of the transaction are sufficiently stable to enable the government to assess whether it could lead to national security risks.

The government would generally consider it appropriate to notifywhen there is good faith intention to proceed  e.g., when there are agreed financing arrangements, agreed heads of terms or when a transaction has been considered at the board level or publicly announced."
Cooley,Further Guidance Published on UK National Security and Investment Regime,"However, the same guidance stresses that if a transaction is notified too early and the terms of the transaction subsequently change after it has been reviewed, this could count as a separate 'trigger event' (i.e., a separate transaction within scope of the regime), which may not be covered by the previously obtained clearance.

Parties can update the ISU on nonmaterial changes to their planned arrangements and ask if a new notification is needed; however, responses to such requests may take time and parties are reminded to factor in sufficient time in their commercial timeline in case another notification is necessary.

To avoid complications, the Market Guidance Notes recommend that if parties decide to notify, the notification forms should state the progress of negotiations or commercial dealings.

Depending on the circumstances, the ISU may require confirmation that a counterparty to the the transaction (for example, the seller) has been engaged and agrees that the the transaction is in contemplation.

This may be particularly relevant where the arrangements appear to be fluid or where there are unusual circumstances surrounding the notification.

Uncertainty about whether a transaction is notifiable The Market Guidance Notes also confirm that the ISU will provide parties with guidance as to whether the targets activities fall into one or more of the 17 sensitive areas of the economy that require mandatory notification , where there is significant uncertainty.

In such circumstances, parties should include as much detail as possible (including the names of the parties and their activities), a clear explanation of the uncertainty and any timing considerations the government should be aware of.

The Market Guidance Notes further clarify that, while the government will endeavour to be as helpful as possible, there will be circumstances in which it may not be possible or appropriate for the government to give a substantive response.

In particular, the government is unlikely to comment on hypothetical scenarios as they may be misapplied to similar but substantially different real scenarios.

Guidance on stages of NSI assessment process The updated Market Guidance Notes provide further helpful explanation on the various aspects of the NSI assessment process, including the use of interim orders, the process of issuing final orders and withdrawing applications.

Interestingly, the Market Guidance Notes provide for the first time insights into the ISUs engagement with third parties and clarify that this is done both through information requests and attendance notices (i.e., meeting requests).

The guidance provides that parties and third parties may be asked to attend meetings either in person or virtually as part of the transaction review.

Where the transaction has been called-in for an in-depth assessment, both information requests and attendance notices stop the clock, even when issued to third parties  with the timeline only restarting when the government is satisfied that the information provided has appropriately answered the questions posed.

The Market Guidance Notes also provide further details on when the ISU will engage and seek representations from the parties directly, including when the government is considering imposing a final order and when the government is considering imposing remedies.

Parties may proactively approach the government about potential remedies, if they believe that a remedy may mitigate any potential national security concerns.

Guidance for completing a notification form Finally, the Market Guidance Notes provide additional guidance on completing the notification form to ensure that a transaction is assessed without delay.

One key clarification concerns the submission of sensitive information in a notification."
Cooley,Further Guidance Published on UK National Security and Investment Regime,"One key clarification concerns the submission of sensitive information in a notification.

The guidance sets out that parties intending to submit information that is classified above the UK OFFICIAL category should contact the ISU directly for advice on secure submission, rather than using the notification forms.

Outlook

This is the second set of additional updates to the notes published since the NSI regime came into force on 4 January 2022.

The additional guidance provides valuable updates that offer businesses greater clarity, understanding and assurance regarding the UK government's approach to NSI notifications and the functioning of the NSI regime.

Further insight can be expected when the government publishes the 2023 Annual Report, due in the coming months.

Cooley,10 Actionable Compliance Steps for New York City Employers,"New York City employers face the constant challenge of managing their workforces while also complying with ever-evolving legal requirements.

Below we have listed 10 actionable steps that New York City private-sector employers should take to promote compliance and avoid common pitfalls.

1. Ensure pay transparency in job postings Several jurisdictions, including New York State and New York City (as discussed in this April 2022 client alert on New York Citys pay transparency law ), require certain information in internal and external job postings to comply with pay transparency laws.

Employers should review their job postings  including those on third-party websites  to confirm their postings, among other things, contain a good faith pay range for the position.

2. Ensure Fair Chance Act compliance Under New York Citys Fair Chance Act and its implementing guidance, employers requiring a background check must ensure that the background check is the very last step of the pre-onboarding hiring process.

Indeed, a conditional offer of employment should precede the background check.

Additionally, New York employers should ensure that their job postings and websites do not reference background check requirements at all (unless mandated by law).

3. Audit employee onboarding documentation practices There are numerous notices covering a range of topics that must be provided to new hires based in New York City.

For example, all New York employees must receive a wage notice describing, among other things, their pay rate and the employers payroll practices.

In addition, all New York employers must provide new hires with a copy of their anti-harassment policy, and employers that engage in electronic monitoring must give notice to all new hires (as discussed in this November 2021 client alert on employee monitoring in New York ).

Employers should audit their onboarding practices to determine whether new hires are receiving all required notices and information.

4. Review practices regarding separation and settlement agreements As discussed in this February 2023 client alert , all employers should be mindful of the recent National Labor Relations Board ruling regarding certain provisions in separation agreements, including nondisparagement and confidentiality provisions.

Given preexisting limitations under the states anti-harassment laws and regulations, this decision can further complicate the process for New York employers to include a confidentiality provision in a settlement agreement with an employee who has raised a claim of discrimination or harassment.

In order to mitigate any future issues, employers should ensure that the separation agreements they proffer to departing employees are legally compliant and enforceable.

5. Review parental leave policies All New York employers must promulgate a policy addressing rights and processes under the New York State Paid Family Leave Act .

For employers offering additional parental leave, it is important to review parental leave policies and confirm that, if desired, all statutory and company-offered leaves are taken concurrently.

6. Conduct annual anti-harassment training All New York City employers are required to conduct annual anti-harassment training for employees and certain independent contractors.

Employers should ensure all employees take a legally compliant training.

7. Update anti-harassment policy New York State recently revised its model anti-harassment policy .

Employers should review their written anti-harassment policies and procedures to confirm they meet all legal requirements and reflect the employers actual practices.

8. Prepare for Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT) law compliance Enforcement of New York Citys AEDT law is set to begin on July 5, 2023, following the citys publication of its final implementation rule."
Cooley,10 Actionable Compliance Steps for New York City Employers,"Employers who use artificial intelligence- and algorithm-based technologies for recruiting, hiring or promotion should begin preparing for compliance  including by undergoing a compliant bias audit and providing certain notices to job candidates or employees.

9. Ensure compliance with sick leave laws New York State and New York City each require most employers to provide paid time off for sick leave.

Employers also are required to document each employees use and accrual of sick leave.

Even employers using a flexible or nonaccrual paid time off model should determine whether they have adequate tracking procedures in place.

10. Review incentive-based compensation plans Employers that offer bonuses, commissions or other forms of incentive-based compensation should review their plans to ensure they clearly define the scope of the eligible incentive compensation and specifically how it is earned.

Employers should avoid conflating a description of when incentive compensation is paid with when it is earned .

Cooley,"UK Government Gets Tough on Sanctions Evasion, Fraud and Money Laundering in Newly Published Economic Crime Plan","On 30 March 2023, HM Treasury and the Home Office published the Economic Crime Plan 2 for 2023 to 2026.

The three-year plan builds on the first Economic Crime Plan published in 2019 and commits the UK government to: Combatting kleptocracy and driving down sanctions evasion.

Cutting fraud.

Reducing money laundering and recovering more criminal assets.

To address these commitments, the plan includes several ambitious reforms, mainly focused on heightened criminal enforcement.

We have summarised the key takeaways below Sanctions evasion The plan acknowledges the importance of sanctions in encouraging Russia to cease its activities in Ukraine  and, more generally, to combat state threats, terrorism, cyberattacks and other issues.

As such, the plan evinces the UK governments will to make sanctions enforcement a priority for the coming years.

The plan outlines specific actions to combat sanctions evasion and high-end money laundering linked to kleptocracy: Improve design, implementation and enforcement of financial sanctions.

The plan aims to improve engagement and information-sharing of suspected cases of sanctions violations between supervisory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), professional body supervisors and the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).

The government also will enhance OFSIs methods of engagement with the public, the private sector and supervisory bodies.

OFSI is further tasked with reviewing and expanding its enforcement guidance, licencing framework and future legislative needs.

The plan aims to improve cooperation and collaboration with the US, European Union and other jurisdictions to share information on how the implementation and enforcement of sanctions can be improved.

The government commits to delivering a published assessment of sectoral threats and identifying vulnerabilities relating to financial sanctions.

Strengthen the operational and international response to kleptocracy.

Kleptocracy is a term used to describe a society or system under which high-level political power is abused by a network of ruling elites to steal their countrys resources and public funds for their own private gain.

The plan seeks to expand the capacity of the existing Combatting Kleptocracy Cell (CKC) to target corrupt elites and kleptocrats.

The CKC, established in February 2022, is a unit within the National Crime Agency (NCA) that investigates criminal sanctions evasion and high-end money laundering.

The plan also aims to strengthen international cooperation to tackle enablers of kleptocracy by working in partnership with agencies around the world to target specific individuals and assets.

Fraud

The plan notes that fraud accounted for an estimated 41% of all crime experienced by adults in England and Wales in the year ending September 2022.

It, therefore, underlines the importance of tackling fraud and points to the forthcoming Fraud Strategy.

Specifically, the government aims to: Modernise the response and reduce the impact of fraud against the public sector.

The plan highlights the new Public Sector Fraud Authority (PSFA) launched in August 2022.

It tasks the PSFA with ensuring that ministerial departments and public bodies understand and take action on fraud against the public sector.

The plan also launches a new Counter Fraud Profession under which the PSFA will develop standards, deliver technical updates, training and apprenticeships, and continuously assess members.

The PSFA also will work with partners internationally to share and develop leading practices, standards and guidance in combatting fraud against the public sector.

Implement wider economic crime reforms and infrastructure that will have an impact on tackling fraud.

The plan notes that the actions set out in its other sections will support the governments wider efforts to tackle fraud."
Cooley,"UK Government Gets Tough on Sanctions Evasion, Fraud and Money Laundering in Newly Published Economic Crime Plan","The plan notes that the actions set out in its other sections will support the governments wider efforts to tackle fraud.

For example, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill was introduced last year as part of the governments overarching strategy to combat economic crime and encourage corporate transparency.

There is a significant proposal within the draft legislation that, if adopted, would introduce a new offence of failure to prevent fraud.

The aim is to hold organisations to account if they profit from fraud committed by their employees.

For a deeper dive into this potentially game-changing proposal, see our overview and commentary, Failing to Prepare is Preparing to Fail .

Money laundering The plan sets out several targets for the UK government to achieve a reduction in money laundering: Limit the abuse of corporate structures.

Under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, Companies House will be empowered to verify the identities of those behind new and existing companies and use enhanced intelligence capabilities to check information that has been filed.

Combat criminal abuse of crypto-assets.

The plan sets out targets to increase law enforcement capacity to pursue and prosecute the abuse of crypto-assets.

A key initiative includes establishment of a multiagency Crypto Cell.

Improve intelligence, feedback and analysis through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) Reform Programme.

A suspicious activity report is a disclosure made by a regulated person to the NCA about known or suspected money laundering or terrorist financing.

The SARs Reform Programme aims to address variations in reporting and under-reporting, increase the use of SARs by law enforcement, modernise the technology used for SARs reporting and analysis, and increase the capacity of the UK Financial Intelligence Unit.

Recover more criminal assets.

The plan aims to build on the 61% increase in asset recoveries from last year, which was achieved because of the Asset Recovery Action Plan.

It establishes a new Anti-Money Laundering and Asset Recovery (AMAR) Programme to build capacity across the system to increase intelligence, enhance investigative capability and deliver improved technology.

Conclusion The plan sets out an ambitious package of goals  and methods to achieve them  in the fight against economic crime.

Building on the use of public-private partnerships that were particularly pivotal to progress in the first Economic Crime Plan (2019  2022), the plan focusses directly on impact and outcomes of measures.

It marks a significant shift in bringing sanctions enforcement into the mainstream of economic crime enforcement, while also evidencing the heightened risks resulting from the wider geopolitical environment and evolving national security threats.

Businesses should look to strengthen their due diligence and anti-money laundering processes to deal with sanctions and money laundering risks  and to avoid the risk of enforcement action.

If failure to prevent fraud is introduced, which appears likely, we envisage a further step change in the UKs compliance landscape.

Businesses also should consider setting up or strengthening systems of information-gathering and retention regarding economic crime to comply with new information-sharing initiatives.

Cooley,CFPB Flags Risks Associated With Reinitiating Collections on Aged Mortgage Loans,"On April 26, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued an advisory opinion warning collection agencies and mortgage servicers against suing or threatening to sue to recover time-barred debt.

The advisory opinion clarifies that a covered entity that brings  or threatens to bring  a state court foreclosure action to collect on a time-barred mortgage may violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and Regulation F. The CFPB also clarified that collecting on time-barred debt is prohibited, even if the entity does not know the debt is time-barred.

Zombie mortgages At a field hearing in Brooklyn, New York, announcing the advisory opinion , CFPB Director Rohit Chopra indicated an increase in consumer complaints related to attempts to collect on mortgage debt that consumers believed was already discharged, modified or forgiven.

Chopras comments and the advisory opinion both focus on second-lien home loans made prior to the 2008 financial crisis.

During the hearing, Chopra indicated that many borrowers who previously obtained a piggyback loan  a second-lien mortgage that satisfied down payment requirements  had obtained a workout to resume payment on the first lien, while the second lien remained delinquent.

Chopra suggested that lenders holding the second-lien loans were unlikely to recover any value if they attempted to foreclose on the home (being behind the full mortgage in seniority), and they thus offloaded these piggyback loans from their books.

The CFPB asserts that consumers often received no notice regarding the sale of their loan and could go years without receiving periodic statements.

After 15 years of price appreciation, however, the CFPB reports increasing numbers of collection agencies are now attempting to collect on this long-dormant debt.

Time-barred debt The CFPB is concerned that some entities may be threatening to foreclose on properties whose mortgages have become time-barred (i.e., those for which the states applicable statute of limitations would preclude judicial foreclosure actions).

The advisory opinion affirms: The FDCPA and its implementing Regulation F prohibit a debt collector (as defined by state law) from suing or threatening to sue to collect a time-barred debt.

This prohibition applies even if the debt collector neither knows nor should know that the debt is time-barred.

The CFPB also reiterated that Regulation Fs prohibition on suits, and threats of suit, on time-barred debt is subject to a strict liability standard, meaning debt collectors would be held liable for violations even if they neither knew nor should have known that a debt was time-barred.

Whats next

This is yet another space where it is important to understand your consumers and the rules of the road.

The CFPBs field hearing and accompanying advisory opinion suggest it is closely analyzing consumer complaints and may pay particular attention to institutional processes for verifying that these outstanding second-lien loans remain collectible.

At the same time, states and plaintiffs attorneys also are likely to be reviewing these issues, and companies should understand what  if any  applicable state law limitations may apply to their processes.

Companies should understand their risk and exposure, taking proper steps to mitigate that risk as appropriate."
Cooley,"Q1 2023 Venture Financing Report – Pre-Money Valuations Trend Up While Deal Volume, Invested Capital and Up Rounds Continue Decline","Cooley handled 192 reported venture capital financings for Q1 2023, representing $4.7billion of invested capital.

Both deal count and invested capital have been declining since Q4 2021, when we saw a record high deal count of 428 reported VC financings, and Q1 2022, when we saw a record high amount of invested capital at $24.3billion.

This continued decline in deal count and invested capital is consistent with trends seen in the broader market and represents the lowest deal count and invested capital we have seen since Q1 2017.

While we have witnessed downward trends in deal counts and amounts raised over the last year across all stages of financing, the decline in Q1 2023 is most significant in Series C and later deals.

Looking back to near-record highs for deal count and amounts invested for Series D and later in Q4 2021, the number of deals has dropped by 90%, and the amount invested has dropped by 97%.

For earlier rounds, the decline in deal count is not quite as steep.

Since Q1 2022, the number of Series Seed deals reported is down by 32%.

For Series A, the number is down by 56%, and for Series B, the number is down by 44%.

However, the decline in invested capital has been more significant  with invested capital down by 71% for Series Seed deals, by 76% for Series A deals and by 84% for Series B deals.

Median pre-money valuations have not declined at such a steep rate.

The valuations for Series Seed deals generally remain high, consistent with levels seen since mid-2021.

Series A valuations are down since late 2021 but are generally still higher than pre-pandemic levels, and Series B valuations are trending up again, aligning with valuations seen in late 2020 and early 2021.

Meanwhile, Series C valuations are now back in line with valuations seen in early 2022.

The median pre-money valuations for Series D and higher rounds in March 2023 also was up again, in line with valuations from early 2021.

The percentage of deals (at all stages) with a median pre-money valuation of $100million or more increased slightly to 25% of deals for March 2023  after dropping to below 20% of deals in January and February of this year  which is the first time it has dropped below this threshold since October 2019.

Overall, the percentage of up rounds continued to decline, representing just 73% of deals for Q1 2023, down from 79% in Q4 2022.

Down rounds represented 15% of deals, and flat rounds represented 12% of deals  the highest percentage of down rounds reported since Q2 2020 and the highest percentage of flat rounds noted in the history of this report.

Despite the continued decline in invested dollars, deal volume and up rounds, deal terms themselves in Q1 2023 continued to be generally favorable for companies.

During the quarter, 95% of reported deals had non-participating preferred stock.

The percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision remained low at 5.7% of reported deals.

However, it is rare that this number is above 5%, and this is the first time since Q3 2020 that it has exceeded the 5% mark.

The percentage of deals involving a recapitalization rose slightly in Q1 2023 to 1.04% of deals, as compared with just 0.35% of deals in Q4 2022.

In PitchBooks 2022 Annual Global League Tables , Cooley continued to hold the top spot in the US and globally for representation of companies in venture capital transactions and was ranked as the #2 law firm for all venture financing transactions.

Cooley also ranked as the most active law firm in various industry sectors for venture capital financings  including in pharma and biotech, energy, healthcare (services and systems), IT hardware and media.

Cooley,"Q1 2023 Venture Financing Report – Pre-Money Valuations Trend Up While Deal Volume, Invested Capital and Up Rounds Continue Decline","Cooley handled 108 reported financings of technology companies, representing more than $2.9billion of invested capital.

This represents the lowest deal volume for technology companies since Q1 2017, when Cooley handled 102 reported deals, and the lowest amount raised since Q1 2019, when Cooley handled 123 reported deals representing more than $2.8billion of invested capital.

As with all industries, the deal count and invested capital for technology company venture financings is down significantly since one year ago, when Cooley handled 257 reported venture financing deals for technology companies, representing more than $18.6billion of invested capital for Q1 2022.

Average reported deal size increased slightly during the quarter for venture financings of technology companies at more than $27.6million, compared to slightly more than $25million in Q4 2022  both down from more than $72million in Q1 2022.

Spotlight on life sciences In Q1 2023, Cooley handled 46 reported venture financings of life sciences companies, representing more than $993million of invested capital.

Both numbers are down from Q4 2022, when Cooley handled 58 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies, representing more than $1.2billion of invested capital.

Reported deal sizes for venture financings of life sciences companies also decreased slightly to an average deal size of more than $21.5million.

The numbers for venture financing deals for life sciences companies are significantly down compared to Q1 2022, when Cooley handled 70 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies, with invested capital of $2.2billion and an average deal size of more than $32million.

The percentage of life sciences venture financings structured in tranches remained high at 24% of reported deals.

Prior to Q4 2022, the last time that the percentage of reported life sciences venture financings structured in tranches exceeded 20% was in Q3 2020.

Cooley,"Regulating the Digital Sector, Transforming Consumer Protection Regulation – UK Government Proposes Significant Reforms With Draft Bill","Untitled Document We finally have sight of the long-awaited Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill .

Warning: It is a sizeable and ambitious piece of legislation, but the following is our summary take on the key competition and consumer issues.

The legislation is just at the start of its journey, so it is difficult to estimate how long it will be before it becomes law  and in what form  and, therefore, how long before its real impact is felt.

However, now is the time for businesses to evaluate potential impacts so they can be prepared as the legislation progresses.

Background After significant delays, the UK government has introduced draft legislation representing a major shift in digital, competition and consumer protection regulation.

The wide-ranging reforms contained in the bill will significantly strengthen the powers and remit of the UKs antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

The bill reflects the intention of the UK government for the CMA to have a much broader and more robust toolkit of competition, digital regulatory and consumer protection powers from which it can take forward enforcement action in digital markets and intervene to protect consumers.

The legislation would see consumer rights infringement afforded a much higher platform in terms of enforcement, more akin to how we see competition infringement dealt with.

Key competition and digital markets elements of the bill Large digital companies with UK activities subject to new digital markets regulatory framework The CMA will have the power to designate companies engaging in the provision of internet services and digital content in the UK as having strategic market status (SMS).

Only those companies designated as having SMS will be subject to the digital markets regime.

SMS designations will be determined by the CMA according to whether a company has substantial and entrenched market power, a position of strategic significance in the market and a turnover exceeding 25 billion globally or 1 billion in the UK.

The approach is similar to that adopted by the EU in the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

That is, the focus of the new regulatory regime is on large digital companies with strong market positions.

As such, many firms in the digital sector will face no new compliance obligations.

The regime will require the CMA to conduct a formal evaluation process to determine who should be designated as having SMS.

However, the tests and approach used to determine those companies with SMS differ from those of the EU.

Whilst there will be commonality between the two regimes, it is possible that there may be some differences between the companies subject to regulation in the UK and EU.

Each designated SMS firm subject to its own bespoke set of obligations focused on three core principles fair dealing, open choice, and trust and transparency There is no one-size-fits-all approach taken in the bill in respect of the obligations each designated SMS firm will be subject to (as is the case under the EUs DMA).

Rather, each company will be subject to requirements that are appropriate to its activities, position in the market and potential CMA concerns.

The UK government considers this provides more flexibility and will enhance the effectiveness of the regime.

For SMS firms, the CMA will have the power to select appropriate conduct requirements to achieve one or more of the following objectives: Fair dealing to ensure fair treatment of users and potential users.

Open choice to enable free and easy choices for users and potential users between the services and content offered by designated undertakings and those offered by other companies.

Trust and transparency to ensure those using or seeking to use services or content provided by designated companies have the information they need to inform their decision-making."
Cooley,"Regulating the Digital Sector, Transforming Consumer Protection Regulation – UK Government Proposes Significant Reforms With Draft Bill","Trust and transparency to ensure those using or seeking to use services or content provided by designated companies have the information they need to inform their decision-making.

Conduct requirements, which will be of relevance to all third parties who deal with SMS firms, will either oblige the SMS firm to take certain actions (for example, requirements to provide clear and accessible information to users) or to avoid certain actions and behaviours (for example, the prevention of discriminatory terms, conditions or policies).

SMS firms will be required to provide the CMA with compliance reports explaining how they are complying with the requirements.

There also will be obligations on each SMS firm to appoint compliance officers to take responsibility for complying with the conduct requirements.

Proposed reforms give CMA significantly expanded toolkit to use in digital markets The CMA also will have the power to make pro-competitive interventions in relation to SMS firms, designed to address any factors that the CMA identifies, after an investigation, as having an adverse effect on competition.

These powers are potentially wide-ranging and intrusive, including the power to order structural remedies and divestments against SMS firms.

The bill provides for the use of a final offer mechanism that will act as a backstop tool to enforce conduct requirements to offer fair and reasonable payment terms.

This will enable the CMA to require the SMS firm and an invited third party to submit what they consider to be fair payment terms for a proposed transaction, and the CMA will make a determination.

In addition, the CMA will have robust enforcement powers.

The CMA will be able to impose fines of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches of the conduct requirements, along with daily fines of up to 5% of global turnover for continued breaches.

But, more generally, the draft legislation will provide the CMA with a choice  whether to use its normal competition law powers or its digital regulatory powers when taking forward enforcement action in the digital space.

As such, we can expect to see greater regulatory activity.

CMA widening net of reviewable mergers, including in tech sector The bill proposes an additional merger control threshold allowing the CMA to review mergers where either party has at least a 33% share of supply or purchases of goods/services in the UK (or a substantial part of it), that party has more than 350 million of turnover in the UK, and a UK nexus test is met with respect to the other party.

The test is designed to close a gap in the current UK merger control regime and more easily enable the CMA to intervene in mergers where there may not be any clear competitive overlap between the parties, and/or where the target is particularly small but is being acquired by a purchaser with a sizeable market position.

The UK nexus requirement, however, suggests that the CMAs jurisdiction will not automatically extend to acquisitions of targets that have not yet commercialised any products  to the extent that the targets activities are fully conducted outside of the UK.

Whilst this change will apply to all sectors, a more sector-targeted proposal is the requirement for all SMS firms and their groups to report to the CMA all acquisitions worth at least 25 million, where such acquisitions involve passing an equity or voting gateway of 15%, 25% or 50% (including joint ventures), and the transaction has a UK nexus.

The SMS firm will not be able to close the transaction until the expiry of a five-day waiting period, which starts once the CMA has confirmed that the report provided is complete.

This change will give the CMA better knowledge of the investment activities of SMS firms, as well as providing it the opportunity to call-in and review investments and acquisitions using its existing powers, if desired."
Cooley,"Regulating the Digital Sector, Transforming Consumer Protection Regulation – UK Government Proposes Significant Reforms With Draft Bill","The requirement is similar to one included in the EUs DMA, pursuant to which gatekeepers must report all planned acquisitions to the European Commission before completion.

Key consumer rights elements of the bill UK consumers have an existing set of statutory rights to enforce consumer law, but research carried out by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (replaced now by the Department for Business and Trade) identified various weaknesses that needed to be remedied (see the Consumer Protection Study 2022 ).

The research suggested that consumers are losing out on 54.2 billion a year from unresolved disputes with traders, and that enforcement action is slow, lengthening the time it takes for consumers to receive redress.

There also is little to deter traders from breaching consumer protection law.

Unlike the other countries in the G7, the UK is the only country not to have civil penalties for common consumer protection breaches.

Bill introduces extensive new enforcement powers for breaches of consumer protection law, including aggressive fining powers The bill proposes to significantly strengthen the enforcement of consumer protection law by introducing new penalty powers for the civil courts, along with out-of-court powers for the CMA to determine and sanction breaches of certain consumer laws.

The bill will provide civil courts with new powers to impose civil monetary penalties for breaches of consumer protection law.

Authorities, such as the CMA and local authority trading standards, will be able to apply to the courts to impose penalties of up to 300,000, or 10% of the total value of a business global turnover, whichever is higher.

The bill introduces an administrative model for consumer protection law enforcement, allowing the CMA to determine if certain consumer laws have been breached and impose monetary penalties (up to 10% of the total value of a business global turnover), without having to go through the courts.

This will mirror the CMAs existing competition enforcement powers.

The CMA also will have additional investigative powers to gather evidence, impose higher penalties for failure to comply with investigative requirements (e.g. failing to comply with information notices or providing false or misleading information), and levy penalties based on business turnover for noncompliance with CMA orders, undertakings and accepted commitments.

The intention for these powers is to enable the CMA to act faster and take on more cases to safeguard the interests of consumers and create a level playing field for compliant businesses.

Bill introduces enhanced, expanded consumer rights The bill revokes the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading (CPUT) Regulations 2008 (which is the UKs implementation of the EUs Unfair Commercial Practices Directive).

That said, these regulations are not going anywhere, as the bill largely recreates the prohibitions of unfair commercial practices (e.g., misleading actions, omissions and aggressive practices) set out in the CPUT Regulations, with the same objective of preventing harm to the collective interests of consumers.

New measures are proposed to regulate consumer saving schemes and to protect consumers from inertia selling (the sending of unsolicited goods to potential customers in the hope of making a sale) and entering into subscription traps.

Consumer-related proposals will lead to increased enforcement, shift in compliance focus The CMAs broader investigative powers and ability to impose higher, turnover-based penalties for failure to comply with its information notices, orders, undertakings and commitments means that businesses should examine their processes to ensure they are robust enough to allow for a prompt response to CMA requests for information  and for the business to remain compliant with any undertakings, orders or commitments."
Cooley,"Regulating the Digital Sector, Transforming Consumer Protection Regulation – UK Government Proposes Significant Reforms With Draft Bill","Further, the CMAs administrative powers to determine breaches of consumer law and impose significant turnover-based fines without having to go to court will likely result in a significant increase in CMA consumer law enforcement.

Whilst the bill does provide for a merits-based appeal of the CMAs enforcement decisions, the explanatory notes to the bill suggest that a court should interfere only if it concludes that the decision is wrong in a material respect.

As a result, businesses should carefully review their consumer-facing communications and practices to ensure they are found compliant under the new regime.

Recently, the CMA has focused on online choice architecture, with the aim of tackling potentially harmful online selling practices to UK consumers.

On 29 March 2023, the CMA wrote an open letter to online businesses in the UK, setting out its compliance advice in relation to urgency and price reduction claims in digital retail spaces.

In view of the significant expansion of the CMAs enforcement powers, businesses should ensure that their online choice architecture and selling practices are compliant with the CMAs advice in this area.

Next steps The bill has begun the legislative process and, subject to the parliamentary timetable, is expected to come into force in spring 2024.

Cooley,"Startups, Other R&D-Heavy Companies May Face Significantly Higher Tax Costs in 2022","The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted more than five years ago, but certain changes under the legislation are only now coming into focus as taxpayers prepare their 2022 tax returns.

In particular, there are significant changes as to the deductibility of certain research and experimentation expenses, as well as the ability to utilize net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.

These changes may result in greater tax liabilities for companies and may also affect certain qualified small business stock eligibility requirements.

As discussed below , many expected new legislation would repeal or delay this capitalization requirement, but no such legislation has yet been passed.

Treatment of research and experimentation expenses Under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174, certain research and experimentation expenses, specifically including expenses incurred in connection with the development of software (R&E expenses), were fully deductible in tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2022.

However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, these R&E expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized over five years (or, in the case of R&E expenses incurred outside of the US, 15 years).

Under current rules, amortization of capitalized R&E expenses begins with the midpoint of the taxable year in which such expenses are paid or incurred.

Below is an illustration of how this works.

Assume a taxpayer incurs $5 million of domestic R&E expenses in 2022.

The taxpayer is only permitted to deduct $500,000 of those expenditures in 2022, $1million in each of 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, and the remaining $500,000 in 2027.

Under prior law, taxpayers often did not need to distinguish R&E expenses from other more general expense deductions, but it is now important to do so because of the capitalization requirement.

The statute does not clearly define what constitutes R&E expenses, but existing regulations provide that R&E expenses are expenditures incurred in connection with the taxpayer's trade or business which represent research and development costs in the experimental or laboratory sense, and would include all such costs incident to the development or improvement of a product, such as compensation expenses for service providers conducting research and experimentation, as well as costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer for research or experimentation carried out on the taxpayers behalf by another person or organization.

This change will impact companies in research-dependent industries, such as life sciences and software development, and is expected to increase the taxable income (or decrease the taxable loss) of companies that incur such R&E expenses.

The requirement to capitalize R&E expenses will be particularly relevant to companies that receive large lump sum payments under licensing and collaboration agreements or certain types of funding arrangements.

Further, the treatment of R&E expenses under IRC Section 174 could impact the application of other tax provisions  including the research credit under IRC Section 41, the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income under IRC Section 250, global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and the foreign tax credit rules.

In addition, for companies whose stock is intended to constitute qualified small business stock (QSBS) under IRC Section 1202, the capitalization of R&E expenses may impact the $50 million aggregate gross asset value threshold, which generally is based on the issuers tax basis in its assets.

The IRC Section 1202 aggregate gross asset value of a company increases by the amount of cash received in a financing, but the increase could be quickly reduced under prior law if the financing proceeds were applied toward deductible expenses.

The requirement to capitalize R&E expenses prolongs the time period over which the expenses funded with such financing proceeds may be deducted, keeping the aggregate gross assets higher during that period."
Cooley,"Startups, Other R&D-Heavy Companies May Face Significantly Higher Tax Costs in 2022","The change in law may, therefore, prevent stock issued in subsequent financings from qualifying as QSBS.

Treatment of NOL carryforwards generated after2017 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, corporate taxpayers may offset only 80% of net taxable income for the year, with NOL carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after 2017.

This is a change from the prior law, which potentially allowed up to 100% of such income to be offset with available NOL carryforwards.

This limitation on corporations ability to use certain NOL carryforwards, when combined with the requirement to capitalize R&E expenses, may cause corporations that historically operated at a loss to become cash taxpayers even if they have NOLs (including NOL carryforwards) that exceed taxable income in an applicable tax year.

Below are two basic examples of how the rules discussed above might impact two different companies with similar income/expense/NOLs in each of 2017, 2021 and 2022 (i.e., before and after the rules discussed above were operative).

Example 1  Smaller corporation $6million of revenue, $5million of R&E expenses and $1 million of available NOL carryforwards Taxable income example (2017 versus 2021 versus 2022)

Tax year 2017 2021 2022 Income $6,000,000 $6,000,000 $6,000,000 R&E expense Deductible R&E expense Capitalized R&E expense $(5,000,000) $(5,000,000) $- $(5,000,000) $(5,000,000) $- $(5,000,000) $(500,000) $(4,500,000) Net taxable income before use of NOL carryforwards $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $5,500,000 Available NOL carryforwards (generated pre-2017) $(1,000,000) $- $- Available NOL carryforwards (generated post-2017) N/A $(1,000,000) $(1,000,000)

Net taxable income after use of NOL carryforwards $- $200,000 $4,500,000 US federal income tax cost* $- $(42,000) $(945,000) *

US federal corporate income tax rate for post-2017 tax years = 21% Example 2  Larger corporation $80 million of revenue, $75million of R&E expenses and $150 million of available NOL carryforwards Taxable income example (2017 versus 2021 versus 2022) Tax year 2017 2021 2022 Income $80,000,000 $80,000,000 $80,000,000 R&E expense Deductible R&E expense Capitalized R&E expense $(75,000,000) $(75,000,000) $- $(75,000,000) $(75,000,000) $- $(75,000,000) $(7,500,000) $(67,500,000) Net taxable income before use of NOL carryforwards $5,000,000 $5,000,000 $72,500,000 Available NOL carryforwards (generated pre-2017) $(150,000,000) $ - $ - Available NOL carryforwards (generated post-2017)

US federal corporate income tax rate for post-2017 tax years = 21% Possible congressional action

As companies grapple with potentially significant higher tax costs associated with the rules discussed above, a bipartisan group of US senators  led by Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana  introduced a bill last month that would, among other things, amend IRC Section 174.

Called the American Innovation and Jobs Act , the bill would repeal the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capitalization rule and double the tax credit for certain research and development expenditures.

The American Innovation and Jobs Act has significant industry backing (e.g., the National Association of Manufacturers and the Technology Councils of North America support its passage), but it remains unclear whether the proposed legislation will ultimately gain any traction in Congress.

Cooley,"CFPB, Federal Agencies Warn of Obligations to Avoid Algorithmic Discrimination","On April 24, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Justice (DOJ) and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) released a joint statement affirming that existing law  including those that prohibit discrimination, as well as unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP)  applies to the use of automated systems and innovative new technologies, including artificial intelligence.

Acknowledging the greater role of AI today and its potential benefits, such as increasing efficiencies and advancement in many arenas, the agencies suggest that AI may also perpetuate unlawful bias, automate unlawful discrimination, and produce other harmful outcomes.

The agencies reiterate[d]

[their] resolve to monitor the development and use of automated systems and promote responsible innovation and pledge[d] to vigorously use [their] collective authorities to protect individuals rights regardless of whether legal violations occur through traditional means or advanced technologies.

In his remarks on the joint statement , CFPB Director Rohit Chopra further noted that [c]ompanies must take responsibility for their use of these tools.

Potential for unlawful discrimination The joint statement identifies the following as three potential sources of discrimination in automated systems: Data and data sets : Automated system outcomes can be skewed by data that is unrepresentative or imbalanced, incorporates historical bias or has other errors.

Automated systems also can correlate data with protected classes, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes.

Model opacity and access : Internal workings of automated systems are not clear to many people, which makes it difficult for developers, businesses and persons to determine if an automated system is fair.

Design and use : Developers may fail to understand or account for the contexts in which private or public entities will use their automated systems and may design a system on the basis of flawed assumptions.

In the CFPBs announcement accompanying the joint statement, Chopra said the CFPB is particularly scrutinizing the use of AI in advertising, underwriting and home valuation.

Federal focus on AI bias  continued and heightened Each of the agencies has previously taken certain steps to demonstrate the import of ensuring AI is developed and used in a legally compliant manner that avoids discriminatory impact.

As noted in the joint statement, in its 2022 Report to Congress on AI , the FTC urged that AI systems be transparent, which includes the need for it to be explainable and contestable.

That report, like the joint statement, stressed the need for entities to be able to explain the reasoning of algorithms behind individual decisions, with a particular focus on guarding against risk.

In January 2023, the DOJ filed a statement of interest asserting that alleged bias in a tenant screening algorithm violated the Fair Housing Act.

Discussing the joint statement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke suggested the DOJ was ready to hold accountable those entities that fail to address the discriminatory outcomes, reinforcing the focus on bias resulting from model decisions.

Focusing on the broader lending space, the CFPB published a May 2022 circular confirming that federal consumer financial laws and adverse action requirements apply regardless of the technology being used.

Like the joint statement, the circular asserted that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B require creditors to provide statements of specific reasons to applicants against whom adverse action is taken, effectively prohibiting the use of black box algorithms in such situations.

The CFPB also will release a white paper this spring on the current chatbot market and the impact on consumers of its integration by financial institutions."
Cooley,"CFPB, Federal Agencies Warn of Obligations to Avoid Algorithmic Discrimination","The CFPB also will release a white paper this spring on the current chatbot market and the impact on consumers of its integration by financial institutions.

Commissioners at the FTC have previously taken an expansive interpretation of Section 5, asserting authority to target firms who use black box algorithms that result in bias.

In recent years, the FTC has required firms to destroy algorithms or other work product that it asserted were trained on data from improperly collected data sets.

The FTC previously warned that improper use of AI could violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the ECOA.

The White House also has weighed in on the risk of discrimination, noting in its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should take proactive and continuous measures to protect individuals and communities from algorithmic discrimination.

The White House further stated that protections should include ongoing disparity testing and mitigation and [i]ndependent evaluation, among other required consumer protection precautions.

The Government Accountability Office noted in its 2021 AI accountability framework that AI has the potential to amplify existing biases and concerns related to civil liberties, ethics, and social disparities, and that the US government and others were working to address such concerns.

Implications for financial services firms While the use of cutting-edge AI technology can result in demonstrable benefits  for businesses and consumers  the joint statement makes clear that financial institutions will need to understand the impacts of deploying AI throughout their operations.

Thus, financial institutions reliant on AI, or reliant on third-party providers of services dependent on AI, should undertake efforts to assess fair lending compliance risks at the point of implementation  and monitor those risks throughout product development and deployment."

Cooley,European Commission Publishes Proposals to Revise Current EU Pharmaceutical Legislative Framework,"Yesterday, the European Commission published two legislative proposals concerning the regulation of medicinal products in the European Union.

The proposals seek to consolidate existing legislation into two instruments, a revised and amplified version of Directive 2001/83, the Community code on medicinal products, and a revised and amplified version of Regulation 726/2004, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Regulation.

The proposals include a draft regulation laying down EU procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and creation of rules governing the EMA and a draft directive relating to medicinal products for human use.

The European Commission also proposed a Council Recommendation on antimicrobial resistance.

The proposals would introduce several changes to existing concepts regarding the regulation of medicinal products.

The intention of the European Commission is to achieve a balance between patient access to affordable medicinal products and the need to stimulate innovation.

In particular  and as anticipated  data and market exclusivity available to innovative medicinal products would change.

In addition, Regulation (EC)

No 141/2000 (the Orphan Regulation) and Regulation (EC)

No 1901/2006 (the Paediatric Regulation) would be repealed, and their provisions would be incorporated within the draft regulation.

Regulatory protection periods for innovative medicinal products As anticipated, the standard data and market exclusivity periods for which the current Community code provides will  if the proposals are adopted in their current form  be reduced.

The standard period for regulatory protection would be reduced from 10 years, including eight years of data protection and an additional two years of market exclusivity, to a total maximum period of eight years.

Basic data exclusivity would be reduced from eight to six years, with an additional two years of market exclusivity.

However, to encourage innovation, the proposals would render the data exclusivity period modulable.

Accordingly, marketing authorization holders would have the possibility to extend the basic data exclusivity in accordance with the following provisions: + 24 months of data exclusivity if the medicinal product is launched in all 27 EU member states covered by the marketing authorization.

There are, however, conditions related to this additional exclusivity, including the requirement that the product be launched within two years from the marketing authorization or within three years for small- and medium-sized enterprises, not-for-profit entities or companies with limited experience in the EU system.

+ 6 months of data exclusivity for products that address an unmet medical need.

+ 6 months of data exclusivity if comparative clinical trials are conducted.

+ 12 months of data exclusivity for an additional therapeutic indication.

In theory, the modulation of regulatory protection periods may permit marketing authorization holders to achieve a total of up to 12 years of regulatory protection in relation to their medicinal products.

As regards exclusivity related to launch of a product in all 27 EU member states: Given the role of pricing and reimbursement in any decision by marketing authorization holders concerning launch, and the fact that it is the competent authorities of the individual EU member states who have sole power to determine pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products within their territory, the possibility to not only achieve agreement with the competent authorities of all 27 EU member states concerning pricing and reimbursement status of a medicinal product, but also then launch the products on all 27 markets may be a challenge even for large and experienced marketing authorization holders."
Cooley,European Commission Publishes Proposals to Revise Current EU Pharmaceutical Legislative Framework,"Orphan medicinal products If adopted in their current form, the proposals would merge the regulation of orphan medicinal products into the general framework applicable to all medicinal products in the EU and introduce the following main changes: Flexible criteria for defining orphan conditions : The proposals would largely maintain the existing criteria for orphan designation based on the prevalence of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition exists within the EU in no more than five persons per 10,000.

However, the proposals recognize that the prevalence criterion may not necessarily be appropriate to the identification of rare diseases in all cases.

Consequently, the proposals envisage the possibility for the European Commission to supplement the criteria on which orphan designation is determined if this is scientifically justified and is based on a recommendation from the EMA.

EMA empowerment : The proposals suggest transferring responsibility for the adoption of decisions on orphan designation from the European Commission to the EMA for purposes of expediting and facilitating the procedure.

However, this would mean that the EMA would be provided with decision-making powers in relation to orphan designation.

Orphan designations would have an initial validity period of seven years, which may be extended by the EMA in certain circumstances.

Amended regulatory protection periods : The proposals provide that the basic market exclusivity period for orphan medicinal products would be nine years.

Market exclusivity would be extended to 10 years if the orphan medicinal product were to address a high unmet medical need.

Additional market exclusivity extensions could be granted, in certain circumstances, in accordance with the following provisions:

+ 12 months of market exclusivity if the medicinal product is launched in all EU member states.

+ 12 months of market exclusivity for each of the first two indications of orphan medicinal products, i.e., up to an additional two years total.

Market exclusivity would, however, be reduced to five years if the use of the active substance in the medicinal product is well established and the related application for market authorization were based on bibliographic data.

Orphan medicinal products would benefit from the same data protection periods as those established for innovative medicinal products.

This would include the potential extensions available in relation to innovative products, with the exception of the extension for additional therapeutic indications from which an orphan product would benefit only in relation to the extended market exclusivity period, if applicable.

Similarly to issues relating to the modulable data exclusivity periods detailed above, in theory, the modulable market exclusivity periods could permit orphan medicinal products to be subject to a total market exclusivity period of up to 13 years.

However, in practice, the chances of having an orphan medicinal product fulfill all the conditions above and benefiting from the maximum market exclusivity period are slim.

We would anticipate that most orphan medicinal products may face a reduced market exclusivity period of nine years compared to the 10 years available today.

However, the possibility to review the eligibility criteria for market exclusivity after six years would be removed.

Reduced marketing authorization assessment periods

It is also proposed that the period for assessment of applications for marketing authorisation be shortened.

The EMA would have 180 days to complete its assessment regarding a positive or negative opinion instead of the current 210 days.

The European Commission would then have 46 days instead of the current 67 to decide whether to grant a marketing authorization."
Cooley,European Commission Publishes Proposals to Revise Current EU Pharmaceutical Legislative Framework,"The European Commission would then have 46 days instead of the current 67 to decide whether to grant a marketing authorization.

Moreover, medicinal products of major interest from the point of view of public health and therapeutic innovation may be eligible for an accelerated assessment which would be conducted within 150 days.

The European Commission anticipates that the clock-stops that can currently result in an increase in the review period will be reduced as a result of the proposed strengthening of EMA scientific support to developers of medicinal products.

As this is expected to improve the quality of initial applications, a reduction in delays caused by clock-stops and expedited evaluations for marketing authorisation are anticipated.

Antimicrobial resistance measures Among the innovative provisions in the proposals are a series of measures to combat antimicrobial resistance and to encourage development of innovative antimicrobials.

This includes introduction of a transferable data exclusivity voucher available to those antimicrobial products that bring a significant clinical benefit with respect to antimicrobial resistance.

A developer of an antimicrobial that is provided a voucher can either use the voucher for one of its own products or sell it to another marketing authorisation holder.

A maximum of 10 vouchers will be granted over a period of 15 years.

Other topics The proposals also address several other matters, including: Restructuring of the EMA committees.

Increased transparency on the contribution of public funding to research and development costs.

Incentives for research and innovation, including for orphan and paediatric medicinal products.

New concepts of unmet medical need and high unmet medical need.

Enhancing scientific and regulatory support by strengthening the EMA Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme.

Changes to the regulatory regime for generics and biosimilars.

New obligations in relation to continuity of supply and prevention of shortages.

Rules on repurposing of medicinal products.

The possibility for EU member states to permit electronic product information instead of paper product information."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - April One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts final rules regarding share repurchase disclosures On May 3, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules to require enhanced disclosure about issuer share repurchases under the Exchange Act.

The final rules will require quarterly tabular disclosure of an issuers daily repurchase activity, instead of disclosure one business day after execution of a share repurchase, as was initially contemplated in the proposed rules.

This tabular disclosure must contain specified information about the repurchases broken out by day and will be provided in an exhibit to Forms 10-Q and 10-K for issuers filing on domestic forms, or in new Form F-SR for issuers filing on foreign private issuer (FPI) forms.

The final rules also: Require an issuer to disclose quarterly via a checkbox whether any of its Section 16 officers or directors  or senior management or directors for FPIs  purchased or sold shares that are the subject of an issuer share repurchase plan or program within four business days before or after the announcement of the plan or program, or announcement of an increase to an existing plan or program.

Revise Item 703 to eliminate the current requirement in Item 703 of Regulation S-K to disclose monthly repurchase data and require an issuer to disclose in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K: The objectives or rationales for its share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the amount of repurchases.

Any policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of the issuers securities by its officers and directors during a repurchase program, including any restrictions on those transactions.

Note: Corresponding narrative disclosure requirements also will be added to Item 16E of Form 20-F. Add new Item 408(d) to Regulation S-K to require quarterly disclosure in Forms 10-Q and 10-K of an issuers adoption, material modification or termination of Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements, as well as a description of the material terms of the trading arrangements.

Issuers filing on domestic forms will be required to comply with the amendments to Forms 10-Q and 10-K beginning with the first filing covering the full fiscal quarter beginning on or after October 1, 2023.

This means that the first report requiring compliance for calendar year-end companies will be the 2023 Form 10-K filed in 2024 , as it relates to repurchases made during the quarter ending December 31, 2023.

FPIs filing on FPI forms will be required to comply with the amendments in new Form F-SR beginning with the first filing covering the full fiscal quarter that begins on or after April 1, 2024.

This means that the first Form F-SR requiring compliance for calendar year-end companies will need to be filed beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

The amendments to the Form 20-F narrative disclosure will be required starting in the first Form 20-F filed after the FPIs first Form F-SR has been filed.

Survey highlights board cybersecurity oversight In March, The Wall Street Journal and the National Association of Corporate Directors published their findings from a survey of 472 public and private company directors regarding various aspects of board cybersecurity oversight.

Key highlights from the survey include: Only 30% of directors rated their boards ability to oversee a cyber crisis as advanced or expert, despite more than three-quarters (76%) of boards having at least one cyber expert.

Among companies with no cyber experts on their board, 67% of directors said they planned to educate existing board members with cybersecurity certificates or credentials and/or develop knowledge among all members of the board.

22% of public companies responded that they lack cyber expertise; of those, 31% plan to hire an independent director with cyber expertise."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - April One-Minute Reads,"22% of public companies responded that they lack cyber expertise; of those, 31% plan to hire an independent director with cyber expertise.

Cyber-specialist board directors increased overall board awareness of cyber risk in 62% of companies surveyed, but they were sometimes unable to contribute more widely to board discussions.

90% of larger businesses that have a chief information security officer or chief information officer deliver their cyber risk briefing agreed that the information allows them to effectively oversee cyber risk, showing a strong correlation between the role of the executive delivering the cyber risk briefing and the boards ability to effectively oversee cyber risk.

Less than half of all respondents (48% for public and private companies) said their board had taken part in a tabletop exercise related to cyber-attacks.

US Supreme Court hears oral argument in Slack direct listing case On April 17, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Slack Technologies v. Pirani , presenting the question of whether shareholders in a direct listing have standing to sue under Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act.

Previously, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling that the plaintiff did have standing to sue under Sections 11 and 12, even if they could not definitively trace the securities that they acquired to the registration statement.

Slack appealed the decision, contending that tracing to the registration statement is required under Section 11.

As this Cooley PubCo blog post discusses in further detail , the oral arguments possibly signaled a potential resolution to the case, with the justices differentiating between Sections 11 and 12.

SEC announces charges for Regulation A violations On May 16, the SEC announced charges against 10 microcap companies for offering and selling securities in violation of Regulation A, which provides a limited exemption from registration under the Securities Act for smaller offerings, subject to certain conditions.

According to the press release, each of the companies obtained qualification from the SEC for their securities offerings under Regulation A but later made significant changes to their offerings that did not meet the requirements of the exemption.

The changes included improperly increasing the number of shares offered, improperly increasing or decreasing the price of shares offered, failing to file updated financial statements for ongoing offerings, and engaging in prohibited at the market or delayed offerings, which resulted in the companies offering and selling unregistered securities, according to the SEC.

All 10 companies agreed to settle the charges, which serves as an important reminder to companies conducting a Regulation A offering to ensure that any fundamental changes after the offering statement has been qualified by the SEC still satisfy the exemption conditions.

Delaware state bar proposes amendments to DGCL The Delaware State Bar Association recently recommended legislation proposing to amend the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which is expected to be considered by the Delaware General Assembly during its 2023 regular session.

Most notably for public companies, the amendments would revise Section 242 of the DGCL to: Eliminate the need for a default vote of stockholders for charter amendments effecting specific types of forward stock splits and associated increases in the authorized number of shares.

Reduce the minimum stockholder vote required to authorize a charter amendment that increases or decreases the authorized shares of a class or effects a reverse split of the shares of a class, where the shares are listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the amendment becomes effective and meet the listing requirements of the exchange after the amendment becomes effective."
Cooley,Public Companies Update - April One-Minute Reads,"These proposed amendments would be particularly helpful for companies with large retail shareholder bases, as they would lower the required vote threshold for the specified amendments  from the current threshold of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote  to one based on votes cast, provided the specified conditions are met.

In addition, the proposed amendments would, among other things: Confirm that a corporation is not required to receive the statutory minimum consideration (typically the par value) for a disposition of treasury shares.

Simplify the requirements for the filing of certificates of validation in connection with the ratification of certain defective corporate acts.

Provide greater certainty regarding the stockholders who must be given a notice of a non-unanimous action by consent of stockholders.

Reduce the vote required to consummate a domestication, transfer or continuance of a Delaware corporation to a non-US entity.

Revise the provisions governing statutory appraisal rights, including to add such rights in connection with a transfer, continuance or domestication of a Delaware corporation to a non-US entity.

Provide that no vote of stockholders is required to authorize a sale, lease, or exchange of collateral securing a mortgage or pledge under specified circumstances.

If enacted, the amendments would become effective on August 1, 2023, subject to certain specified exceptions.

Cooley,FCA Outlines Priorities for Payment Firms Governance and Risk Management in Spotlight,"The reverberations of recent bank collapses continue to be felt in the UK, with payment companies at risk of being found by the UKs financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to have inadequate risk controls.

Despite concurrent compliance pressures on payment firms, such as the new FCA Consumer Duty coming into force as early as 31 July 2023, payment firms are being asked to do more.

The key takeaway from this development is clear: Payment firms within and outside the UK are expected to take active steps to ensure continued compliance with the regulators expectations.

On 16 March 2023, the FCA sent a Dear CEO letter to approximately 300 payment firms authorised or registered under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 and the Electronic Money Regulations 2011  including payment institutions, electronic money institutions and registered account information service providers.

The FCAs actions indicate a perceived lack of risk management among payment firms.

The FCAs letter centres on the regulators concerns that payment services firms continue to fail to protect consumers from financial risks, thereby undermining the integrity of the financial system as a whole.

The FCA set out its expectation that payment firms take prompt action, and firms may be asked to explain, on request, the actions they have taken to ensure that customers money is safe, the firm does not compromise financial system integrity and the new FCA Consumer Duty is being implemented robustly.

Key actions coming out of the letter which payment firms should be aware of are: Safeguarding customers money : This should be a firms top priority.

Payment firms must, among other actions detailed in the letter, undertake reconciliations daily (at minimum), improve procedures and enhance record-keeping to support the identification of funds requiring safeguarding.

Prudential risk management : Firms should ensure that regulatory capital requirements are met at all times, consider holding additional capital, set or review their risk appetite and conduct scenario analysis to assess financial performance in a range of different scenarios.

Wind-down planning : Firms must have an appropriate wind-down plan and regularly review this plan.

Consideration of and reference to the Wind-down Planning Guide produced by the FCA, while not directly applicable to payment firms, is viewed as good practice.

Ensure AML systems and controls are effective : Firms must conduct regular reviews to assess their anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and remediate any weaknesses identified.

In particular, firms must take immediate action to ensure that they are not being used to receive the proceeds of fraud.

Implementation of the Consumer Duty : Firms must take appropriate action to comply with the new Consumer Duty.

Firms should consult the FCA guidance on implementing the Consumer Duty in payment firms .

More broadly, payment firms are required to implement robust governance strategies that align with the FCAs environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy and ensure consideration of material ESG risks and opportunities.

UK-authorised payment firms, or those registered in the UK, are strongly urged to take the FCAs concerns seriously and implement the changes suggested by the FCA promptly.

Payment firms and their boards must be prepared to explain, on request, the actions they have taken.

Following the FCAs 2022 to 2025 strategy released last year, earlier and more assertive action can be expected by the FCA when dealing with firms that fail to take necessary compliance actions.

Should you require any assistance in reviewing and/or revising your current governance procedures to better align with the FCAs stance, please reach out to Cooleys Yulia Makarova , who will be happy to help."
Cooley,UK Government Opens Consultation on Future Regulatory Regime for ESG Ratings Providers,"In March 2023, the UK government launched a consultation on the future regulatory regime for environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings providers.

These providers compile, package and sell information to market participants about companies ESG performance and risk.

Recognising the growing use of these assessments by companies and consumers when making financial decisions, the consultation seeks to understand whether these assessments should be brought within the regulatory perimeter of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

Setting the (green) scene The consultation was launched against the background of the UKs updated Green Finance Strategy , which aims to mobilise private capital to assist the government in achieving its sustainability, environmental and climate goals (e.g., to deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050).

In part, the government intends to achieve this by addressing concerns regarding the use of ESG assessments and ensuring that ratings providers use transparent methodologies, are well-governed and are void of conflicts of interest.

The government believes these outcomes could be  brought about through regulation .

Other consultations, nationally and internationally, have already concluded the same.

For example, the FCA carried out its own consultation in 2021 , which found that there was a  clear rationale for regulatory oversight  of ESG ratings providers.

Other jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union, Japan and India) are either carrying out consultations or have already introduced voluntary codes of conduct.

Purpose of the consultation When choosing to measure ESG impact, there are as many ESG methodologies as there are ESG ratings providers.

Although this can be explained by the  inherent multidimensionality  of ESG ratings to an extent, stakeholders have raised concerns about some of the methodologies being  opaque and lead[ing] to confusion .

These potential risks can undermine confidence in ESG ratings and their usefulness and have prompted the government to consider whether the regulatory perimeter is appropriately set.

Under the UKs Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a person can only carry out a regulated activity if it is authorised to do so by the appropriate regulator  like the FCA  or is otherwise exempt.

One of the regulatory proposals for ESG ratings providers entails them being FCA-authorised, subject to meeting certain minimum conditions.

This consultation seeks stakeholders views on the impact of this potential legislative change.

The consultation is broken down into five sets of questions on the following topics: Whether regulation for ESG ratings providers should be introduced and the practical challenges that might arise as a result.

How ESG ratings should be defined and the context(s) in which ratings providers should be regulated.

Potential exclusions from the regulation (e.g., where an ESG assessment is created by a company solely for use by that company).

The territorial scope of the regulation.

How the regulation can be made proportionate to the risks that ESG ratings  and ratings providers  pose.

As discussed above, the UK is not the only country considering how to tackle the risks and reap the benefits arising from the use of ESG assessments.

The consultation emphasises the need for international cohesion, and the FCA has already indicated that it would seek to follow the recommendations of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) as a  starting point .

IOSCO recommends that any proposed regulation for ESG ratings and data should focus on: Transparency.

Good governance.

Management of conflicts of interest.

Robust systems and controls.

Interestingly, the consultation notes that the FCA would not seek to  harmonise the varying methodologies  used by ESG ratings providers."
Cooley,UK Government Opens Consultation on Future Regulatory Regime for ESG Ratings Providers,"Robust systems and controls.

Interestingly, the consultation notes that the FCA would not seek to  harmonise the varying methodologies  used by ESG ratings providers.

Instead, the regulation would focus on ensuring that the methodologies used are transparent, including in respect of the individual underlying components assessed and the measurement objectives.

Next steps The government is inviting stakeholders to respond to the consultation by 30 June 2023.

Stakeholders are welcome to send their views in respect of all  or just some  of the questions.

If the government decides to extend the regulatory perimeter to incorporate ESG assessments, the FCA will likely carry out further public consultation, following its normal processes, at a later date.

Cooley comment Although the proposals considered in this consultation are at an early stage, HM Treasury has stated that it considers there to be  clear benefit  from the introduction of regulation.

In doing so, the government is not seeking to curb the influence of ESG ratings providers, but instead, it is seeking to ensure that their assessments can be properly relied on, thereby delivering better outcomes for the market and consumers alike.

The government sees new regulation as an opportunity to boost four of its key objectives: net-zero emissions, consumer protection, international competitiveness and economic growth  mirroring the multidimensionality of ESG ratings in the multidimensionality of benefits it is seeking to achieve.

As ever, though, this is not without risks.

The ESG assessment market, although growing, is still nascent, and the potential for overregulation to stymie innovation is real, especially as the market is currently dominated by two or three large players.

If you could be affected by this potential regulation, we recommend responding to the consultation now, when it is at this early stage.

Cooley lawyers will continue to monitor this space.

Please reach out to the authors or to your regular Cooley contact if you would like to discuss this further."
Cooley,Europe’s Top Court on Merger Review: No Deals Are ‘Off the Table’,"The European Unions top court recently confirmed that an M&A transaction that does not require mandatory pre-merger authorization may be investigated post-merger on suspicion that the transaction involved an abuse of the acquirers dominant position.

Per the ruling in the Towercast case, pre-merger authorization under the EU Merger Regulation (or EU member state equivalents) is required for certain specified transactions, but the rules on merger review do not exclude the applicability of the general antitrust prohibitions in Article 101 (restrictive agreements) and Article 102 (abuse of dominance) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and EU member state equivalents.

The recent judgment is notable because, over the past several decades when mandatory pre-merger control was introduced or enhanced, European competition authorities only very rarely relied on abuse of dominance provisions to investigate acquisitions.

The ruling clarifies how the rules on merger control complement the general antitrust laws within the EU and the framework for companies assessment of antitrust risk under EU and member states laws.

In the following, we summarize the main points of the Towercast judgment  as well as its enforcement implications  and explain important considerations for dealmakers.

The Towercast case The Towercast case involved an acquisition by Tldiffusion de France (TDF), a French provider of digital terrestrial broadcasting services, of one of its rivals, Itas.

The deal was not reportable for merger review to the European Commission (EC) or the French Competition Authority (FCA).

After the TDF/Itas deal closed, Towercast, a competitor, complained to the FCA that TDF had abused its dominant position by the acquisition.

The FCA dismissed the complaint on the basis that it lacked competence to review the transaction retrospectively, because it was not reportable under the merger control rules.

Towercast appealed the FCAs decision, and the Court of Appeal of Paris requested guidance from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the relationship between the rules on abuse of dominance and merger review.

The CJEU noted that merger control rules assume that acquisitions that satisfy certain thresholds can have harmful effects on the market structure and competition  and so, must be notified for pre-merger review.

The CJEU clarified, however, that this does not mean that acquisitions that do not meet the thresholds for review should never be subject to post-merger investigation under the abuse of dominance rules, which apply generally and independently of the merger control rules.

The CJEU ruled in 1973, in Continental Can , that a firm holding a dominant position, in certain circumstances, may abuse that position contrary to Article 102 TFEU by way of an acquisition.

In the decades since, specific merger control rules were adopted, but those rules did not affect the applicability of Article 102 TFEU.

On that basis, mergers & acquisitions that are subject to mandatory pre-merger review (under the EU Merger Regulation or corresponding member state laws) are immune from abuse of dominance claims under Article 102 TFEU.

But where pre-merger reviews are not triggered, competition authorities and courts remain free to investigate whether an acquirer that holds a dominant position on a relevant market has abused that dominant position by acquiring a competitor.

In that analysis, a finding of abuse presupposes that the acquisition strengthened the acquirers dominant position to such a degree that competition is  substantially  impeded in the sense that the behavior of all remaining rivals  depends  on the acquirer.

Implications for enforcement The EC has reviewed more than 8,268 M&A deals since the EU Merger Regulation took effect in 1990, and many more have been reviewed by national competition authorities under the member states merger control laws."
Cooley,Europe’s Top Court on Merger Review: No Deals Are ‘Off the Table’,"The EU Merger Regulation gives the EC and member states the opportunity to refer jurisdiction over M&A deals to ensure that a case is dealt with by the most appropriate authority.

Over the years, 456 transactions have been referred to the EC by member states  around 90% of those were initiated by merging parties and around 10% by member states authorities.

Conversely, 309 deals have been referred from the EC to member states  around two-thirds of those were initiated by merging parties and one-third by the EC.

Despite this robust enforcement record and interagency collaboration, the EC and member states authorities perceive an enforcement gap in the merger control system.

The concern is that certain M&A deals, especially deals involving nascent or emerging innovative tech and life sciences targets, may have adverse effects on competition, even though they fall outside the scope of mandatory pre-merger review.

To that end, in March 2021, the EC announced a shift in its policy on encouraging and accepting referrals for its review of transactions that fall below the thresholds for automatic jurisdiction under the EU Merger Regulation, as well as member states laws.

Although that policy change has not caused a major increase in the number of referrals from member states (in total, five such Article 22 referrals have been made since 2021, including one involving a deal over which no member state had initial jurisdiction), the EC is understood to have evaluated more than 30 deals for potential referral.

The policy is therefore controversial, as it creates uncertainty in deal negotiations and execution and remains subject to challenge before the CJEU .

We expect that the pre-merger notification route will remain the mainstay for competition analysis of M&A deals also after the Towercast judgment.

Certain deals that fall outside the scope of automatic review remain subject to potential Article 22 referral for review by the EC; but, as a threshold matter, any such deal must affect trade  between member states  and pose a  significant  threat to competition in the member state(s) requesting referral.

We do not expect that Towercast will open floodgates of new antitrust investigations.

The judgment clarifies that there are two possible routes for review of an M&A deal that does not meet the requirements for pre-merger review: an authority may initiate a referral to the EC for pre-merger review under the EU Merger Regulation (as mentioned above) or an ex officio post-merger investigation into suspected abuse of dominance.

A deal with cross-border dimensions may in principle be a candidate for referral to the EC, but a purely domestic deal will unlikely affect trade between member states  even if it presents risks to domestic competition.

Still, several factors militate against investigating even complex local deals under abuse of dominance rules.

First, any post-merger investigation is fraught with difficulty, not least in terms of ultimately implementing effective remedies such as a reversal or unscrambling of the deal.

The EU Merger Regulation was adopted precisely because Article 102 TFEU, while applicable, is not well-suited to M&A settings.

Second, the Towercast standard for intervention under Article 102 TFEU is stricter and more difficult to satisfy, compared to that applicable in pre-merger review under the EU Merger Regulation.

Intervention under Towercast presupposes that the acquirer holds a dominant position pre-transaction and that this position is not merely  strengthened  but strengthened to  substantially  impede competition such that the remaining rivals  depend  on the acquirer.

Under the EU Merger Regulation, intervention is possible if dominance is strengthened and effective competition thereby is  significantly impeded .

That said, the risks of post-merger intervention are real and should be taken seriously by dealmakers."
Cooley,Europe’s Top Court on Merger Review: No Deals Are ‘Off the Table’,"That said, the risks of post-merger intervention are real and should be taken seriously by dealmakers.

For instance, only a few days after the CJEUs ruling in Towercast , the Belgian Competition Authority announced that it was investigating whether the countrys leading telecom operator may have abused a dominant position by acquiring a smaller broadband communications services provider.

Considerations for dealmakers The Towercast ruling confirms that deals beyond the perimeter of the European pre-merger review system remain subject to post-merger EU antitrust law intervention.

Conceptually, the position is similar to, for instance, the US, where deals that satisfy the thresholds for Hart-Scott-Rodino review must be reported to antitrust agencies.

But those agencies retain jurisdiction to investigate any deal, whether reportable or not.

US law goes further than the Towercast ruling, with US authorities retaining jurisdiction over deals that have been reported.

Given this ruling  as well as European agencies concerns around the potential future roles of nascent or emerging innovative tech and life sciences firms  dealmakers should keep the following points in mind: Sellers and buyers alike need to develop comprehensive regulatory strategies to control for timing and execution risks in M&A deals.

Regulatory strategies should include assessment of M&A deals likely substantive effect on competition, even where targets have no or only low turnover, or where the parties have limited presence in Europe.

Mere analysis of mandatory filing requirements, or the likely outcome of such reviews, does not enable buyers or sellers to comprehensively calibrate risk of enforcement action and impact on timing.

Regulatory strategies should include parameters for proactive engagement with enforcement agencies, as appropriate for pre-merger notification, and factor in the potential for referrals of jurisdiction for pre-merger review.

Sellers and buyers alike need to factor in the potential for post-merger review under abuse of dominance rules.

Where such risk exists, it is not only a buy-side concern.

Even if an investigation were to materialize only after closing, the seller needs to anticipate that risk at the negotiation stage as it may influence the buyers proposed terms."
Cooley,Form 144 Goes Digital,"Venture capital and private equity funds with public companies in their portfolios  or whose principals sit on public company boards  are likely to be impacted by the new electronic filing requirements adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Form 144.

Securities Act Rule 144 Rule 144 provides an exemption from SEC registration for resales of securities acquired directly from an issuer in a private offering (restricted securities) and resales of securities held by affiliates of an issuer (control securities).

Restricted securities Restricted securities are securities acquired in unregistered, private transactions from the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer.

Examples of restricted securities include securities received in venture financings and private placements, including private investment in public equity (PIPE) transactions.

Control securities Control securities are securities held by an affiliate of the issuer, regardless of how the shares were acquired.

An affiliate is a person, such as a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer.

Control means the power to direct the management and policies of the company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, board representation or otherwise.

A fund will generally be considered to be an affiliate if it  alone or with related funds  beneficially owns more than 10% of the companys stock, or if the fund has an associated individual serving as a director of the company.

The conditions of Rule 144 that apply to a particular sale of restricted or control securities vary depending on the circumstances and are beyond the scope of this alert.

If you have questions regarding whether Rule 144 applies and about particular requirements of the rule, please reach out to your Cooley contacts.

Form 144 Among the conditions that apply to Rule 144 sales by affiliates is the requirement to file a Form 144 (notice of proposed sale) with the SEC, if aggregate sales over a three-month period involve more than 5,000 shares or greater than $50,000.

Forms 144 have historically been paper filings to be deposited in the mail to the SEC on the date of first sale, and most full-service brokers have customarily prepared and submitted these Form 144 filings on behalf of their clients.

However, the SEC recently adopted rule amendments that will require all Forms 144 to be filed electronically on the EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval) system beginning on April 13, 2023.

What this means for you Based on our conversations with many brokers, we believe that the majority of large, full-service brokers will continue to prepare and file Forms 144 for their clients after the transition to electronic filing.

In order to do so, these brokers will, at a minimum, now require the EDGAR filing codes of any selling stockholder.

In addition, some brokers are requiring amendments to service agreements and, for those brokers who plan to execute Forms 144 on behalf of their clients, you will likely be asked to deliver a power of attorney authorizing them to do so.

If you havent already been in communication with your broker(s) about this rule change, we recommend proactively reaching out to them to determine whether they intend to continue making filings on your behalf and, if so, what they will require from you.

If any of them are not planning to make filings on your behalf following the rule change, you will need to plan for how you will make these filings.

Each entity and control person that will potentially sell portfolio company securities will be required to have their own separate EDGAR codes.

We recommend evaluating your structure including any affiliated entities or individuals that could receive distributions in kind  to identify potential filing persons.

If any of them do not have EDGAR codes, consider applying as soon as possible."

Cooley,CFPB Issues Policy Statement on CFPAs Prohibition on Abusive Conduct,"On April 3, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a policy statement articulating a new framework for analyzing conduct that it considers abusive in violation of federal law.

The CFPB until now has provided limited formal guidance on what constitutes abusive conduct under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA).

Consistent with the CFPBs recent statements, the new policy statement touches on concepts of fair dealing and proper market functions when explaining the CFPBs rationale.

This includes references to prior concerns about competition where an entity has outsized market share or concentration, or when it otherwise participates in a market structure that disadvantages consumers.

The CFPB also heavily focuses on congressional intent and commentary from the CFPAs enactment.

It cites legislative history and House Committee on Financial Services testimony to show the necessity of prohibiting abusive conduct and why the policy statements framework is consistent with the CFPAs legislative intent.

The policy statement offers numerous examples to flesh out each prong of the statutory abusive standard, and it articulates facts and circumstances the CFPB believes may be sufficient to support such a claim.

Consistent with the CFPBs prior pronouncements and the CFPB Supervision and Examination Manual, the policy statement also reiterates that neither substantial injury nor harm to consumers is necessary to support a claim for abusive conduct.

Material interference with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a product or service doesnt require a showing of intent or actual misunderstanding The CFPA declares an act abusive if it materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service.

According to the CFPB, this prohibition applies to actions or omissions that obscure, withhold, de-emphasize, render confusing, or hide information relevant to the ability of a consumer to understand terms and conditions.

Examples of this type of abusive behavior include: Buried disclosures, such as the use of fine print, complex language, jargon, or omitting material terms and conditions.

Physical interference, like impeding a persons ability to see, hear, or understand terms and conditions, such as physically withholding or hiding notices.

Digital interference, including the use of pop-up or drop-down boxes, multiple click-throughs, or other actions or dark patterns, which would make terms and conditions materials less accessible or salient.

Overshadowing, such as the prominent placement of certain content that interferes with the comprehension of other conduct.

The policy statement indicates that an intent to materially interfere with consumer understanding, or evidence of actual consumer misunderstanding, can help support a violation of the abusive standard.

But they are not necessary to support liability.

Instead, the CFPB says that it need only be shown that the natural consequence of the act or omission is to impede the consumers ability to understand the product.

Taking unreasonable advantage of certain circumstances rises to the level of abusiveness even if, for example, the entity doesnt cause the lack of understanding of which it takes advantage The CFPA also provides that an act is abusive if it takes unreasonable advantage of: A lack of understanding on the part of consumers of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service.

The consumers inability to protect their own interests in selecting or using a consumer financial product or service.

The reasonable reliance by consumers on a covered person to act in the consumers interests.

As explained below, the CFPB provides context and conduct supporting violations for each of these three circumstances defined as abusive by the CFPA.

Lack of understanding This circumstance focuses on gaps in understanding that affect consumer decision-making."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Policy Statement on CFPAs Prohibition on Abusive Conduct,"Lack of understanding This circumstance focuses on gaps in understanding that affect consumer decision-making.

For purposes of establishing liability, the CFPB says it is enough to show that the consumer does not understand the consequences of defaulting on a loan, for example, or how to realize the benefits of the product.

Whether the consumers lack of understanding was reasonable is irrelevant, and there is no minimum threshold of impacted consumers, says the CFPB.

It is not even necessary that the entity itself created the lack of understanding, as long as the entity takes unreasonable advantage of it.

Inability to protect interests The CFPB here is focused on circumstances where a consumer has unequal bargaining power .

Some of these circumstances are structural and tied to the nature of the relationship, according to the CFPB, such as where the consumer cannot select an alternative service provider.

This occurs, for example, with credit reporting companies, debt collectors or servicing companies.

The CFPB says it also will scrutinize under this circumstance the use of form contracts where the consumer is unable to bargain, as well as whether there are high transaction costs to exit a relationship.

Reasonable reliance The CFPB says this circumstance focuses on situations where the consumer has a reasonable expectation that the institution will act in their interests or advise them on how to make a decision and acts in reasonable reliance on it.

The CFPB provides two examples of ways in which it may establish reasonable reliance: Where the entity communicates that it will act in the customers best interests or holds itself out as doing so but falls short of that representation.

Where the entity assumes the role of acting on behalf of the consumer or helping them to select service providers in the market.

However, the CFPB notes that there are numerous ways to establish reasonable reliance.

What to expect The CFPBs policy statement will serve as a formal reference point for future examinations and investigations by the CFPB and other regulators and government enforcers with authority to pursue abusiveness claims.

It also will guide market participants as they examine their own policies and practices.

As CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in remarks the same day the CFPB released the policy statement: We wanted to assist our fellow government enforcers and the market more broadly by drawing out some of the key principles from our decade of enforcement work.

The policy statement follows a rise in recent actions and statements from the CFPB relying on the abusiveness prong of the CFPA to bring enforcement actions against potentially violative conduct.

It also follows guidance released by the CFPB over the past couple of years that continues to define and expand the CFPBs authority to pursue unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAPs).

For example, the CFPB announced in March 2022 that it intends to use its UDAAP authority to pursue discrimination claims in noncredit financial products, as we detailed in a client alert .

With the new policy statement to fall back on, the CFPB is likely to continue to push the limits of its UDAAP authority and use its policy statement to identify abusive conduct and bring enforcement actions where appropriate.

The policy statement will be published in the Federal Register.

Public comments are due by July 3, 2023."
Cooley,"Treasury Department Releases Report on Money Laundering Risks, Decentralized Finance","The US Department of the Treasury has released an Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance , which indicates that the Treasury Department sees significant risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) services and the potential impact on efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Bank Secrecy Act compliance program requirements The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) imposes anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations on financial institutions, such as banks, broker-dealers, and money services businesses (MSBs).

MSBs include companies that provide money transmission services, which is a broad category encompassing significant amounts of fintech and virtual currency activity.

Since 2013, the Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which implements the BSA, has interpreted the MSB designation to apply to activities involving accepting, transmitting, exchanging and issuing virtual currencies.

A covered financial institution subject to AML/CFT compliance program obligations must establish and implement an effective AML program and address record-keeping and reporting requirements, including requirements to file suspicious activity reports (SARs).

Additionally, financial institutions that are MSBs are required to register with FinCEN.

Application of BSA requirements to DeFi services The risk assessment indicates that the Treasury Department sees decentralization as generally immaterial to the analysis of whether activity is subject to the BSA.

The report affirms that obligations for financial institutions under the BSA apply to DeFi services, if those services involve the activities of financial institutions as defined by the BSA.

For example, according to the risk assessment, if a DeFi service accepts and transmits virtual assets from one person to another person or location by any means, then it most likely would qualify as a money transmitter (and therefore an MSB) and be subject to the same AML/CFT compliance program obligations as a money transmitter offering services in fiat currency.

On the other hand, the report recognizes that some DeFi services may fall outside the BSA definition of a financial institution, such as (depending on the specific facts and circumstances) some services that enable users who self-custody assets to interface with software that processes transactions automatically.

The Treasury Department appears skeptical of such services, noting that many DeFi services claim to be disintermediated by enabling automated P2P

[peer-to-peer] transactions without the need for an account or custodial relationship.

Furthermore, the risk assessment describes DeFi services that fall outside the scope of the BSA could potentially result in gaps in suspicious activity reporting and limit authorities collection of and access to information critical to supporting financial investigations.

The report notes that the term DeFi has no generally accepted definition but broadly refers to virtual asset protocols and services that purport to allow for some form of automated P2P transactions, often through the use of self-executing code known as smart contracts based on blockchain technology.

However, the Treasury Department cautions, [t]he degree to which a purported DeFi service is in reality decentralized is a matter of facts and circumstances, and this risk assessment finds that DeFi services often have a controlling organization that provides a measure of centralized administration and governance.

And, in any event, a DeFi service that functions as a financial institution as defined by the BSA, regardless of whether the service is centralized [or] decentralized, will be required to comply with BSA obligations, including AML/CFT obligations."
Cooley,"Treasury Department Releases Report on Money Laundering Risks, Decentralized Finance","That means that if the service meets the applicable definition of a financial institution (e.g., an MSB or a broker-dealer), its decentralization has no bearing on whether the obligations apply.

Key risk assessment findings The report asserts that bad actors are using DeFi services to transfer and launder their illicit proceeds, largely by capitalizing on vulnerabilities stemming from the lack of AML/CFT controls for DeFi services and lack of compliance with BSA obligations.

The Treasury Department identified several vulnerabilities that bad actors capitalize on, including: Lack of compliance with AML/CFT obligations.

Lack of coverage of certain DeFi services by existing AML/CFT requirements.

Less rigorous or non-existent AML/CFT controls in foreign jurisdictions.

Poor cybersecurity controls by DeFi services.

The risk assessment suggests that such vulnerabilities may stem in part from the fact that industry participants may not fully understand how AML/CFT obligations apply to DeFi services.

However, the report also notes that in other instances, participants may expressly seek to decentralize a service in an effort to avoid AML/CFT obligations that in fact do apply to such covered services.

Additionally, the Treasury Department notes the supervisory challenges inherent to DeFi services because some are developed with opaque organization structure.

Treasury Department recommendations and request for public comment The report includes recommendations for US government actions to mitigate the illicit finance risks associated with DeFi services, including: Strengthening AML/CFT regulatory supervision.

Assessing enhancements to the AML/CFT regulatory regime to address gaps.

Providing additional guidance for the private sector on DeFi services AML/CFT obligations, as well as coordinating with industry on threat mitigation and information sharing.

Engaging with foreign jurisdictions to implement the latest global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and to close gaps in FATF implementation governing DeFi.

The Treasury Department also seeks public input on the risk assessment, and it poses several questions for comment, including what factors should be considered to determine whether DeFi services are a financial institution under the BSA, as well as recommendations for clarifying the DeFi services covered by the BSA and how AML/CFT obligations should vary based on the different types of DeFi services."
Cooley,2 EU Laws Could Supercharge Product Liability Class Actions,"Editors note: Authored by Edward Turtle and Harriet Jones, this article was originally published in Law360 .

The EU is planning to radically reform its product liability laws.

The European Commission has proposed to amend the existing Product Liability Directive (85/374/EEC) to expand the scope of claims that can be brought and the range of damages that can be recovered, and to make it easier for consumers to prove their case.

While final implementation dates are not yet confirmed, the new provisions of the PLDcould become effective in 2024 or 2025.

At the same time, the EU's new class action regime under the Representative Actions Directive (EU) 2020/1828 is set to apply starting in June.

The RAD represents a major overhaul of the European litigation landscape.

Inspired by a concern that globalization, e-commerce and new technologies have increased the risk of large groups of consumers suffering harm, the RAD introduces class action mechanisms in every one of the EU's 27 member states, as well as a new cross-border mechanism.

Taken together, these changes represent a fundamental change to the product liability landscape in Europe  which we expect to supercharge the already growing trend for European class action litigation.

This article takes a look at the combined effect of these developments, comparing the position in the EU to the U.S., to consider whether Europe has adopted U.S.-style product liability class actions.

Reforms to the Product Liability Framework For over 30 years, the EU has had a strict liability regime established for product liability claims under the PLD where producers are responsible for defective products, regardless of whether the defect is their fault.

Claimants just need to show that a product was defective, they suffered damage, and there was a causal link between the defect in the product and the damage they suffered.

It is also possible to bring product liability claims under national fault-based regimes  e.g., contract and tort.

But the strict liability regime is generally preferred, because, since claimants do not have to establish fault, it is easier to bring a claim.

The EU has decided that reform of the PLD is needed to protect consumers better against risks including those created by connected products, artificial intelligence, the circular economy and e-commerce.

While the proposed reforms focus on addressing new technologies, they will affect all product sectors with key reforms, including the following.

Expanding the Definition of ""Product"" Into the Digital Realm

The reforms expand the definition of ""product"" to include software and certain related digital services, and introduce strict liability for defects resulting from cybersecurity risks and software updates  or lack of updates  including where they cause loss or corruption of data.

At the same time, the commission proposes removing the existing threshold of 500 for personal property claims.

The impact of these changes, when combined with new class actions mechanisms under the RAD, is likely to be a significant risk of mass claims for trivial data loss or corruption claims following, for example, cybersecurity incidents or bugs in software updates.

Broadening Recoverable Damages to Cover Psychological Harm

The reforms broaden the scope of recoverable damages from personal injury, death and damage to personal property, to include medically recognized harm to psychological health.

There is no definition of this included in the proposal, and it is currently very unclear what would be in scope.

As drafted, there is a risk that claims for stress and anxiety would be recoverable.

Requiring Defendants to Disclose Technical Information The reforms introduce a new disclosure or discovery obligation that requires defendants to disclose technical information if the claimant establishes a plausible case."
Cooley,2 EU Laws Could Supercharge Product Liability Class Actions,"As this is quite a low bar, there is a risk that these powers could be used by claimants in so-called fishing expeditions  i.e., spuriously, in the hope that it might turn up something that could help put together a claim.

If this materializes, it is likely to place a significant burden on companies doing business in the EU.

Creating New Presumptions of Defect The reforms create new presumptions of defect  including where there was noncompliance with EU product safety rules, or where defendants failed to provide documentation under disclosure powers.

In addition, the burden of proof could be eased for scientifically or technically complex cases  the commission gives the examples of cases involving pharmaceuticals or artificial intelligence  or where a product has an obvious malfunction.

In our view, this easing of the burden of proof is problematic as currently drafted, because most malfunctions will be obvious after the event.

New Liability for Online Marketplaces

The reforms add new liability for online marketplaces, including imposing strict liability on a fulfillment service provider where there is no manufacturer, importer or authorized representative established in the EU.

An online marketplace may be held strictly liable in certain cases where it fails to identify who supplied it with the product within one month of a request.

These reforms go much further than expected, and would represent a complete overhaul of existing EU product liability laws, creating a much more claimant-friendly regime.

Moreover, it is no longer just the traditional players in the consumer product manufacturing industry that will need to reevaluate their exposure as a result of these new rules.

Rather, a whole range of companies doing business in the EU will need to reconsider their liability risks  including manufacturers and importers, software developers, online marketplaces and other intermediaries, among many others.

New EU Class Action Regime

The EU is introducing new class action mechanisms under the RAD which will enable qualified entities to bring representative actions in the collective interests of consumers.

This is a major change  introducing class actions for all 450 million EU consumers across the EU's 27 member states, where previously, only three had these procedures.

The RAD creates two types of class actions: those brought in one EU member state, and cross-border actions across multiple member states.

The cross-border mechanism would allow organizations in, for example, Germany, France and Italy to work together to bring consumer claims in the courts of one of these jurisdictions.

Qualified entities can seek a range of remedies, including injunctions and damages for breach of over 66 EU laws covering consumer rights, product safety, medical devices and medicinal products, data protection, financial services, energy and telecommunications.

Importantly, it will also cover the EU's product liability regime, including the PLD and the proposed reforms to it outlined above.

Product Liability Class Actions: Comparing the EU and U.S. Models

The EU was reluctant to adopt an approach comparable to the class action system in the U.S.

The RAD intends to create a different system: protecting consumers on the one hand, while not creating a culture the EU perceives as unnecessarily litigious.

There are certainly some clear points of distinction.

In particular, recovery is limited to actual loss, and there are no punitive damages.

Moreover, class actions can only be brought by eligible nonprofit consumer organizations, not law firms.

So the EU system sounds unlike the U.S. system.

On closer inspection, however, the new EU class action mechanisms are not as different from the U.S. model as they might seem, and are likely to boost the already growing trend for European product liability class actions."
Cooley,2 EU Laws Could Supercharge Product Liability Class Actions,"First, while class actions can only be brought by nonprofit organizations, there is nothing to stop these organizations instructing plaintiff law firms to run their claims.

Moreover, litigation funding is permitted under the RAD, provided it is not detrimental to the collective interests of consumers and is fully disclosed as part of transparency measures.

Taken together, it is no accident that Europe has already seen a huge influx of U.S. plaintiffs firms in the last two years.

Secondly, there will be a low threshold to initiate proceedings under the RAD.

It will be sufficient to describe the group affected by the alleged infringement and set out at a high level the issues of fact and law to be resolved.

As a result, we are likely to see class actions brought quickly in the EU off the back of media coverage of issues including data breaches, recalls or noncompliance with EU laws.

Thirdly, the EU regime is designed to incentivize settlement, with courts being given powers to instruct parties to enter settlement discussions, as well as to review and approve settlements.

While there are no punitive damages or jury awards comparable to U.S. proceedings, the huge pool of 450 million potentially affected EU consumers means that, in practice, even small per-claimant product liability claims will aggregate to significant group damage amounts.

Experienced consumer organizations, and the plaintiffs firms that they instruct, will be able to leverage this to obtain major settlements.

Fourthly, claimants will have the upper hand when it comes to costs.

Under the RAD, the losing party will be required to reimburse the winning party's costs  including legal fees  which is designed to act as a deterrent to abusive claims.

However, in practice, it increases businesses' risk of exposure if defeated, with little offset in terms of their potential to recover costs, even if successful.

In particular, potential for recovery from consumer organizations is likely to be limited, and individual consumers will not be ordered to pay costs, except in the unlikely scenario they are found to have deliberately or negligently increased costs.

Finally, claimants can use final decisions in one member state as evidence in proceedings in other member states.

This could result in forum shopping, with claimants pursuing initial actions in nember states with the most favorable regime, then bringing follow-on proceedings in others.

In summary, even though the EU has taken a different approach from the U.S., the mechanisms it has introduced will undoubtedly create a much more claimant-friendly environment for class actions.

As a result, bringing large collections of product liability claims will become a much more viable prospect for consumers  and a much more threatening one for businesses.

Conclusion: Evaluating the Likely Impact It is extremely likely that the EU's RAD and reforms of the PLD will encourage the growth of product liability class actions against companies doing business in the EU.

The question is: On what scale?

In our view, this is a game changer  a fundamental shift in the European risk landscape that will supercharge product liability class actions in the EU.

While it remains to be seen how quickly this will come to pass, we expect to see a rapid growth in product liability class actions, even in the short term."
Cooley,Banking Sector Events May Affect Qualified Small Business Stock Treatment,"Startups and emerging companies that are reevaluating their cash management policies following recent events in the banking sector should be aware of the implications of such policies on qualified small business stock (QSBS) treatment for their stock.

Investments in mutual funds  including money market funds  can potentially jeopardize QSBS treatment.

Background Stock issued by a corporation is not treated as QSBS unless, among other requirements, at least 80% of its assets (by value) are used by such corporation in the active conduct of one or more qualified trades or businesses  known as the  active business requirement   during substantially all of the applicable investors holding period for such stock.

A corporation cannot qualify for the active business requirement for any given period if more than 10% of the value of its assets (in excess of liabilities) consist of portfolio stock  known as the  portfolio stock limitation   other than assets that qualify under the working capital exception, which weve described below.

Portfolio stock generally means stock of other corporations that are less than 50% owned by the putative QSBS-issuing corporation.

This limits the amount that a QSBS-eligible corporation can invest in other companies.

Under a  working capital exception , assets are treated as used in the active conduct of a corporations trade or business if they are held as a part of the reasonably required working capital needs of a qualified trade or business of the corporation, or if they are held for investment and are reasonably expected to be used within [two] years to finance research and experimentation in a qualified trade or business or increases in working capital needs of a qualified trade or business.

For periods after the corporation has been in existence for at least two years, no more than 50% of its total assets can qualify for the working capital exception.

For purposes of the portfolio stock limitation, investments in mutual funds are likely to be treated as portfolio stock.

There may be arguments that interests in money market funds should not be treated as portfolio stock given their cash equivalency, but the statute itself does not exempt interests in mutual funds based on the composition of their assets.

Guidance for companies reassessing cash management A corporation that intends to qualify as a QSBS issuer should exercise caution with its cash management policies following recent events in the banking sector.

An investment in a mutual fund (including money market funds), if in excess of 10% of the value of a corporations net assets (combined with any other portfolio stock), could run afoul of the portfolio stock limitation, which could increase risk that the corporation does not satisfy the active business requirement during substantially all of the investors holding periods.

By contrast, investments of cash in more traditional working capital accounts  for example, savings or checking accounts, money market accounts (to the extent they are not used to invest in securities, money market funds or other funds), Treasury bills or other government securities, or certificates of deposit  generally do not raise issues under the portfolio stock limitation.

Companies are cautioned, however, that certificates of deposit, other bank time deposits and short-term corporate obligations (such as commercial paper) are considered investment securities under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if held in sufficient amount may cause a company to be considered an investment company under that act, which could affect the company adversely.

Cooley,FCC Adopts New Equipment Authorization Testing Standards,"The Federal Communications Commission has released a Report and Order updating its equipment authorization rules to incorporate new standards for testing devices subject to the rules.

Radio frequency (RF) devices must be tested to ensure that they comply with the FCCs technical requirements before they are marketed or imported in the United States.

The new rules align with the FCCs ongoing efforts to ensure new RF devices do not cause harmful interference to other devices.

Most of the changes focus on amending site validation and testing requirements.

However, the FCC also deleted outdated references and transition periods within the existing rules.

The FCC monitors and updates its technical requirements by incorporating best practices from standards-setting bodies.

In this latest update, the FCC incorporated standards for testing for RF emissions established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Accredited Standards Committee C63 (ANSC C63) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

The FCC adopted the following standards: American National Standard Validation Methods for Radiated Emission Test Sites, 1 GHz to 18 GHz (ANSI C63.25.1-2018).

American National Standard of Procedures for Compliance Testing of Unlicensed Wireless Devices (ANSI C63.10-2020).

General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories (ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E)).

American National Standard for Methods of Measurement of Radio-Noise Emissions from Low-Voltage Electrical and Electronic Equipment in the Range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz, Amendment 1: Test Site Validation (ANSI C63.4a-2017).

The new rules will be effective 30 days after the FCCs order is published in the Federal Register.

After the rules go into effect, there is a two-year transition period for test labs and manufacturers to comply with ANSI C63.10-2020 and ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E).

The FCC did not adopt a transition period for ANSI C63.25.1-2018 or ANSI C63.4a-2017, because there are alternatives to those standards that will remain in the rules.

Product manufacturers and laboratories should review the new standards to ensure that devices are tested in compliance with the new rules.

Failure to do so could result in product launch delays, devices being impounded as they are imported into the US, or sanctions for devices that are imported or sold without meeting the testing requirements.

As the FCCs changes only apply to devices approved going forward, any devices that have previously been approved under the FCCs prior rules can continue to be marketed in and imported into the US.

Cooley,Considerations for Companies Seeking Competitor Collaborations,"There are many legitimate reasons why your company may wish to collaborate with one of its competitors.

You may, for example, want to enter into an agreement with your competitor to develop a new product.

Collaboration between competitors that leads to innovation and directly benefits customers is normally permissible under competition law.

However, you need to be careful, as there are competition law risks when competitors interact to such an extent that they are no longer acting independently.

Certain forms of collaboration between competitors are illegal under competition law and carry serious consequences, including: Fines.

Agreements being declared void.

Director disqualification in some jurisdictions (e.g., the UK).

Potential prosecution and imprisonment (e.g., bid-rigging amounts to a criminal law violation in the UK and Germany).

Significant and long-lasting reputational damage, which may impact the companys valuation.

Potential private damages actions brought by disgruntled customers or competitors who have suffered loss because of the infringement.

When entering into, setting up, or managing joint ventures, alliances or other forms of collaboration with your competitors, its important to collaborate legally, check that you are compliant with competition law from the outset and keep arrangements under regular review to help ensure that you remain compliant.

You also should: Consider carefully the true purpose of the collaboration and the benefit for competition and customers, be precise about what the collaboration aims to achieve, and document it.

Determine whether the collaboration restricts competition between the parties involved and, if so, whether that level of restriction is proportionate and necessary for the objective pursued, as the greater any reduction in competition, the higher the legal risk (and the greater the need for legal advice).

Pursue collaborations only where the proposed innovation could not be achieved by the collaborating businesses acting alone.

Keep in mind that the circumstances (the marketplace, the legal framework, etc.) in which your collaboration takes place may change, and regularly check your arrangements to ensure compliance.

Be alert to changes in the business, such as a merger.

Do not  assume collaborative arrangements that try to mask what is otherwise price fixing, market sharing, output restriction or bid-rigging will escape detection and fines.

Refrain from sharing competitively sensitive information that relates to business matters not covered by your arrangement (i.e., discussions about pricing should only be those that are necessary for the collaboration and limited to the specific scope of the relevant venture).

Common forms of collaboration agreements The most common forms of collaboration agreements concern research and development (R&D), production and purchasing.

Weve summarized the main principles of each agreement type below.

1. R&D agreements In R&D agreements, the parties agree to jointly carry out research and/or jointly develop using the results of the research .

While these types of agreements often are a cost-efficient way of pooling expertise, skills and assets with other players in the market in order to drive innovation and improve the products you are selling, they can trigger antitrust concerns.

Be sure that your agreement does not: Reduce or slow down innovation, leading to fewer or lower quality products or, products coming to the market later than they otherwise would.

Lead to higher prices by reducing competition significantly between the parties outside the scope of the agreement or by making anti-competitive coordination likely in those markets.

Foreclose access to key technology where at least one party has a significant degree of market power.

Include price restrictions and market allocation."
Cooley,Considerations for Companies Seeking Competitor Collaborations,"Foreclose access to key technology where at least one party has a significant degree of market power.

Include price restrictions and market allocation.

An R&D agreement is less likely to be anti-competitive if it includes cooperation: At an early stage, far removed from the exploitation of possible results.

Between noncompetitors.

Between competitors who cannot carry out the necessary R&D independently.

Carried out by specialized companies, research institutes or academic bodies that are not active in the exploitation of the results.

That avoids the joint exploitation of possible results by means of licensing, production and/or marketing.

Note: In some jurisdictions, there is an automatic exemption from antitrust rules if the parties combined market share does not exceed a certain threshold and the agreement does not contain hardcore restrictions.

2. Production agreements In production agreements, the parties agree to carry out production by one party alone or more than one party jointly .

This tends to save costs, as the parties pool their complementary skills, know-how or their financial resources, which in turn leads to improved product quality and variety.

Ideally, these benefits are passed on to consumers.

However, production agreements may trigger antitrust concerns.

Joint production can be carried out in different ways, such as via a joint venture or a subcontracting agreement between actual or potential competitors or between companies operating at different levels of the market.

Such arrangements may restrict competition on the product markets of the products manufactured under the agreement, as well as the spillover markets , which are the markets upstream or downstream to the markets directly affected by the agreement.

Determining whether a production agreement violates antitrust rules involves looking at the extent of the parties market power on the relevant markets that may be affected by the terms of the agreement.

Production agreements restrict competition if they do not truly concern joint production but serve as a tool to engage in a disguised cartel.

For example, production agreements may restrict competition if they: Directly align (between the parties) the output, quality, prices or other competitively important parameters of the joint ventures sales.

Coordinate the parties competitive behavior as suppliers, which may lead to higher prices or reduced output, as well as have an impact product quality, variety and innovation.

Foreclose third parties in related markets (i.e., where parties use their joint production to raise input costs for their competitors downstream).

A production agreement is less likely to be anti-competitive if: The parties only agree to the output directly concerned by the production agreement, provided other parameters of competition are not eliminated.

The parties only set sales prices for jointly manufactured products only where its essential for a production and joint distribution agreement to go ahead in the first place.

The cooperation falls within the scope of any special exemptions.

3. Purchasing agreements In purchasing agreements, the parties agree to jointly purchase all or part of their product requirements (i.e., components to manufacture new products or products for resale).

This tends to save money in the form of reduced purchase prices and transaction, transportation and storage costs, as such agreements increase the parties buying power and economies of scale.

In turn, this may lead to lower prices and qualitative benefits for consumers.

Nonetheless, purchasing agreements may trigger antitrust concerns.

Joint purchasing can be carried out in different ways, such as through a jointly controlled company, a company in which many other companies hold noncontrolling stakes, a contractual arrangement or even looser forms of cooperation."
Cooley,Considerations for Companies Seeking Competitor Collaborations,"While such agreements often are considered pro-competitive, as they may lead to lower purchase prices, over the past few years we have seen intense scrutiny of purchase agreements that were considered purchase cartels.

Although less common than their sales counterparts, purchase cartels also are illegal and have resulted in significant fines.

Determining whether a purchasing agreement violates antitrust rules involves looking at the extent to which the parties market power on the purchasing and selling markets may be affected by the agreement.

Purchasing agreements restrict competition if they do not truly concern joint purchasing but instead serve as a tool to engage in a cartel.

Purchasing arrangements may restrict competition if they: Require the parties to source all or a high percentage of their purchases under the agreement.

Impose maximum purchase prices and, in doing so, distort the structure of demand in the market.

Impose ancillary restrictions (e.g., on resale).

Are not visible to the supplier and result in a de facto exclusion of competition."
Cooley,Crossing the Atlantic: Comparison of US and UK Employment Concepts,"For US companies contemplating an expansion into the UK, there are a number of employment-related factors to consider, as the requirements for employers and rights of employees differ significantly across the pond.

Below, weve provided a brief overview highlighting the differences between some of the key employment concepts in the two countries.

Employment contract US Executive or more senior level employees in the US may have an employment agreement, but most employees sign a less formal offer letter.

There is no legal significance to using one form or the other  either operates as an enforceable agreement.

Irrespective of whether you use an employment agreement or offer letter, these documents are generally limited to compensation-related terms.

As a best practice, confidentiality and intellectual property provisions, among other covenants, typically are contained in a stand-alone document without any compensation information in it.

UK All UK employees are entitled to a written contract containing basic terms, including salary, working location and hours, notice period, holiday entitlement, sickness absence entitlement and pension.

Most employers will provide a much more comprehensive employment contract with protections such as express confidentiality obligations, assignment of intellectual property and post-termination restrictions.

Generally, all contractual employment terms are contained in one document  there is no separate confidential information and invention assignment agreement (CIIAA), unlike in the US.

Confidentiality and intellectual property US

It is common and highly advisable to have employees enter into a form of a CIIAA at the outset of employment.

A properly drafted CIIAA prohibits an employees unauthorized use or disclosure of company proprietary information.

It also requires the employee to assign to the company all rights to any invention or other form of protectable idea or property related to the business of the company or developed using company resources.

A CIIAA also may include other restrictive covenants, such as noncompete and nonsolicitation provisions, to the extent allowed by federal and state law.

UK Confidential information and intellectual property protections should be set out within the employment contract.

In the absence of express contractual confidential information protections, only the most valuable and sensitive of trade secrets will be protected as a matter of law.

Generally, an employer in the UK has automatic ownership of patents, copyright, database rights, unregistered designs and registered designs in works created by its employees, but it is advisable for employers to include express intellectual property protections in the employment contract.

Noncompetition and nonsolicitation US

Some employers may require employees to enter into contractual post-termination restrictions.

This is an area highly regulated by federal and state law.

Some states allow broader restrictions, while others will take a very narrow view of whether and to what extent an employer can impose such restraints.

For example, California prohibits post-employment noncompetition provisions except in certain limited circumstances, such as the purchase of a business.

The US Federal Trade Commission also is pursuing proposed regulations that would heavily restrict the usage of noncompetition agreements under federal law.

UK Contractual post-termination restrictions are permissible if the employer can show that it has a legitimate proprietary interest that it is appropriate to protect, and that the protection sought is no more than is reasonable.

This will involve limiting the covenant, including by reference to the restricted activities themselves, the period of restraint and the geographical extent of its application.

Covenants should be tailored to each specific employee and the business in which they operate."
Cooley,Crossing the Atlantic: Comparison of US and UK Employment Concepts,"Covenants should be tailored to each specific employee and the business in which they operate.

Post-termination restrictions are generally included within the employment contract.

Notice period US Employment in the US is presumed at will unless altered by contract (which is very rare) or under state law in Montana.

This means that the employer or the employee may end employment at any time with or without cause or advance notice, for any or no reason.

However, some mass layoffs require advance notice to employees of up to 90 days.


US law also does not require that severance be paid to a separating employee.

Companies may establish a general plan or policy providing severance under certain types of terminations, and employees may independently negotiate their own severance benefits.

UK All UK employees are entitled to receive statutory minimum notice  one weeks notice during the first two years of employment and, thereafter, one weeks notice for each complete year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks notice.

However, most employees will have a notice period of at least four weeks; senior employees will often have three- to six-month notice periods.

Notice periods are usually reciprocal, meaning that the employee must give the same amount of notice as the employer is required to give.

Overtime US Unless classified as exempt under federal and state laws governing payment of wages and overtime, US employees must receive overtime pay (generally calculated as one and one-half their regular hourly rate).

Federal law requires overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a week, but state law may set more generous benefits  for example, California requires overtime for working more than eight hours in one day.

Non-exempt employees also may be legally entitled to certain other benefits, such as required meal and/or rest periods.


Managers, executives and others may qualify as exempt from these laws if their salaries meet a certain minimum amount and they engage in duties that otherwise qualify them for applicable exemptions.

This area is highly fact-sensitive and governed by federal and state law.

It also is heavily litigated and can carry significant liability.

UK There is no categorization of employees as exempt or non-exempt in the UK, but nonmanagerial employees may be paid overtime at or in excess of their normal rate of pay.

Vacation and sick time US Vacation and designated sick time ordinarily are separate categories of leave in the US.

Vacation time is not required by law, but many companies offer it as an employee benefit.

In contrast, many states and localities have or are considering adopting paid sick leave laws that would require companies to provide a minimum number of paid sick days per year.

Employers who do choose to provide vacation time to employees must comply with state laws, which may regulate the accrual, use and payment of vacation time.

Some employers combine vacation and sick time into one aggregated time-off category commonly referred to as paid time off (PTO).

In that case, the PTO bank usually must satisfy the applicable requirements for both vacation and sick time.

UK Vacation (or holiday) time and sick leave are two separate concepts in the UK, and employees are entitled to a minimum of 28 days of holiday time in each holiday year.

This can be made up of 20 days of holiday pay plus the eight usual public holidays, but it is common for employers to offer 25 days of holiday time plus the public holidays (being 33 days in total).

Subject to certain qualification criteria, all employees are entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) from day four of any period of absence due to illness or injury (there is no entitlement to SSP on the first three days of the absence).  

SSP is paid at the rate set by the government each year."
Cooley,Crossing the Atlantic: Comparison of US and UK Employment Concepts,"SSP is paid at the rate set by the government each year.

However, many employers offer to continue to pay employees their normal basic rate of pay during a specified period of sickness absence  for example, for sickness absence totaling four weeks in any rolling period of 12 months.

Commissions and bonuses US Companies are not required by law to pay commissions or bonuses in the US.

Of course, companies can offer such incentives to a range of employees.

State law often imposes certain rules around incentive compensation, including limits on the ability to claw back earned incentive compensation.

Companies may elect, or be legally required to adopt, written incentive compensation plans to set out eligibility requirements to prevent disagreements in the future.

This is another heavily litigated area, and crafting adequate incentive compensation plans in the US is critical.

UK Companies are not required by law to pay commissions or bonus, but both forms of remuneration are common in the UK.

There is a growing body of regulation affecting both private and listed companies that governs the way in which bonuses are paid and, in some cases, the quantum of bonuses.

Regulation is especially prevalent in the financial services sector, and it is important for companies to have specific incentive compensation plans in place to set out the applicable rules.

Healthcare and other benefits US Many US employers offer employees a retirement program, mostly via a 401(k) plan in which employees contribute a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis into the plan, and the company may make additional matching contributions.

Such benefits are discretionary, but a common practice.

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees who work 30 or more hours per week are required to offer those full-time employees health coverage that meets certain affordability and minimum value standards or face potential tax penalties.

States and localities may have additional healthcare coverage requirements that may apply to smaller employers.

In addition to the benefits listed above, many US employers offer a wider range of benefits including short- and long-term disability insurance, life insurance, and dental and vision insurance.

A few states, such as California, and some localities have additional required benefits that must be offered to employees (e.g., commuter benefits) or which employees may apply for (e.g., state disability or family leave benefits).

UK All employers in the UK must automatically enroll employees into a workplace pension scheme that meets certain requirements, including a minimum level of employer pension contribution.

In addition to the minimum legally required pension, many employers offer a wider range of benefits, including an enhanced company pension scheme (e.g., with an employer pension contribution of 5% of an employees salary), private medical insurance, permanent health insurance (long-term disability coverage) and life assurance (death in service).

Data protection US

Although California is the only state that currently requires a privacy notice for employees, many US companies provide employees with a privacy notice as a best practice.

The California Consumer Privacy Act includes within its scope data about employees, and employers need to provide a notice to their California employees that discloses: The categories of personal information it collects.

The sources from which the personal information is collected.

The categories of third parties to whom the business discloses personal information The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing personal information."
Cooley,Crossing the Atlantic: Comparison of US and UK Employment Concepts,"The categories of third parties to whom the business discloses personal information The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing personal information.

Employers are also required to extend to employees certain individual rights, including the right to access and request copies of their personal information, request deletion of their personal information, opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, and the right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information.

UK T he UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires all employers in the UK to inform employees which employ-related data (known as personal data) that the employers collect or hold, how that personal data is processed, the legal basis for processing, and employees rights regarding their personal data.

Employers cannot rely on employees consent as the legal basis for the processing of their personal data and its transfer outside of Europe (e.g., to the US).

Each employee instead should be provided with a stand-alone employee privacy notice that includes the legal basis for processing the employees personal data."
Cooley,US Employment Law Summary for New or Emerging Businesses and Foreign Entrants to US Employment,"Foreign companies hiring employees in the US frequently overlook some of the fundamental US employment law requirements surrounding the employment relationship.

Here you will find a general guide to some of the key US employment laws that foreign entrants into the US employment space will need to navigate.

Both federal law and many state laws prohibit discrimination in employment or employment practices (hiring, firing, rates of pay, promotions, terminations, etc.)

based, under federal law, on race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy , sexual orientation or gender identity ), age, disability, genetic information (including family medical history), citizenship and veteran status  and on other categories on a state-by-state, or even local, basis.

These laws also prohibit sexual harassment (as well as harassment based on race, religion and other protected characteristics) defined somewhat more broadly than many foreign investors may anticipate.

These laws are enforced by federal and state agencies, as well as by private actions brought by persons alleging they are victims of discrimination.

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) governs the relationship between employers and unions.

The NLRA permits employees to organize and bargain collectively with their employer.  

In general, employees may form labor unions, bargain as a unit with their employer and engage in collective activity designed to aid their collective bargaining or to organize their workplace for the first time.

Each employer must permit its employees to engage in these activities and must bargain in good faith with any union that lawfully represents its employees.

The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and state laws regulate the payment of wages, including minimum wages, overtime compensation, when wages are paid and what deductions from wages are permitted.

State laws vary widely on overtime and minimum wage exemptions, overtime eligibility rules and penalties for noncompliance with wage and hour regulations.

In the absence of an agreement or law to the contrary, employees in most US states are employed at will, which means that either the employer or the employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason or no reason (without any advance notice).  

There are numerous exceptions to the at will rule, so employers must check and comply with federal and state laws when terminating an employee.

New employers in the US must register with the federal Internal Revenue Service to obtain a federal employer identification number (EIN), which is used to report tax withholdings (income taxes, social security and Medicare) for employees.

A new employer also must register with each state in which it has employees (including remote employees) to obtain a state employer number for state tax withholding and unemployment compensation contributions.

Employee benefit plans, such as health and retirement plans, also are regulated by the IRS and are subject to significant legal requirements.

Injuries and illnesses arising out of and in the course of work are compensated through state workers compensation programs.

Most employers obtain insurance to cover this responsibility.

The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides job protection and other benefits for employees taking leave for reasons covered by the act.

Some states and individual municipalities have leave laws that provide benefits in addition to those provided by the FMLA (e.g., parental leave, sick leave, family and medical leave, voting leave and jury duty leave).

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) extends certain job protections to employees who serve in the military, as well as reemployment protections for returning veterans."
Cooley,US Employment Law Summary for New or Emerging Businesses and Foreign Entrants to US Employment,"The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) requires 60 days notice to employees of covered mass layoffs or plant closings, and several states also have enacted similar laws."
Cooley,Considerations for US Companies Contracting Abroad,"There are many reasons why your company might consider entering into contracts with counterparties in a country where you do not currently have a presence.

Perhaps you are expanding into a new geographical market, have identified a lucrative joint venture opportunity or have a project that needs to be outsourced to organizations overseas.

Whatever the rationale, there are several critical contract-related issues to consider when you contract in a new jurisdiction.

Weve outlined some of these below.

Contracting conventions Foreign countries often have different laws and conventions surrounding contracts.

For example, some countries have laws prohibiting restrictions on resellers accepting passive sales from clients in territories beyond those defined for them by contract.

Other countries have governing contractual defaults or provisions that may be read into contracts in the absence of express statements to the contrary, so you will need to ensure that contracts with counterparties in foreign countries abide by the relevant contracting requirements.

Cultural conventions and processes Cultural conventions also may affect your ability to negotiate or form a contract with counterparties abroad.

For example, in some countries (as with some companies),

No or Theres no way we can do that may be a standard negotiation strategy more than a statement of fact.

In other countries, companies actually may be constrained by governmental requirements.

Being aware of cultural conventions can help significantly as you work to form contracts globally.

IP protection It can be far more challenging to protect intellectual property once you begin to expand outside the United States.

Government-supported IP protection is territorial  and US IP laws and registrations only protect your IP rights in the US.

Once you begin selling products in a foreign country, your IP will only be protected if you have obtained protection in those foreign jurisdictions.

For example, a US patent generally will not provide patent protection in other countries.

Given this territoriality, consider taking steps to secure the available IP protection, particularly before engaging in extensive expansion or if your product would be easy to reverse-engineer.

Some countries have regimes that are less protective of the IP rights of foreign companies, or limit or restrict transfers of IP out of the country, so you will want to take those risks into account as well.

Confidentiality, security and data transfer concerns As soon as data begins to flow across borders to unaffiliated third parties, there is some loss of control regarding who can access the data and what sorts of security measures are available.

For that reason, you should take steps to ensure that data transferred across borders is limited to only the information necessary to facilitate the transaction  and you should impose other protective security measures as needed.

Foreign consumer protection laws Foreign consumer protection laws may apply to products and services offered to consumers in foreign countries, even if the contracts are governed by US law.

As these consumer protection laws can have substantial effects on your activity abroad, as well as your legal commitments, you will want to check with counsel to ensure compliance with these laws in the country where your counterparty resides.

Tax concerns While tax obligations for sales of goods and services often are straightforward for businesses that operate solely in the US, tax issues become more complicated once a business expands abroad  and associated taxes imposed can comprise a far greater percentage of the overall transaction value, unless tax treaties between the US and the applicable foreign government provide relief.

It is important to speak with a tax expert to ensure tax allocations are properly addressed."
Cooley,Considerations for US Companies Contracting Abroad,"It is important to speak with a tax expert to ensure tax allocations are properly addressed.

Export control issues Federal laws restricting the export of goods, technology and related technical data may present a challenge to those planning to contract abroad.

Sanctions for violations of these laws can be substantial, so you should speak with counsel to ensure that the export or re-export of the applicable products or services doesnt violate any export control laws.

FCPA issues The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits US citizens and entities from bribing foreign government officials to benefit their business interests.

While this may appear straightforward, companies often run into trouble with the FCPA in three ways: Theyre not aware that they are dealing with a foreign government official.

Theyre not aware that their actions may be interpreted as bribery.

Theyre not exercising adequate controls or oversight over foreign sales representations and resellers.

You should take steps to train employees and other representatives on these risks, and counsel can advise you on your approach.

Other regulatory issues Once you begin contracting across borders, you may be subject to new and different regulatory requirements, in addition to those already discussed, such as rules applying to medical devices and sensitive information.

Even if you are in compliance with US law, you will want to seek advice of counsel with respect to any differing foreign regulatory rules.

Determining governing law and venue When contracting abroad, it is particularly important that your contract defines the governing law and venue for any disputes, in order to provide a clearer path to interpretation and resolution.

However, parties often prefer their home court, which can turn these provisions into points of major contention.

Counsel can advise you on venues that provide an appropriate balance and increase chances of enforcement against a foreign counterparty.

Contracting with foreign consultants The following additional issues are key considerations when contracting with foreign consultants.

Differing IP ownership rules In addition to the concerns surrounding IP protection discussed above, differing IP ownership rules should be top of mind when contracting abroad.

For example, in some countries, assigned copyrights may revert to the original owner after a period of time, while others require that IP be assigned retroactively on a periodic basis, and not prospectively.

If the contract being entered into involves assigned IP, you should work with counsel to verify the relevant IP ownership rules in that country.

Quality control When working with foreign consultants, overseeing activities on the ground can be a substantial challenge, so you will want to take steps to ensure effective monitoring practices are in place to mitigate quality control risks.

Commitments to third parties prohibiting contractors outside the US You may be subject to regulations or restrictions that limit your ability to contract with foreign entities, pursuant to contracts other than the direct contracts with the foreign contractors.

For example, US governmental contracts, and contracts with commercial third parties in highly regulated industries, often impose such restrictions.

With respect to any particular work that you intended to outsource overseas, you should ensure that you are not prohibited (or likely to be prohibited) from utilizing foreign contractors for that work.

Diligence burden created by using foreign contractors Agreements with foreign contractors typically receive a particularly close review in investments and M&A deals.

Obtaining advice of counsel before entering into these agreements can help limit diligence issues and transactional blockers that might otherwise inhibit material opportunities."
Cooley,Considerations for US Companies Contracting Abroad,"Obtaining advice of counsel before entering into these agreements can help limit diligence issues and transactional blockers that might otherwise inhibit material opportunities.

For all these reasons, it is vital that US companies contracting in a new jurisdiction seek advice of counsel to ensure that their expansion is established and structured in a compliant and effective manner  and with a thoughtful assumption of the potential risks."
Cooley,CFPB Finalizes Rule to Monitor Small Business Lending Practices,"On March 30, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued its long-awaited small business lending rule , which requires companies issuing a wide array of commercial credit products to small businesses to begin collecting and reporting demographic and lending data to the bureau.

In remarks accompanying the release , CFPB Director Rohit Chopra highlighted research indicating that women and minority small business owners were not able to access credit during the pandemic and expressed hope that the rule will enable the government to take a data-driven approach to ensuring that the credit needs of all communities are being met.

Lenders with at least 2,500 covered originations in both 2022 and 2023 will be obligated to comply with the rule by October 1, 2024.

Slightly smaller volume lenders have until April 1, 2025, to come into compliance, and ultimately, on January 1, 2026, all lenders originating at least 100 transactions in each of the prior two years must come into compliance.

Expansive set of institutions offering variety of small business lending products will be subject to rule As a general matter, the collection and reporting obligations apply to bank and nonbank lenders taking applications and originating covered transactions.

A transaction is generally covered if it is an extension of credit to a business that had $5 million or less in gross annual revenue for its preceding fiscal year.

Thus, the rule sweeps in closed-end loans, lines of credit, business credit cards and online credit products.

The CFPB also concludes that merchant cash advance products  arrangements that are not necessarily loans but that could constitute extensions of credit under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)  are subject to the rule.

However, purchases of credit transactions are not covered by the rule, and the CFPB also has excluded factoring and leasing arrangements, among other things.

Under the rule, covered lenders will be required to compile and report information about the demographics of a small business applicants ownership, including whether the business applicant is minority-, women- or LGBTQI+-owned, as well as the ethnicity, race and sex of the applicants principal owners.

Other required application-level information includes the type of credit product offered, credit pricing, types of guarantees, loan term, credit purpose, amount of money applied for and the action taken on the application by the institution.

The collection and reporting requirement attaches to any covered application, defined as an oral or written request for a covered transaction that is made in accordance with procedures used by a financial institution for the type of credit requested.

However, the CFPB generally has excluded requests for reevaluation, extension or renewal on existing business credit accounts from data collection requirements.

CFPB will be on lookout for institutions with inadequate procedures for collecting demographic data The CFPBs rule was accompanied by a separate policy statement indicating that the bureau will focus supervisory and enforcement activities on ensuring lenders do not discourage applicants from providing responsive data  in particular, the mandated demographic data requests.

While the rule sets forth general requirements that requests for such data be prominent and easy to respond to, the CFPB notes that compliant lenders will seek to maximize the collection of responses from applicants and minimize missing or erroneous data.

To enforce compliance, the CFPB indicates that it will compare lender response rates across institutions of similar size, type, geographic reach or other factors to assess whether low response rates  such as applicants routinely indicating they do not wish to provide demographic information  indicate discouragement or failure to maintain proper collection procedures."
Cooley,CFPB Finalizes Rule to Monitor Small Business Lending Practices,"What to expect Compliance dates for the new rule may seem far away, but lenders of all sizes will be required to take significant actions to achieve compliance.

If the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  the mortgage industrys data collection and reporting corollary  is any indication, small business lenders will have to revise application and processing procedures and enhance systems of record to ensure complete and accurate collection of the required data points.

Lenders sales forces also will need significant training on data collection, and in particular, on how to ensure applicants are not being dissuaded from providing demographic information.

Accurate submission of data to the CFPB portal also will require care, with vendors likely popping up to assist in the scrubbing and formatting of data to comply with CFPB standards.

Lenders also will need to establish (or augment) fair lending compliance programs to consider the ramifications of collecting demographic and geographic data.

The CFPB will undoubtedly utilize this wealth of data, as it has done in the mortgage markets, to understand levels of service to protected class applicants, as well as levels of service to businesses located in minority communities."
Cooley,CFPB Launches Inquiry Into Data Broker Practices Ahead of Planned Rulemaking Under FCRA,"On March 15, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) launched an inquiry into the business practices of companies that collect, aggregate, sell, resell, license, or otherwise share consumers personal information with other parties  collectively called data brokers.

Noting the significant expansion of the data broker industry since enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the CFPB intends to assess whether  and likely how  entities using new business models and technologies to collect and sell consumer data may be covered by FCRA.

Comments on the CFPBs request for information (RFI), due by June 13, 2023, will inform the CFPBs planned rulemaking under FCRA, which was identified in the CFPBs fall 2022 regulatory agenda .

Overview of the RFI The RFI seeks information regarding the data broker market and consumers experiences  both positive and negative  in light of the explosion of the market.

On the market side, the CFPB is looking for information on the sources from which data brokers collect information, the type of information collected and shared, the method of collection, whether people can avoid having their information collected, controls implemented by data brokers to ensure the quality and accuracy of data collected, and the potential harms and benefits data broker practices bring to consumers.

From a consumer risk perspective, the CFPB is seeking information about data accuracy and privacy, as well as issues accessing, viewing, correcting and removing data collected by such brokers.

What to expect The CFPB has devoted substantial attention to so-called financial surveillance companies and the potential for consumer harm stemming from their collection and dissemination of consumer information.

It therefore comes as no surprise that the RFI focuses on consumer concerns over being  tracked and surveilled  by data brokers.

The CFPBs inquiry comes on the heels of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seeking public comment on commercial surveillance and data security practices.

We expect the CFPB and FTC to take a collaborative approach to the protection of consumer data and the scrutiny of companies that collect and share consumer information going forward.

The RFI also coincides with the CFPBs January 2023 issuance of market monitoring orders to data aggregators in connection with its ongoing Section 1033 rulemaking pertaining to consumer access to financial records.

Entities that engage in the collection and sharing of consumer data should monitor developments related to the CFPBs Section 1033 rulemaking, which could also be informed by responses to the RFI."
Cooley,Biden Justice Department Continues Focus on Interlocking Directorates,"The Department of Justice recently announced that five directors had resigned from four corporate boards , and one company declined to exercise board appointment rights in the face of the Antitrust Divisions stepped-up enforcement of antitrust rules against interlocking directorates.

These resignations come just months after the DOJ announced that seven directors had resigned from five company boards , signaling that the DOJ is continuing to scrutinize interlocking directorates.

The most recent actions affected companies from a variety of sectors, including software, transportation and insurance.

Private equity firms board appointment rights  with different representatives on competing firms boards  were at the center of three of the interlocks, while a fourth involved three competing IT companies sharing a common director.

Meanwhile, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee recently called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to scrutinize interlocks in the pharmaceutical industry.

DOJ actions have only resulted in resignations The DOJs recent Section 8 enforcement initiative has resulted only in voluntary board resignations, not consent agreements or civil penalties.

This has allowed the DOJ to claim success, but the actions are not precedential and have not changed the legal scope of Section 8.

The DOJ can enter into consent orders with companies  and has in the past.

It even successfully sought a court order prohibiting a company from hiring as an officer any individual who was a director of one of the interlocked corporations if, at the same time, a director of the second interlocked company was employed by the defendant.

However, Section 8 does not provide the DOJ with authority to seek civil penalties or other monetary relief, though a violation of a consent decree entered into in a Section 8 case could be enforced by the DOJ through a contempt proceeding where the DOJ could seek costs, attorneys fees and other monetary relief.

DOJ remains committed to representation theory On its face, Section 8 clearly prohibits, subject to de minimis exceptions, the same person from serving on the boards of two competitors.

But the DOJ is going further, and directors have resigned where two different individuals  associated with the same private equity or venture capital firm  serve on the boards of competing companies.

In its recent announcements, the DOJ has touted the resignations of different board members appointed by the same investment firm.

No court has found a violation of Section 8 based on this theory.

However, in Reading International, Inc. v. Oaktree Capital Management LLC , the US District Court for the Southern District of New York denied a motion to dismiss a claim where an investment firm owned minority positions in competing movie theater groups.

Importantly, however, the court held that the plaintiffs would need to show more than common employment by the investment firm.

They would need to demonstrate that their service on the boards is not in their individual capacities but as puppets or instrumentalities of the corporations will, such that it can legitimately be said that the investment firm  not the individuals as separate persons  sits on the two boards.

The courts analysis leaves room to argue that different individuals serving on boards are not engaged in the type of coordination that Section 8 is designed to prohibit  especially if they have adopted measures to prevent the exchange of competitively sensitive information.

When are corporations considered competitors for purposes of Section8?

The language of Section 8 prohibits an officer or director of one corporation from serving as an officer or director of another corporation if they are by virtue of their business and location of operation, competitors, so that the elimination of competition by agreement between them would constitute a violation of any of the antitrust laws."
Cooley,Biden Justice Department Continues Focus on Interlocking Directorates,"This leaves open the question of whether an agreement between the two corporations would constitute an antitrust violation.

Securities disclosures In its recent enforcement push, the DOJ has relied in large part on corporations Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings to identify competing corporations.

In most of the resignations announced by the Biden DOJ, at least one of the companies identified the other as a competitor in its SEC filings.

Merger investigations Some of the recent actions appear to have arisen from merger investigations, where a company likely identified the other firm as a competitor in internal documents submitted with a merger filing.

Horizontal relationship Courts have typically required interlocks to be between companies in the same line of business at the same stage of production.

Involvement in different aspects of the same industry has not been sufficient to establish the competitive relationship for a Section 8 interlock.

For example, one court found that an agent for producers of television programming was not in competition with the producer-owners of the programming because only the latter had the authority to make pricing decisions.

The companies could not fix prices or allocate markets as required by the statute.

Seeking to sell similar products to same customers Courts have looked to the market definition analyses to see if companies have common sales in the same product and geographic market.

Thus, courts have questioned whether two products can be said to compete because they are reasonably interchangeable with respect to the uses to which they can be put and whether two products are competitive because there is a high elasticity of demand on the part of customers.

Other courts, however, have said that relying on interchangeability of use and cross-elasticity of demand may be too restrictive, especially [i]n a developing industry in which product variation is just beginning and customer needs are not yet standardized.

Thus, courts also have relied on evidence that companies sought to sell similar products to the same prospective customers.

Section 8 has not been applied to potential competitors In a report on interlocking directorates , the FTC in fact stated that Section 8 leaves unchallenged interlocking directorates between corporations, both large and small, that have not been competitors in the past but might become so in the future.

Courts have followed this guidance, reasoning that a corporations plans or intentions to engage in the production of [the relevant product] d[id] not  make it a competitor  within the meaning of Section 8, and therefore Section 8 is not violated by [the directors] membership on the boards of both companies.

Statutory de minimis exemptions Even if companies are competitors, Section 8 does not condemn all interlocks.

The FTC adjusts de minimis thresholds annually, and it did so earlier this year.

Now, both corporations net assets must exceed $45.257 million.

Further, the competitive sales of the companies must exceed $4.5257 million in each firms last fiscal year.

Cooley,Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument on Legal Standard for Patent Enablement,"On March 27, 2023, the US Supreme Court heard oral argument in Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi , a case that asks it to clarify how much information a patent applicant must include in its patent application to satisfy the statutory requirement under 35 USC  112 that a patent must enable those skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention.

Amgen asked the Supreme Court to overturn lower court precedents holding that an enabling disclosure must allow those skilled in the art to reach the full scope of claimed embodiments  that is, to cumulatively identify and make all or nearly all variations of the invention  without substantial time and effort.

This undue experimentation standard has resulted in the invalidation of many patents that contain genus claims that cover many species (especially in the context of antibody patents) and was the rationale for invalidating Amgens patents in the lower courts.

The case attracted significant attention, with several friend of the court briefs filed on each side from industry groups, large pharmaceutical companies and Nobel laureates.

Many are watching the case to determine whether the Supreme Court appears likely to change the long-standing full scope standard to the seemingly more permissive make and use standard that Amgen argued for in its briefing and in the lower courts.

At oral argument, however, it appeared that the parties all agreed that  112 law required patentees to enable the full scope of the claims.

Because of this, several justices questioned whether the case was a proper vehicle for Supreme Court review.

Advocates for both sides, and the government, suggested any opinion that might issue from the Supreme Court should clarify the law around enablement.

Based on the questioning, it appears unlikely that the Supreme Courts decision will announce a radical shift in enablement law, as some had predicted.

Although all parties apparently agreed that the law should require a patent applicant to enable the full scope of patent claims, they disagreed strongly over what that means.

According to Amgen, it was enough in this case to disclose 26 antibodies covered by the claims, along with a description of the trial-and-error process that Amgen scientists followed as a road map, notwithstanding evidence that millions of potential antibodies are covered by its patent.

By contrast, the respondents and the government insisted that under existing law, a genus patent claim is not enabled unless every species covered by the claim is described in the patent, or the patent describes the genus by sufficient structural details that are shared by every species in the genus  in keeping with long-standing precedent from the Federal Circuit.

Amgens take on the full scope standard proposed a more relaxed analysis that considers whether a patent reasonably enables a skilled artisan to make and use the embodiments that fall within the scope of its claims.

Under this interpretation, according to Amgen, a patent would have an enabling disclosure so long as it provides enough disclosure for those skilled in the art to make and use all of the embodiments covered by the claimed invention that matter (that is, without regard to outlier embodiments).

In practice, this means a patent claim would be enabled if the patent included enough detail to make and use at least some embodiments of the claimed invention, unless an accused infringer could identify a particular undisclosed embodiment that the patent did not teach how to make and use and show why that embodiment mattered for achieving the purpose of the invention.

Amgen urged that its proposed standard is necessary to preserve incentives for drug companies to invest billions of dollars in new drug development because it would allow discoveries to be broadly protected with patent claims that are difficult to design around with minor modifications."
Cooley,Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument on Legal Standard for Patent Enablement,"Sanofi, Regeneron and the government argued that existing law appropriately requires patent applicants who claim a lot, to enable a lot, and that the Supreme Court should not dispense with the full scope and undue experimentation tests because they are informative and useful.

The respondents and government disagreed that genus claim patent protection, at least when it takes the form of broad functional claims like Amgens, is essential to the pharmaceutical industry and asserted that broad genus claims inhibit (rather than advance) progress in the life sciences by preventing healthy competition that can result in the discovery of drugs that are more effective than the first drug to obtain a patent.

The Supreme Court will likely decide this appeal within the next few months."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – March One-Minute Reads,"Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange propose clawback rules As previously published in this client alert on the final clawback rule and this PubCo post on compensation clawbacks , the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Rule 10D-1 in October 2022 to require securities exchanges to establish listing standards to obligate public companies to develop and implement a clawback policy providing for the recovery of incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers in the event a company is required to prepare an accounting restatement.

In response, the NYSE and Nasdaq have released proposed listing standards.

The NYSE proposal would add new section 303A.14 to the Listed Company Manual, which sets forth requirements for the recovery policy, including the triggering restatements, executive officers covered, incentive-based compensation covered and other pertinent provisions, all designed to closely conform to the applicable language of Rule 10D-1.

Section 303A.14 also specifies the following implementation timeline: The recovery policy prescribed by the section must be adopted no later than 60 days from the effective date of the listing standard.

Companies must comply with the recovery policy for all incentive-based compensation received on or after the effective date resulting from financial reporting measures based on financial information from a fiscal period ending on or after the effective date.

Companies must provide the required disclosures in the      applicable SEC filings on or after the effective date.

The NYSE proposal also would add Section 802.01F, which specifies that if the NYSE determines that a listed issuer is noncompliant with any of the provisions of Section 303A.14, trading in all listed securities of the company would immediately be suspended and delisting procedures would immediately commence.

The NYSE will determine whether the steps a company is taking constitute compliance with its policy, and a separate process would apply for companies that fail to timely adopt the required recovery policy.

Similarly, the Nasdaq proposal would add new Listing Rule 5608, which also sets forth the requirements for a recovery policy and is designed to conform closely to the applicable language of Rule 10D-1.

In addition, Listing Rule 5608 provides for the same implementation timeline as the NYSE proposal, except that companies would be required to apply the recovery policy to incentive-based compensation received on or after the effective date, regardless of the financial reporting measure it is based on.

A company would be subject to delisting under Nasdaqs proposal if it does not adopt a compliant compensation recovery policy, disclose said policy in accordance with SEC rules or comply with its recovery provisions as contemplated by Rule 10D-1.

Nasdaq will determine whether the steps a company is taking constitute compliance.

Companies that fail to comply must submit a plan to regain compliance, with the administrative process resembling other corporate governance deficiencies under the Nasdaq listing standards.

As a reminder, these listing standards must be effective no later than November 28, 2023.

Comments on each notice of proposed rule change will be due 21 days from publication of the applicable notice in the Federal Register.

Corp Fin issues C&DIs on pay-versus-performance rules On February 10, 2023, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance posted 15 new Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DIs) addressing issues arising under the final pay-versus-performance rules , which require most public companies to provide a table and accompanying disclosure comparing executive compensation actually paid against specified measures of company financial performance.

The new C&DIs can be found under the caption for Reg S-K, Item 402(v)."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – March One-Minute Reads,"The new C&DIs can be found under the caption for Reg S-K, Item 402(v).

Among other topics, the C&DIs address questions regarding: The calculations for equity award and pension value adjustments to get to compensation actually paid.

The fiscal years to be covered by the footnote disclosure.

The calculation of peer group total shareholder return.

Whether the company-selected measure can be derived from net income or total shareholder return.

The use of stock price as a company-selected measure.

How to determine whether a company uses a financial performance measure for compensation decisions when it utilizes a bonus pool.

Notably, in one C&DI the staff confirmed that Item 402(v) disclosure does not need to be included in Form 10-K, despite Item 11 of Form 10-K indicating that the information is required under Item 402.

SEC adopts final rules to move standard settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1

On February 15, 2023, the SEC announced it had adopted final rules to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most securities transactions from two business days (T+2) to one business day (T+1) after the trade date.

The SEC also shortened the standard settlement cycle for firm commitment public offerings priced after 4:30 pm from four business days (T+4) to two (T+2).

These final rules also include requirements relating to the processing of institutional trades.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the adoption of these amendments addresses one of the four areas the staff recommended the Commission address in response to the meme stock events of 2021.

Notably, the SEC indicated it continues to consider the feasibility of moving to a T+0 settlement (i.e., settlement by the end of the trade day).

The rules will become effective 60 days after being published in the Federal Register, with a compliance date of May 28, 2024.

Climate disclosure starter guide Persefoni and the Society for Corporate Governance recently published a practical resource titled Climate Disclosure Starter Guide: Measuring, Managing, and Reporting Scope 1,2, and 3 Emissions , aiming to help companies understand the complicated and complex workstreams of climate management.

While it doesnt provide an in-depth solution for all companies, the guide provides a general understanding of the steps companies should take when calculating and reporting a carbon footprint and building a climate strategy.

The five primary steps explored are: Establishing organizational boundaries and a governance strategy.

Identifying emissions sources and collecting data.

Aligning with the relevant standards.

Creating a climate strategy.

Reporting a companys carbon footprint.

The guide may be of particular use to companies beginning their climate reporting and strategy journey, as it also includes definitions and explanations for key climate terms and concepts and summarizes the different standards to be aware of.

SEC continues focus on non-GAAP measures On February 28, 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported on a series of recent comments letters from the SEC focused on the presentation of non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) metrics."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – March One-Minute Reads,"Per the WSJ, 20 companies were questioned in January and February 2023 about their compliance with Question 100.04, one of the C&DIs updated in December 2022 , when it was expanded to more generally state that a non-GAAP measure can violate Regulation G and be misleading if the recognition and measurement principles used to calculate the measure are inconsistent with GAAP.

The updates also included the addition of illustrative examples of adjustments the staff may consider to be misleading.

The WSJ expects the number of companies to be questioned about their use of non-GAAP measures to increase in the coming months, given the SECs apparent focus.

See this December 2022 PubCo post on the new non-GAAP C&DIs for more information on the C&DI updates.

SEC climate-related comments In February 2023, MyLogIQ published its findings from an analysis of 620 climate change-related comments in SEC comment letters to Forms 10-K and 20-F from July 2021 to January 2023 (covering 76 public companies).

The report found 11 climate-related reporting themes that the SEC is focused on: Consistency between environmental, social and governance/corporate social responsibility reports and SEC filings.

Material effects on transition risks.

Material litigation risks.

Capital expenditures on climate-related initiatives.

Indirect consequences on business trends.

Physical impacts on operations and cost of insurance.

Compliance costs.

Pending legislation and regulation.

Purchase of carbon credits.

The board and its role in climate disclosures.

Reputational risk.

The report includes examples of comments for each theme and shows the frequency with which they are mentioned, with comments most commonly addressing the physical effects/cost of insurance (18%), transition risks (16%) and compliance costs (15%).

Finally, the report includes three takeaways for companies from the analysis: Be prepared to discuss the physical effects of climate change on the companys operations and cost of insurance.

Synchronize the content of publicly posted reports with SEC filings.

Management discussion and analysis and risk factor disclosure received the most comments."
Cooley,[Video] Trends in ESG,"Listen in as Cooley partner Beth Sasfai, who leads Cooleys ESG & sustainability advisory practice, discusses her experience in the environmental, social and governance space, as well as forward-looking trends for 2023, with public companies practice co-chair Jason Kent.

Key Takeaways Public companies need to be focused on regulatory actions coming down the pipeline in 2023, including the much-anticipated Securities and Exchange Commission climate rules, in addition to cybersecurity, board diversity and human capital rules.

Even more extensive rulemakings are happening in the European Union, which are likely to result in additional ESG disclosure obligations for companies in their supply chains, whether or not they are directly covered by the rules.

Boards and companies need to give thought to their engagement programs and public statements as shareholder engagement and media campaigns related to ESG continue to ramp up.

Public companies should expect increased enforcement activity at the SEC and Federal Trade Commission, as well as class action lawsuits, focused on the use of specific ESG-related words and claims of greenwashing.

Private companies can benefit from early thinking about their ESG strategy, as their customers, employees and investors are demanding more and more transparency surrounding ESG, including with codes of conduct, supply chains and emissions.

Employees are also increasingly expecting companies to speak up about their commitment to certain values.

Cooley,CFPB Issues Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Credit Card Late Fees,"On February 1, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the provisions in Regulation Z governing credit card late fee charges permitted under Regulation Z, 1 which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).

2

Specifically, the CFPB indicated that the proposed rule would: Adjust the safe harbor dollar amount for late fees to $8 and eliminate a higher safe harbor dollar amount for late fees for subsequent violations of the same type.

Limit a credit card issuers ability to implement annual inflation adjustments for the safe harbor dollar amounts in connection with the late fee safe harbor amount.

Require that late fee amounts not exceed 25% of the required minimum payment.

According to the CFPB and remarks issued by Director Rohit Chopra , the CFPB professes that the proposed rule would better ensure that credit card penalty fees are reasonable and proportional to the late payment as required under TILA and would ensure that the credit card market is fair and competitive.

Chopra also indicated that the CFPB projects that the proposed rule would reduce credit card late fees paid by Americans by $9 billion each year.

Significantly, the proposed rule was immediately endorsed by the White House as a key part of the Biden-Harris administration as one that will slash excessive credit card fees.

The CFPB is requesting public comment on several aspects of the proposed rule, including the $8 safe harbor provision and whether the safe harbor provision should be eliminated altogether, the ban on automatic inflation adjustment for late fee amounts, the proposed capped late fee percentage, whether the proposed changes should be applied to all credit card penalty fees, whether consumers should be granted a courtesy period before late fees can be assessed, and whether issuers should be required to offer autopay in order to make use of the safe harbor provision.

Interested parties may submit comments to the proposed rule through the Federal eRulemaking Portal , by email or via direct mail.

Comments on the proposed rule should be submitted on or before April 3, 2023.

Background In May 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act was signed into law, and it primarily amended TILA and instituted new substantive and disclosure requirements to establish fair and transparent practices for open-end consumer credit plans (i.e., credit cards).

The Credit CARD Act, in part, required penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional to the applicable omission or violation.

At the time, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was responsible for promulgating rules to implement the Credit CARD Act and issued a final rule on June 29, 2010, as part of Regulation Z.

The final rule included a safe harbor provision for credit card penalty fee amounts and enabled annual fee increases for inflation.

Drawing on data from a March 2022 report , the CFPB suggested that penalty fees have increased over time, surging to as much as $41 for a missed payment in recent years.

The CFPB further indicated that such penalties amount to $12 billion per year in late fees, and it has estimated that $9 billion of those late fees are not associated with collection costs that companies incur for late payment violations.

Given the issues raised by the report, on June 22, 2022, the CFPB issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information from credit card issuers, consumer groups and the public regarding credit card late fees and late payments, and card issuers revenue and expenses.

In light of the CFPBs research report and advance notice of proposed rulemaking, on February 1, 2023, the CFPB announced its notice of proposed rulemaking to address such penalty and late fees.

The proposed rule The CFPB invites comments on several aspects of the proposed rule, as outlined below."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Credit Card Late Fees,"The proposed rule The CFPB invites comments on several aspects of the proposed rule, as outlined below.

Lowering safe harbor dollar amount for late fees from up to $41 to $8 Currently, under Regulation Z and its commentary, a card issuer may not impose a penalty fee for violating the terms of a credit card account (e.g., late fees, over-the-limit fees and insufficient funds fees) unless the issuer has determined that the amount of the fee is a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the issuer for that type of violation or complies with a safe harbor provision.

According to Regulation Z, the safe harbor for credit card issuers to impose such penalty fees is $30 for the first violation and $41 thereafter for a violation of the same type.

Card issuers may charge these fees without running afoul of the reasonable and proportionate fee requirement set forth in TILA.

The proposed rule would lower this safe harbor provision threshold solely for late payment fees from up to $41 to $8 for initial and all other subsequent violations.

The CFPB preliminarily found that card issuers generate late fee income exceeding associated collection costs by a factor of five.

Because the safe harbor provision currently allows issuers to charge late fees of up to $41, the CFPB indicated that it believes that a late fee of $8 would be sufficient for most issuers to cover collection costs incurred as a result of late payments.

However, the CFPB also noted in the proposed rule that several industry trade groups have asserted that although the current $41 safe harbor amount does not cover all the costs associated with late payments and is not as effective a deterrent as higher fees would be, the amount covers a significant portion of issuer costs and deters late payments.

The proposed rule would allow card issuers to charge above the $8 safe harbor as long as they can prove that the higher fee is necessary to cover their incurred collection costs.

Further, irrespective of the safe harbor provisions, card issuers still may charge 3% of the delinquent balance on a charge card account that requires payment of outstanding balances under Regulation Z.

Under the proposed rule, if finalized, card issuers still would be able to charge for other penalty fees, such as over-the-limit and returned payment fees.

Eliminating automatic annual inflation adjustment The CFPBs proposal would eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment for the safe harbor amount.

According to the CFPB, this adjustment is not required by law, nor is it necessarily reflective of how collection costs change over time.

The CFPB instead would monitor market conditions and the safe harbor provision amount for potential adjustments as necessary.

Banning late fees in excess of 25% of required minimum payment Currently, Regulation Z allows a card issuer to potentially charge a late fee that is 100% of the required minimum payment owed by the cardholder.

The proposed rule would restrict any late fee charge to 25% of the required minimum payment.

This change would only affect late payment fees and would not necessarily apply to all penalty fees that a card issuer may impose for violating the terms of a credit card account.

Further, the 25% cap would apply even if the safe harbor provision would otherwise permit a higher late fee.

In other words, if 25% of the minimum payment would equate to less than $8, the card issuer would only be able to charge 25% of the minimum payment despite the card issuer being able to charge an $8 late payment fee under the safe harbor.

Other requests for comment In the proposed rule, the CFPB also requests comment on the following elements.

Applicability to other penalty fees As written, the proposed rule only applies to late fees, although the current applicable fee-related provisions of Regulation Z apply to all penalty fees for violation of credit card terms."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Credit Card Late Fees,"The CFPB is requesting comment on whether it should expand the rule to apply to other penalty fees outside of late or missed payment fees.

Effective date In the proposed rule, the CFPB indicates that the final rule, if adopted, would take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

The CFPB is requesting comment on whether it should extend this effective date and when compliance with the proposed changes should be mandatory.

The CFPB further requests comment on whether an October 1 effective date mandated by TILA section 105(d) in connection with disclosure-related changes should be applicable to certain of the proposed changes.

Specifically, the CFPB states the following in the proposed rule: Separately, under TILA section 105(d), Bureau regulations requiring any disclosure which differs from disclosures previously required by part A, part D, or part E shall have an effective date of October 1 which follows by at least six months the date of promulgation subject to certain exceptions.

To the extent that TILA section 105(d) may apply to any proposed changes requiring disclosures, it would not necessitate the October 1 effective date for purposes of the late fee disclosure for two reasons.

First, under Regulation Z, card issuers are currently required to disclose the late fees amounts, or maximum late fees amounts, as applicable, that apply to credit card accounts in certain disclosures, and the disclosure of those late fee amounts must reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.

In other words, this proposal, if finalized, would not differ from the current requirement to disclose late fee amounts; instead, it would solely result in a change to the amount of the late fee disclosed for issuers using the safe harbor.

Second, this change in amount applies to the safe harbor, which is an amount that card issuers may elect but are not required to use.

If the Bureau were to finalize the 15-day courtesy period on which the Bureau solicits comments as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of  1026.52(b)(2)(i), consistent with TILA section 105(d), the Bureau solicits comment as to whether that courtesy period and potential disclosure language should have an effective date of October 1 which follows by at least six months the date of promulgation.

Courtesy period requirement While many card issuers currently provide consumers with a chance to avoid interest and late fees for a period of time after the disclosed due date, Regulation Z does not require card issuers to do so.

In public comments to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the CFPB received comments from consumer group commenters indicating that the CFPB should prohibit the assessment of a late fee without first providing consumers a period of time after each due date to make the required payment (i.e., a courtesy period).

Taking these comments into consideration, the CFPB is asking for comments on whether to require a 15-day courtesy period as part of the final rule and whether the length of this proposed courtesy period is sufficient.

Autopay requirement In addition to general comments on the $8 safe harbor provision, the CFPB also seeks comment on whether, as a condition of using the safe harbor for late fees, it would be appropriate to require card issuers to offer automatic payment options (such as for the minimum payment amount), or to provide notification of the payment due date within a certain number of days prior to the due date, or both.

Cost analysis While primarily addressing late payment fees, the rulemaking also clarifies that with respect to all penalty fees, the cost analysis for determining whether a fee is reasonable should not include any collection costs that are incurred after an account is charged off pursuant to loan loss provisions.

Smaller issuers The proposed rule also requests comment on whether the safe harbor amount may need to be adjusted for smaller issuers."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Credit Card Late Fees,"Smaller issuers The proposed rule also requests comment on whether the safe harbor amount may need to be adjusted for smaller issuers.

Specifically, the CFPB solicits comments on whether the collection costs for smaller issuers may differ from the costs to larger issuers and, if so, how.

Looking forward In addition to the CFPBs inquiry into late payment fees, there has been general increased attention on credit card transactions and disclosures.

For instance, the Credit Card Competition Act of 2022 was introduced in July 2022 by the Senate and later in September 2022 by the House of Representatives that proposed to expand the multiple payment network routing requirements that currently apply to debit cards to credit cards for issuers with assets of more than $100 billion.

Additionally, the bill proposed to prohibit credit card issuers from imposing certain limitations on the routing of electronic credit transactions, such as through penalties for failure to meet a specified threshold of transactions on a particular payment card network.

While the bill has not been passed by either chamber of Congress, its introduction signals that Congress is paying closer attention to credit card transactions generally.

The proposed rulemaking is an extension of the ongoing supervisory and examination emphasis on junk fees.

For example, in July 2021, President Joe Biden launched an effort to promote competition in the American economy, tasking federal agencies with looking for ways that competition is undermined, for example, in connection with surprise and opaque fees or junk fees.

As part of this effort, the CFPB identified junk fees as an area of concern for consumers , citing late fees, overdraft fees, nonsufficient fund fees and bounced check fees.

While the CFPB continues to publish reports and information in this space, it also continues to push its enforcement agenda outside of the rulemaking process, bringing enforcement actions and issuing supervisory findings, including in the credit card space, alleging such fees are unfair.

The CFPB also has signaled that it intends to examine and investigate such fees under a theory of unfair discrimination.

What does this mean for you?

In light of the proposed rule, covered entities may wish to assess their late fees, considering whether to implement the $8 safe harbor or to utilize a cost analysis by gathering and documenting data to support imposing late fees that exceed $8.

In addition, card issuers may need to establish policies and procedures to cap late fees at 25% of the minimum payment of a credit card.

While the proposed rule, if finalized, may change the maximum amount that covered entities may charge for late fees, it also would affect TILA credit card disclosures required under Regulation Z.

As a result, covered entities should begin identifying any disclosures that may be impacted by the proposed rule  including advertising disclosures, account-opening disclosures, periodic statements and renewal notices  and start to determine the changes that may need to be made pursuant to any final rule.

The supplemental information accompanying the proposed rule provides a list of model disclosures in Regulation Z that may be affected.

Covered entities also should consider how they would notify consumers and credit card holders of any changes to late fees, if applicable.

Lastly, entities should keep in mind that the enforcement risk in this space remains real, even while the rule is pending, in light of the more general unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices approach the regulators are taking.

This means understanding the assessment of fees, disclosure of those fees (and omissions of other payment methods) and the value inherent in such fees.

Cooley,"Support Announced for R&D-Intensive SMEs in UK’s Spring Budget 2023, Other Changes to R&D Tax Relief Regime","In recognition of the need to support the UKs most innovative businesses, an additional tax relief for research and development-intensive small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was recently announced in the Spring Budget 2023 , partially counteracting reforms decreasing the SME R&D tax relief rates that were announced in the Autumn Statement 2022 .

Additionally, the previously announced reform with respect to the new territorial restrictions intended to refocus R&D relief toward activities undertaken in the UK will be postponed, and there are changes to certain filing requirements.

The changes that were previously announced, which included a decrease in the SME R&D enhanced deduction and credit rate, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2023, were discussed in our January 2023 client alert on significant changes to the R&D tax regime , published following the Autumn Statement 2022.

The changes announced in the Spring Budget 2023, which come as welcome news to early-stage companies focused on innovation, including those in the life sciences sector, are discussed below.

Targeted relief for R&D-intensive SMEs After engagement with industry, the government acknowledged in the Spring Budget 2023 that the reductions to the rates of the reliefs available for SMEs under the R&D tax relief regime announced in the Autumn Statement 2022 have created challenges for some R&D-intensive SMEs.

In recognition of this, as well as the value of R&D-intensive SMEs to the UKs wider innovation ecosystem and the difficulties suchSMEsface when raising capital, the government announced that loss-making SMEs whose qualifying R&D expenditure incurred after 1 April 2023 is at least 40% of total annual expenditure  and that therefore qualify as R&D-intensive  will be entitled to the R&D credit rate of 14.5% (rather than the reduced credit rate of 10% announced in the Autumn Statement 2022).

However, the enhanced deduction available to such SMEs will be the previously announced rate of 86% (which is less generous than the rate for pre-April 2023 expenditure).

The effect of the changes is that R&D-intensive SMEs will be entitled to an R&D credit equal to 26.97% of amounts incurred on qualifying R&D, rather than 18.6%, which will apply to SMEs that do not qualify as R&D-intensive.

Therefore, some funding support for loss-making R&D-intensive SMEs will be lost from April, but the reduction is much less than was feared.

The previously announced increases to the rates of the above-the-lineR&D expenditure credit (RDEC), primarily targeted at larger companies, will remain the same.

The broad net effect following all of the announced rate changes is summarized in the table below.

Pre-April 2023 From April 2023 Loss-making R&D-intensive SME Enhanced deduction: 130% R&D credit: 14.5% Benefit: 33.35% Enhanced deduction: 86% R&D credit: 14.5% Benefit: 26.97% Other loss-making SME Enhanced   deduction: 130% R&D credit: 14.5% Benefit: 33.35% Enhanced   deduction: 86% R&D credit: 10% Benefit: 18.6% Profit-making SME Enhanced deduction: 130% Corporation tax rate: 19% Benefit: up to 24.7% Enhanced deduction: 86% Corporation tax rate: 25% Benefit: up to 21.5% RDEC company RDEC credit rate: 13% Corporation tax rate: 19% Benefit (after tax): 10.53% RDEC credit rate: 20% Corporation tax rate: 25% Benefit (after tax): 15% As these changes will be legislated after 1 April 2023, R&D-intensive SMEs can either claim any payable credit at the new 10% rate applying from 1 April 2023 and subsequently amend their corporation returns to claim the higher rate, or they can delay making their claim until the legislation is introduced (the government intends to introduce the legislation in Finance Bill 2023  24)."
Cooley,"Support Announced for R&D-Intensive SMEs in UK’s Spring Budget 2023, Other Changes to R&D Tax Relief Regime","Postponement of overseas expenditure restrictions and changes to certain filing requirements The new territorial conditions restricting R&D relief in respect of some overseas expenditure (discussed in our previous alert) will now come into effect from 1 April 2024, a year later than had been planned, to allow the government to consider the interaction between this restriction and the design of a single UK R&D regime (see below).

This may be seen as good news for some businesses, but its late announcement has left little time for planning.

The requirement to file an additional information form, providing information such as the breakdown of costs across qualifying categories and a description of the R&D, has been brought forward and will now apply to claims submitted on or after 1 August 2023 (instead of claims submitted for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023).

Possible merging of the RDEC and SME schemes The government will continue to consider the possible merging of the RDEC and SME schemes into a single scheme and will publish a summary of responses to the recent government consultation and draft legislation in July 2023.

It has committed to a more collaborative approach with impacted industries than it did in the lead-up to the changes announced in the Autumn Statement 2022, which should ensure a more informed approach is taken to any future changes."

These changes to the EMI scheme will take effect automatically from 6 April 2023:

The requirement for a company to set out details of share restrictions within the option agreement will be removed.

The requirement for employees to sign a working time declaration will be removed.

EMI FAQ 1.

My company has previously granted EMI options.

Do I need to do anything?

These changes will take effect automatically from 6 April 2023, and you do not need to revise your existing EMI plans to benefit from these changes.

2.

Do the new rules apply to unexercised EMI options granted prior to 6 April 2023?

Yes.

The removal of the requirements to set out details of share restrictions within the option agreement and for employees to sign a working time declaration is retrospective, and it will benefit options granted prior to 6 April 2023 but exercised on or after 6 April 2023.

3.

Do EMI option holders still have to meet the working time requirements?

Yes.

It is just the requirement to actually sign a working time declaration that is being removed.

Three different employee descriptions can satisfy the statutory working time requirements to receive EMI options: Employees who are required to spend, on average, at least 25 hours a week on the business of the EMI company (or if the EMI company is a parent company, the business of the group), regardless of any other economic activity they also undertake.

Employees who are required to spend, on average, less than 25 hours a week on the business of the EMI company (or if the EMI company is a parent company, the business of the group), if employment with such company or group makes up on average at least 75% of the employees working time if they also are self-employed or work elsewhere.

Employees who haveno otherremunerative employment or self-employment, no matter how little time they are required to spend per week on the business of the company.

4. Is the time to notify HM Revenue & Customs of the grant of EMI options also changing?

Not yet.

From 6 April 2024, the deadline for a company to notify HMRC of the grant of an EMI option will be extended from 92 days from the grant to the 6 July following the end of the tax year in which the EMI option was granted.

This will be covered in separate, future legislation.

CSOP changes from 6 April 2023 These Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) changes also will take effect automatically from 6 April 2023 :

The per-person share options limit will increase from 30,000 to 60,000.

Share class restrictions (i.e., shares included in a CSOP plan must be from a share class that is worth having, by being either open market shares or employee-control shares) will be removed.

CSOP FAQ 1.

My company has more than one class of shares.

Can we now grant CSOP options?

CSOP options are a tax-efficient alternative if a company is too big to satisfy the EMI qualification conditions.

Previously, private companies with more than one class of shares, and particularly venture-backed companies with a preference stack, found it difficult to meet either the employee-control or open market test regarding the class of shares to be placed under CSOP options.

As such, many companies with more than one class of shares couldnt grant CSOP options even if they met the other CSOP qualifying conditions.

The removal of these share class restrictions will make it much easier for companies with more than one class of shares to qualify to grant CSOP options from 6 April 2023.

2.

My company has previously granted CSOP options.

Do I need to do anything?

These changes will take effect automatically from 6 April 2023.

You do not need to revise your existing CSOP plans to benefit from these changes.

3."
Cooley,April 2023 Brings Enterprise Management Incentive and Company Share Option Plan Changes,"Do I need to do anything?

These changes will take effect automatically from 6 April 2023.

You do not need to revise your existing CSOP plans to benefit from these changes.

3.

Do the new rules apply to unexercised CSOP options granted prior to 6 April 2023?

Yes.

Unexercised CSOP options granted prior to 6 April 2023  assuming they were qualifying CSOP options based on the rules in place at the time of grant  will benefit from these changes.

4. Will replacement CSOP options granted on a company reorganisation benefit from the new rules?

Yes.

HMRC confirmed that the new rules will provide that, in the event of an exchange of CSOP options on a company reorganisation, the share class restrictions will no longer apply when determining whether the new options can be regarded as equivalent to the old options.

5.

We are planning to submit a CSOP share valuation request to HMRC.

Should we wait until 6 April 2023?

HMRC asks that companies or their agents to not submit valuation requests for shares under the new CSOP rules any earlier than 23 March 2023.

You will need to tell HMRC if the companys circumstances change between submitting the valuation request and 6 April 2023.

Cooley,"DOJ Issues Further Guidance, Warnings on Ephemeral Messaging Apps","At the March 2023 American Bar Association National Institute on White Collar Crime, senior Department of Justice officials offered their most expansive guidance yet about the dangers of using ephemeral messaging for company communications.

Officials noted that when conducting an investigation , DOJ prosecutors will consider a companys use of ephemeral and encrypted applications, whether the company preserved those communications, and if those messages are accessible for the investigation, as well as company policies governing such apps.

And they warned in no uncertain terms that if a company does not turn over these types of communications,  prosecutors will not accept that at face value .

Where a company fails to produce such communications, prosecutors will further scrutinize the companys ability to access those communications and how they are stored, among other things.

Officials made clear that [a] companys answers  or lack of answers  may very well affect the offer it receives to resolve criminal liability.

The DOJs most recent comments follow a memorandum from September 2022 recommending that companies institute compensation clawback measures to ensure employees adhere to corporate compliance policies, including policies governing employee use of personal devices and third-party messaging apps such as Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.

The memo noted that corporations with robust compliance should have these types of device and messaging policies, provide training to employees on them, and enforce the policies when violations are identified.

It also cautioned that [h]ow companies address the use of personal devices and third-party messaging platforms can impact a prosecutors evaluation of the effectiveness of a corporations compliance program, as well as the assessment of a corporations cooperation during a criminal investigation.

Additional DOJ guidance provided in December 2022 zeroed in on encrypted and ephemeral messaging apps , observing that while there may be legitimate uses for those tools for company business, they can present significant challenges to a companys ability to ensure it has a well-functioning compliance program, and more importantly, the ability to access those communications when required.

The DOJs guidance on messaging apps comes against the backdrop of a renewed focus on corporate enforcement and vigilance against corporate malfeasance.

As early as 2017, the DOJs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement division had published guidance that organizations being investigated for FCPA violations could obtain a cooperation credit only if they disallowed the use of ephemeral messaging by employees.

However, noting that many organizations use ephemeral messaging for legitimate business reasons, it later softened its stance, instead requiring organizations using ephemeral apps to have safeguards to ensure information is retained pursuant to retention policies and legal requirements.

What is ephemeral messaging?

Ephemeral messaging apps are communication platforms that automatically erase the conversation between parties immediately or after a short amount of time.

Automatic deletion can be the applications default or a feature that users or administrators can turn on and off.

While ephemeral messaging has several real-world benefits, including privacy and security, it can be problematic for businesses that need to preserve information for regulatory, compliance, litigation or legal holds, or other reasons.

Similar communication mediums such as text messages, in-application chat features and direct messages in social media accounts can prove equally problematic due to their decentralized nature, with the messages often residing on users devices or accounts beyond the reach of company controls.

Other issues can arise when messaging apps are used to further illegal or disfavored activities by way of eliminating incriminating conversations or evidence of wrongdoing."
Cooley,"DOJ Issues Further Guidance, Warnings on Ephemeral Messaging Apps","Other issues can arise when messaging apps are used to further illegal or disfavored activities by way of eliminating incriminating conversations or evidence of wrongdoing.

Courts and regulatory agencies such as the DOJ have taken notice, cautioning organizations on the potential hazards of using messaging apps for business activities without sufficient policies and procedures in place to monitor compliance and preserve communications when necessary.

Actions against broker-dealers and investment advisers In September 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reached a combined $1.8 billion settlement with 15 broker-dealers and an investment adviser related to a failure to preserve electronic communications.

Regulators focused on the widespread use of what the SEC called off-channel messaging communications, in particular text messages and messaging apps, that were not preserved as required of broker-dealers and investment advisers by SEC and CFTC record-keeping regulations.

In December 2021, the SEC announced a $125 million fine against a large financial institution related to failures to preserve staff communications on personal mobile devices and messaging applications.

The SEC highlighted concerns related to ephemeral messaging in a Risk Alert issued in December 2018 reminding registered investment advisers of their retention obligations pursuant to SEC rules.

1

Noting an increase in the use of text messaging or chat apps to communicate, the SEC recommended that advisers review their policies and processes related to electronic messaging to ensure compliance with retention rules.

In October 2021, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal indicated that companies need to be actively thinking about and addressing the many compliance issues raised by the increased use of personal devices, new communications channels, and other technological developments like ephemeral apps.

Litigation pitfalls Ephemeral apps and text messages also have proven to pose issues for judges and parties in litigation, particularly in the context of preservation obligations in discovery.

In Herzig v. Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care, Inc. , 2 the defendant alleged that the plaintiffs decided to install and use the ephemeral messaging application Signal to intentionally destroy discoverable evidence, despite the fact that they were subject to legal holds.

The court found that the Signal communications were most likely responsive and that the plaintiffs decision to use Signal was done in bad faith.

Organizations that do not have controls or effective legal hold policies in place also run the risk of increased costs as the focus of the case shifts away from the merits to expensive discovery disputes that could result in case-ending sanctions.

Minimizing legal and compliance risks It is imperative that companies have enforceable policies and controls in place to minimize legal and compliance risks from employee use of ephemeral messaging apps.

Below, weve summarized actions companies can take.

Retention program and information policies Create and implement practical retention policies for electronic messaging apps that are authorized by the company, and ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations.

This includes monitoring compliance and addressing noncompliant use of prohibited applications for business purposes.

These policies also need to harmonize with the organizations acceptable use policies for technology  and clearly define business communications and messaging guidelines.

Mobile devices and applications Design functional mobile device policies and administer mobile device management software to manage apps on devices used for business purposes, including personal devices.

Legal holds Establish proactive legal hold response procedures to prepare for potential litigation or regulatory activity."
Cooley,"DOJ Issues Further Guidance, Warnings on Ephemeral Messaging Apps","Legal holds Establish proactive legal hold response procedures to prepare for potential litigation or regulatory activity.

Training and oversight Develop training programs to educate employees regarding company policies and permissible communication applications, as well as apps prohibited for business purposes.

Empower employees to understand their role in helping the company manage risk.

Notes Advisers Act Rule 204-2, which is also known as the Books and Records Rule, requires advisers to make and keep certain books and records relating to their investment advisory business, including typical accounting and other business records as required by the SEC.

No. 2:18-CV-02101, 2019 WL 2870106 (W.D. Ark., July 3, 2019)."
Cooley,Marketing of Cryptoassets Pushed Up on UK Financial Regulator’s Agenda,"In a recent statement, the UKs financial regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  made it clear that businesses marketing certain cryptoassets in the UK will need to prepare for compliance with the FCAs financial promotions regime.

This follows the UK governments proposal to bring cryptoassets within the FCAs regulatory perimeter.

These new measures will have a significant impact on how cryptoasset businesses, globally, market their products to customers in the UK.

Scope of financial promotions regime once new measures are in force Regardless of whether you are in the UK, or the type of technology you use, if you are marketing qualifying cryptoassets to customers in the UK, you will need to comply with the FCAs financial promotions regime.

The proposed definition of qualifying cryptoasset captures most of the commonly used cryptoassets  any cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights which is fungible and transferable.

However, this definition is not set in stone and is still being developed.

What constitutes marketing in this context is fairly broad: It captures any invitation or inducement communicated by a business, in the course of its business, to engage in qualifying cryptoassets .

Importantly, cryptoasset businesses that are in scope should be aware that noncompliance with the financial promotions regime can result in up to two years of imprisonment, monetary fines, taking down websites, issuing public warnings and other FCA enforcement action.

The financial promotions regime Under the current financial promotions regime, businesses are prohibited from communicating financial promotions (effectively most marketing materials) to UK consumers unless the promotion is communicated, or approved by, an authorised person (i.e., a person authorised by the FCA), or the promotion is exempt from the rules.

However, the UK government is proposing to add a new bespoke exemption to the regime for certain cryptoasset businesses.

This exemption is being proposed in response to concerns raised by the crypto industry that most cryptoasset businesses are not authorised by the FCA and will find it challenging to find an authorised person to approve their financial promotions (more on this below).

The financial promotions regime also sets out the FCAs rules and expectations on the content of financial promotions for cryptoassets: Any financial promotion must be fair, clear and not misleading and, in some cases, must include specific risk warnings throughout the customer journey.

These issues will need to be considered by whomever is making or approving the financial promotion.

Options available to promote cryptoassets to UK consumers Including the FCAs new proposal, there will be four potential options for businesses to communicate cryptoasset financial promotions to UK consumers.

Number Status Option 1 Current regime The financial promotion is communicated by an authorised   person  a cryptoasset business that is already authorised and regulated   by the FCA can approve its own marketing materials.

2 Current regime The financial promotion is made by an unauthorised   cryptoasset business but is approved by an authorised person  an   unauthorised cryptoasset business must ask an FCA-authorised person to   approve its marketing materials.

3 Current regime The communication is exempt from the rules  a   cryptoasset business must prove that it can rely on one of the limited   exemptions under the regime.

4 New proposal The financial promotion is communicated by a   cryptoasset business registered under the Money Laundering, Terrorist   Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017   (MLRs)  a registered cryptoasset business can approve its own marketing   materials but not the marketing materials of others."
Cooley,Marketing of Cryptoassets Pushed Up on UK Financial Regulator’s Agenda,"Note: A business that is only authorised under the Electronic Money Regulations or the Payment Services Regulations is not considered an authorised person.

Options for unauthorised firms While there are three options available to unauthorised cryptoasset businesses (options 2, 3 and 4), there are challenges and limits to each.

Firstly, considering option 2, it is not clear at this point how willing authorised firms will be to approve marketing materials.

The approver also will need specific FCA permissions and the appropriate expertise in the cryptoasset product.

For option 3, relying on one of the exemptions means that  among many other requirements  it is unlikely that a business will be able to market to retail customers or (potentially) high net worth individuals.

Lastly, for option 4, becoming registered under the MLRs has proven to be a successful route for some cryptoasset businesses.

However, it is a lengthy and complex process, so the benefits of becoming registered may be disproportionate to the time and expense of going through it.

For those businesses that are already so registered, it is still important to note the obligation to comply with all the other rules and requirements under the financial promotions regime  such as the fair, clear and not misleading rule  when marketing cryptoassets to UK consumers.

Keep an eye on updates The FCA is clearly trying to balance the need to protect UK consumers against the risk of crypto-related investments with promoting competition and innovation in the UK.

The FCA is not the only authority that has raised concerns in this area; the Advertising Standards Agency published an enforcement notice on the Advertising of Cryptoassets: Cryptocurrencies in March 2022.

In terms of timelines, the UK government announced that it has reduced the implementation period of cryptoassets being brought into the financial promotions regime from six to four months.

The implementation period will start once the new legislation is in effect.

We will keep clients updated on any new developments during this process and provide practical tips for how to comply when the rules are in force."
Cooley,Paid Leave for Nearly All Illinois Employees Coming Soon,"Paid leave for any reason is coming to Illinois.

On March 13, 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Paid Leave for All Workers Act (Paid Leave Act), which requires employers to provide up to 40 hours of paid leave to nearly all employees in Illinois.

The Paid Leave Act becomes effective on January 1, 2024.

While an increasing number of state and local jurisdictions require certain employers to provide their employees with paid sick leave for specified purposes, the Paid Leave Act requires employers to provide paid leave for any reason.

The Paid Leave Act will make Illinois the third state in the US  following Maine and Nevada  to require private employers to provide paid leave to employees to be used for any reason.

This alert reviews the main Paid Leave Act requirements and highlights key considerations.

Covered employers and employees The Paid Leave Act will reach nearly all employees in Illinois and has no exceptions based on business size.

Employers with one or more employees are covered under the Paid Leave Act, including certain employment and labor placement agencies and any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.

This also includes state and local government employers (except certain school and park districts).

Notably, however, the Paid Leave Act does not apply to employers covered under a municipal or county ordinance in effect on January 1, 2024, requiring employers to give any form of paid leave to their employees, including paid sick leave.

So, an employer covered by the Cook County Earned Sick Leave Ordinance and/or the Chicago Minimum Wage and Paid Sick Leave Ordinance does not have to grant paid leave under the Paid Leave Act.

All employees working in Illinois are covered under the Paid Leave Act, including domestic workers, with some limited exceptions: Students employed on a part-time, temporary basis by a college or university they attend (with respect to work performed by the student for the college or university).

Short-term employees of higher education institutions employed for fewer than two consecutive calendar quarters during a calendar year without a reasonable expectation that they will be rehired in a subsequent calendar year.

Employees working in the construction industry who are covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement.

Employees who are covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement with an employer that provides  nationally and internationally  services of delivery, pickup and transportation of parcels, documents and freight.

Employees as defined in the federal Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act or the Railway Labor Act.

Properly classified independent contractors are not eligible for paid leave under the Paid Leave Act.

The paid leave requirements also do not impact the terms of bona fide collective bargaining agreements in effect on January 1, 2024.

After that date, the paid leave requirements may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement.

Accrual and carryover An employee who works in Illinois is entitled to earn and use up to 40 hours of paid leave during a 12-month period, or a pro rata number of hours of paid leave.

The 12-month period may be any consecutive 12-month period designated by the employer in writing at the time of hire.

Beginning January 1, 2024, or at the start of employment (whichever is later), paid leave accrues at the rate of one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked up to a minimum of 40 hours of paid leave (or such greater amount if the employer provides more than 40 hours).

Overtime-exempt employees under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act are presumed to work 40 hours per workweek for the purposes of accrual, unless their regular workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case paid leave accrues based on that regular workweek."
Cooley,Paid Leave for Nearly All Illinois Employees Coming Soon,"Instead of this accrual method, employers can frontload paid leave by making at least the minimum number of paid leave hours available to an employee on the first day of employment or on the first day of the 12-month period.

For employees who accrue paid leave under the Paid Leave Act, unused paid leave carries over annually, but the Paid Leave Act does not require employers to provide more than 40 hours of paid leave for an employee in the 12-month period.

Employers that frontload paid leave are not required to carry over unused paid leave.

Using paid leave Paid leave under the Paid Leave Act may be used by the employee for any reason.

An employee is not required to provide a reason for the leave and cannot be required to provide documentation to support the leave.

Employees must be allowed to begin using paid leave 90 days following the start of their employment or 90 days following the effective date of the Paid Leave Act, whichever is later.

Employers can set a reasonable minimum increment for the use of paid leave not to exceed two hours per day.

If an employees scheduled workday is less than two hours per day, the employees scheduled workday must be used to determine the amount of paid leave.

Employers can require up to seven days notice of any foreseeable need for paid leave.

However, if the leave is unforeseeable, an employee must provide notice as soon as practicable after the employee is aware of the need for leave.

Any employer that requires notice of the need for leave must provide employees with written notice of the notification requirements.

If requiring notice of unforeseeable leave, the employer must implement a written policy containing procedures by which an employee can provide notice to the employer.

Employers cannot require an employee to search for a replacement worker to cover their paid leave.

Separation from or change in employment Upon separation from employment, employers are not required to pay out accrued but unused paid leave under the Paid Leave Act.

However, if the paid leave under the Paid Leave Act is credited to an employees paid time off bank or employee vacation account, then any unused paid leave must be paid to the employee upon separation to the same extent as vacation time under existing Illinois law, which requires the monetary equivalent of all earned vacation to be paid as part of final compensation.

If an employee is rehired within 12 months of separation, unused and accrued paid leave must be reinstated and made available for use.

Additionally, any employee transferred to a separate division, entity or location will retain their accrued paid leave time.

Notice and posting Employers will be required to post a notice on the Paid Leave Act provided by the Illinois Department of Labor and include a copy in a written document, which can include a written employee manual or employee policy, upon commencement of an employees employment or 90 days following the effective date of the Paid Leave Act, whichever is later.

An employer that violates these requirements will be subject to a $500 civil penalty for the first violation and a $1,000 civil penalty for any subsequent violation.

Recordkeeping Employers must make and keep records for each employee documenting hours worked, paid leave accrued and used, and the balance of accrued paid leave.

Employers are required to retain these records for at least three years.

Additionally, employers must provide these records for inspection to the Illinois Department of Labor upon request.

Protection against retaliation The Paid Leave Act prohibits employers from taking adverse action against employees for: Exercising their rights under the Paid Leave Act.

Opposing practices that the employee believes to be in violation of the Paid Leave Act.

Supporting others in their exercise of rights under the Paid Leave Act."
Cooley,Paid Leave for Nearly All Illinois Employees Coming Soon,"Opposing practices that the employee believes to be in violation of the Paid Leave Act.

Supporting others in their exercise of rights under the Paid Leave Act.

In addition, employers cannot consider the use of leave under the Paid Leave Act when evaluating employees or making decisions about employee discipline or promotion.

Penalties Employees may file a complaint with the Illinois Department of Labor alleging violations of the Paid Leave Act within three years of any alleged violation.

If an employer is found to have violated the Paid Leave Act, the employer will be liable to any affected employees for damages and a penalty of $500 to $1,000.

Employees also are entitled to appropriate equitable relief, in addition to fees and costs.

In addition, the Illinois Department of Labor will impose a civil penalty of $2,500 for each separate offense.

Next steps While employers will have until January 1, 2024, to come into compliance with the Paid Leave Act, we encourage employers to review their current leave processes and policies now.

Although some employers may already have paid leave policies that provide at least 40 hours of paid leave per year and, therefore, may not be required to modify their paid leave policies if leave can be taken for any reason, employers should consider creating a tailored policy to address the requirements of the Paid Leave Act.

Employers also may want to modify their existing accrual policies or notice requirements to prevent abuse of the leave entitlements created under the Paid Leave Act.

We expect further guidance from the Illinois Department of Labor on the Paid Leave Act and will continue to monitor developments.

If you have any questions about or related to the Paid Leave Act, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,Recent Developments: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,"After depositors rushed to withdraw funds from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), on Friday, March10, 2023, the US bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was named receiver of the closed bank.

SVBs sudden failure going into the weekend created significant uncertainty  and prompted many questions about the ability to access accounts and funds held at the bank at the time it closed.

On March 10, the FDICs first step was to create the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB) to protect insured deposits of SVB customers and facilitate the resolution of the bank.

On the evening of Sunday, March12, however, government officials issued a joint press release stating, in part, that Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors  i.e., insured and uninsured deposits.

Also on March12, in the wake of the closing of SVB, the New York State Department of Financial Services took possession of Signature Bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver of that bank.

More detail on developments between March10 and Monday, March13, including announcements regarding the current status of SVB and Signature Bank available at the time of publication, is provided below.

Silicon Valley Bank

On the morning of March13, the FDIC issued another press release indicating that it transferred all deposits  insured and uninsured  and substantially all assets of SVB to a newly created, full-service FDIC-operated bridge bank named Silicon Valley Bank, N.A.

According to the FDIC, this action is designed to protect all depositors of SVB.

Those depositors automatically became customers of the bridge bank and should have had full access to their funds starting on the morning of March13 when the SVB bridge bank opened and resumed normal banking hours and activities, including online banking.

According to the press release, SVB official checks will continue to clear.

The receiver for SVB also has transferred all qualified financial contracts of SVB to the bridge bank.

According to FDIC regulations , the term qualified financial contract includes any securities contract, commodity contract and repurchase agreement.

Nonetheless, the FDIC reiterated that shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders will not be protected.

Also on March 13, HSBC Holdings plc announced that its UK subsidiary, HSBC UK Bank plc, is acquiring Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited, an affiliate of SVB.

The developments on March13 followed the joint press release issued on March12 by Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg stating that [a]fter receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors.

Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March13.

The joint press release was released moments after the Federal Reserve Board announced it would make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors.

In its announcement, the Federal Reserve said that it is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.

Signature Bank After the New York State Department of Financial Services announced on March12 that it had taken possession of Signature Bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver of the bank, the FDIC announced that it had established Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. , as a successor to Signature Bank, New York, NY."
Cooley,Recent Developments: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,"As with SVB, the announcements relating to Signature Bank affirmed that banking activities, including online banking, would resume on March13.

The bank currently is being marketed to potential bidders, and Signature Bridge Bank, N.A., will operate the bank in order to maximize the value of the institution for a future sale while maintaining banking services to the accounts formerly served by Signature Bank.

The government officials joint press release on March12 noted that the resolution of Signature Bank also was based on a systemic risk exception, and it affirmed that [a]ll depositors of this institution [i.e., Signature Bank] will be made whole.

Finally, with respect to the resolution of both banks, the joint press release stated that no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.

Cooley,Common Questions Regarding Access to Funds After Failure of an FDIC-Insured Bank,"Background On Friday, March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was named receiver and immediately created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB) to facilitate the resolution of SVB.

Read the FDICs official press release announcing the closing of the bank and the DFPIs press release .

The FDIC also has established a resource page .

The banks sudden failure means there are many questions about the ability to access accounts and funds held at the bank at the time it closed.

Each bank customer experience may be different, and each bank customer should review its applicable account agreements and any available information regarding its balances in relevant accounts.

The following is intended to provide a general overview of the treatment of assets in different types of accounts for informational purposes only; it does not constitute legal, business or financial advice.

You should contact your lawyer, financial adviser or other professional advisers to advise you on your specific situation before you take any action, rather than relying on this alert.

Funds on deposit Insured deposit amounts  Deposit accounts, including checking accounts, interest bearing savings accounts and money market accounts, also known as money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000, per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.

More information on the various account ownership categories for purposes of determining FDIC deposit insurance coverage is available.

The FDIC press release states that insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits (i.e., up to $250,000, per depositor, for each account in a different legal ownership category) through DINB

no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023.

The FDIC press release also states that banking services will include online banking and other services and that SVBs official checks will continue to clear.

Uninsured deposit amounts  Uninsured deposits include deposits in excess of the standard deposit insurance amount of $250,000 (for deposit accounts that otherwise are covered by deposit insurance), as well as other deposits and account types that are not insured.

The FDIC press release states that [t]he FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week.

Uninsured depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.

As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors.

Average disposition times according to the FDIC are six to 12 months, but can be longer depending on factors including litigation and enforcement matters.

Funds in sweep programs Many commercial banking customers participate in sweep programs that enable the customer to have excess cash in its main deposit accounts (e.g., checking accounts) swept to other accounts and used to purchase shares in money market mutual funds (MMMFs) and other similar investment securities.

The nature of sweep programs vary.

For example: Programs that establish a target balance amount for the customers applicable deposit account and sweep cash in and out of the deposit account to maintain that target balance.

Programs that establish, in addition to the target balance amount, a target investment return amount.

Programs that sweep customer deposits held in deposit accounts with the bank for overnight purchases of securities and then sell the securities in the morning, returning the funds to the customers deposit accounts.

Regardless of the specifics of the sweep program, swept funds can generally be divided into two buckets.

First, swept funds are used by the bank to purchase, on behalf of the customer, external assets such as shares in a money market mutual fund (MMMF)."
Cooley,Common Questions Regarding Access to Funds After Failure of an FDIC-Insured Bank,"First, swept funds are used by the bank to purchase, on behalf of the customer, external assets such as shares in a money market mutual fund (MMMF).

Holdings of assets, such as MMMFs purchased through external investment fund management, should not constitute deposits and therefore are not expected to be subject to the resolution of funds on deposit as described above.

Rather, for funds that are not deposits, the bank must disclose to the customer pursuant to 12 CFR  360.8(e), in the applicable program agreement, the status such assets would have if the institution failed.

Although it is yet to be seen, in general, such assets should belong to the banks customer, even if the bank made the share purchases as agent of the customer and held such shares in the banks name and on behalf of its customers.

Second, some swept funds are held by the bank in accounts (such as omnibus accounts) that may earn interest or other returns paid by the bank.

These funds are generally not holdings of shares in an external asset such as an MMMF that belong to the customer.

This cash remains in a deposit account and will likely constitute a deposit subject to the resolution of deposits as described above.

Customers that participate in a sweep program should be able to see information through their online banking portal, if it is available, regarding their holdings of assets such as MMMFs purchased through external investment fund management as well as their cash funds that remain deposits with the bank.

Claims process As of the morning of March 11, 2023, the FDIC has not announced a clear process for uninsured depositors.

FDIC guidance indicates that it will make clear whether there will be a claims process and what that will be, including whether it will use the information on file to reach out to depositors directly.

However, there may be circumstances that require claim filings even where the FDIC is reaching out affirmatively.

We expect more information in the coming days.

What next?

The order of priority for creditors of an insured depository financial institution is established by law.

Payment priority is given to depositors over general unsecured creditors.

Typically, after the FDIC recoups administrative costs and insured depositors are paid, customers with uninsured deposits are paid before any general unsecured creditors or equity shareholders.

In SVBs case, there are reports of an existing loan owned to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, which will be afforded super lien status and therefore will be resolved first.

More information should be available this coming week.

In the meantime, the FDIC press release states that, with respect to customer deposits: Insured deposits up to $250,000 will be available through the DINB no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023.

Uninsured depositors will receive a distribution of a portion of their uninsured amount on deposit at some point this coming week.

They will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds on deposit.

While some uncertainty exists given the circumstances, for external assets such as MMMFs purchased through the bank but held by the bank as agent for the customer, customers should retain ownership of those assets (subject to FDIC confirmation of customer ownership  for example, in the books and records reflecting the bank as custodian and agent of the assets on behalf of the customer), meaning that they will not be handled through the FDICs distribution process for deposits.

However, the timing of the availability of these assets is not certain at this time.

Cooley,FTC Revises Health Products Compliance Guidance,"In December 2022, the Federal Trade Commission released its Health Product Compliance Guidance , updating and replacing its 1998 industry advertising guidelines on dietary supplements.

Unlike the 1998 guidelines, the new guide expressly applies to advertising for all health-related products 1 to ensure that claims about the benefits and safety of not only dietary supplements, but also foods, over-the-counter medicine, homeopathic products, health-related apps, health equipment and diagnostic tests, are truthful, not misleading, and supported by appropriate substantiation.

The basic legal framework the FTC uses to evaluate these issues has not materially changed in the intervening 24 years, but the standards the commission applies have been clarified and refined by its prosecution of more than 200 cases involving false or misleading advertising claims for health-related products.

The guide incorporates the FTCs collective views based on that work.

Although the guide deserves careful review, particularly of the many examples of permissible and prohibited advertising conduct that may apply in particular situations, a few key points stand out.

Key insights Substantiation standards

In an effort to dispel what the FTC refers to as  urban myths  about the substantiation required to make health-related claims, the guide unequivocally states that the commission will rigorously enforce the requirement that advertisers have competent and reliable scientific evidence for any health-related claims.

Regardless of whether an ad makes an express claim about the level of support (i.e., tests show), generally competent and reliable evidence for health-related claims consists of randomized, controlled human clinical testing conducted by experts in the relevant disease, condition or function.

In evaluating the reliability of such testing, the FTC will consider several factors, such as sample size, duration and outcome measures.

The guide also urges advertisers to consult with independent experts to assess whether a study was well designed and well conducted, and whether the data was properly analyzed.

Only then can advertisers confidently say that their health claim is supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.

Although the FTC does not require a specific number of reliable clinical studies, replication by one or more additional studies adds to the weight the commission will give to the evidence.

The guide notes, however, that quality of research is more important than quantity.

Further, the guide cautions that animal and in vitro studies cannot, standing alone, substantiate health claims, nor can surveys of consumer experiences.

And the FTC will accept epidemiological or observational studies only where experts in the field consider them an acceptable substitute and clinical studies arent otherwise feasible (e.g., nutrition studies that would take decades to complete).

Quality of evidence The FTC not only looks at the type and amount of substantiating evidence, but it also analyzes the internal validity of each piece of evidence.

The guide directs that the following basic requirements should be present in any competent and reliable scientific evidence: A control group Randomization Double blinding The study also must result in statistically significant and clinically meaningful results (i.e., results that would actually matter to users).

Moreover, the guide cautions against post hoc analysis of data, or p-hacking, rejecting it as a way to substantiate a claim where the original protocol did not show meaningful results.

In addition, the guide sets out a number of factors that the FTC will consider when analyzing the quality of the underlying evidence  factors that all advertisers and their research partners should carefully consider when designing substantiating clinical trials."
Cooley,FTC Revises Health Products Compliance Guidance,"Even where advertisers have valid internal studies to support their claims, they must consider the totality of the other research in the field, including studies that show different results, to assess whether a claim is substantiated.

And advertisers must be sure that the research they are relying on is truly relevant to the specific claim they are making.

Clear and conspicuous disclosures Many ads require disclosures of qualifying information to avoid deception.

The guide reaffirms that such disclosures must be clear and conspicuous, or difficult to miss, and easily understandable by ordinary customers.

The guide also clarifies that disclosures must mirror whatever medium the ad is conveyed in  so if the claim is made visually and audibly, the disclosures also should be made in both mediums.

For claims made via social media, the guide offers new guidance that disclosures necessary to prevent deception must be unavoidable and, it pointedly notes, hyperlinks are avoidable.

Notably, the guide contains new cautions that if, despite the disclosure, a significant minority of consumers take away a misleading claim, then the disclosure must be modified, or the claim should be discontinued.

Indeed, the guide describes certain disclosures that are unlikely to, or will not, meet the FTCs clear and conspicuous standard.

Claims about emerging science, for example, are described by the guide as very difficult to adequately qualify for a general audience, given the complex scientific concepts at issue.

Moreover, the FTC rejects the use of vague terms such as may, helps, promising, preliminary, initial or pilot as adequate qualifiers for such claims.

The FTCs misgivings regarding emerging science claims, as expressed in the guide, should give any advertiser pause before making such claims.

Further, the guide reconfirms the long-standing rule that a disclosure that directly contradicts the express or implied message conveyed by advertising copy is ineffective.

As an example, the guide notes that even an express disclosure that no clinical study has been performed on the product cannot cure the misleading impression of scientific support conveyed when an ad displays images of individuals in lab coats and/or uses the caduceus symbol, in combination with terminology such as research center.

Consumer testimonials and expert endorsements The guide reaffirms the basic principle that advertisers cannot make health-related claims through consumer testimonials or expert endorsements that they cannot separately substantiate with appropriate scientific evidence  in other words, the FTC views testimonials and endorsements as if the advertiser were making the claims directly.

Further, if the testimonial reports results that are not typical, it is likely deceptive and cannot be cured by disclaimers such as results not typical.

Instead, the ad must clearly and conspicuously disclose the results a consumer can actually expect.

Lastly, advertisers must be sure to disclose clearly and conspicuously any personal, financial, or similar connection between the expert/consumer and the advertiser.

Traditional use The guide is clear that there is no exception for homeopathic and alternative medicines, as they too must meet the competent and reliable standard to make health-related claims.

However, it also clarifies that advertisers may make carefully qualified claims that describe a products traditional or historic uses, as long as those claims do not misleadingly imply the products efficacy and/or health benefits.

To do so effectively, the guide includes specific guidelines, including: Clearly disclosing within the ad that there is no scientific support for the health-related benefit.

Avoiding positive statements, endorsements or images that might undercut that disclosure.

Urging advertisers to consider conducting consumer research on the ad, to ensure consumers understand the limited nature of the qualified claim."
Cooley,FTC Revises Health Products Compliance Guidance,"Urging advertisers to consider conducting consumer research on the ad, to ensure consumers understand the limited nature of the qualified claim.

Regardless of the above, the guide cautions that advertisers cannot make traditional use claims regarding the treatment of serious medical conditions, which could put users at risk even if carefully qualified.

For example, a claim that a folk remedy is traditionally used to shrink tumors is prohibited, regardless of clear disclosures that there is no scientific support for the claim.

This is in sync with the FDAs approach to view such claims as rendering such a product an unapproved new drug under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), including the FDAs recent draft guidance on homeopathic drugs .

Third-party literature The guide notes that it will carefully scrutinize ads that use third-party literature, such as books, newspaper articles or abstracts of scientific studies, to market their products, as such materials impact how consumers interpret an ad.

Advertisers will be responsible for any claims implied by reference to the materials.

For example, where an ad for a dietary supplement contains a link to a book entitled The Miracle Cancer Cure, which describes the purported curative properties of an herb that also is used in the dietary supplement, the marketer is responsible for substantiating the implied efficacy claims.

Note that such cancer claims would render the product an unapproved new drug under the FDCA and pull the product outside claims permissible for a dietary supplement.

2 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act disclaimers and FDA approval

The guide notes that the disclaimer required under the FDCA for dietary supplements, (i.e., that statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA, and that the product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease) does not cure an otherwise deceptive ad.

The guide also notes that advertisers must carefully avoid implications that their products or claims have been approved by the FDA.

For example, where a Class I or Class II medical device has received FDA clearance, a label in an ad saying FDA Approved is deceptive, as it overstates the FDAs review of the product, conflating the agencys substantial equivalence determination for low- to moderate-risk devices with the more rigorous approval standard the FDA applies to Class III high-risk devices.

Thus, referencing the phrase FDA Approved for a device cleared through the FDAs 510(k) pathway may falsely imply that the FDA has reviewed and approved of any accompanying marketing claims.

In sum, while the guide offers parameters to meet the FTCs stringent requirements for health-related claims, advertisers must keep in mind the separate FDCA requirements, which govern premarket applications required before certain categories of products can be marketed, as well as strict labeling requirements that vary depending on the product category.

If you have any questions or concerns about FTC or FDA compliance, please contact one the lawyers listed below.

Notes For these products, the FTC shares jurisdiction with the US Food and Drug Administration, and companies that promote and distribute such products will have to ensure compliance with both agencies regulations, with the FTC primarily regulating the advertising for such products, and the FDA regulating the labeling.

As the FTCs recent guidance explains , [s]ome forms of marketing may constitute both labeling and advertising under the two agencies laws.

For example, a website where a dietary supplement can be purchased would fall within the FDAs definition of labeling in addition to being advertising under FTC law.

Cooley,NLRB Reverts to Prior Policy Restricting Employee Nondisparagement and Confidentiality Provisions,"On February 21, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) returned to long-standing precedent that an employer may not offer severance conditioned on an employees agreement to broad nondisparagement and confidentiality provisions.

Such an offer violates Section 7(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), irrespective of whether the employee actually enters into the agreement.

The decision reflects a growing trend among federal and state authorities to curtail an employers ability to enter into agreements with employees containing confidentiality and nondisparagement provisions.

The NLRB frequently reverses law upon the change of presidential political parties, and this decision is in line with the enumerated issues on which the current NLRB general counsel is seeking to return to law made or reestablished under the Obama-era NLRB.

Section 7(a) of the NLRA Under Section 7 of the NLRA, an employee has the right to self-organize, join or assist labor organizations and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.

These Section 7 rights apply to union and nonunion employees alike, but certain workers  such as supervisory employees  are not covered by the NLRA and generally do not have Section 7 rights.

Whether an employee is a supervisor for purposes of the NLRA is fact-dependent and based on the employees authority to hire, fire, discipline or responsibly direct the work of other employees.

McLaren Macomb , 372 NLRB No. 58 (2023)

In McLaren Macomb , the NLRB analyzed whether a Michigan-based hospital impinged on Section 7 rights by offering a severance agreement to permanently furloughed union employees.

The board took issue with the following provisions, which are often included in severance agreements: Confidentiality  The Employee acknowledges that the terms of this Agreement are confidential and agrees not to disclose them to any third person, other than spouse, or as necessary to professional advisors for the purposes of obtaining legal counsel or tax advice, or unless legally compelled to do so by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction.

Nondisclosure  At all times hereafter, the Employee promises and agrees not to disclose information, knowledge or materials of a confidential, privileged, or proprietary nature of which the Employee has or had knowledge of, or involvement with, by reason of the Employees employment.

At all times hereafter, the Employee agrees not to make statements to Employers employees or to the general public which could disparage or harm the image of Employer, its parent and affiliated entities and their officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives.

The agreement also provided for substantial monetary and injunctive sanctions against the employee in the event that the employee breached the nondisparagement or confidentiality provisions.

Importantly, the severance agreement had no carve out for Section 7 protected activity.

Before analyzing the legality of the provisions, the board contrasted its historic approach to confidentiality and nondisparagement clauses with two 2020 Trump-era NLRB rulings.

A hallmark distinction between NLRB views of the two political parties is whether the language of an agreement or policy alone is sufficient to justify a violation of law versus a factual situation that actually implicates the provision and results in a violation.

The 2020 rulings held that, absent circumstances that could render proffers of severance agreements coercive, the mere action of offering agreements with confidentiality and nondisparagement provisions did not constitute a violation of the NLRA."
Cooley,NLRB Reverts to Prior Policy Restricting Employee Nondisparagement and Confidentiality Provisions,"Here, the board expressly overruled the circumstances-driven approach and held that the mere proffer of an agreement that has a reasonable tendency to restrain, coerce or interfere with the exercise of Section 7 rights by employees is unlawful, regardless of the surrounding circumstances.

Turning to the nondisparagement clause, the board noted that the provision: Appeared to prohibit an employee from making any statement asserting that the hospital had violated the NLRA.

Was not limited to matters regarding past employment with the hospital.

Provided no definition of disparagement.

Extended to statements relating to the hospitals parents and affiliated entities and their officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives.

Lacked any time limitation.

As a result, the board found the nondisparagement provision imposed a clear chilling tendency on the exercise of Section 7 rights, including to assist fellow employees and cooperate with the boards investigation and litigation of unfair labor practices.

The board then scrutinized the confidentiality provision, observing that the clause prohibited an employee from disclosing the terms of the agreement to any third person.

Such a provision would preclude an employee from disclosing the existence of an unlawful provision contained in an agreement and prohibit the employee from discussing the terms of the severance agreement with former coworkers, the union or the board.

After finding that the hospital violated the NLRA, the board ordered the hospital to cease and desist from presenting the nondisparagement and confidentiality provisions to the furloughed employees and to post a notice for 60 days stating that it would not violate the NLRA by doing so again.

Implications moving forward Employers (with both unionized and nonunionized employees) should revisit any nondisparagement or confidentiality clauses included in form separation agreements presented to non-supervisory employees.

Given the brief respite of the 2020 rulings, many employers likely already include carve outs for NLRA-protected activity in their separation agreements.

With reasonable modifications to these carve outs, nondisparagement and confidentiality clauses could potentially coexist with an employees Section 7 rights.

Without such a carve out, an overbroad confidentiality or nondisparagement clause would likely render a severance agreement unlawful.

Employers may also consider removing confidentiality and nondisparagement provisions altogether or applying them only to supervisory employees.

Cooley,US Copyright Office Grants Limited Registration for AI-Generated Graphic Novel,"On February 21, 2023, the US Copyright Office (USCO) issued a decision limiting a copyright registration for Zarya of the Dawn, a graphic novel comprised in part of images created with the assistance of an artificial intelligence platform.

The decision has potentially significant implications for the protectability of AI-generated expressive works.

Background The author, Kris Kashtanova, first obtained a copyright registration for the 18-page graphic novel on September 15, 2022.

Kashtanova has described the work, which features original text alongside striking images of the main character in various post-apocalyptic landscapes, as the adventure of a non-binary person (Zarya) in different worlds seeking to find connection with other people and creatures.

However, the registration faced potential cancellation after the USCO learned of statements by Kashtanova to the effect that the graphic novel was created using artificial intelligence.

The USCO currently interprets the Copyright Act to protect only human works of authorship and, according to the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices (Third Edition), it will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work.

The USCO invited Kashtanova to submit arguments showing good cause why the registration should be maintained.

In a letter brief filed in November by Kashtanovas lawyers at Taylor English Duma and Open Advisory Services, Kashtanova claimed authorship of the entirety of Zarya, notwithstanding use of AI platform Midjourney to generate each individual image panel.

Kashtanova argued that use of Midjourney is similar to other technologies that artists employ to create expressive works, such as cameras.

Kashtanova, who uses they/them pronouns, claimed that the prompts they input into Midjourney determined the poses and points of view, and the juxtaposition of the various visual elements within each picture, not unlike how a photographer selects and frames the subject of a photograph.

Kashtanova further argued that each image was the result of a creative process in which they guided Midjourney iteratively through hundreds of variations of intermediate images until a desired result was achieved, and that some images were even refined by Kashtanova more directly by using Adobe Photoshop.


Kashtanova also contended, in the alternative, that even if some individual images were determined to be unprotectable, the graphic novel as a whole still could be protected as a compilation.

Under 17 USC  101, protection for a compilation extends to the selection, coordination, and arrangement of preexisting materials or data, regardless of whether the constituent elements are individually protectable.

USCOs decision affords limited protection

The USCO ultimately agreed that Kashtanovas original text was protectable and that Zarya as a whole constituted a protectable compilation, but disagreed that the individual images were entitled to copyright protection.

The USCO concluded that, based on the limited record before it, and its current understanding of the Midjourney platform and how Kashtanova used it, Kashtanova lacked sufficient control over the resulting output to qualify as an author.

The USCO also determined that although image editing performed by Kashtanova could, in theory, receive protection, the modifications identified in the record were either too limited or had not been described with enough specificity for the USCO to evaluate them.

Is this the final word?

The USCOs letter may not be the final word on the scope of protection for Zarya, however.

Pursuant to 37 CFR  202.5, Kashtanova is entitled to request reconsideration of the USCOs determination and has indicated publicly that they intend to respond.

In any event, other parties are likely to renew and elaborate on Kashtanovas arguments  and make new arguments in support of claiming copyright protection for their own AI-assisted works."
Cooley,US Copyright Office Grants Limited Registration for AI-Generated Graphic Novel,"In any event, other parties are likely to renew and elaborate on Kashtanovas arguments  and make new arguments in support of claiming copyright protection for their own AI-assisted works.

Notably, the USCO has yet to consider related ownership issues, including whether the company that creates and operates an AI platform may be regarded as the author of AI-assisted output it generates (akin to a commissioned artist), the possibility of co-authorship (between user and platform), the authorship implications of including user-generated images in prompts, or circumstances in which a claimant has documented more direct control over the specific contents of AI-assisted output.

Practical considerations For now, users of generative AI platforms should be mindful of the USCOs decision around protection of AI-assisted works other than as components of a compilation.

There is a risk that such works will be deemed unprotectable by the USCO, at least in part.

Companies and individuals wanting to avail themselves of copyright protection in works created with the aid of AI platforms should carefully document steps undertaken to dictate the specific contents of the work, including the extent of any expressive contributions added to AI-assisted output."
Cooley,FCC Updates Equipment Authorization Rules,"In 2022, the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules to implement the Secure Equipment Act of 2021.

Those rules, which in large part took effect on February 6, 2023, prevent manufacturers on the FCCs Covered List  companies whose products are deemed to pose a risk by national security agencies  from obtaining the equipment authorizations necessary to sell new or updated products in US markets.

Any manufacturer on the list is subject to the ban, but the FCCs new rules do not apply to information security products, solutions and services, or telecommunications services provided by entities on the Covered List.

Under the new rules, no applications for affected equipment filed by any of the listed companies or their affiliates will be granted.

The new rules cover both equipment that requires affirmative approval and equipment that is deemed approved under the FCCs Suppliers Declaration of Conformity program, which is used for a wide range of equipment sold to the consumer market.

In addition to preventing these companies from introducing new equipment into the US market, the rules prohibit companies from making changes that would require additional authorization to existing equipment that includes components from manufacturers on the Covered List.

The FCCs new rules do not prevent manufacturers on the Covered List from selling equipment that already has been authorized.

However, the FCC has asked for comment on whether it should revoke all existing equipment authorizations for manufacturers on the Covered List.

Revocation would prevent future sales of equipment manufactured by these companies or any other company that is placed on the Covered List in the future, potentially including equipment already in the supply chain in the US.

Action on this proposal could come in the next several months, and any new rules potentially could be effective before the end of 2023.

Next steps for companies?

These new rules are among several actions taken by the US government that suggest that it would be prudent for any company that currently uses, offers to consumers, or recommends the use of any services provided by or equipment manufactured by companies on the Covered List to explore alternatives  and be prepared for the possibility that products from those companies will be forced from the US marketplace.

It also may be prudent to evaluate the potential risks of purchasing equipment and services from other companies that may be added to the Covered List based on determinations by national security agencies.

Companies and products can be added to the Covered List at any time, and the FCC is not required to provide notice or an opportunity to comment before doingso.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – February One-Minute Reads,"Corp Fin issues new C&DIs on clawback rules On January 27, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Corporation Finance posted four new C&DIs (Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations) addressing issues arising under the final clawback rules adopted in October 2022.

As a refresher, these rules require securities exchanges to establish listing standards obligating public companies to develop and implement policies to recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers (see this November 2022 PubCo post on the updated clawback rules and this October 2022 client alert for more information).

In brief, the new C&DIs address the following: While check boxes and other disclosure requirements will be in the relevant forms in 2023, Question 121H.01 provides that the SEC does not expect companies to include the check boxes or provide the required disclosure until they are required to have a recovery policy under the applicable listing standard.

The listing standards are not required to be effective until November 28, 2023, and issuers subject to such listing standards will not be required to adopt a recovery policy for 60 days following the date on which the applicable listing standards become effective.

For foreign private issuers that use Form 20-F, Question 121H.02 provides that individualized disclosures under the final rules are required for members of their administrative, supervisory or management bodies for whom they otherwise provide individualized compensation disclosure in the filing.

For companies filing Form 40-F, Question 121H.03 provides that individualized disclosure under the final rules is required for executive officers for whom there is otherwise individualized compensation disclosure in the filing.

Question 121H.04 notes that the rule is intended to apply broadly to plans that consider incentive-based compensation, and that for plans that consider incentive-based compensation, an issuer would be expected to claw back the amount contributed to the notional account based on erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation and any earnings accrued to date on that notional amount.

SEC reportedly considering easing proposed climate disclosure rules On February 3, 2023, the Wall Street Journal and Politico reported that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is considering softening the controversial proposed rules requiring public companies to provide extensive climate-related disclosures (see this April 2022 client alert , this March 2022 PubCo post on the proposed new rules and this March 2022 PubCo post on the proposed new rules related to greenhouse gas emissions for more information).

As noted by Politico, a main reason for the possible relaxation is the wave of lawsuits that are expected to challenge the rule once its finalized, especially with the Supreme Court moving to rein in the so-called administrative state.

According to the WSJ, the SEC is particularly focused on whether and how to revise the financial statement disclosure requirements that are included in the proposed rules, though the final version of the rules will likely still mandate some climate disclosures in financial statements, according to the people close to the agency.

For more information, refer to this February 2023 PubCo post on dialing back the climate disclosure rules .

Geopolitical impact on boardroom In a new report titled  Geopolitical and economic risks: Board oversight in an evolving world , Corporate Secretary published the findings of a survey of governance professionals exploring how boards are implementing oversight of geopolitical risk.

Some key takeaways include: 54% of respondents indicated that the board of directors has primary oversight of relevant geopolitical risk issues, with 17% identifying the risk committee and 15% the audit committee.

67% of large-cap respondents and 65% of mega-cap respondents indicated that primary oversight of geopolitical risk was the responsibility of the whole board of directors, while only 47% of mid-caps and 46% of small caps indicated the same.

42% of respondents indicated that, within the past 12 months, the board of directors has discussed geopolitical risk issues at every board meeting, while 28% say those discussions occurred on an ad hoc basis (only 6% reported that the board hadnt discussed these issues).

The most frequently mentioned economic/geopolitical topics discussed at board meetings in the past year were economic growth/recession (95%), inflation (93%), the war in Ukraine (84%), racial equality (46%) and gender pay gaps (43%).

For more information, refer to this January 2023 PubCo post on boardroom geopolitics and this article on board oversight of geopolitical risks and opportunities .

FTC noncompete rule proposal In a significant departure from current practice, the Federal Trade Commission published a proposed rule that would categorically ban noncompete agreements between employers and a broad class of workers (natural persons who work, whether paid or unpaid, for an employer, including employees, independent contractors, externs, interns, volunteers, apprentices or sole proprietors who provide a service to a client or customer).

Currently, noncompete covenants are generally governed by state laws and are generally considered enforceable if reasonable.

The proposed rule has no immediate impact and is likely to be challenged in court if made final, but companies should be aware of the proposal and consider alternative approaches to protect their confidential information.

DIS-TECH will operate in 12 cities across the US and work with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and multiple US attorneys offices, according to the announcement.

The strike force will use data analytics, intelligence gathering and private-sector partnerships to identify illicit activity, according to the announcement.

The federal government had been signaling plans to step up enforcement efforts in this area.

Last year, the Commerce Department announced it was revamping its own enforcement program by imposing significantly higher penalties for export violations, increasing incentives for companies to voluntarily self-report and eliminating no admit, no deny settlements."
Cooley,No-Poach Approach Continues: UK Regulator Warns Employers About Anticompetitive Practices,"Following the US Department of Justices first criminal conviction for labor market antitrust violations in October 2022, and with scrutiny of labor agreements increasing internationally, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is the latest to intervene in the no-poach approach with the publication of a statement warning businesses about anticompetitive labor agreements .

Significant financial and personal consequences Anticompetitive labor agreements are a serious competition law infringement and can amount to cartel conduct.

The statement by the CMA makes it unequivocally clear that collusion between employers is illegal, and that there are significant financial and personal consequences for breaking the law.

The CMA highlights three distinct forms of anticompetitive behavior in labor markets:

Agreements between businesses not to approach or hire each others staff, or only to do so subject to the others consent.

Agreements between businesses to fix wages or other employee benefits, including maximum caps on pay or wage rates.

Businesses sharing sensitive information, such as terms and conditions and salaries offered to staff, which could include sharing information outside of any recruitment context (e.g., sharing or discussing such information through industry bodies via activities such as benchmarking processes, where salaries or terms of individual employers could be identified).

An agreement does not need to be in writing for it to be in breach of antitrust laws  informal practices or verbal understandings also are in scope.

In addition to applying to salaried employees, these rules apply when engaging freelancers and contracted workers.

The CMA recommends that businesses, legal advisers and recruiters: Refrain from engaging in these illegal practices.

Provide training to employees, including recruitment teams, on the application of competition law to recruitment processes.

Ensure robust internal reporting processes are accessible to staff.

Consider applying for leniency to the CMA if a no-poaching or wage-fixing agreement has been entered into.

The statement reflects the CMAs increased appetite for bringing enforcement action against such practices.

Notably, the CMA opened its first investigation into wage fixing in July 2022, probing four sports broadcasters that allegedly fixed rates offered to freelancers.

FTC pushes to end use of employment noncompete clauses On other labor fronts, the Federal Trade Commission published a proposed rule in January 2023 that would categorically ban noncompete agreements between employers and a broad class of workers  including independent contractors and unpaid interns, senior executives, and everyone in between.

This contrasts with the position in the UK, where there are currently no equivalent proposals on noncompete agreements.

The FTCs proposed rule is not final and is likely to be challenged in court; however, if upheld, it would represent a sea change in the enforceability of employee noncompete agreements in the US, where such restrictive covenants are relatively common.

Below are some key takeaways from the proposed rule.

The rule broadly defines worker to include all employees, independent contractors, externs, interns, volunteers, apprentices and sole proprietors who provide services to a client or customer.

It protects individuals and would not apply to noncompete agreements between corporate entities, so it would have limited application in the deal setting.

It would ban certain nondisclosure agreements, nonsolicitation clauses and other restrictive covenants that effectively function as noncompete agreements.

It would apply retroactively, requiring employers to rescind existing noncompete agreements and individually notify current and former employees within 45 days of recission.

The proposed rule is subject to a 60-day public comment period.

If the FTC does issue a final rule, it would become effective 180 days after publication."

Cooley,"Illegality Doctrine Rejected in Legal Cannabis Patent Case, Confirming Patent Enforceability","As the industry for cannabis that is legal under state and/or federal law continues to expand, a flurry of court cases in recent years have addressed whether these businesses can utilize the federal courts to vindicate their legal claims.

As discussed below, in some contexts, federal courts have dismissed plaintiffs claims under the old common law illegality doctrine, which holds that litigants engaged in unlawful practices may not access the court system to enforce their rights to proceeds of illegal acts.

At the same time, the federal government has readily issued utility patents on legal cannabis inventions.

The primary right accompanying an issued patent is the right to exclude others from practicing it  which generally requires the patent owner to sue in federal court.

As a result, the enforceability of legal cannabis patents directly impacts their value.

Until recently, however, no federal court had addressed whether it would open its doors to legal cannabis businesses seeking to enforce their issued patents, injecting some uncertainty into the industry.

In Gene Pool Technologies, Inc. v. Coastal Harvest, LLC , 1 a California federal judge ruled that the legal cannabis patents asserted in the case were enforceable, rejecting a motion to dismiss based on the illegality doctrine.

The illegality doctrine in federal court Dating back to at least the 18th century, English and American courts have declined to extend their jurisdiction to cases in which a claim arises from acts that are themselves a violation of law.

This rule has been termed the illegality doctrine, or ex turpi causa .

2

In the words of the US Supreme Court, [n]o court will lend its aid to a party who founds his claim for redress upon an illegal act.

3 Given that hemp is now fully legal under federal law, cannabis has been legalized in dozens of states, 4 and with legal cannabis inventions clearly patentable (also under federal law), legal cannabis businesses have been left to question whether adversaries might raise the illegality doctrine in an effort to thwart legal claims.

Mixed results for legal cannabis litigants in non-patent federal court contexts Operators of legal cannabis businesses have pursued a variety of claims in federal courts.

In some cases, courts have declined to accept jurisdiction, while in others, the courts have held that merely alleging that a litigant was engaged in a business in conflict with the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) should not effectively immunize that litigant from claims that it violated other federal  or state  laws.

Results for legal cannabis businesses so far have been mixed.

Federal courts have declined to provide jurisdiction to legal cannabis businesses in some contexts.

Bankruptcy courts, for example, have declined to extend the protections of the bankruptcy code to debtors whose businesses clearly violated the CSA.

5 Other types of claims, such as for violation of the Lanham Act and related Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act claims, have similarly been dismissed when courts further determine that accepting jurisdiction would effectively perpetuate an activity that is clearly illegal under federal law.

6 Legal cannabis businesses have fared better in other cases and contexts.

Other federal courts considering claims for bankruptcy protection or breach of contract have rejected the illegality doctrine as a defense.

7

As another example, in a case presenting claims for trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract , a federal court found it had jurisdiction to hear the claims because plaintiffs are not seeking a remedy that would compel either party to violate the [CSA] and the dispute in this case does not involve the actual production or sale of cannabis.

8

The court further stated that even if a defendant was allegedly engaged in a business violative of one federal law, that would not give it license to violate another."
Cooley,"Illegality Doctrine Rejected in Legal Cannabis Patent Case, Confirming Patent Enforceability","8

The court further stated that even if a defendant was allegedly engaged in a business violative of one federal law, that would not give it license to violate another.

These varying outcomes create uncertainty for owners of issued patents covering legal cannabis inventions.

Although patent infringement is a strict liability tort, and courts have generally been reluctant to apply the illegality doctrine in the context of tort claims, 9 no court had yet ruled on whether it would enforce issued patents against infringers.

As discussed below, the Gene Pool Technologies case provides an initial answer to this question.

California federal judge rejects illegality doctrine in legal cannabis patent case On November 22, 2022, Judge John W. Holcomb ruled on the defendants motion to dismiss based on the illegality doctrine in the Gene Pool Technologies, Inc. v. Coastal Harvest, LLC patent infringement case pending in the US District Court for the Central District of California.

10

The plaintiff, Gene Pool Technologies, Inc., sued the defendant, Coastal Harvest, LLC, alleging infringement of several patents claiming methods for extracting oils and other compounds from plant material.

11 Coastal Harvest filed a motion to dismiss based on the illegality doctrine, arguing that the issues raised in Gene Pools complaint were nonjusticiable in federal court, because, they alleged, the matter involved cannabis-related commercial activity that would violate the CSA.

12

This was a case of first impression for utility patent litigation.

The argument had not been raised in previous cases, including high-profile cannabis utility patent suits.

13

In 2021, a federal court rejected a motion to dismiss a design patent infringement case based on the illegality doctrine, but no court prior to this case had addressed the issue in the context of a utility patent applicable to the legal cannabis industry.

14 Judge Holcomb delivered his decision at an oral hearing, denying Coastal Harvests motion and clearing the case to proceed through discovery and trial.

The district court decision provided an analysis of each of the partys arguments and a review of its legal reasoning.

The primary points raised in the decision are summarized below as guidance for future patent litigants.

No controlling authority At the outset, the district court noted the lack of any controlling authority addressing the application of the so-called illegality doctrine in the patent infringement context generally.

15

The district court further highlighted the lack of any case law cited in the defendants motion that addressed the federal justiciability of cases where the illegality arises from the defendants (as opposed to the plaintiffs) alleged illegal conduct; that is, where a defendant seeks to use its own illegal conduct as a shield to allege tortious conduct.

16

In this case, plaintiff Gene Pool was presented as an intellectual property holding company, without any alleged ties to cannabis production or sales, making Coast Harvests cannabis extractions the only activity that could be allegedly illegal.

Complaint did not necessarily invoke illegality doctrine based on guiding case law Without any controlling precedent, the district court looked to other cases for guidance.

Judge Holcomb placed emphasis on the Siva Enterprises v. Lance Ott case discussed above, in which the court accepted jurisdiction to hear a trade secret misappropriation dispute because plaintiffs were not seeking a remedy that would compel either party to violate the [CSA], and the dispute did not involve the actual production or sale of cannabis.

17

In evaluating whether the dispute necessarily involved a violation of the CSA, the district court raised the following points: Complaint allegations do not read on a violation of the CSA  The district court found that Gene Pools complaint did not necessarily seek damages based on an alleged violation of the CSA by Coastal Harvest."
Cooley,"Illegality Doctrine Rejected in Legal Cannabis Patent Case, Confirming Patent Enforceability","The complaint alleged improper extraction of products and solutes from cannabis , which the court noted could also encompass extractions of low-THC hemp varietals expressly excluded from the CSA ever since the 2018 amendments to the Farm Bill.

18

Thus, the district court held that the complaints allegations concerning extraction of cannabis material are broad enough to include types of cannabis material excluded from the CSA.

19 Damages not based on lost profits of sales in violation of the CSA  The district court further distinguished its decision from the cited ruling in Shulman v. Kaplan, noting that Gene Pool does not seek damages based on its own cultivation or sales of marijuana, but was instead merely the holder of allegedly infringed IP.

20 Asserted patents and claims are not expressly limited to cannabis  The district court also noted that the asserted patents do not mention cannabis or marijuana but rather relate more generally to extracting oils or compounds from plants generally.

21

Thus, the sole connection to cannabis and any potential violations of the CSA were from the defendants use of the technology, and the claims per se did not expressly involve cannabis.

Judge Holcomb also took notice of the federal governments self-imposed prohibition on prosecutions of private individuals or organizations that produce, distribute, or possess marijuana in accordance with state medical marijuana laws.

22

The court reasoned that such prohibition on prosecution would likely apply to the cannabis extraction activities alleged in the complaint, and by extension to the governments assessment of any alleged aiding and abetting that would arise from a courts resolution of the patent infringement dispute.

23

In short, the district court held that the fact that certain marijuana-related activity may be deemed [il]legal under federal law, does not in and of itself transform an unrelated federal cause of action with entirely different goals (for example, protecting employees or promoting innovation ) into facilitating a crime.

24

The decision is welcome news for holders of US cannabis patent rights, and although not necessarily binding on other courts, it provides a first guidepost through which parties can assess IP infringement and enforcement risks and strategies.

Overall, the Gene Pool Technologies case suggests that courts are open to accepting jurisdiction in cases where owners of patents on legal cannabis assert claims to enforce their patent rights, so long as there is a plausible basis for the court to find that the power of the federal government is not being used to further illegal activity.

Innovators who are inventing new technologies in the legal cannabis market can maximize the likelihood that their patent rights will be enforceable by working with experienced patent counsel to draft claims in a manner that avoids reading exclusively on illegal cannabis-related activities, as well as strategically and selectively enforcing patent rights in a manner that allows federal courts to conclude that granting relief to the plaintiff will not make the court  and by extension, the federal government  an accessory to illegal activity.

Take-home lessons for the legal cannabis industry Several lessons for the industry are apparent from the ruling in the Gene Pool Technologies case: Patent owners considering future enforcement suits should consider placing their IP in non-plant touching entities that would not be subject to any allegations of illegality.

Such strategies, however, should be carefully reviewed with IP counsel to guard against potential adverse impacts to available remedies and damages theories.

Courts may focus on whether a complaint clearly alleges that any money damages would necessarily flow from activity illegal under the CSA, implying that any complaint for patent infringement should be drafted so that infringement and damages are not necessarily limited to activity that violates the CSA."
Cooley,"Illegality Doctrine Rejected in Legal Cannabis Patent Case, Confirming Patent Enforceability","Legal cannabis businesses seeking patent protection should obtain claims of varying breadth, as well as claims that cover practices that are clearly legal under both state and federal law.

Patent owners seeking to enforce their legal cannabis patents in federal court should seek to assert claims against infringing practices that are clearly legal under both state and federal law, and consider out-of-court strategies  such as licensing  to exercise their patent rights in other contexts.

Cooley,CFPB Brings RESPA Section 8 Into 21st Century With Digital Marketing Risk Advisory Opinion,"On February 7, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an advisory opinion warning operators of digital mortgage comparison platforms of specific practices the bureau may view as violating Section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), which prohibits the payment of fees for the referral of real estate settlement services.

The advisory opinion cautions operators against presenting information on their platforms in a non-neutral way or steering consumers to specific service providers based on the level of compensation received.

Importantly, the CFPB indicates that some platform operators, and their participating settlement service providers, may currently be engaging in activities that violate RESPA Section 8.

Overview of the advisory opinion RESPA Section 8 prohibits companies and individuals from receiving kickbacks and referral fees in connection with a transaction involving a residential mortgage or real estate settlement service.

In this new advisory opinion, the CFPB sets forth a three-part test to determine whether a digital mortgage comparison platform violates RESPA.

Specifically, the CFPB indicates that an operator violates RESPA when (1) the platform displays settlement service provider information to consumers in a non-neutral way, (2) that presentation has the effect of affirmatively influencing the consumers selection of the provider, and (3) the operator receives a payment or other thing of value that is, at least in part, for the referral activity.

Importantly, the CFPB warns that disclosing on the platform the criteria regarding how the information is presented to consumers will not cure a RESPA violation if the operators practices otherwise satisfy each prong of the CFPBs test.

The advisory opinion also offers a detailed set of hypothetical business practices that, according to the CFPB, might constitute prohibited referral activity and run afoul of RESPAs Section 8 prohibition.

For example, the bureau warns that ranking settlement service providers, or presenting a service provider as the best option on the platform, based on compensation received and irrespective of the consumers preferences, could violate RESPA.

Similarly, presenting information about settlement service providers differently to consumers, such as by using a larger font or incorporating weblinks for providers paying higher fees so as to influence the consumers selection of higher-paying providers, could also run afoul of that prohibition.

Lastly, the CFPB clarifies that digital marketing practices also may violate other federal or state financial protection laws, including the CFPBs prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices, to the extent that consumers are expecting a neutral and fair comparison of providers on the platform but are instead steered to providers not necessarily tailored to their needs.

What to expect?

One of the long-standing challenges of complying with RESPAs Section 8 obligations has been applying decades-old guidance to emerging technologies (official RESPA commentary still refers to facsimile transmission machines).

This advisory opinion places compliance risks in the context of modern technologies, and may require operators of digital marketing platforms to reevaluate how information is presented on their websites, as well as existing ranking methodology and fee structures with participating providers to ensure compliance with the CFPBs expectations.

Operators also should review any ancillary marketing services offered to lenders and settlement service providers, such as promotional activities or endorsements, to ensure those services do not otherwise negate the neutral display of information to consumers.

Participating lenders and settlement service providers should likewise review their arrangements with digital mortgage comparison platforms to mitigate regulatory scrutiny."
Cooley,CFPB Brings RESPA Section 8 Into 21st Century With Digital Marketing Risk Advisory Opinion,"Participating lenders and settlement service providers should likewise review their arrangements with digital mortgage comparison platforms to mitigate regulatory scrutiny.

While the specific RESPA focus may be new, the regulatory interest in transparency and accuracy in advertising is not.

Indeed, many of the principles in the advisory opinion align with the Federal Trade Commissions endorsement guides, which are rooted in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices).

Last year, the FTC proposed updates to those guides  which are still under consideration  to include, among other things, an emphasis on the roles and potential liability of digital platforms, which the FTC said should bear greater responsibility.

This additional regulatory focus from the CFPB signals once again the close coordination between agencies  and the heightened risk for noncompliance."
Cooley,Fed Circ Oil Tech Patent Ruling Drills Down on Indefiniteness,"Editors note: Authored by Lowell Mead, Dena Chen and Patrick Lauppe, this article was originally published in Law360 .

A recent oil drilling patent case represents an unusual move for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .

In the Jan. 12Grace Instrument Industries LLC v. Chandler Instruments Co. decision , the Federal Circuit vacated the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas' ruling that patent claims were indefinite and expressly construed the challenged claim term.[1]

Federal Circuit did not stop there  it remanded the case to the district court to consider whether the disputed term may still be indefinite in view of potential unresolved factual issues.

In doing so, the Federal Circuit raised some important considerations for patent litigators.

On May 19, 2020, Grace filed a complaint in the Southern District of Texas accusing competitors Chandler Instruments, Chandler Engineering and Ametek Inc .

of patent infringement.

Grace accused Chandler's viscometers  i.e., devices for measuring the viscosity of fluids  of infringing claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,412,877.

The '877 patent discloses devices for testing the viscosity of oil drilling fluid  which is used to help clear debris during drilling  under the high pressure and temperature conditions at the bottom of a drill hole.

Prior art viscometers introduced measurement errors by adding pressurization fluid, which would mix with the drilling fluid during testing or require the use of a friction-causing seal.

The '877 patent purported to solve this issue by creating a buffer zone  a chamber above the viscosity testing chamber that was connected via a small opening.

Drilling fluid is added until the testing chamber and part of the buffer zone is filled up.

Then, less-dense pressurization fluid is added to the buffer zone, where it sits on top of the drilling fluid like oil on water.

With enough drilling fluid added, the pressurization fluid remains floating above the drilling fluid in the buffer zone even as the drilling fluid compresses  thereby keeping the testing chamber full of pure drilling fluid.

The '877 patent claims call the buffer zone the enlarged chamber.

During claim construction before the district court, Chandler argued the term enlarged chamber was indefinite as a term of degree with no baseline.

Grace disagreed, arguing that a person of ordinary skill in the art, or a POSITA, would have understood that the enlarged chamber must be big enough to hold enough drilling fluid to keep the pressurization fluid floating above the testing chamber when the drilling fluid was compressed.

U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Southern District of Texas agreed with Chandler, finding that ""explaining something is large enough to do a certain task does not answer the question: larger than what?

There is still no baseline from which to answer that question.

""[2] On appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated the district court's ruling, finding that the enlarged-chamber language ""does not require that chamber to be larger than some baseline object; rather it must be large enough to accomplish a particular function.

""[3]

The Federal Circuit construed ""enlarged chamber"" to mean ""a chamber that is large enough to contain excess test sample prior to pressurization to prevent mixing of the test sample and pressurization fluid in the lower measurement zone when the test sample is pressurized to maximum rated pressure.

""[4]

But then the Federal Circuit did something surprising: It found that even though it had construed enlarged chamber, the question of whether this term was indefinite may not be resolved.[5]

The court raised several remaining issues for the district court on remand."
Cooley,Fed Circ Oil Tech Patent Ruling Drills Down on Indefiniteness,"The court raised several remaining issues for the district court on remand.

The '877 patent claims recited an additional limitation for preventing mixing based on the density difference between drilling fluid and pressurization fluid  potentially casting doubt on the definiteness of enlarged chamber as construed.[6] Further, the size of the enlarged chamber had to depend on how much a given drilling fluid compresses, which varies from fluid to fluid  potentially further muddying the waters.[7] While the court acknowledged these points might involve new arguments on appeal, it instructed the district court to consider any argument of waiver.[8]

Additionally, the court noted that the district court had made no finding as to the identity of a POSITA  potentially ""due to the parties' relative inattention to this factual issue.

""[9]

The court suggested a POSITA definition may be informative as to indefiniteness on remand.[10] In construing a claim term while keeping the door open to a further indefiniteness challenge, the Federal Circuit raised a new avenue for potential disputes on indefiniteness.

Typically, construing a disputed claim term resolves any indefiniteness challenge.

But Grace v. Chandler provides an exception to that rule: Even after the Federal Circuit construed the disputed term, it still might be indefinite.

The Federal Circuit's opinion also raises some useful practice pointers for raising and opposing indefiniteness challenges.

First, evaluate and properly present to the district court any factual evidence that may bear on indefiniteness.

The relevant evidence may include expert opinions, third-party texts and the patent itself  Grace v. Chandler points to potential fact- finding arising from an additional limitation recited in the claims.[11] Fact-finding by the district court in claim construction also becomes important on appeal, where it is reviewed under the deferential clear error standard rather than de novo.[12] Second, the POSITA determination may be important, even if only to prompt the district court to make an express ruling on a POSITA formulation that is not materially disputed.

Parties sometimes treat the POSITA definition as somewhat arbitrary and inconsequential  agreeing to a definition with the other side or arguing that any differences are immaterial.

But in Grace v. Chandler, the Federal Circuit flagged that inattention to the POSITA determination could undermine a district court's ruling on indefiniteness.[13] Finally, an express claim construction is not necessarily game over for indefiniteness.

If an indefiniteness challenge can survive a Federal Circuit construction, then post-claim construction patent litigation may have just gotten a lot more interesting.

Cooley,European Medicines Agency Publishes Q&A on Clinical Trial Data Transparency,"Following the entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) 536/2014 (CTR) for all initial clinical trial applications on 31 January 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has published a Q&A document concerning the transparency obligations established in the CTR in relation to information submitted in support of an application.

The Q&A provides responses to questions raised by clinical trial sponsors in the context of a survey developed by the European Commission, the EMA and the Heads of Medicines Agencies.

The survey sought to identify the challenges relating to the implementation of the CTR and assess the degree to which sponsors understand the obligations foreseen therein, including disclosure rules.

One of the challenges identified in the survey was compliance by applicants with transparency requirements in the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the single electronic entry point through which the submission, assessment and reporting of clinical trial information is conducted for all initial clinical trial applications submitted on or after 31 January 2023.

The two main concerns articulated by sponsors in relation to disclosure obligations are deferrals of publication of trial data and redaction of trial documents to protect commercially confidential information (CCI).

Deferral of publication of documents The Q&A provides guidance regarding deferral of publication of clinical trial information.

Although, in principle, clinical trial sponsors must publish clinical trial documents and data immediately upon submission, a deferral mechanism is available.

This mechanism provides sponsors with the possibility of seeking approval to delay the publication of certain clinical trial data, such as the clinical trial protocol or the investigators brochure, for a specified period of time.

EU member states also may choose to delay the publication of the questions included in their assessment reports and the evaluation of the related responses provided by the sponsor.

The purpose of this delay is to protect CCI and personal data.

The duration and scope of the deferral period varies, depending on the category under which a clinical trial falls.

As an exception, for trials conducted in situations of public health emergency, deferrals are not accepted.

According to the Q&A, where requests for deferrals are made, the reporting member state (RMS) or the member state concerned (MSC) must specifically reference the category in which the individual trial falls.

This is important, as any related deferral timeline will be determined based on this categorization.

Member states may also comment on the deferral timeline proposed by the sponsor.

If the request for deferral is accepted, the same deferral timeline will apply to the publication of assessment reports or requests for information (RFIs) by the MSC.

The Q&A also provides that the type of justification sponsors should provide in support of their request for deferral is information relating to the applicable trial category.

In addition, the Q&A clarifies that there is no procedure in place to inform sponsors about the status of their request for deferral.

Instead, an absence of related RFIs from the national competent authorities or sufficient response to RFIs will signal that a deferral request has been accepted.

Redactions in relation to CCI and personal data The Q&A provides that, although not mandatory, RMS and MSC may review and comment on the extent of redactions proposed by sponsors in the clinical trial documents included in the CTIS submission.

The purpose of this review is to ensure that transparency rules are respected by sponsors.

The Q&A adds that, as a general rule, extensive redaction will be considered to defeat the CTRs aim of achieving a high level of transparency of trial data."
Cooley,European Medicines Agency Publishes Q&A on Clinical Trial Data Transparency,"The Q&A adds that, as a general rule, extensive redaction will be considered to defeat the CTRs aim of achieving a high level of transparency of trial data.

This means that the same documents or data should not be subject to both redaction and deferral requests, except in limited circumstances where both measures are necessary to protect CCI.

In terms of practical advice in relation to redactions, the Q&A suggests that CCI be included in the not for publication section of trial applications by placing it in a red box.

This will help reviewers understand which parts of the trial applications are considered CCI that should not be incorporated into publicly available assessment reports or RFIs.

Most documents requiring signatures and those that include personal data must be uploaded under the not for publication section of the application in the CTIS, unless such information is redacted.

The name and surname of the principal investigator and the person issuing a site suitability document are, however, excluded from this rule and will be published in the CTIS, as foreseen in the Appendix on disclosure rules to the Functional specifications for the EU portal and EU database to be audited .

Next steps The Q&A is expected to be updated as soon as more information becomes available and will form part of the draft Guidance document on the protection of personal data and CCI in documents uploaded and published in the CTIS ."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – January One-Minute Reads,"SEC seeks enhanced disclosures regarding inflation impact On December 8, 2022, Intelligize reported on the Securities and Exchange Commissions recent comment letters related to disclosures addressing the impacts of inflation on companies operating results.

The comments generally requested that companies disclosures go deeper into the impacts of inflation on their business, as can be seen in the letter to FedEx  where staff asked FedEx to expand on trends or uncertainties caused by inflation that might weigh on operating metrics such as cash flows and liquidity  and in the letter to Eastman Chemical Company  where staff asked Eastman to update future risk factor disclosures to reveal the extent to which recent inflationary pressures have materially impacted its operations.

In this regard, companies should identify the types of inflationary pressures they are facing more specifically and discuss their particular approaches to mitigate its impacts.

Nasdaq simplifies compliance deadlines for board diversity On December 14, 2022, Nasdaq filed a proposed rule change with the SEC to amend the compliance deadlines for certain requirements in its board diversity rules.

The rule change was declared effective immediately.

As a reminder, the SEC approved Nasdaq listing rules in August 2021 relating to board diversity and disclosure.

One of these rules  Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(f)  requires that Nasdaq-listed companies either have an applicable number of diverse directors by specified dates or explain why they do not have such directors.

Now, these dates have been amended to require companies to comply or explain by December31 of the applicable year, as illustrated in the table below.

The amendments also include certain technical changes to the relevant listing rules.

SEC charges McDonalds and former CEO On January 9, 2023, the SEC announced that it had charged the former CEO of McDonalds , Stephen J. Easterbrook, with making false and misleading statements to investors about the circumstances leading to his termination in November 2019.

More aggressively, the SEC charged McDonalds itself for shortcomings in its public disclosures related to the CEOs separation agreement, finding that the companys disclosures were deficient in not divulging that it exercised discretion in terminating Easterbrook without cause, allowing Easterbrook to retain substantial equity compensation.

The charges relate to McDonalds 2019 termination of Easterbrook after discovering he had exercised poor judgment and engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with a McDonalds employee in violation of corporate policy.

In a seemingly unusual step for an enforcement action, Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda dissented from the order charging McDonalds , contending that McDonalds was a victim of Easterbrooks deception  and that the order casts the company as a securities law violator through a novel and overly expansive interpretation of executive compensation disclosure requirements.

This case serves as a reminder to carefully draft disclosures regarding executive agreements, including separation and termination agreements, and to consider whether all material terms of an agreement are adequately disclosed.

Cooley,Considerations for US Companies Hiring Abroad,"There are many reasons your business might consider hiring in or transferring current employees to a country where your company currently does not have a presence.

Perhaps you are expanding into a new geographical market, have identified a talented individual you want to bring onboard, or have a key employee you want to retain who needs to move overseas.

Whatever the rationale, there are important employment-related issues that you need to consider each time you plan to hire in a new jurisdiction.

Permanent establishment risk In short, you could create a corporate tax presence of the entity that you use to employ individuals within the jurisdiction they are working from.

For example, if you use a company incorporated in the UK to employ an individual who lives and works in Germany, there may be a risk that you will create a taxable presence of the UK company in Germany as a result.

Check the permanent establishment risk with your accountants or your tax counsel, who may advise that it would be better to incorporate a local subsidiary.

Immigration You will need to check that employees have the legal right to live and work in the jurisdiction that they are working from.

Applicable law Individuals are likely to benefit from the protection of the employment laws of the country that they are working from, such as mandatory minimum holiday time, benefits and termination rights.

For that reason, you will need to establish a local law-compliant employment contract to ensure that you are properly protected (for example, in respect to your confidential information and intellectual property) and fulfill your legal obligations as an employer.

Payroll obligations Having an employee work in a particular jurisdiction is likely to trigger obligations to register as an employer and run payroll in that country.

That position can be complex (and the rules relating to income tax and social security contributions may be different), so you will want advice from lawyers or accountants in that jurisdiction.

Insurance and benefits You should confirm what mandatory minimum insurance and benefits you need to put in place for employees working abroad.

For example, employers in the UK are required to have employers liability insurance in place with a mandatory minimum level of coverage and to automatically enroll employees into a pension scheme that meets certain compulsory minimum requirements.

Stock options If you plan to grant stock options (or other equity incentives) to employees working abroad, local tax, securities, exchange control and employment laws are likely to apply.

This is also the case if employees have already been granted stock options that may continue to vest and/or be exercised while they are abroad  the cross-border tax implications can be particularly complex.

For these reasons, seek local law and tax advice for the jurisdiction in which you are considering hiring to ensure that the expansion is established and structured in a compliant and effective manner."
Cooley,FDORA Changes to the FDA Accelerated Approval Program,"Enacted on December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the year-end omnibus spending bill) includes the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), which enhances the Food and Drug Administrations authority in several key areas.

One such section addresses recent criticism of the FDA around the accelerated approval pathway.

The provisions seek to increase transparency around this regulatory pathway and also grant new authorities to the FDA to ensure that sponsors are complying with post-approval requirements that are essential to ensure that only drugs that are safe and effective for their intended use remain on the market.

What is accelerated approval?

Drugs that treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fulfill unmet medical needs are eligible for review by the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway.

1

This pathway is accelerated in that it allows sponsors to seek approval with data that demonstrates efficacy based on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is believed to predict clinical benefit for the disease or condition, rather than primary clinical endpoints.

The pathway has been used primarily for drugs aimed at diseases that progress slowly, such that waiting for trials that demonstrate primary clinical endpoints would result in a yearslong delay before such drugs could be eligible for approval under the traditional pathway.

As a condition of receiving accelerated approval, sponsors are required to conduct post-approval studies to confirm the clinical benefit of the drug.

Upon satisfaction of the post-approval requirements, the conditions of accelerated approval are removed.

The FDA also can withdraw an accelerated approval if the sponsor fails to conduct the post-approval studies with due diligence, the studies fail to verify the predicted effect or demonstrate that the product is safe or effective under the conditions of use, or if the sponsor disseminates false or misleading promotional material.

Prior to FDORA, the law did not provide details of the withdrawal process, except that the drug sponsor must be granted an opportunity for an informal hearing.

The FDA encourages sponsors interested in the accelerated approval pathway to communicate with the agency early in development to discuss proposed surrogate endpoints or intermediate clinical endpoints, plans for confirmatory trials and clinical trial design, among other topics.

2 Previous critiques of accelerated approval Since the launch of the accelerated approval pathway in 1992, nearly 300 drugs have been approved through the pathway , including the recent approval of Eisai and Biogens Leqembi for Alzheimers disease.

In recent years, however, the FDAs standard for accelerated approval has been brought into question, particularly with respect to the agencys decisions to approve Sarepta Therapeutics Exondys 51 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Biogens Aduhelm for Alzheimers disease.

Exondys 51 was approved despite concerns regarding the reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit , with the head of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research overruling the findings of an advisory committee and reviewers that evidence of a likely benefit was lacking.

Aduhelm was similarly approved under the accelerated approval pathway following unfavorable findings from the FDAs advisory committee and the FDAs Medical Policy and Program Review Council.

Based on this, the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform and Committee on Energy and Commerce investigated the review process .

The FDA also has come under fire for failing to police sponsors compliance with post-accelerated approval requirements.

An Office of Inspector General (OIG) report issued on September 29, 2022 , found that over one-third of drugs granted accelerated approval had incomplete confirmatory trials, and of those studies with incomplete trials, 34% had at least one trial past the original planned completion date."
Cooley,FDORA Changes to the FDA Accelerated Approval Program,"The study also noted that the multistep process to withdraw products approved through the accelerated approval pathway is lengthy and cumbersome for the agency, which could explain why the FDA has not exercised its authority even when the post-approval data is incomplete.

3 Changes to accelerated approval program The key FDORA provisions related to accelerated approval include the following: Post-approval study elements must be agreed upon pre-approval FDORA requires the FDA to specify the conditions for any post-approval studies by the date of the accelerated approval and gives the agency much flexibility in setting forth such conditions, which may include enrollment targets, study protocol and milestones  including the target date of study completion.

Timing to start confirmatory studies FDORA allows, but does not mandate, the FDA to require, as appropriate, that certain post-approval studies already be underway prior to accelerated approval or within a specified time from the date of approval.

In other words, certain post-approval studies have to start before the accelerated approval or shortly after it.

FDORA leaves it to the agency to explain the standards for setting forth such start date requirements.

Increased transparency for confirmatory studies If the FDA determines that a post-approval study is not required, the agency must publish the rationale for the determination on its website.

FDORA does not specify where the FDA will post this information.

Currently, the FDA only posts separately the accelerated approvals and post-market requirements and commitments .

Expedited withdrawal procedure FDORA creates a formal expedited withdrawal procedure for drugs approved through accelerated approval.

The new procedure allows for additional transparency while still affording the sponsor due process.

Specifically, the FDA must provide sponsors with notice and an explanation for the proposed withdrawal.

The sponsor will have an opportunity to meet with and file a written appeal to the FDA commissioner (or a designee).

At the request of the sponsor, an advisory committee also may be convened and consulted on issues related to the proposed withdrawal, if no such committee had previously advised the FDA on the matter.

In addition, the FDA must publish the withdrawal proposal for public comments  and later a summary of the comments and the agencys response  on its website.

Previously, the law 4 only required an opportunity for an informal hearing.

The regulations 5 provided more details to the withdrawal procedure, including that a hearing would follow Part 15 regulations and that the FDAs withdrawal decision would constitute a final agency action subject to judicial review, if petitioned.

The Code of Federal Regulations will be revised to reflect the changes from FDORA.

Post-approval reporting Pre-FDORA, sponsors were required to submit reports to the FDA annually following approval.

FDORA increases the frequency and timing of the reporting period for sponsors to every six months and requires the FDA to publish the reported information on its website.

Enforcement FDORA amends the prohibited act provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 6 to include new prohibitions covering the failure to conduct with due diligence any post-approval study required by an accelerated approval and the failure to submit timely progress reports for post-approval studies.

Guidance documents FDORA requires the FDA to issue multiple guidance documents regarding accelerated approval and post-approval studies, including guidance documents that address the use of novel clinical trial design for post-approval studies, as well as guidance addressing discussion of novel surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoints in early stages with the FDA."
Cooley,FDORA Changes to the FDA Accelerated Approval Program,"All draft guidance must be issued within 18 months of the enactment of FDORA (by June 29, 2024), with final guidance required no later than one year after the close of the public comment period on the draft guidance.

For highly technical issues, including, for example, the development of efficacy endpoints for rare diseases, 7 FDORA directs the FDA to promulgate non-binding guidance (rather than regulations) to provide information to the industry.

Accelerated approval council FDORA requires the FDA to form an intra-agency coordinating council within one year of the enactment of FDORA.

Membership includes the directors of seven specified centers and offices within the FDA, as well as at least three directors of review divisions or offices overseeing products approved under the accelerated approval pathway.

8

The council is tasked with ensuring consistent and appropriate use of accelerated approval across the agency through direct engagement with product review teams.

The council also is required to publish an annual report of its activities on the FDAs website.

Putting FDORA in context  Whats next for industry and the FDA?

Overall, the new legal requirements attempt to address the concerns that have emerged around the accelerated approval pathway in recent years and may help reverse some of the trends found within OIGs report.

The additional requirements around post-approval studies and revised timelines for progress reports are more onerous for sponsors, but the forthcoming agency guidance, formation of the accelerated approval council, and the multiple new reporting and publishing requirements related to the accelerated approval pathway will likely increase transparency and help restore the integrity of the program.

Making accelerated approval a viable and credible pathway is in the best interests of the FDA, patients and sponsors and will hopefully help avoid the degree of cost-benefit battle over pricing and reimbursement that Biogen faced with Aduhelm. 9

Although FDORA establishes multiple new requirements with respect to accelerated approval, the text of the law is relatively sparse, leaving open questions as to how the FDA will implement the new requirements.

With respect to confirmatory studies, the law does not contain criteria specifying when it is appropriate to require a study to begin  prior to approval or shortly after  leaving the determination up to the FDA.

10

This begs the question as to whether the FDA will make the determination on a case-by-case basis, or whether it will develop guidance or formalize any specific criteria used to make the determination.

The law also leaves open what constitutes an adequate rationale to not require a post-approval study and who ultimately is responsible for developing such a rationale.

The expedited withdrawal procedure contained in the law also contains ambiguity as to the sequence and timing for the various reviews and appeals offered to the sponsor.

Must a sponsor exhaust all other available avenues before requesting an advisory committee, or may a sponsor avail itself of this option immediately?

Is consultation with a withdrawal advisory committee governed by Part 14?

11

When in the decision-making process does the FDAs action constitute final agency action such that a sponsor may petition for judicial review?

Given these open questions, as well as the tension now created between FDORA and current regulations, 12 it will be challenging for the FDA to update these regulations and promulgate new guidance consistent with the statutory mandate.

Finally, questions remain as to whether and how the FDA will take advantage of the new enforcement provisions.

Given that the accelerated approval pathway aims to fulfill unmet needs for patients dealing with serious or life-threatening conditions, the agency may be hesitant to take actions, such as product seizure, that could adversely impact these patient populations."
Cooley,FDORA Changes to the FDA Accelerated Approval Program,"The FDA also will face oversight pressure to utilize the new enhanced withdrawal and enforcement authorities afforded under FDORA to ensure that the accelerated approval pathway is not abused.

With all of these open questions, as well as the new obligations placed upon the FDA, it will likely be years before the full effects of the law are felt.

Cooleys FDA team will continue to monitor updates in this space.

Please reach out to us if you have any questions, including how the improved transparency may benefit your product candidates potential development pathway.

The study highlights hydroxyprogesterone caproate (Makena), which was approved through the accelerated approval pathway in 2011.

Although the sponsor completed the requisite study, it was completed 64 months past the original planned date and failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit.

The FDA began the withdrawal process in 2020, which included numerous exchanges between the agency and sponsor, as well as a request for a hearing.

A hearing before the commissioner and an advisory committee was held in October 2022, with the committee voting to remove Makena from the market.

The drug is currently still on the market, as the final decision from the commissioner is pending.

Cooley,What Is International Arbitration?,"International arbitration is a method of dispute resolution where the parties agree to resolve their disputes before private arbitrators instead of a national court.

For most cross-border transactions, international arbitration is generally recognized as the preferred dispute resolution mechanism because it creates a neutral forum, awards are usually easier to enforce than court judgments, and parties can choose who decides their dispute.

Parties must agree to arbitrate.

The most common way they do so is by including an arbitration clause in their commercial agreements.

If there is no arbitration clause, parties can also agree to submit a dispute to arbitration after it has arisen.

This is called a submission agreement.

In the arbitration clause, the parties frequently agree on critical parts of the arbitral process, including the arbitral institution that will administer the arbitration, the number of arbitrators and how they will be appointed, the legal place of arbitration (also called the seat), and the language of the arbitration.

Sometimes, they will also specify the governing law of the arbitration (which does not need to be the same as the substantive law governing the contract).

The scope of the arbitrators authority is determined by the arbitration clause and the law of the seat of arbitration.

The arbitral process concludes with the arbitrators issuing a final award, which is binding on the parties and can be enforced in most courts around the world.

There is usually no right of appeal and the award can only be set aside (or vacated) on limited grounds.

Key features of international arbitration Enforceability One of the main advantages of international arbitration over litigation is that in most countries, international arbitration awards are easier to enforce than foreign court judgments.

Over 170 countries have ratified the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 (also known as the New York Convention), a multilateral treaty for the recognition and enforcement of international arbitration agreements and awards.

Under the New York Convention, non-domestic arbitral awards are enforceable in any of the ratifying states subject to certain narrow exceptions.

Neutrality International arbitration provides a neutral forum for resolving cross-border disputes.

This is particularly important when the parties want to avoid giving the other a local court advantage, or where the domestic judicial system of one party may be unfamiliar, complex, or challenging to navigate.

Privacy and Confidentiality Unlike for court filings, the submissions, rulings, and orders issued by an international arbitral tribunal are generally not available to the public and are communicated only to the parties.

Hearings are also usually not open to the public.

Further, the parties can agree that the existence and content of the arbitration will be kept confidential.

Choice of Arbitrators Parties can specify any qualifications for arbitrators in their arbitration clause, such as experience in a certain area of the law, industry, subject area, or otherwise select arbitrators that have the background or expertise they believe are relevant to the case.

Finality Generally, an arbitration award is final and binding and there is no right of appeal.

Also, awards usually cannot be set aside (or vacated) except in limited circumstances, often centered around due process or the power of the arbitrators, and not the merits of the award.

Autonomy As a private and mutually agreed-upon form of dispute resolution, international arbitration is less formal than judicial proceedings and allows the parties a degree of flexibility and autonomy to agree on things like how the arbitration will be conducted, the procedural rules, and where the arbitration hearing will be held."
Cooley,What Companies Need to Know About Abuse of Dominance,"Companies are usually constrained in their commercial behavior by competitors, customers and consumers.

Where such constraints are weak and ineffective, the company is considered to hold market power.

When market power allows a company, over time, to behave independently from other market actors, such company is deemed to exercise a dominant market position.

Dominance per se is not unlawful.

Rather, it is the abuse of dominance  particularly if used to weaken competitive dynamics by excluding rivals and harming consumers  that is unlawful.

Definition of dominance Dominance is established by reference to specifically defined geographic and product markets.

To define markets, antitrust authorities consider whether there is demand and supply substitutability between the products , as well as potential competition through entry or expansion.

Competition authorities usually rely on market share as a proxy for market power; however, the finding of a dominant position is based on an overall assessment of all relevant factors.

In general, a company with a market share below 40% is unlikely to be regarded as dominant.

Examples of abusive practice Exclusive dealing: The dominant company requires or gives incentives (for instance, loyalty rebates) to customers to deal only with the dominant supplier.

Refusal to deal : The dominant company refuses to supply an essential input to a downstream competitor.

Predatory pricing : The dominant company foregoes short-term profits by pricing below cost in order to drive out or discourage competitors.

Leveraging through tying : The dominant company conditions the sale of one product on the sale of another.

Anti-competitive use of intellectual property rights: The dominant company employs a pay-for-delay strategy or abuses the patent system.

Consequences A company that abuses a position of dominance faces serious consequences.

The company itself can face fines and be exposed to actions from third parties who have suffered loss because of the dominant companys anti-competitive behavior.

In addition, individuals in certain jurisdictions can be disqualified from serving as a company director."
Cooley,An Overview of European Products Regulation,"The regulation of products is extensively governed by legislation that operates on a European Union-wide level.

While it can be a complex and sometimes onerous regulatory system, it brings some important benefits for product manufacturers.

First, the regimes, for the most part, provide clear guardrails to help companies design products with confidence that, if the rules are complied with, will be acceptable to be marketed.

Second, compliance with the rules potentially opens the door for the same product to be sold in 27 or more countries  without further testing or design changes needed.

Some product categories are governed by sector-specific (vertical) measures.

Many of the sector-specific regimes are those that require the products to carry the CE marking, which serves as the manufacturers declaration that the product complies with all the requirements of the applicable European regulatory regime.

To the extent that consumer products are not covered by vertical measures, they will be subject to horizontal measures under Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety  the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD).

Under the GPSD, a product is any product, including in the context of providing a service, which is: Intended for consumers, or that is reasonably foreseeable to be used by consumers, whether intended for them or not.

Supplied or made available, for free or not, in the course of a commercial activity.

New, used or reconditioned.

Examples of vertical sector-specific measures include directives and regulations governing the safety of: Toys Low-voltage electrical equipment Cosmetics Personal protective equipment Machinery Radio equipment Motor vehicles Medical devices Medicines Equipment for use in explosive atmospheres Other relevant horizontal measures include: Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 on the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (REACH Regulation), which addresses the production and use of chemical substances in the EU.

Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 on the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP Regulation), which incorporates the classification and labelling criteria agreed upon at the United Nations, and requires manufacturers to appropriately classify, label and pack products that contain dangerous substances and mixtures before placing them into the consumer market.

Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment (recast WEEE Directive), which regulates waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and provides for the creation of collection schemes where consumers can return such equipment free of charge.

Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (recast RoHS Directive), which governs the restriction on use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.

Regulation (EU) 1007/2011 on textile fiber names and related labelling and marking of the fiber composition of textile products (Textiles Regulation), which regulates fiber names and related labelling requirements for textile products.

For the most part, these regimes are enforced at a national level, and are therefore subject to some degree of differences in interpretation and enforcement.

There also will be some limited requirements that arise from national laws in Europe, such as translations into the local language.

The European product regulatory regime is dynamic, and changes are frequent."
Cooley,Data Protection Officers: What US Companies Need to Know,"As set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a data protection officer (DPO) plays a crucial role in the data privacy landscape.

The provisions covering the designation, position and tasks of a DPO are detailed in Articles 37, 38 and 39 of the GDPR.

Who needs to appoint a DPO?

In principle, public authorities and companies that carry out systematic and regular monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or those whose core activities involve processing special categories of data or criminal convictions on a large scale, should appoint a DPO.

However, European Union (EU) Member States have established additional rules for appointing a DPO depending on, for example, the number of employees the company has (i.e., Germany) or the processing activities or industry of the company (i.e., Spain).

The appointment of a DPO is not a requirement just for controllers.

Processors also must appoint a DPO if they meet the thresholds mentioned above.

Who can be a DPO?

The role of the DPO is to act as an intermediary between the organization, the data protection authorities (DPAs) and the data subjects.

Therefore, when appointing a DPO, the contact details for the local DPO in each establishment where the organization is based should be available to data subjects and DPAs.

A group of undertakings may appoint a single DPO, provided that the DPO is easily accessible from each establishment.

The DPO does not necessarily need to be based in the EU.

However, it is useful to appoint a DPO based in the same time zone or who can communicate in the same language as the relevant DPA where the organization is established.

A DPO can be an individual or an organization, and organizations can outsource the role of the DPO or appoint someone within the organization.

Before appointing someone internally as DPO, it is important that the organization carries out an ad hoc assessment to determine who can be appointed as a DPO, as some roles (such as the chief information security officer or the general counsel) could end up being in conflict with the responsibilities of a DPO.

The DPO cannot have a role requiring them to determine the means and purposes of processing data, and the DPO cannot be the same person as the EU representative, since this role is incompatible with the independence criteria needed for a DPO.

The organization also should have internal protocols to ensure that the DPO is independent.

In addition, the DPO should have authoritative knowledge of data protection laws and practices and the ability to fulfill their tasks and should directly report to the highest management level of the organization (ideally, the board of directors).

The organization should provide the DPO with the resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations to maintain their expert knowledge.

What are the main functions of a DPO?

The DPO should have at least the following tasks or functions, according to the GDPR:

Informing and advising the organization and its employees of their obligations pursuant to the GDPR.

Monitoring compliance with the GDPR and with the policies of the organization in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and related audits.

Providing advice where requested regarding the data protection impact assessment and monitoring its performance.

Cooperating with the DPAs.

Acting as the contact point for DPAs on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36 , and consulting, where appropriate, about any other matter.

What happens if we do not agree with the DPO?

Can we dismiss the DPO?

It is acceptable for organizations to disagree with the DPO."
Cooley,Data Protection Officers: What US Companies Need to Know,"What happens if we do not agree with the DPO?

Can we dismiss the DPO?

It is acceptable for organizations to disagree with the DPO.

However, in such cases, they should document their decisions when there is a discrepancy between the DPO and the business, and expressly state why the organization is not following the decision of the DPO.

DPOs do have certain protections to safeguard their independence.

Under the GDPR, these protections are not to suffer detriment and dismissal.

DPOs are not protected in all circumstances  for example, they can be dismissed for gross misconduct.

Is the DPO liable for the organizations breaches of the GPDR?

What happens if we do not appoint a DPO?

The DPO is responsible for monitoring compliance with the GDPR by the organization, but the DPO is not liable for breaches made by the organization.

Failing to appoint a DPO where one is required may attract a fine of 10 million euros or 2% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher."
Cooley,Considerations for US Companies Hiring Abroad,"There are many reasons your business might consider hiring in or transferring current employees to a country where your company currently does not have a presence.

Perhaps you are expanding into a new geographical market, have identified a talented individual you want to bring onboard, or have a key employee you want to retain who needs to move overseas.

Whatever the rationale, there are important employment-related issues that you need to consider each time you plan to hire in a new jurisdiction.

Permanent establishment risk In short, you could create a corporate tax presence of the entity that you use to employ individuals within the jurisdiction they are working from.

For example, if you use a company incorporated in the UK to employ an individual who lives and works in Germany, there may be a risk that you will create a taxable presence of the UK company in Germany as a result.

Check the permanent establishment risk with your accountants or your tax counsel, who may advise that it would be better to incorporate a local subsidiary.

Immigration You will need to check that employees have the legal right to live and work in the jurisdiction that they are working from.

Applicable law Individuals are likely to benefit from the protection of the employment laws of the country that they are working from, such as mandatory minimum holiday time, benefits and termination rights.

For that reason, you will need to establish a local law-compliant employment contract to ensure that you are properly protected (for example, in respect to your confidential information and intellectual property) and fulfill your legal obligations as an employer.

Payroll obligations Having an employee work in a particular jurisdiction is likely to trigger obligations to register as an employer and run payroll in that country.

That position can be complex (and the rules relating to income tax and social security contributions may be different), so you will want advice from lawyers or accountants in that jurisdiction.

Insurance and benefits You should confirm what mandatory minimum insurance and benefits you need to put in place for employees working abroad.

For example, employers in the UK are required to have employers liability insurance in place with a mandatory minimum level of coverage and to automatically enroll employees into a pension scheme that meets certain compulsory minimum requirements.

Stock options If you plan to grant stock options (or other equity incentives) to employees working abroad, local tax, securities, exchange control and employment laws are likely to apply.

This is also the case if employees have already been granted stock options that may continue to vest and/or be exercised while they are abroad  the cross-border tax implications can be particularly complex.

For these reasons, seek local law and tax advice for the jurisdiction in which you are considering hiring to ensure that the expansion is established and structured in a compliant and effective manner."
Cooley,10 Key Issues for US Flip Transactions,"When structuring a flip transaction  a deal in which shareholders in an overseas company exchange their shares for shares in a new US company  there are multiple initial issues to consider as outlined below.

In a flip transaction, the new US company becomes the parent company, and the overseas company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent.

1.

Tax planning and tax clearances (if required) for current shareholders To identify taxes triggered by the flip for current shareholders in an overseas company and determine future tax consequences (e.g., controlled foreign corporation rules):

Consider tax consequences for individual and corporate/institutional shareholders.

Explore steps to minimize tax impact (e.g., individuals holding shares through a corporate entity).

Find out whether other arrangements could alleviate costs if the flip is taxable for a shareholder.

2. Cap table review Do smaller or friends and family shareholders wish to participate in the flip, or should they be bought out by larger shareholders?

3. Relocation of management and/or employees Is relocation  permanent or secondment (temporary)  of overseas employees or founders to the US required?

Consider: Secondment or relocation terms, tax equalization, etc. Immigration clearance or visas  think about employee eligibility and the timing of the visa process.

4. Incorporation in the United States A flip typically is incorporated as a Delaware corporation.

The timing depends on commercial needs, financial resources and other factors.

Ask: Is the goal to complete the flip as soon as possible or just prior to a US financing?

5.

Share exchange/flip process Determine the method of exchanging shares in the overseas company: Share purchase or exchange agreement, especially if there is a small number of shareholders.

Using drag-along rights in articles and constitutional documents.

Scheme of arrangement or other court-sanctioned reorganization process (least desirable).

6. US securities compliance procedures For the issue of shares in the new US company, identify appropriate US securities law exemptions (e.g. accredited investors).

7. Overseas company shareholders Identify securities law compliance procedures (e.g., information memorandum, filings, notices, etc.)

based on country of residence of shareholders for: Sale/exchange of overseas company shares.

Issue of securities (shares or warrants to shareholders, options to employees, etc.)

in the new US company.

8. Overseas company share options How should you handle existing options or warrants: exercise, cancel or replace?

9. Business or asset transfer to US If some or all of the overseas companys business is relocated to the US, consider: Third-party consents/novation of agreements and change-of-control issues in key contracts.

Identifying and scheduling all assets, contracts, and liabilities.

Do government grants restrict transfer of intellectual property to US?

Does the flip affect the overseas companys tax losses?

(And how to maintain and utilize going forward?)

10.

Intercompany arrangements Agree on the post-flip role of the new US company and the overseas company based on commercial, operational and tax-planning needs  and document with appropriate arms-length intercompany agreements."
Cooley,Key Components of US Anti-Money Laundering Law,"On January 1, 2021, the US Congress enacted the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

Incorporated within the NDAA is the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act), which created the most significant reforms to US anti-money laundering laws since the passage of the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act.

These reforms have implications for companies and individuals with foreign operations and foreign bank accounts, virtual and cryptocurrency companies, and even art dealers, advisers and consultants.

Key provisions of the AML Act are detailed below.

Expanded authority to subpoena foreign banks The AML Act expanded the Department of Justice (DOJ) and US Treasurys authority to subpoena records from foreign banks.

Before passage of the AML Act, the DOJ had three possible methods for obtaining documents from foreign banks: Make a request under a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT).

Serve a Bank of Nova Scotia subpoena upon a US branch of a foreign bank or business for records located abroad.

S ubpoena foreign banks maintaining correspondent accounts in the US pursuant to 31 USC  5318(k)(3), but only for records related to those correspondent accounts .

The timing and limitations of these procedures make them cumbersome and often prohibitive for US regulators to obtain foreign banking information.

The AML Act changed this, allowing the DOJ and US Treasury to subpoena foreign banks that maintain a correspondent account in the US and request  any records relating to the correspondent account or any account at the foreign bank, including records maintained outside the United States, as long as they are the subject of a civil forfeiture action, an investigation pursuant to 31 USC  5318A, or an investigation into a violation of criminal law or the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).

If the foreign bank refuses to respond, the DOJ can ask a federal district court in the jurisdiction where the investigation is occurring to compel compliance with the subpoena.

Banks that continue to ignore the subpoena will face contempt sanctions and potential termination of correspondent accounts.

Increased criminal and civil penalties for BSA violations The AML Act added two new criminal provisions to the BSA  both intended to crack down on intentionally providing deceptive information to banks and provide the DOJ with enhanced tools to target international corruption  and established a number of new penalties.

It created a new prohibition on knowingly concealing or misrepresenting a material fact from or to a financial institution concerning the ownership or control of assets involved in transactions of more than $1million and including assets of a senior foreign political figure, close family member or other close associate.

In addition, the AML Act made it a crime to knowingly conceal or misrepresent a material fact from or to a financial institution concerning the source of funds in a transaction involving an entity that is a primary money laundering concern.

The penalties for violating these provisions are up to 10 years imprisonment and/or a $1million fine.

The AML Act also increased penalties for repeat and egregious violators of the BSA, including higher civil penalties and prohibitions on violators serving on the boards of financial institutions.

Expanded coverage for cryptocurrency and antiquities The AML Act revised a number of definitions to broaden the BSAs reach to prohibit money laundering in regard to virtual currencies, art and artifacts.

In other words, all the provisions of the BSA now apply to transactions with institutions dealing in virtual or cryptocurrencies, as well as to persons working in the antiquities trade, including advisers and consultants who solicit the sale of antiquities."
Cooley,Key Components of US Anti-Money Laundering Law,"Beneficial ownership registration The AML Act created a new uniform beneficial ownership reporting program that applies to reporting companies  defined as corporations, limited liability companies or other similar entities that are either created by filing a document with a secretary of state or formed under the law of a foreign country and registered to do business in the US.

Certain entities already required to disclose beneficial ownership information are exempt from the new reporting program.

Companies subject to the new program must disclose their beneficial owners to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

A beneficial owner is an individual who directly or indirectly exercises substantial control over the company or owns or controls not less than 25% of the ownership interests in the company.

Already existing corporations have two years to report their beneficial ownership, whereas new reporting companies must start reporting this information at the time of formation or incorporation.

Any changes to beneficial ownership information must be reported within one year.

Enhanced whistleblower provisions The AML Act expanded the existing BSA whistleblower program to increase protections and rewards for whistleblowers of suspected money laundering.

Specifically, the AML Act provides that when an enforcement action results in monetary sanctions of more than $1 million, the Treasury secretary shall pay an award of up to 30% of what was collected to the whistleblower who provided the pertinent information.

The AML Act also includes protections against retaliation for whistleblowers who provide information to their employer, the DOJ or the US Treasury."
Cooley,FDA Doubles Down on Its Pre-Catalyst Stance on Orphan Drug Exclusivity,"On January 24, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration published a notice in the Federal Register to address the uncertainty created by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuits September 30, 2021, decision in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra .

In the notice, the FDA noted that it had complied with the courts order to set aside its approval of Jacobus Pharmaceutical Co.s drug, but explained that in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the agency intends to apply its existing regulations and long-standing approach to grant orphan drug exclusivity based on the indications for which the drug is approved rather than granting the exclusivity for the entire rare disease or condition that was the subject of the orphan drug designation (as the Catalyst court instructed the FDA to do).

While the FDAs recent announcement may calm the waters for industry, it also leaves the agency open to legal challenge, particularly in the Eleventh Circuit, where Catalyst is binding precedent.

That said, the FDAs public Federal Register notice also could serve a protective role in any future Administrative Procedure Act litigation based on the agencys failure to more broadly apply the Catalyst courts interpretation of the statute, in that the FDA could assert that industry is on notice about the agencys planned approach, which is consistent with its past, pre- Catalyst precedent.

FDA historically tied orphan drug exclusivity to the scope of the drugs approval Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population of 200,000 or more in the US where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the US.

In the US, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as tax advantages and user fee waivers.

In addition, if a drug or biologic with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for a particular active ingredient or principal molecular structural features for the indication for which it has such a designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during that time period, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with existing orphan drug exclusivity, or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.

Traditionally, the FDA has taken a narrow approach to the meaning of the phrase same drug, interpreting it in the context of exclusivity as limited to the indication or use for which the orphan drug product was approved.

The intent of this approach was to permit multiple orphan-drug exclusive approvals for multiple subsets of the same underlying orphan disease or condition, which the agency believed is consistent with the purpose of the Orphan Drug Act because it provides an important incentive for one or more sponsors to develop, or to continue to develop, a potentially promising drug for use in all persons affected by a rare disease or condition, rather than in just a subset of that orphan population, even after the drug has been approved for a different subset of the population with the disease or condition.

1"
Cooley,FDA Doubles Down on Its Pre-Catalyst Stance on Orphan Drug Exclusivity,"1

Therefore, historically, orphan drug exclusivity did not offer products total protection from competition from the same or a different drug approved for the same disease or condition, because orphan drug exclusivity did not prevent the FDA from approving the same or a different drug in a different indication (including different patient populations) for the same disease or condition.

This means that even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA could approve a later application for the same drug for the same condition before the expiration of the seven-year exclusivity period because the FDA has interpreted same disease or condition to meant same use or indication.

A brief detour: The Catalyst decision Catalyst involved a dispute between two entities that had been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the same drug for the same rare disease.

Catalyst Pharmaceuticals was the orphan drug exclusivity holder for its drug FIRDAPSE to treat adults with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), a rare autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the bodys own tissues.

Jacobus was approved subsequently, during the window of FIRDAPSEs exclusivity, for its drug, RUZURGI, which also received orphan drug exclusivity, but not because it showed clinical superiority to FIRDAPSE or because FIRDAPSE was unavailable in sufficient quantities to meet patient need.

Rather, the FDA approved RUZURGI during FIRDAPSEs orphan exclusivity period because RUZURGI was approved to treat pediatric patients with LEMS, and not adults.

To the FDA, this distinct patient population meant that RUZURGI was not approved for the same disease or condition because the FDAs view was that the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity was tied to the scope of approval  where two drugs were approved for the same rare disease, but had different indications (i.e., one drug indicated to treat adults and the other to treat pediatric populations), both could be approved as orphan drugs.

As noted by the Catalyst court, however, Jacobus never submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) seeking pediatric-only approval, and never conducted any clinical trials in children.

2 All of the patients involved in Jacobus clinical trials were adults.

3 Jacobus did submit limited data on pediatric safety, but not efficacy  even though both safety and efficacy data are required for approval of an NDA.

4 Against the backdrop of these compelling facts, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the lower courts application of Chevron to defer to the FDAs statutory interpretation, and concluded that the FDAs argument that orphan drug exclusivity is tied to the scope of a drugs approval had no basis in the plain language of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).

Rather, the Eleventh Circuit held that the phrase same disease or condition in the statute referred to the rare disease or condition that was the subject of the orphan drug designation and, therefore, the corresponding orphan drug exclusivity properly referred to the entire rare disease or condition, and not just a narrowed indication.

Accordingly, the Eleventh Circuit ordered the FDA to set aside the RUZURGI approval due to FIRDAPSEs orphan drug exclusivity.

Since the Eleventh Circuit held that the FDAs interpretation violated the plain language of the FDCA, rare disease sponsors remained in limbo wondering how the FDA would define the scope of orphan drug exclusivity in a post- Catalyst world.

FDAs response to Catalyst The FDA may have been waiting for a legislative fix to the problem, such as the proposed Retaining Access and Restoring Exclusivity (RARE) Act , consistent with how the agency dealt with similar setbacks in previous orphan drug cases.

5"
Cooley,FDA Doubles Down on Its Pre-Catalyst Stance on Orphan Drug Exclusivity,"5

While the agency was waiting for Congress to come to its rescue, it was reported that the FDAs Office of Orphan Products Development had deferred pending orphan drug exclusivity determinations, listing them as TBD in the Orange Book.

With the recent passage of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, which did not include any provisions of the RARE Act that could support the agencys long-standing approach to grant exclusivity based on the scope of approval rather than the scope of the orphan drug designation, the FDA turned to other means and landed on a public announcement of the dire impact of the Catalyst case on its website, and the Federal Register notice drumming the same beat in support of the agencys public rebuff of the Eleventh Circuits rationale.

What remains to be seen is how legal challenges in the Eleventh Circuit will be handled in light of the direct affront the FDA has raised to Catalyst .

After all, while the Eleventh Circuits decision is only persuasive authority in the rest of the country, it is binding in that circuit.

Whether a litigant can succeed in relying on Catalyst likely will depend on the key factual issues that made Catalyst an ideal vehicle to challenge the FDAs statutory interpretation, such as the agencys decision to administratively split an NDA to allow a pediatric-only indication to move forward based on efficacy data from trials only conducted with adults, 6 and an underlying rare disease where the disease mechanism, the pathophysiology, the clinical symptoms, the treatment regimens, and even adverse events are the same for both adults and children.

7 Takeaways The FDAs long-held view about the goals of the Orphan Drug Act, which jibe with the agencys overarching public health mission, resulted in a Federal Register notice that openly challenges a federal appellate courts interpretation of the FDCA.

While rare disease sponsors can take some comfort in having clarity on the agencys position (and hopefully the logjam of orphan drug exclusivity decisions will now subside), sponsors seeking to challenge the agencys interpretation can attempt to use the Catalyst playbook  at least until a(nother) legislative fix comes along to support the FDAs long-held interpretation.

Law clerk Madelon Bird also contributed to this alert.

Cooley,"Q4 2022 Venture Financing Report – Downward Trends Continue in Deal Count, Invested Capital and Pre-Money Valuations, Up Rounds Drop to Less Than 80% of All Deals","Cooley handled 269 reported venture capital financings for Q4 2022, representing $6.1 billion of invested capital.

This is the lowest deal count since Q4 2019 and the lowest invested capital since Q1 2019.

By comparison, in Q4 2021, we handled 428 reported VC financings with invested capital of $23.2 billion (a record high for deal count and near-record high for invested capital).

Both deal count and invested capital have declined over the past three quarters, consistent with trends seen in the broader market.

We have witnessed the downward trend in amounts raised during 2022 across all stages of financing, but the decline is most significant in mid- to late-stage deals.

Series D and later deals have seen a 78% drop, from $10.5 billion in Q4 2021 to just $2.3 billion in Q4 2022.

The drop in amount raised in Series C deals was even more significant at just over 87%, from $3 billion in Q4 2021 to $377 million in Q4 2022.

The 2022 drop was nearly 74% for Series B deals (from $5.3 billion to $1.4 billion), just under 58% for Series A deals (from $3.5 billion to $1.5 billion) and just over 38% for seed deals (from $932 million to $576 million).

While the percentage decline in amount raised for Series D and later deals during the full year of 2022 is consistent with that seen in the first three quarters of 2022, the decline increased meaningfully for Series C deals and earlier between the first three quarters  where the decline was 64% for Series C, 61% for Series B, 50% for Series A and only 9% for seed deals  versus the full year.

Median pre-money valuations for mid- to late-stage deals are down from highs seen during 2021, returning to levels aligned with those seen in 2020.

Series A valuations also are down from the highs seen in late 2021 but are generally still higher than pre-pandemic levels.

The valuations for seed deals were somewhat down during late 2022 compared to earlier in the year, but they generally remain high, consistent with levels seen since mid-2021.

The percentage of deals (at all stages) with a median pre-money valuation of greater than or equal to $100 million remains low at 26% of deals for December 2022, the lowest percentage seen since April 2020.

Overall, the percentage of up rounds continued to decline, representing just 79% of deals for Q4 2022.

Up rounds have not represented less than 80% of deals since Q1 2017.

Down rounds represented 14% of deals during Q4 2022, and flat rounds represented 7% of deals during Q4 2022, the highest percentages reported since Q2 2020 for down rounds and Q3 2020 for flat rounds.

Despite the decline in invested dollars, deal volume, valuations and up rounds, deal terms themselves continued to be generally favorable for companies in Q4 2022.

During the quarter, 96% of our reported deals had non-participating preferred stock, up just slightly from the 95% reported for Q3 2022.

The percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision remained low, at just 4.1% of reported deals, consistent with the percentages for such deals throughout 2022.

The percentage of deals involving a recapitalization continued to decline, representing just 0.37% of deals in Q4 2022, returning to a percentage equivalent to those seen in Q1 2022 and during 2021.

In PitchBooks Q3 2022 Global League Tables, Cooley continued to hold the top spot globally and in the US for representation of companies in venture capital transactions and was ranked as the #1 law firm for representation in late-stage venture financings.

Cooley also ranked as the most active law firm in various industry sectors for venture capital financings  including in pharma and biotech, energy, healthcare (devices and supplies, services and systems), IT hardware and media.

During the quarter, Cooley handled 157 reported financings of tech companies, representing more than $4 billion of invested capital.

This is the lowest deal volume for tech companies since Q4 2019, when Cooley handled 136 reported deals, and the lowest amount raised since Q1 2020, when Cooley handled 162 reported deals representing more than $3.7 billion of invested capital.

As with counts across all industries, the deal count and invested capital for tech company venture financings for Q4 2022 is down significantly since one year ago, when Cooley handled 235 reported venture financing deals for tech companies, representing more than $11.5 billion of invested capital for Q4 2021.

Average reported deal size remained the same during the quarter for venture financings of tech companies at just under $26 million in Q4 2022, compared to just over $26 million in Q3 2022, both down from more than $49 million in Q4 2021.

Spotlight on life sciences In Q4 2022, Cooley handled 56 reported financings of life sciences companies, representing more than $1.2 billion of invested capital.

This deal count is up slightly, while the invested capital is down slightly, from 54 reported venture financing deals for life sciences companies, representing more than $1.4 billion of invested capital in Q3 2022.

Reported deal sizes for venture financings of life sciences companies also decreased to an average deal size of more than $22 million in the quarter, as compared to an average deal size of more than $26 million in Q3 2022  and well below the averages seen throughout 2021.

Similar to deals for tech companies and across all industries, the numbers for venture financing deals for life sciences companies were significantly down compared to Q4 2021, when Cooley handled 85 reported life sciences venture financing deals with invested capital of $5.5 billion and an average deal size of more than $64 million.

The percentage of life sciences venture financings structured in tranches increased to 25% of reported deals (up from 20% in Q3 2022).

This is the highest percentage of deals structured as tranches seen since Q3 2020.

Cooley,New Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Thresholds and Filing Fees Announced,"The Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act thresholds, which govern when acquisitions must be reported to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, will increase slightly more than 10% in February 2023.

The minimum size-of-transaction threshold will increase from $101 million to $111.4 million.

The increases, which are based on changes in the US gross national product, will go into effect on February 27, 2023.

The new six-tiered HSR filing fee structure passed by Congress last December will go into effect at the same time, raising filing fees to as high as $2.25 million for transactions valued at $5 billion or more (compared to a filing fee for an equivalent transaction of $280,000 in the past).

The new filing fee scheme is expected to significantly boost DOJ and FTC antitrust enforcement funding.

The HSR Act requires that parties to acquisitions, including acquisitions of voting securities and assets, notify the DOJ and the FTC, and observe a statutory waiting period if the acquisition meets specified size-of-person and size-of-transaction thresholds  and does not fall within an exemption to the HSR Act.

The waiting period, which is 30 days for most transactions, historically has been terminated early when transactions do not present substantive issues, but the Biden administration has stopped granting early terminations for almost all transactions since February 2021 .

In addition to adjustments to the minimum size-of-transaction threshold, the most significant adjustments are the following: The size-of-person test will increase from $20.2 million to $22.3 million and from $202 million to $222.7 million, with respect to the required level of annual net sales or total assets.

The larger size-of-transaction threshold, which is applicable even if the size-of-person test is not met, will increase from $403.9 million to $445.5 million, meaning that acquisitions of more than $445.5 million will be reportable regardless of whether the size-of-person threshold is met (unless an exemption applies).

The newly adopted HSR filing fee structure will be as follows: The FTC also announced revised dollar thresholds applicable to the size criteria applied under Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which governs the legality of interlocking directorates.

Under the updated thresholds, competitor corporations are covered by Section 8 if each one has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $45,257,000, with an exception if the competitive sales of either corporation are less than $4,525,700 (as adjusted).

The revised levels for these thresholds were effective as of January 20, 2023, upon publication in the Federal Register.

Finally, earlier this month, the FTC also announced an adjustment to the maximum daily civil penalty for HSR violations, which is adjusted for inflation (unlike the HSR thresholds, which are adjusted based on changes in the gross national product).

The current maximum daily civil penalty is now $50,120 per day, effective as of January 11, 2023.

HSR filing analyses  and determinations of which interlocking directorates may violate Section 8 of the Clayton Act  are highly technical.

The penalty is lowered to $50 if corrected within 30 days (by March 30 if the due date is February 28), and is lowered to $110 if corrected by August1, 2023, up to an aggregate annual limit of $3,532,500, or $1,177,500 for small businesses.

Penalties will not apply to any failure that the corporation can show was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

Similarly, every corporation that in 2022 records or has recorded by its transfer agent an initial transfer by a current or former employee of stock acquired by such employee under an ESPP  meaning a plan that is established under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code  must, on or before January 31, 2023, furnish to the current or former employee whos transferring the stock a written statement containing the information on Form 3922 when the purchase price is either: Less than 100% of the value of the stock on the grant date.

Not fixed or determinable on the grant date.

Form 3922 is available on the IRS website .

Copy A of Form 3922 is filed with the IRS, copy B is furnished to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained by the corporation for its records.

As explained above, the copy A that is filed with the IRS needs to be scannable.

Form of employee information statement The employee information statement must either be: Contained on the appropriate form (i.e., Form 3921 for ISO exercises or Form 3922 for ESPP stock transfers).

Contained on a substitute form that meets the format and content requirements in Publication 1179."
Cooley,Year-End Reporting for ISO Exercises and ESPP Stock Transfers,"Contained on a substitute form that meets the format and content requirements in Publication 1179.

A separate form must be filed for each transaction and, if an employee has more than one transaction during the year, each form must contain a unique account number, such as a number provided by equity tracking software.

However, if a substitute form is used, the company may aggregate transactions, providing a single form to each employee.

Delivery of employee information statement Employee information statements, either copy B of the applicable form or an acceptable substitute, may be mailed or delivered to the current or former employees last known address or may be sent electronically, provided that the person has given their consent to receive the statement electronically and the corporation meets certain other specified requirements.

IRS information return A corporation is required to file an information return with the IRS in addition to providing information statements to employees.

For exercises and transfers in 2022, the information returns must be filed no later than February 28, 2023, if filing by paper, and no later than March 31, 2023, if filing electronically (subject to extensions in certain declared disaster zones as noted above).

Companies filing 250 or more copies of Form 3921 or Form 3922 in a year (determined separately and not aggregated between them for purposes of this 250-form threshold) must file their information returns electronically.

The Taxpayer First Act of 2019, enacted July 1, 2019, authorized the US Treasury Department and the IRS to reduce the 250-return requirement, and regulations proposed in July 2021 reduced the 250-return threshold to 100 in 2022 and to 10 in 2023.

However, the proposed regulations have yet to be finalized, and the threshold remains at 250 until issuance of final regulations.

The information returns must contain the same information required by the Section 6039 regulations with respect to employee information statements.

Information returns for ISO exercises must be made on Form 3921, and information returns for ESPP stock transfers must be made on Form 3922.

It is possible to file Form 8809 to get an automatic 30-day extension to the due date for filing information returns.

Form 8809 is available on the IRS website , and the extension will only extend the due date for filing the returns with the IRS, not the due date for furnishing statements to recipients.

Information requirements As explained above, the information that corporations must provide to a current or former employee in an information statement is the same information that corporations must report to the IRS in an information return.

When reporting this information, corporations should use the applicable form for both the information statement and the information return.

Also as described above, copy A of the applicable form is filed with the IRS, copy B is provided to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained for the corporations records.

Form 3921 for ISO exercises must contain: The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation transferring the shares.

The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the current or former employee to whom the shares were transferred pursuant to the exercise of the ISO.

The grant date, the exercise price per share, the date of exercise, the fair market value per share on the date of exercise and the number of shares transferred pursuant to the exercise of the ISO.

Form 3922 for ESPP stock transfers must contain: The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation whose shares were transferred.

The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the current or former employee who transferred the shares.

The date the purchase right was granted to the current or former employee, and the fair market value per share on the grant date."

Cooley,Proposed FTC Rule Would Ban Most Noncompete Agreements,"On January 5, 2023, the Federal Trade Commission published a proposed rule that would categorically ban noncompete agreements between employers and a broad class of workers, including independent contractors and unpaid interns, senior executives, and everyone in between.

The proposed rule has no immediate impact and is likely to be challenged in court if it is made final, but companies should be aware of the development and consider alternative approaches to protect misuse of their confidential information.

Historically, the enforceability of employee noncompete agreements has been largely left to the states, with the vast majority of states evaluating these covenants under a reasonableness standard that accounts for employers legitimate interests in protecting confidential information and preventing free riding.

Only a handful of states  most notably, California, Oklahoma and North Dakota  have imposed broad bans.

Against this backdrop, if made final, the proposed rule would be a sea change in the enforceability of employee noncompete agreements.

The proposed rule was announced one day after the FTC announced settlements with several companies and individuals for allegedly imposing illegal restrictions on workers via noncompete agreements.

These actions follow earlier Biden administration efforts to protect competition in labor markets.

The proposed rule is now subject to a public comment period for 60 days.

If the FTC does issue a final rule, it would become effective only 180 days following publication.

It is not expected to go into effect until the end of 2023, at the earliest.

Key provisions of the rule The proposed rule could dramatically alter restrictive covenants law in the US.

Below are some key takeaways.

Worker defined broadly The proposed rule would apply broadly to all employees, independent contractors, externs, interns, volunteers, apprentices and sole proprietors who provide services to a client or customer.

No application to noncompete agreements between corporate entities Notably, the proposed rule is designed to protect people not businesses, and therefore it would not apply to noncompete agreements between corporate entities.

For example, while the rule would apply to protect franchise workers, it would not apply to noncompete agreements between franchisees and franchisers.

Limited application to deals The proposed rule would not apply to noncompete agreements entered into between merging or transacting companies, and it generally would not affect the use of noncompete agreements in deals, except in one fairly limited circumstance.

Recognizing the legitimate interest companies have in protecting the value of businesses they are acquiring, the FTC excepts from rule coverage noncompete agreements between a buyer and a seller where the person bound by the noncompete is an owner, member or partner holding at least a 25% ownership interest in a business entity and is selling the entirety of the ownership interest in the transaction.

The upshot is, merging companies can continue to enter into noncompete agreements with individual stakeholders of 25% or more without running afoul of the rule.

In contrast, noncompete agreements with individual stakeholders who hold less than a 25% ownership interest would be prohibited by the rule.

Implications for NDAs, nonsolicitation clauses and other restrictive covenants that could function as noncompete agreements While indicating that the proposed rule generally would not apply to other types of restrictive employment covenants  such as run-of-the-mill nondisclosure agreements and client or customer nonsolicitation agreements  the FTC has said that such restrictive covenants would be considered noncompete clauses covered by the scope of the rule where they effectively prevent a worker from working in the same field."
Cooley,Proposed FTC Rule Would Ban Most Noncompete Agreements,"Retroactive application Employers would be required to rescind existing noncompete agreements and individually notify current and former employees within 45 days of recission that those noncompete clauses are no longer in effect.

The proposed rule suggests safe harbor language for such notices.

Controversial, likely to be challenged in court The FTC vote to publish the proposed rule was 3  1, with Chair Lina Khan and Democratic Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya voting affirmatively.

Republican Commissioner Christine S. Wilson voted against the proposed rule, and in a dissenting statement said the rule represents a radical departure from hundreds of years of legal precedent that employs a fact-specific inquiry into whether a noncompete agreement is unreasonable or is justified by a legitimate business purpose.

She also argued that the commission lacks authority to engage in unfair methods of competition rulemaking and has little enforcement experience with employee noncompete agreements that would justify this rulemaking.

Wilsons criticisms have been echoed by critics who argue that noncompete agreements are needed to protect investment in employees and prevent sensitive and proprietary information from winding up in competitors hands.

On the other hand, proponents of the rule point to studies and research suggesting that noncompete agreements suppress wages and prevent labor mobility and are often used in situations with uneven power dynamics between companies and their workers.

FTC enforcement actions highlight the agencys concerns regarding noncompetes

The day before publishing the proposed noncompete rule, the FTC announced it had entered into consent agreements with companies and executives that had noncompetes with employees alleged to be an unfair method of competition in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The allegations in those matters track the FTCs concerns justifying the proposed rule.

In the matter of Prudential Security, et al.  

The FTC alleged Prudential Security, Inc., Prudential Command Inc. and two individual owners exploited bargaining power against low-wage security guards to restrict them from working for a competitor business within a 100-mile radius of their job site for two years and required employees to pay $100,000 for violations.

A Michigan state court struck down the restrictions as unreasonable; however, the company still required employees to sign the noncompete agreements.

As part of the consent agreement, the companies and owners are banned from enforcing any noncompete restriction on any current or past workers for the next 20 years.

In the matter of O-I Glass, Inc. and In the matter of Ardagh Group, et al.  Glass container manufacturers, O-I Glass, Inc. and Ardagh Group S.A.  both competing in what the FTC alleged is a highly concentrated market  imposed restrictions on workers for one to two years after leaving their employer, preventing them from performing similar services for competitors in the US, Canada and Mexico.

The companies allegedly imposed restrictions on employees in a variety of roles, including engineers, quality assurance and furnace workers.

As with the Prudential consent agreement, O-I Glass and Ardagh are prevented from enforcing noncompete agreements on employees for 20 years.

Wilson voted against these actions, expressing concern that the FTCs complaints did not offer evidence of anticompetitive effects in any relevant market.

She further noted that the complaints did not assess the reasonableness of the relevant noncompete agreements and seem[ed] to treat the noncompete clauses as per se unlawful, contrary to established case law.

Shifting landscape of state laws still in play while federal rule is being worked out Employer-employee noncompete agreements have long been unlawful in California, which has labor code provisions closely mirroring the proposed FTC rules."
Cooley,Proposed FTC Rule Would Ban Most Noncompete Agreements,"North Dakota and Oklahoma similarly have banned most noncompete agreements.

Most other states have statutes or case precedent suggesting that noncompete restrictions are disfavored.

In recent years, many states have taken action to limit use of noncompete agreements  including restrictions on who may be eligible with income limits, requirements for a garden leave period of pay commensurate with the restricted period, prohibitions on application to certain industries or professions, consideration that must be given in exchange for restrictions, time employed before enforceability, explicit notice periods and other limiting actions.

Among the states with relatively recent noncompete limitations are Colorado , Illinois , Massachusetts, Nevada and Washington.

The trend seems to be moving toward more free movement of talent and restricting the use of noncompete agreements against the majority of the workforce.

The FTCs proposed ban, if enacted, would likely be far more limiting for companies seeking to enforce restrictive covenants against workers than whats seen in most states.

Not only does the proposed rule contemplate a near blanket ban on noncompete agreements, but also companies would be subject to the notification requirements for any existing noncompete agreements with their workers.

Implications moving forward While the impact of the ban would be far-reaching, for now it is still a proposal and not a final rule.

Public comments and input from stakeholders will likely raise questions that the FTC will need to consider in assessing the rules scope.

Enforcing a blanket ban could impose hardships on businesses trying to protect competitive and sensitive information that could be given to a competitor or otherwise misused by a firms employees.

Companies should be conscious of the implications of the proposed ban and be proactive in developing policies and procedures that would reduce risk of misuse of sensitive information.

More thought will need to go into alternative means of protecting confidential information and intellectual property and preventing free riding on company investments, with other forms of restrictive covenants potentially playing a more important role going forward.

Given the uncertainty, employers may follow existing practices and state laws for the time being.

As with nearly all newly adopted rules, employers will almost certainly have notice and a grace period to come into compliance if the rule is finalized.

If the rule is never finalized, or is invalidated by court challenges, it may be hard in some states to seek noncompete agreements from employees hired without them in the interim.

Nonetheless, given the overall trend of legislatures and courts moving away from restraints on employment, a strategic review of restrictive covenant documentation and enforcement efforts is wise."
Cooley,"Annual SEC Filing Deadline for Venture, Private Equity Funds Is February 14, 2023","Venture and private equity funds that own equity securities of public companies may have numerous Securities and Exchange Commission filing requirements, including filings based on the size of the holdings of a particular portfolio company, aggregate holdings of securities across all public portfolio companies and filings triggered by the volume of sales and purchases of portfolio company equity securities.

These filing requirements may be annual or quarterly, and the filings are briefly described below.

Schedule 13G Funds  including their general partners and, in some cases, managing principals  that hold in excess of 5% of a class of public equity as of December 31, 2022, generally must file a Schedule 13G within 45 days of year-end.

Also, any fund that has previously filed a Schedule 13G with respect to a portfolio company must file an annual amendment to its Schedule 13G within 45 days of year-end if there have been any changes in ownership since the most recent filing  including an exit filing if the funds ownership has declined below 5%.

Form 13F Investment advisers who exercise investment discretion over Section 13(f) securities (generally equity securities of public companies) are required to file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter-end.

Subject to certain exceptions, if your funds collectively owned are in excess of $100 million of Section 13(f) securities as of the last day of any month during the 2022 calendar year, you are obligated to file a Form 13F for the quarter ending on December 31, 2022, within 45 days of calendar year-end.

This filing obligation continues for a minimum of three consecutive calendar quarters (i.e., March 31, June 30 and September 30), with filings due within 45 days of the relevant quarter-end.

It is important to note that even if you do not exceed the $100 million threshold as of December 31, the obligation to file a Form 13F for the quarter ending December 31 remains if the threshold was met as of the last day of any single month during the calendar year.

Form 13H Investment advisers who have previously filed a Form 13H to register as a large trader are required to file an annual update to the filing within 45 days of year-end.

Large traders who have completed a full calendar year without exceeding any of the Form 13H triggering thresholds  measured across all portfolio companies  may be eligible to elect inactive status and thereby suspend certain ongoing large trader obligations.

These triggering thresholds are daily trading of at least two million shares or $20 million in share value, or calendar month trading of at least 20 million shares or $200 million in share value, in each case aggregating purchases and sales of the securities of all portfolio companies during the relevant day or month.

In addition to the annual filing requirement, large traders are reminded that there is a quarterly obligation to promptly amend the Form 13H following any quarter during which any of the information in the large traders Form 13H materially changes.

Action required The determination of whether you have a Schedule 13G, Form 13F or Form 13H filing obligation is often complex.

Cooley,European Commission Publishes Updated Q&A on Clinical Trials Regulation,"In December 2022, the European Commission published an updated version of the Q&A guidance on the Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR).

This new version was issued ahead of the 31 January 2023 deadline from which all new applications for the approval of clinical trials must be submitted in accordance with the CTR.

The most important amendment to the Q&A is the inclusion of a new Annex III.

The application dossier for the approval of a clinical trial in accordance with the CTR is composed of two parts.

Part I of the application dossier relates to scientific aspects of clinical trials that are considered to be scientifically harmonized among European Economic Area (EEA) countries.

Part II relates to country-specific, patient-level requirements, which may vary from one EEA country to another.

The European Commission has developed standardized templates for documentation required for Part II of the application dossier, but some EEA countries have developed their own national templates.

As a result, when operating in the EEA, sponsors may be confronted with divergent national requirements of individual EEA countries.

The updated Q&A aims to provide a consolidated list of national sources where sponsors can identify national requirements and any applicable templates in those countries.

This information should assist sponsors in navigating the specific requirements of individual EEA countries, as well as submitting high-quality and appropriate documents as part of their application dossiers for the approval of clinical trials.

Annex III provides a table listing the websites of all EEA countries, where sponsors can find information regarding national requirements of each EEA country.

It also lists the email addresses for those countries national competent authorities to which sponsors may submit inquiries.

Cooley,New York Requires Employers to Provide Electronic Versions of Mandatory Workplace Postings,"On December 16, 2022, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law an amendment to New York Labor Law Section 201 that requires employers to make mandatory workplace postings available electronically.

Before the amendment, the law required that certain legal notices be posted conspicuously in the workplace.

Now, employers must also make digital versions of the physical notices available, either on the employers website or via email.

Employers should take the following steps to comply with the amended law: Ensure that all mandatory workplace posters have been displayed in a conspicuous place on each floor of their New York workplaces, if any.

Upload digital versions of the posters to the employers intranet  or, if the employer does not have an internal website, disseminate via email.

Notify employees that the posters are available electronically (e.g., via an email with a link to the employers intranet page).

Update the company handbook and other internal resources with information regarding the online location of the posters.

Federal posting requirements can be found on the US Department of Labor website .

New York-specific posting requirements are available on the New York State Department of Labor website .

Note that certain industries, such as healthcare and hospitality, require additional industry-specific postings.

Cooley,European Commission Proposes Amending Transitional Provisions in Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostics Regulations,"On 6 January 2023, the European Commission adopted a proposal to amend the transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR).

The proposal aims to prevent medical device shortages on the European Economic Area (EEA) market.

The proposed amendments introduce an extension to the transitional periods established in the regulations to provide medical device manufacturers more time to bring their devices into conformity with the requirements of the regulations.

In the case of the MDR, the length of the proposed extension is contingent on the risk classification ofdevices.

The proposed amendments were discussed during a meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council held on 9 December 2022.

During the meeting, the overwhelming majority of health ministers of the EU member states welcomed the proposed prolongation of the transitional periods established in the MDR and the IVDR, and they underlined the urgency of delaying implementation of the regulations.

(For more information on the meeting, refer to Cooleys related Productwise blog post .)

The European Commissions proposal to amend the transitional provisions established in the MDR and the IVDR includes the following elements: Extension of the transitional period for higher risk (Class III and IIb implantable devices) medical devices covered by a CE certificate of conformity issued before 26 May 2021 in accordance with the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) or the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (AIMDD) from 26 May 2024 to 31 December 2027 .

Extension of the transitional period for medium- and low-risk (other Class IIb devices, Class IIa and certain ClassI devices) medical devices certified prior to 26 May 2021 in accordance with the MDD to 31 December 2028.

Introduction of a transitional period for Class III custom-made implantable devices until 26 May 2026 , provided that an application for a conformity assessment is lodged with a notified body by the medical device manufacturer by 26 May 2024, and a contract with the notified body is signed before 26 September 2024.

Extension of the period of validity of certificates issued in accordance with the MDD and the AIMDD based on the products risk class.

Removal of the sell-off deadline established in Article 120.4 of the MDR and Article 110.4 of the IVDR for medical devices and in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), respectively, which means that medical devices and IVDs certified in accordance with the MDD, the AIMDD and the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) before the end of the transitional period established in the MDR and the IVDR will be allowed to remain on the EEA market.

According to the proposal, medical devices and IVDs would benefit from the prolonged transitional periods if they fulfill certain conditions.

Medical devices and IVDs must not present an unacceptable risk to patient and user health and safety.

Moreover, the application of the extended transitional periods would not cover devices that have undergone significant changes in terms of their design and intended purpose.

Manufacturers also must have started the process of transitioning their devices to the MDRs requirements.

Reasons behind proposed extension of transitional periods Despite progress in the implementation of the MDR and the IVDR, there have been significant delays in the transition of medical devices and IVDs to the new rules, as well as challenges in respecting the original transition deadlines provided in the regulations.

Limited notified body availability and capacity, shortages in the supply of raw materials in the EU and lack of preparedness of manufacturers to bring their devices into conformity with the regulations are among the factors that have contributed to these delays and challenges."
Cooley,European Commission Proposes Amending Transitional Provisions in Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostics Regulations,"To avert the risk of disruption to the supply and availability of medical devices and IVDs on the EU market that could impact the protection of patient health, the European Commission proposed to allow safe legacy devices to remain on the market in the EEA after the end of the currently applicable transitional period.

Next steps The proposal adopted by the European Commission will be considered for adoption by the European Parliament and the European Council through a co-decision procedure.

If adopted in its current form, the proposed extension of the transitional provisions would have many implications for the medical device industry.

Cooley,UK Enacts Significant Changes to Research & Development Tax Regime,"Significant changes to the UKs Research & Development (R&D) tax relief regime are being introduced with effect from 1 April 2023.

Some of the changes were announced in the 2021 Autumn Budget, while others were more recently announced in the 2022 Autumn Statement.

The changes impact the amount of relief that can be claimed, the types of activities that will qualify and the way in which businesses can claim relief.

They are intended to ensure that  the UK remains a competitive location for cutting edge research ,  the reliefs continue to be fit for purpose  and  taxpayer money is spent as effectively as possible .

The most recently announced rate changes to the R&D tax relief scheme for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), discussed below, were unexpected.

The impact of the changes  stated to be introduced to target error and fraudulent abuse of the SME scheme  will be significant.

The SME regime has proved to be an important incentive and, in some cases, a lifeline to many early-stage companies focused on innovation, particularly those in the life sciences sector.

It is disappointing that the government has not found a practical way to target abuse, other than by materially reducing the benefits of the SME regime, which has clearly contributed to the UKs remarkable achievements in R&D and innovation.

Although the relevant treasury minister has committed to holding a roundtable discussion with members of the life sciences industry to discuss how companies in the sector can continue to be properly supported by the R&D tax relief scheme, these changes have now been enacted as law.

Changes to R&D tax relief rates Relief is available for SMEs under the R&D tax relief regime effectively in the form of an enhanced corporation tax deduction of a percentage of qualifying R&D costs.

Loss-making SMEs usually have the option of receiving a cash payment of an R&D credit in return for surrendering R&D-related losses.

Any such payment is capped at a percentage of the losses available for surrender.

1

An R&D expenditure credit (RDEC) is also available, primarily targeted at larger companies, although it may be used by  and can prove valuable to  SMEs in certain circumstances.

The RDEC uses a different method of calculating corporation tax relief on R&D expenditure.

The above-the-line RDEC is effectively a taxable credit that may be used to offset liability to UK corporation tax or, in some circumstances, claimed as a cash payment.

For expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2023, the SME R&D enhanced deduction will decrease from 130% to 86%, the SME R&D credit rate will decrease from 14.5% to 10% and the RDEC credit rate will increase from 13% to 20%.

The broad net effect of the changes is summarised in the table below.

Pre-April 2023 From April 2023 Loss-making SME Enhanced deduction: 130% 2 R&D credit: 14.5% Benefit: 33.35% Enhanced deduction: 86% 2 R&D credit: 10% Benefit: 18.6% Profit-making SME Enhanced   deduction: 130% Corporation   tax rate: 19% Benefit:   (up to) 24.7% 3 Enhanced   deduction: 86% Corporation   tax rate: 25% Benefit: (up to) 21.5% 3 RDEC   company RDEC   credit rate: 13% Corporation   tax rate: 19% Benefit   (after tax): 10.53% RDEC   credit rate: 20% Corporation   tax rate: 25% Benefit   (after tax): 15% The increase in the RDEC is to be welcomed and should make it more competitive internationally.

However, the RDEC provides a much more limited cash repayment and therefore is not as valuable to innovative startups.

As summarised by the UK BioIndustry Association : Businesses have made their investment plans based on the SME R&D tax relief providing 33p for every 1 the company itself invests in R&D, the cut proposed  means they can now expect 18.6p for each 1 of in-house R&D they perform and as little as 12p for each 1 of R&D they outsource to universities, hospitals or other companies.

Life science SMEs are therefore now facing significant shortages in their R&D cash flow projections."
Cooley,UK Enacts Significant Changes to Research & Development Tax Regime,"Life science SMEs are therefore now facing significant shortages in their R&D cash flow projections.

The UK government also has stated that it will explore and consult on the design of a single simplified RDEC-like scheme.

There is currently no further information about what is envisaged, but further changes are expected.

Refocussing R&D relief toward activities undertaken in the UK From April 2023, new territorial conditions will be introduced affecting subcontracted R&D expenditure (i.e., payments for services) and payments for externally provided workers (EPWs), which are workers provided by an external company.

Subcontracted R&D activity will need to be performed within the UK, and EPWs will need to be subject to UK PAYE (pay as you earn).

However, expenditure in respect of overseas activity will qualify in limited circumstances  namely, where the conditions necessary for the R&D (such as geographical, environmental or social conditions)are not present in the UK whereas they are present in the location where the R&D is undertaken, and it would be wholly unreasonable to replicate the conditions in the UK, or where there are regulatory or other legal requirements for the R&D to be undertaken outside the UK.

As such, expenditure on overseas R&D activities can still potentially qualify for relief where, for example, a company runs clinical trials overseas to gain licensing approvals for new drugs or vaccines or undertakes deep ocean research.

But the legislation makes it clear that neither the cost of the R&D nor the availability of qualified personnel will be considered as a relevant factor in determining whether the exception applies.

Expansion of the scope of qualifying expenditure The scope of qualifying R&D expenditure will be extended to include the cost of data licences and cloud computing, as well as the cost of pure mathematical advances, subject to certain limitations.

Currently, R&D relief can be claimed on the cost of computer software used directly for R&D purposes, which HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) considers as meaning software licence fees and the cost of certain mathematical advances  representing the nature and behaviour of the physical and material universe .

The proposed extension is therefore a welcome change showing the governments recognition that software can be provided as a service (i.e., SaaS) and not just by licensing of software copies, and that pure mathematical advances are often instrumental and underpin the development of machine learning, robotics and other big data solutions.

Changes to the process of making R&D claims If a company seeks to make an R&D claim for the first time, or it has not made an R&D claim in any of its previous three accounting periods, then it will be subject to a new online pre-notification requirement, meaning that it must inform HMRC of its intention to make an R&D claim, as well as the R&D adviser it will be using, within six months following the end of the relevant accounting period (instead of the usual two-year window), unless the full claim has been submitted within the six-month deadline.

The new measure is likely to be particularly relevant for first-time claimants, who should consider whether any of their upcoming expenditure may qualify for R&D relief and, therefore, whether a protective pre-notification is merited.

In addition, as part of making an R&D claim, further additional information will be required to be provided to HMRC relating to the R&D project, the costs involved, the workers involved and (importantly, from HMRCs perspective) details of the agent who helped the company prepare the claim.

Further, the claim itself will need to be endorsed by a named senior officer of the claimant company.

The UK government hopes that these changes, once introduced, will tackle abuse in the system without disadvantaging compliant businesses.

The FCC asked for comment on the following topics, which it believes will help promote the growth and safety of UAS operations: Examining the FCCs proposal to adopt service rules permitting UAS communications links in the 5030  5091 MHz band and whether it will provide the reliability necessary to support safety-critical UAS communications.

Assessing what steps must be taken to ensure that UAS use can coexist with terrestrial service spectrum operations, like mobile wireless networks.

Requiring UAS operators to obtain licenses in the aeronautical very high frequency band (117.975  137 MHz) to communicate with air traffic control and other aircraft while maintaining the integrity of the band.

Promoting the safe integration of UAS operations in controlled airspace and facilitating flight coordination.

Those involved in the unmanned aircraft industry should consider participating in the FCCs proceeding.

The FCC is likely to provide spectrum that will be a critical input for remote pilots to communicate with UAS, but the specific terms of the rules will affect how UAS can be manufactured and operated.

Comments and reply comments will be due 30 days and 60 days, respectively, after the notice is published in the Federal Register."
Cooley,Federal Court Holds Massachusetts Employers May Use Stock Options As Consideration for Noncompetes,"US District Judge Patti B. Saris of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts recently held that stock options will suffice as mutually agreed upon consideration and fair and reasonable consideration under the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act in Cynosure LLC.

v. Reveal Lasers LLC , No. 22-cv-11176-PBS (D. Mass.

Nov. 9, 2022).

As explained in a 2018 Cooley alert , the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act requires employers to provide consideration to support a noncompete agreement in the form of either precisely defined garden leave payments or other undefined mutually agreed upon consideration.

For employees who enter into a noncompete agreement in the course of their employment, the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act requires employers to also provide consideration thats fair and reasonable, which is another undefined term.

By holding that stock options may suffice as both mutually agreed upon consideration and fair and reasonable consideration, Judge Saris shed long-awaited insight into the question of What quantum or type consideration is sufficient to serve as mutually agreed upon consideration?

Judge Saris also concluded that a Delaware governing law clause does not exempt a noncompete agreement from meeting the minimum requirements of the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act if the noncompete agreement is with a Massachusetts-based employee.

In fact, Judge Saris declined to enforce a noncompete with a Delaware governing law clause for its failure to advise an employee of that employees right to consult counsel, as required by the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act.

Massachusetts law The Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act, which took effect on October 1, 2018, sets forth certain minimum requirements that must be satisfied for a noncompete agreement to be enforceable under Massachusetts law.

Among those requirements, employers must offer garden leave or other mutually agreed upon consideration in exchange for a noncompete.

While the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act defines garden leave as 50% of a former employees highest annualized base salary for the two years before separation, to be paid for the duration of the restricted period, it is silent as to the definition of mutually agreed upon consideration.

The Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act also requires that noncompetition agreements advise employees of their right to consult with counsel prior to entering into the agreement.

For agreements entered into after the commencement of employment, a noncompetition agreement also must be supported by fair and reasonable consideration independent from the continuation of employment.

Cynosure LLC v. Reveal Lasers LLC

In Cynosure LLC v. Reveal Lasers LLC , Cynosure sought a preliminary injunction to enforce noncompetition provisions entered into with former employees who allegedly left Cynosure to work for a competitor.

Two of the employees were based in Massachusetts, and one entered into a noncompetition provision at the beginning of his employment through the Cynosure Employee Intellectual Property Rights, Confidentiality and Protective Covenants Agreement (CEIP).

The other Massachusetts-based employee entered into a noncompetition provision during his employment, through an employee stock option agreement, also known as an equity agreement.

Both the CEIP and the equity agreement were purported to be governed by Delaware law.

Governing law For the two former employees who resided in Massachusetts prior to their separation from employment, the court acknowledged the Delaware choice of law provision, but held that such a provision is valid only if it does not have the primary effect of voiding Massachusetts law.

Thus, the court analyzed whether the equity agreement and the CEIP satisfied the minimum requirements of the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act for the two former Massachusetts-based employees."
Cooley,Federal Court Holds Massachusetts Employers May Use Stock Options As Consideration for Noncompetes,"The equity agreement The equity agreement conditioned a grant of options to purchase 500 shares of Cynosures common stock on each employees execution of restrictive covenants, including a 12-month noncompetition provision.

The options would vest in five equal installments over a period of five years, subject to the employees continuous employment.

For the Massachusetts-based employee who entered into the equity agreement mid-employment, under the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act, Cynosure also needed to provide: Fair and reasonable consideration distinct from continued employment.

Mutually agreed upon consideration or garden leave.

The court found that Cynosure satisfied the fair and reasonable consideration and mutually agreed upon consideration requirements through the one stock option grant, which sufficed in lieu of the garden leave clause.

As the equity agreement also satisfied the remainder of the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Acts minimum requirements, the court held the noncompetition provision in the equity agreement to be enforceable under Massachusetts law.

The CEIP The other former Massachusetts-based employee entered into the CEIP in connection with the commencement of his employment.

Thus, the court acknowledged that the CEIP did not also require fair and reasonable consideration distinct from continued employment to comply with the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act.

The former Massachusetts-based employee also argued that the CEIP was deficient for its failure to provide mutually agreed upon consideration or garden leave, which are two forms of consideration that the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act recognizes as distinct from the concept of fair and reasonable consideration.

However, the court did not need to address the defendants consideration argument based on the CEIPs failure to advise the Massachusetts employee of his right to consult counsel.

We note that the courts decision not to enforce the noncompete agreement based on its failure to include the right to consult counsel language is consistent with an earlier Massachusetts federal court opinion that we summarized in a July 2021 Cooley alert .

That decision also declined to enforce a noncompete agreement for its failure to reference mutually agreed upon consideration or garden leave.

Whats next?

Given the Cynosure decision, employers with Massachusetts employees should ensure that their noncompete agreements expressly reference and comply with all minimum requirements set forth by the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act, even if the noncompete agreement purports to be governed by Delaware law.

Employers also may now take comfort that a grant of stock options will likely suffice to satisfy mutually agreed upon consideration in lieu of the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Acts expensive garden leave requirement.

Cooley,FDA Regulatory Framework for Cosmetics Gets Major Overhaul,"Enacted on December 29, 2022, as part of the 2023 omnibus bill , the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA) is a major overhaul of the Food and Drug Administrations current regulatory framework for cosmetics.

MoCRA amends Chapter VI of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to include new provisions for cosmetic products.

These provisions create significant new authorities for the FDA and, for the first time since the FDCA was enacted in 1938, enhance the FDAs regulatory oversight of cosmetics.

While MoCRA does not include a premarket approval requirement for cosmetics, it does create new obligations for the cosmetics industry.

Some of the key provisions are outlined below.

Facility registration Owners and operators of facilities that manufacture or process cosmetic products must now register with the FDA and renew such registration biennially.

Notably, unlike food and dietary supplement facility requirements, facilities that only perform activities related to the labeling, relabeling, packaging, repackaging, holding and/or distributing of cosmetic products will not be required to register.

Product listing Responsible persons (i.e., manufacturers, packers or distributors of a cosmetic product whose name appears on the label, as set forth under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act) are required to list with the FDA each cosmetic product, including its ingredients and information about where the cosmetic product is manufactured, and update cosmetic product labels to include contact information through which the responsible person can receive adverse event reports.

Mandatory adverse event reporting Responsible persons are obligated to submit reports of serious adverse events to the FDA no later than 15 days after receiving the report and maintain all records related to serious adverse events for a minimum of six years, similar to adverse event reporting requirements for dietary supplements and nonprescription drugs.

Unlike the FDAs other regulated products, for cosmetics, MoCRA provides specific details on what constitutes a reportable event to include infections or significant disfigurement, such as serious and persistent rashes, second- or third- degree burns, significant hair loss, or persistent or significant alteration of appearance[], other than as intended, under conditions of use that are customary or usual.

1

Currently, the FDA uses MedWatch for voluntary cosmetics adverse event reporting and presumably will continue to do so for mandatory serious adverse event reporting.

Safety substantiation Responsible persons will be required to maintain records supporting adequate substantiation that the cosmetic product is safe.

Cosmetic products that do not have adequate safety substantiation will be considered adulterated under a newly created adulteration provision within the FDCA.

Current good manufacturing practice for cosmetics For the first time, the FDA must issue mandatory current good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations for cosmetics that are consistent with national and international standards.

As the FDAs current draft guidance for cosmetic GMP leverages elements from ISO 22716, we anticipate that the FDAs future cosmetic GMP regulations will do the same.

Mandatory allergen labeling MoCRA requires the FDA to determine by regulation fragrance allergens that must be disclosed on a cosmetics label.

This labeling requirement applies regardless of whether a cosmetic product is subject to drug or device regulations.

Mandatory recall MoCRA grants the FDA the authority to order a mandatory recall of a cosmetic product if it determines that the cosmetic product is likely to cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

2

In addition to the mandatory recall authority, MoCRA creates attendant adulteration and misbranding provisions to facilitate the FDAs enforcement of these new authorities under existing FDCA prohibited acts.

3"
Cooley,FDA Regulatory Framework for Cosmetics Gets Major Overhaul,"3

For example, products that fail to comply with the new GMP and safety substantiation regulations will be deemed adulterated under newly created adulteration provisions within the FDCA, and if a cosmetic products labeling fails to include the requiredallergens, a cosmetic product is deemed misbranded under a newly created misbranding provision within the FDCA.

4

The FDAs enforcement authority under MoCRA also allows the agency to suspend the registration of a cosmetic facility if there is a determination that a product manufactured or processed by the facility has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death, and there is a reasonable belief that other products manufactured by the facility may be similarly affected.

5 Overall, these provisions bring cosmetics regulation into greater alignment with other FDA-regulated products, particularly those such as dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs that do not require premarket approval.

Notably, MoCRA gives certain exemptions to small businesses with gross sales of less than $1 million.

For example, while small businesses still will be required to maintain records of adverse events, they only will be required to maintain these records for three years, rather than six.

MoCRA also preempts any state laws or regulations regarding registration and product listing, GMP, records, recalls, adverse event reporting, or safety substantiation for cosmetics that is different from MoCRAs requirements.

Outside of these areas of express preemption, however, states are free to implement additional requirements for cosmetics, such as prohibiting the use or amount of specific ingredients.

Questions remain Many of the key provisions, such as facility registration, product listing, and the new adulteration and misbranding definitions, take effect a year from the enactment date.

With this deadline looming, many open questions remain.

For example, to what extent will the new registration requirements conform with the regulations that set forth the current requirements for voluntary registration and voluntary filing of cosmetic product ingredients statements, respectively?

6 (How) will the FDA enforce the adulteration provisions regarding GMP at the end of this year, when regulations might remain in the rulemaking process until the end of 2025?

Now that registration is mandatory, when will the FDA begin routine inspections of cosmetic establishments?

Will the FDA create a new division within its Office of Regulatory Affairs to conduct these inspections, or will it group the inspections under the food program?

Will cosmetic regulation remain within the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition?

While many questions are outstanding, what we do know is that this new regulatory framework is likely to have a significant impact on the cosmetics industry.

Senior regulatory analyst Kelly Marco and law clerk Madelon Bird also contributed to this alert.

Cooley,California Supreme Court Boosts Policyholders Seeking Coverage for Privacy Class Actions,"In a recent opinion, the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of California-based tech giant Yahoo in a multiyear legal battle with the National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The insurer had refused to defend Yahoo against five class action lawsuits alleging Yahoo violated provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited spam robotext messages.

Yahoo settled some of the claims and sought to recover defense costs from National Union under a series of commercial general liability (CGL) policies Yahoo purchased between 2008 and 2012.

The policies provided coverage for injuries arising out of [o]ral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a persons right of privacy.

The parties also had negotiated an endorsement removing an exclusion for claims arising under the TCPA.

The crux of the dispute was whether Yahoos coverage for violations of a persons right of privacy contemplated coverage for the TCPA claims asserted against Yahoo in the class actions.

A federal district court previously ruled against Yahoo on the issue, granting National Unions motion to dismiss.

The case eventually made its way to the California Supreme Court on certification from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The California Supreme Court explained that the law of privacy protects, among other interests, the right to secrecy (i.e., the right to prevent  disclosure of personal information to others ) and the right to seclusion (i.e., the right to be free from  disturbance by others ).

The TCPA protects telephone users right to seclusion by placing restrictions on automated telephone calls (robocalls)  which has been interpreted to include text messages (robotexts)  and unsolicited facsimile machine advertisements (junk faxes).

The parties stipulated that the TCPA does not address disclosures that would violate the right to secrecy.

The court found the policy language ambiguous as to whether it covered not only right to secrecy violations but also right to seclusion violations.

The court further reasoned that neither the standard rules of contract interpretation nor the rule of the last antecedent resolved the ambiguity.

Accordingly, and consistent with California law, the court found a possibility of coverage and thus a potential duty to defend.

Specifically, the court directed that the federal district court may recognize such a duty to defend if further litigation demonstrates that coverage for TCPA violations was consistent with Yahoos objectively reasonable expectations  or if further litigation does not otherwise resolve the ambiguity.

The court also left open for future litigation whether the policies advertising injury exclusion may limit coverage or a duty to defend.

Still, the court handed a big win to policyholders by siding with Yahoo, rejecting lower-court precedent holding that TCPA/right to seclusion claims can never be covered under standard CGL insuring clauses and reaffirming that ambiguous policy language must be interpreted in a way that fulfills the insureds objectively reasonable expectations.

Cooley,"HSR Filing Fees Increase Substantially for Large Transactions, Boost FTC and DOJ Antitrust Enforcement Funding","On December 29, 2022, President Joe Biden signed a funding bill into law that includes provisions that significantly change the filing fees for mergers & acquisitions notifiable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act.

For transactions valued at more than $5 billion, HSR filing fees are set to jump approximately 800%  from $280,000 to $2.25 million  and will be adjusted for smaller transactions.

Notably, the funds are earmarked to provide additional resources to antitrust enforcers, which may lead to increased enforcement efforts.

The date for implementation of the new fees is not yet set.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to announce an effective date soon.

The HSR Act requires that parties to mergers & acquisitions notify the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FTC if proposed acquisitions meet certain size-of-person and size-of-transaction thresholds .

Parties are required to pay a fee, which currently ranges from $45,000 to $280,000, to the government based on the value of the transaction, and observe a statutory waiting period before consummating the transaction to allow the government to investigate whether the transaction may lessen competition.

The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act (MFFMA), which is included in the funding bill, alters the fee tiers for the first time in 20 years.

The new law establishes a six-tier scheme, with filing fees of up to $2,250,000.

For some smaller transactions, however, the filing fee will be reduced from $45,000 to $30,000.

The MFFMA also provides that the fees will be adjusted annually based on changes in the consumer price index.

Previously, filing fee thresholds have been indexed but not the fees themselves.

The new fee structure is as follows: Deal value thresholds HSR filing fees $101 million to less than $161.5 million $30,000 $161.5 million to less than $500 million $100,000 $500 million to less than $1 billion $250,000 $1 billion to less than $2 billion $400,000 $2 billion to less than $5 billion $800,000 $5 billion or more $2,250,000 The fee increases are projected to boost funding to the FTC and DOJ by about $1.4 billion over five years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, heralded the MFFMA, saying it will enable Congress to get much-needed resources to our antitrust enforcers so they can protect competition.

In addition to impacting HSR filing fees, the MFFMA requires filers to disclose whether they have received subsidies from a foreign entity of concern, which includes countries or entities that are strategic or economic threats to the United States.

The MFFMA asserts that foreign subsidies  can distort the competitive process by enabling the subsidized firm to submit a bid higher than other firms in the market, or otherwise change the incentives of the firm in ways that undermine competition following an acquisition.

The DOJ and FTC are expected to issue new rules and instructions for HSR filers to implement this requirement.

The agencies may roll those out along with other revisions to the HSR rules that FTC Chair Lina Khan has indicated will require more substantive disclosures.

The funding bill signed into law also provides state attorneys general who bring suit under federal antitrust law greater power to control where such cases will be tried.

Under the newly adopted provision, states that bring antitrust cases will receive the same exception as the federal government to avoid consolidation into multidistrict litigation in a different venue from where the state originally sued."
Cooley,FDA’s Latest Twist on Digital Health Oversight Brings Big Shift,"Facing novel, swiftly evolving technologies in the digital health space, the US Food and Drug Administration has been trying to balance fostering innovation with providing reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness under a regulatory framework for devices that dates back to 1976.

Major changes impacting digital health companies came with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, which carved out certain categories of software from FDA oversight.

Since then, the FDA has issued numerous guidance documents providing details on these carve outs, as well as the agencys general approach to regulating digital health technologies.

In its early digital health guidance documents, the FDA sought to harmonize its thinking with that of the international community , but it also announced specific areas of enforcement discretion for low-risk devices .

On September 28, 2022, however, the FDA issued three new final guidance documents in the digital health space  on clinical decision support (CDS) software , mobile medical applications and medical device data systems  as well as a report summarizing its findings on the Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Pilot Program .

The FDAs recent efforts signal that the agency is moving toward more oversight of digital health companies.

With more than 500 medical device approvals and clearances involving artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) under its belt, the agency has a better understanding of the regulatory pressure points for these products, and in response, it has updated its current thinking on how it can regulate software as a medical device, given the Cures Act carve outs.

The most significant revision to the FDAs current interpretation of the Cures Act is the recently finalized guidance on CDS software , in which the agency provides a more detailed interpretation of several statutory elements.

On December 15, 2022, the FDA also updated its Digital Health Policy Navigator , a tool developed by the agencys Digital Health Center of Excellence, to help industry understand the Cures Act analyses, including the non-device CDS exemption.

Below, weve analyzed the practical implications of the most significant of these changes.

CDS software guidance Per the Cures Act, software functions that meet the following four criteria are not devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA):

It is not intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device, or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system.

It is intended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information about a patient or other medical information (such as peer-reviewed clinical studies and clinical practice guidelines).

It is intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a healthcare professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition.

It is intended for the purpose of enabling a healthcare professional to independently review the basis for recommendations that the software presents, but not rely primarily on those recommendations to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient.

1

While the agency cites this same statutory language in previous CDS draft guidance documents, as well as the newly issued final guidance document, the FDAs new interpretation as explained in the final guidance includes parameters not specifically delineated by the statute.

Three key takeaways from the final CDS guidance The final CDS guidance on its face appears to be significantly different from the previous draft guidance.

Some changes, however, are more to form than substance."
Cooley,FDA’s Latest Twist on Digital Health Oversight Brings Big Shift,"Some changes, however, are more to form than substance.

For example, rather than include a table indicating that CDS software that provides outputs focused on caregivers or patients does not qualify for the non-device CDS carve out and is instead subject to enforcement discretion, the FDA refers readers to its other Cures Act guidance documents announcing enforcement discretion policies for low-risk devices, such as its mobile medical applications guidance or general wellness policy for low-risk devices .

Similarly, the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) framework is now referenced only in passing, 2 although several principles from that framework, such as the reference to intended use based on label and instructions for use (rather than FDAs broader intended use regulation 3 ), remain.

The FDA acknowledges in this final CDS guidance that while the IMDRF provides additional information regarding risk categorization and considerations that may apply to certain software functions, it no longer embraces this framework as the foundation for the FDAs revised current thinking as it did in the previous draft guidance .

4 Beyond these changes intended to streamline the guidance, there are three areas where the agencys current interpretation appears to narrow the non-device CDS exemption, particularly when compared to the 2019 draft guidance and the plain statutory language.

FDAs current interpretation restricts non-device CDS inputs The final guidance includes newly announced definitions for medical image, signal and pattern as those terms are used in Criterion 1.

Medical image includes not only those images generated by medical imaging systems to view any parts of the body, but also images acquired for a medical purpose.

5 Further, pattern refers to multiple, sequential, or repeated measurements of a signal or from a signal acquisition system.

Notably, these definitions serve to exclude virtually all CDS functions that analyze continuous monitoring data, data from DNA sequencing or systems that track medical information over time.

Recognizing that none of these technologies can qualify for the Cures Act carve out, the FDA falls back on the statute, noting that such products may be exempted if they do not qualify as a medical device based on their intended uses.

Of course, the CDS carve out would be superfluous if it only applied to products that did not meet the device definition in the first place  i.e., products not intended to cure, mitigate, treat, prevent, or diagnose a disease or other condition, nor to affect the structure or any function of the body.

The FDAs interpretation further restricts CDS inputs by narrowly defining medical information as the type of information that normally is, and generally can be, communicated between healthcare providers in a clinical conversation, or between healthcare providers and patients in the context of a clinical decision.

This narrow reading could exclude from the non-device CDS carve out functions that can provide real value and time savings to healthcare providers, such as AI-driven technology and algorithms that aggregate and sort data, including data from sources that may be overlooked in current medical practice but may give insight into medical diagnoses or treatment.

Taken together, the FDAs broad interpretation of medical image, signal and pattern in Criterion 1, and the agencys narrow interpretation of medical information in Criterion 2, restrict the allowable inputs for the non-device CDS exemption.

FDAs final guidance is at odds with the agencys approach to the practice of medicine Perhaps the most significant change in the final guidance is the FDAs interpretation of Criterion 3, including a newly announced focus on the potential for automation bias, particularly for time-sensitive decision making."
Cooley,FDA’s Latest Twist on Digital Health Oversight Brings Big Shift,"6 Specifically, the FDA voices a concern that healthcare providers may over-rely on a suggestion from an automated system, which could lead to poor outcomes if the system provides inaccurate information or an erroneous treatment option.

To account for this risk, FDA suggests that non-device CDS software functions provide healthcare providers a prioritized list of treatment options, rather than one specific preventive, diagnostic, or treatment output or directive.

7

The FDA further explains that it considers software that  identifies a risk probability or risk score for a specific disease or condition to fall outside the non-device CDS exemption, as such software functions provide a specific preventive, diagnostic, or treatment output.

8

The CDS guidance also notes that functions intended to support time-critical decision-making likely would not be exempted because the agency posits that for situations that require urgent action, automation bias increases because there is not sufficient time for the user to adequately consider other information.

9

The guidance similarly takes aim at devices that provide an alarm.

Per the final guidance, software, including software that provides time-critical alarms or alerts intended to trigger potential clinical intervention to assure patient safety, would not satisfy Criterion 3. 10 For software functions that provide specific recommendations in time-sensitive situations, FDA has signaled that it would expect sponsors to seek agency premarket review rather than view such products as non-device CDS.

11

This prohibition on non-device CDS that utilizes alarms or scoring functions appears to significantly narrow non-device CDS in emergency rooms where alarms are often used, and ignores the fact that healthcare practitioners who are specifically trained in emergency medicine must regularly make instantaneous decisions often without the benefit of medical histories, consultation, or time for reflection.

12

It is also curious that the cited support for this concern is a 2004 article, written three years before smartphones began gaining traction across the globe as a common element of daily life.

13

In todays world, many professionals, including healthcare professionals, are accustomed to receiving information from automated systems, such as text messages, throughout the day.

Moreover, the FDAs interpretation of this element appears on its face to run counter to the agencys long-standing precedent to defer to the judgment of healthcare practitioners.

14

While statutory language for Criterion 3 of the CDS carve out is consistent with the FDAs approach to defer to the practice of medicine  in that it states that a product is not a device and therefore not regulated by FDA if it is intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition  (emphasis added)  the FDAs newly announced interpretation of Criterion 3 does not reflect this deference required by the FDCA and generally supported by the courts.

15

Whereas the FDCA expressly allows for even off-label uses given the physicians ability to make judgments in the best interest of patient care, in its interpretation of Criterion 3, the FDA is skeptical of physician decision making such that automated tools that provide specific recommendations or probability scores aimed at assisting providers in making clinical decisions do not appear to qualify for the non-device CDS exemption.

There is further tension in the FDAs interpretation for Criterion 3, when contrasted with its interpretation of Criterion 4, in which the agency requires software to identify the required input medical information with a plain language description of the underlying algorithm development and validation that forms the basis for the CDS implementation, including a summary of the logic or methods relied upon to provide the recommendations.

16"
Cooley,FDA’s Latest Twist on Digital Health Oversight Brings Big Shift,"16

The FDAs interpretation of Criterion 4 would arguably address any automation bias concerns because the clinicians would have to be provided with details about the software inputs and outputs.

FDAs guidance requires labeling even for exempted products Lastly, the agencys interpretation of Criterion 4 raises a question about the agencys reach over products intended to be exempted from its jurisdiction.

The FDA explains in its Criterion 4 analysis that to fit within the non-device CDS exemption, software should include labeling that describes its purpose and intended use, the required inputs and medical information, and the underlying algorithm, among others.

Yet if the product is exempted from the device definition, can the FDA really require specific labeling for such products?

Additionally, given the agencys long-standing approach to the intended use analysis , 17 it is unclear whether the FDA would be satisfied with express labeling only to determine whether a product can qualify as non-device CDS, or whether it would engage in a broader intended use analysis.

18

Perhaps this interpretation is a holdover from the IMDRF framework, in which intended use is determined on the Label and Instructions for Use for Medical Devices only.

19

In any event, to the extent the FDA appears to be requiring products exempted from agency oversight to carry specific labeling, the agencys interpretation of Criterion 4 potentially raises First Amendment concerns.

Practical considerations The FDAs interpretation of the non-device CDS carve out as announced in the final guidance will, at a minimum, require software developers and device manufacturers to have an increased understanding of FDA labeling requirements and conform descriptions of their software to a format and level of detail that the FDA finds acceptable.

Given the FDAs interpretation of Criterion 4, this is essential even for products that ultimately are exempted from FDA regulation.

Developers also should pay particular attention to the language used in designing the user interfaces and promoting CDS software products, keeping in mind the principles in the FDAs final guidance.

For example, the difference between the FDA regulating a product as a device and the same product being exempt as non-device CDS software could hinge not only on the express language the agency suggests for Criterion 4, but also on a description of the software output as a consideration, rather than a risk score or probability.

Additionally, developers need to keep in mind that diagnostic devices almost always will require FDA clearance or approval, as the non-device CDS exemption does not apply to diagnostic devices.

In addition to more careful device and output descriptions, software developers must take care to plainly show their work to qualify for the non-device CDS exemption.

20 In other words, to be excluded from the definition of a device, the software function must enable healthcare providers to independently review the basis for the recommendations presented by the software.

In the final guidance, the FDA presents a few examples of labeling and device functions that fulfill this requirement.

For example, in the case of a hypothetical software function that analyzes patient-specific medical information regarding end-stage renal disease and provides a list of treatment options based on practice guidelines, the FDA outlines a laundry list of required information that must to be provided to the healthcare provider to satisfy Criterion 4, including the intended use, patient population, medical information, data quality requirements, a plain language description of the underlying algorithm development and validation that forms the basis for recommendations, etc. 21

This, according to the FDA, enables healthcare providers to rely on their own judgment, rather than such recommendations, to make clinical decisions for individual patients."
Cooley,FDA’s Latest Twist on Digital Health Oversight Brings Big Shift,"This, according to the FDA, enables healthcare providers to rely on their own judgment, rather than such recommendations, to make clinical decisions for individual patients.

Software developers should be prepared to provide adequate background information in plain language on the input(s), algorithm, datasets, validation and more, and they must describe in detail how their software functions analyze and calculate data to determine the recommendations they provide.

This requirement, however, assumes that physicians have a sophisticated understanding of software and hence requires non-device CDS software to clearly explain the outputs such that a healthcare provider knows the full bibliography of information analyzed by the software.

However, many physicians do not have data science or software engineering backgrounds, and requiring sophisticated algorithm development and validation to be explained in plain language could therefore be an exercise in futility.

Although the FDA has approved and cleared many devices with AI/ML and digital health technologies, undoubtedly many newly regulated devices will need to utilize the De Novo clearance process due to a lack of adequate predicate devices for these novel products.

22

Thus, large companies that are already familiar with the De Novo process and have existing regulatory departments well-versed in FDA clearance and approval processes may be at an advantage in ultimately getting CDS products to market.

Smaller companies interested in innovating will need guidance from those experienced in these areas to determine whether novel software might qualify for the non-device CDS exemption, given the final guidance, and also analyze software under the FDAs enforcement discretion policies as explained in the mobile medical application , software as a medical device , medical device data systems and general wellness guidance documents.

Digital Health Policy Navigator

In the wake of the FDAs final guidance, it is even more important to lean into FDAs long-standing practice of analyzing software devices on a function-by-function basis.

23

Recognizing this need, FDA established the Digital Health Policy Navigator on September 28, 2022, to help determine whether a software function is subject to or the focus of the FDAs regulatory oversight as a device, and it provides considerations that could be useful to determining the applicable FDA-specific legal and regulatory requirements and recommendations.

Each step in the navigator is crafted to answer a question about the device function and often corresponds to a specific FDA-issued guidance document on the topic.

For example, Step 6 helps determine if the software function is intended to provide clinical decision support.

Although the Digital Health Policy Navigator was announced when the final CDS guidance was published on September 28, the FDA only updated this tool with details on Question 6, which is the CDS analysis question, on December 15.

We had wondered whether the FDA might share additional insights with industry on how to interpret the CDS analysis through the navigators answers to Question 6, but the FDAs analysis with this tool merely tracks the examples provided in the CDS guidance.

For example, the navigator explains that software with outputs rooted in clinical guidelines  such as physicians order sets, software linking patient-specific information to established clinical guidelines or reminders for preventive care based on such guidelines  could meet the elements required for the exemption.

Similarly, the navigator notes that software identifying drug-drug interactions or drug-allergy interactions to avoid adverse events for patients may be exempted.

While the navigator does a good job of pulling the various digital health guidance documents into one streamlined questionnaire, the FDA makes certain to point out that the navigators results are not a formal FDA device determination for your product."
Cooley,FDA’s Latest Twist on Digital Health Oversight Brings Big Shift,"The navigator can be useful for individuals without an FDA background to get a general idea of whether their software may be regulated by the FDA as a medical device.

However, many novel devices raise more nuanced issues or questions regarding software functions that do not fit squarely into the questionnaire.

In this case, a more comprehensive review of the FDCA, its implementing regulations and the FDAs various guidance documents will be required to determine the appropriate regulatory pathway for software functions.

Whats next?

While some developers may wait in the wings to see how the FDA enforces this new guidance given the agencys limited resources and risk-based approach to enforcement, the most likely impact of the final CDS guidance is an anticipated increase in the number of premarket submissions to the FDA for CDS products.

Because premarket applications are not made public by the FDA until clearance or approval, it may be months or even years before we can evaluate the impact of this guidance on the volume of applications.

In the FDAs public statement in 2020 regarding types of evidence the agency considers when determining intended use, the FDA clarified that a manufacturers knowledge of a healthcare providers use of a medical product for unapproved use is not sufficient to establish the products intended use.

In issuing this statement, the FDA reaffirmed its longstanding position  that, in evaluating a products intended use, any relevant source of evidence may be considered.

At present, devices generally are reviewed by the review division within the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) that has jurisdiction over the disease or condition that will be addressed by the device, with input by CDRHs Digital Health Center of Excellence as necessary.

An open question is whether, with a large influx of new software-based device applications, CDRH will continue to review CDS products in this manner or whether we will see increased involvement by the Digital Health Center of Excellence in these submissions.

The FDA traditionally has analyzed medical devices on a function-by-function basis.

Per the FDAs guidance on multiple function device products : In accordance with existing policies, FDA intends not to review a device function subject to an enforcement discretion policy merely because it is part of a multiple function device product.

Instead, FDA intends to review the device function(s) for which clearance or approval is being sought (e.g., the device function-under-review).

For example, if a manufacturer seeks clearance or approval for a device function (e.g., analysis), and not the device function for which FDA has expressed its intention not to enforce compliance (e.g., trend), then FDA intends to only review the analysis function and assess the trend function only insofar as it could negatively impact the analysis function.

In that instance, because FDA is reviewing the analysis function only, FDAs decision to clear or approve applies only to the analysis function."

Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules that impose new conditions on the availability of the Rule 10b5-1 affirmative defense to insider trading and require enhanced disclosures regarding the adoption, modification and termination of Rule 10b5-1 plans and other trading arrangements, issuers insider trading policies and procedures, and certain equity awards granted close in time to the release of material nonpublic information.

New cooling-off periods will be required for all 10b5-1 plans entered into by anyone other than issuers, with a longer cooling-off period for directors and officers.

Limitations will apply to overlapping and single-trade 10b5-1 plans, unless the plan is incidental to satisfying income tax withholding obligations in connection with certain equity compensation awards (i.e., a sell-to-cover plan).

Issuer 10b5-1 stock repurchase plans will not be subject to a cooling-off period or the limitations on overlapping and single-trade plans.

Gifts of equity securities will now be reportable on Form 4, rather than Form 5, under Section 16.

New Item 402(x) will require narrative disclosure of an issuers policies and practices in connection with the timing of the grant of certain equity awards in relation to the issuers disclosure of material nonpublic information.

The amendments to Rule 10b5-1 and the new disclosure obligations will be effective 60 days after the publication of the final rules in the Federal Register.

Issuers, other than smaller reporting companies, will be required to comply with the new disclosure requirements in Exchange Act periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K (or, as applicable, 20-F) and in any proxy or information statements in the first filing that covers the first full fiscal period beginning on or after April 1, 2023; smaller reporting companies will be required to comply in Exchange Act periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K and in any proxy or information statements in the first filing that covers the first full fiscal period beginning on or after October 1, 2023.

On December 14, 2022, the SEC unanimously voted at an open meeting to adopt final rules regarding Rule 10b5-1 insider trading plans and related disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The amended rules impose new conditions on the availability of the Rule 10b5-1 affirmative defense, as well as new disclosure and reporting obligations on issuers, directors and officers regarding adoption, modification and termination of trading plans in reliance on Rule 10b5-1 (10b5-1 plans), issuer insider trading policies and procedures, the timing of certain awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights or instruments with option-like features and bona fide gifts.

In a press release following the SECs open meeting , the commission stated that, [c]ollectively, the final rules aim to strengthen investor protections concerning insider trading and to help shareholders understand when and how insiders are trading in securities for which they may at times have material nonpublic information.

The full release for the final rules is available here , and the condensed fact sheet is available here .

The amended rules will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

For Section 16 reporting persons, compliance will begin with beneficial ownership disclosures on Forms 4 and 5 filed on or after April 1, 2023.

Issuers, other than smaller reporting companies, will be required to comply with the new disclosure requirements in Exchange Act periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K (or, as applicable, 20-F) and in any proxy or information statements in the first filing that covers the first full fiscal period beginning on or after April 1, 2023."
Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"Smaller reporting companies will be required to comply in Exchange Act periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K and in any proxy or information statements in the first filing that covers the first full fiscal period beginning on or after October 1, 2023.

Importantly, the SEC has clarified that the amendments to Rule 10b5-1 will not affect the affirmative defense available under an existing Rule 10b5-1 plan that was entered into prior to the effective date of the amendments to Rule 10b5-1, except to the extent that such a plan is modified or changed in the manner described in the amendments to Rule 10b5-1 after the effective date of the amended rules.

Modifications that trigger the application of the new requirements are described under the Mandatory cooling-off periods heading below.

For information on the SEC commissioners views and statements regarding the amendments, refer to this December 15 Cooley PubCo blog post .

Overview of amendments Although the final rules differ from the proposed rules in meaningful ways, the final rules substantially expand the Rule 10b5-1 safe harbor requirements and impose new reporting and disclosure obligations for issuers, directors, officers and others who implement 10b5-1 plans.

Specifically, the final rules: Impose a cooling-off period for individuals who adopt 10b5-1 plans.

Condition the adoption of a 10b5-1 plan on the requirement to act in good faith.

Require directors and officers to include specific representations in 10b5-1 plans regarding possession of material nonpublic information and intention to act in good faith.

Restrict the use by anyone, other than issuers, of multiple overlapping plans.

Limit single-trade plans to one per every 12-month period (subject to certain exceptions).

Require issuers to disclose information regarding their policies and procedures related to insider trading and timing of certain equity grants around the release of material nonpublic information.

Require issuers to disclose the use of 10b5-1 plans by certain insiders.

Require new disclosures on Forms 4 and 5 by Section 16 reporting persons relating to bona fide gifts as well as trades pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan.

Amendments to Rule 10b5-1 plans Historically, persons wanting to establish a 10b5-1 plan had flexibility in how they designed the plan in order to ensure the affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1 was available.

This flexibility  coupled with regulatory focus on 10b5-1 plans and public perception of these plans  caused many companies, directors, officers and other employees to follow perceived best practices for satisfying the good faith standard when adopting a 10b5-1 plan.

Many of the amended rules, which include five new conditions to the availability of the affirmative defense, formally adopt or amend such best practices into new safe harbor reporting or disclosure requirements as discussed below.

Mandatory cooling-off periods A cooling-off period is the time between the adoption (or modification) of the 10b5-1 plan and when the first trade under the 10b5-1 plan may occur.

Rule 10b5-1, as currently in effect, does not impose any waiting period between the date that a trading plan is adopted, or modified, and the date of the first trade under the plan.

The amended rules impose a mandatory cooling-off period on all individuals, other than issuers, who adopt or modify a 10b5-1 plan.

Under the amended rules, the mandatory cooling-off period imposed on directors and officers 1 will be the later of 90 days after the adoption of a 10b5-1 plan or two business days following the disclosure of the issuers financial results in a Form 10-Q or 10-K (or, for foreign private issuers, disclosure of financial results in a Form 20-F or 6-K) for the fiscal quarter in which the 10b5-1 plan was adopted, not to exceed 120 days.

For other individuals, the required cooling-off period will be 30 days after the adoption of a 10b5-1 plan."
Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"For other individuals, the required cooling-off period will be 30 days after the adoption of a 10b5-1 plan.

In addition, in certain circumstances, a modification to a plan under the amended rules is considered a termination of the 10b5-1 plan and adoption of a new plan, triggering a new cooling-off period.

Modifications or changes to the number of securities to be purchased or sold, price or timing of the purchase or sale of securities, or a modification or change to the formula, algorithm, or computer program that affects the amount, price, or timing of the purchase or sale of securities will be considered a termination of the original plan and adoption of a new 10b5-1 plan, triggering a new cooling-off period.

Administrative changes to a 10b5-1 plan that do not affect the price, number, or timing of a purchase or sale, such as adjustments for a stock split, will not be deemed a termination that triggers a new cooling-off period.

Director and officer certifications The amended rules require directors and officers to certify in the 10b5-1 plan that at the time of the plans adoption or modification that they are not aware of material nonpublic information about the issuer or its securities, and that they are adopting the contract, instruction or plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5.

This is a departure from the proposed rules that would have required a separate certification to be executed and retained for a significant period of time.

Because most brokerage firms already require similar representations in broker trading plans, the amended rules are essentially a codification of existing industry practice.

Restrictions on overlapping plans Next to cooling-off periods, the restriction on using more than one 10b5-1 plan at a time is one of the most significant changes to the current regime.

The amended rules provide that the affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1 would be unavailable for any trade by individuals (other than issuers) who have established multiple overlapping trading arrangements for open-market purchases or sales of any class of securities of the issuer during the same period.

In an important change from the proposed rules, the restriction on overlapping plans will not prohibit traders from having a separate plan that instructs their broker or agent to sell securities to satisfy income tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting (and settlement) of certain compensatory equity awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units, often referred to as sell-to-cover plans, where the individual does not otherwise exercise control over the timing of such sales.

Note that this exception to the general prohibition on overlapping plans does not extend to stock options.

In the final rules, the SEC made certain other clarifications to the restriction on having multiple overlapping plans.

First, a person may enter into more than one plan with different broker-dealers or other agents, provided that, when taken together, the contracts with multiple brokers collectively meet the conditions of Rule 10b5-1.

Similarly, a person will not lose the benefit of the affirmative defense when the person transfers securities to a new financial institution or broker, unless that modification also changes the price, amount or timing of the purchase or sale of securities.

A modification to the price, amount or timing of the purchase or sale of securities would be deemed a termination of such a plan and the adoption of a new plan as discussed above.

In addition, a person is permitted to maintain two 10b5-1 plans at the same time so long as there is no overlap in timing of trades between the two plans, and trading under the earlier-commencing 10b5-1 plan concludes or expires before trading is authorized under the later-commencing plan."
Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"Importantly, the adoption of a later-commencing plan does not change the cooling-off period for the later-commencing plan.

However, if the earlier-commencing plan is terminated before its originally scheduled completion date, then the required cooling-off period for the later-commencing plan will run from the date of such earlier termination (and not from the date the later-commencing plan was adopted).

The SEC noted that, without this qualification, it would be possible to avoid the required cooling-off period that would otherwise be required for a new 10b5-1 plan established after a prior plan termination.

As a result, although further clarification from SEC staff would be helpful, it initially appears that it may be possible to avoid gaps in trading under successive 10b5-1 plans as long as the earlier-commencing plan is not terminated before its scheduled completion date.

Whether the SEC intended the cooling-off period to work in this way is subject to additional clarification.

Finally, the adopting release indicates that the restriction on overlapping 10b5-1 plans will not apply to plans that do not involve open-market transactions, such as employee stock ownership plans or dividend reinvestment plans.

Restrictions on single-trade plans The amended rules also limit the availability of the affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1 to one single-trade plan involving open-market transactions during any rolling 12-month period.

Similar to the exception for overlapping plans, the single-trade plan limitation will not apply to issuers, or to sell-to-cover plans entered into by individuals, for the purpose of selling securities to cover tax-withholding obligations related to the vesting of equity compensation.

Good faith requirement Although the current rules require that persons entering into a 10b5-1 plan enter into the plan in good faith, the amended rules go a step further to require that individuals and issuers act in good faith with respect to the contract, instruction or plan, which includes not only the adoption of, but also any modification to, the plan and actions related to the plan.

This requirement is intended to prevent attempts to influence the timing of corporate disclosures to benefit trades under a 10b5-1 plan, such as by delaying or accelerating the release of material nonpublic information.

Differences in the application of new conditions to Rule 10b5-1 affirmative defense Amended   affirmative defense requirements Directors   and officers All   other individuals New minimum 90-day cooling-off   period Required Not applicable New   30-day cooling-off period Not   applicable Required New   plan representations Required Not   required Limits   on multiple overlapping plans Limits   imposed Limits   imposed Limits   on multiple single-use plans Limits   imposed Limits   

imposed Expanded   good faith requirement Applicable Applicable

In a departure from the proposed rules, the SEC will not impose all the additional conditions in the amended rule on issuers.

Issuers are only required to comply with the expanded good faith requirement.

Disclosure regarding Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements New periodic reporting by issuers Currently, there are no mandatory disclosure requirements concerning the use of 10b5-1 trading arrangements or other trading arrangements.

However, the amended rules impose new quarterly and annual disclosure requirements on issuers, including smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies, related to the adoption, modification and termination of 10b5-1 plans by directors and officers."
Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"Quarterly disclosures The SEC adopted new Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K that requires issuers to (1) disclose in Form 10-Q (or Form 10-K for the fourth fiscal quarter) whether, during the most recently completed fiscal quarter any director or officer has adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 plan and/or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K), 2 and (2) provide a description of the material terms of the Rule 10b5-1 plan or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, other than pricing terms, such as: The name and title of the director or officer.

The date of adoption or termination of the trading plan or arrangement (which includes covered modifications to existing trading arrangements).

The duration of the trading plan or arrangement.

The aggregate number of securities to be sold or purchased under the trading plan or arrangement.

Whether the trading plan or arrangement is a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.

Notably, although sell-to-cover plans are not subject to the restrictions on overlapping and single-trade plans, they are not expressly carved out of the quarterly disclosure requirements and may be an area for further clarification by SEC staff as the amended rules are being put into practice.

As a result, issuers will want to review their existing sell-to-cover arrangements to determine whether periodic disclosure would be required for equity award agreements or other sell-to-cover instructions.

New Item 408(a) will be added to Part II, Item 5, Other Information of Form 10-Q and Part III, Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of Form 10-K, and the disclosures will be subject to the officer certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The disclosure will also be subject to tagging in Inline XBRL.

The Item 408(a) disclosure requirements will not apply to foreign private issuers.

Annual disclosures Under new Item 408(b) of Regulation S-K, the issuer will be required to disclose in its Form 10-K and proxy or information statement  or pursuant to Item 16J of Form 20-F, as applicable  whether it has adopted insider trading policies and procedures governing the purchase, sale and other dispositions of its securities by directors, officers and employees, or by the issuer itself, that are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and any applicable listing standards.

If the issuer has not adopted these policies and procedures, then it will be required to explain why it has not done so.

However, the amended rules changed course from the proposed rules with respect to how an issuer will be required to disclose these policies.

Rather than describing the material terms in the body of the annual report, an issuer will be required to file a copy of its insider trading policies and procedures as an exhibit to its Form 10-K or 20-F, as applicable.

If an issuers trading policies and procedures are included in its code of ethics, then filing the code of ethics as an exhibit will satisfy this requirement.

New Item 408(b) will be added to Part III, Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of Form 10-K, Item 7 of Schedule 14A and Item 16J of Form 20-F. The new annual disclosure requirement will be applicable to both domestic issuers and foreign private issuers and will be subject to the officer certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Like other Part III information required by Form 10-K, under Instruction G to Form 10-K, the disclosure required by Item 408(b) may be forward incorporated by reference from an issuers annual meeting proxy statement.

The disclosure will also be subject to tagging in Inline XBRL in accordance with Regulation S-T and the EDGAR Filer Manual."
Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"The disclosure will also be subject to tagging in Inline XBRL in accordance with Regulation S-T and the EDGAR Filer Manual.

Section 16 reports The amended rules add a mandatory checkbox to Forms 4 and 5 requiring a Section 16 reporting person to indicate whether a reported transaction is pursuant to a plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) and to provide the date of adoption of the 10b5-1 plan.

Bona fide gifts To address concerns that the current ability to delay reporting of gifts on Form 5 may allow insiders to engage in problematic practices involving gifts, such as making gifts of equity securities while in possession of material nonpublic information where the value of the security at the time of donation and sale results in tax or other benefits for the donor and/or donee, the amended rules require the reporting of bona fide gifts of equity securities on Form 4, rather than Form 5.

This means that Section 16 reporting persons will need to report bona fide gifts within two business days of the transaction.

New 402(x) disclosures of stock option grant timing The amended rules add new subsection (x) to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, requiring narrative disclosure about the issuers timing of awards of options.

Specifically, the narrative disclosure must describe the issuers policies and practices in connection with the timing of stock options, stock appreciation rights or instruments with option-like features and must include: How the board of directors determines when to grant such equity awards (e.g., whether awards are granted on a predetermined schedule).

Whether and, if so, how the board or compensation committee considers material nonpublic information when determining the timing and terms of an award.

Whether the issuer has timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.

New Item 402(x) also requires tabular disclosure if any such equity awards were granted, during the last completed fiscal year, to any named executive officer (NEO) within four business days before or one business day after the filing of a periodic report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, or the filing or furnishing of a Form 8-K that contains material nonpublic information (including earnings releases, but excluding any Form 8-K disclosing a new material option award under Item 5.02(e)).

If required, the table must include the following information on an award-by-award basis, as applicable: The name of the NEO.

The grant date.

The number of securities underlying the award.

The per-share exercise price.

The grant date fair value of the award.

The percentage change in the market value of the securities underlying the award between one trading day before and one trading day after disclosure of the material nonpublic information.

Importantly, these new disclosure requirements do not apply to restricted stock or restricted stock units.

Observations and commentary Although many issuers may have already implemented at least some of the features of the amended rules in their insider trading policies and procedures, issuers should evaluate their current policies and practices to prepare for the upcoming changes, including: Issuers should review, and amend as necessary, existing policies and procedures with respect to 10b5-1 plans to ensure they are consistent with the amended rules, including the new mandatory cooling-off periods.

Issuers should consider requiring compliance with the new requirements for any 10b5-1 plans being adopted prior to the effective date of the new rules, especially in light of recent SEC enforcement activity related to use of 10b5-1 plans.

Issuers should also review their insider trading policies and procedures, in particular regarding trading windows, pre-clearance procedures, treatment of gifts and any consequences related to noncompliance with such policies."
Cooley,Filling the Gaps: SEC Adopts Final Rules on 10b5-1 Trading Plans and Related Disclosures,"The new requirement to publicly file insider trading policies and procedures as an exhibit to Forms 10-K and 20-F will for many issuers be the first time their insider trading policy and procedures are publicly disclosed.

As a result, issuers should consider whether any amendments may be desirable to strengthen or add clarity to existing provisions prior to such public disclosure.

With respect to the mandated disclosure on the timing of option awards, issuers should consider whether any changes to their current grant policies and practices are appropriate in order to, among other things, avoid having to provide the required narrative and tabular disclosure and any implication that the awards were timed to take advantage of material nonpublic information.

Even if regular option grants are set to occur outside of the disclosure window with respect to the filing date for an issuers Form 10-Qs and Form 10-K, issuers will need to adopt appropriate controls in order to monitor any grants that are made within four business days before or one business day after Form 8-K filings in order to determine whether disclosure under Item 402(x) will be required.

Cooley associate Stephanie Gambino also contributed to this alert.

Notes:

Officer means any Section 16 officer as defined in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(f).

To help issuers determine what qualifies as a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, the SEC adopted the following definition of non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement: A trading plan where the director or officer asserts that, at a time when they were not aware of material nonpublic information, such person adopted a written arrangement for trading the securities, and the trading arrangement specified (1) the amount, price and date upon which the securities are to be purchased or sold, (2) a written formula or algorithm for determining the amount and price for purchasing or selling, or (3) did not permit the covered person to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to effect purchases or sales, provided that any person acting on behalf of such covered person does not have access to material nonpublic information."
Cooley,[Video] 2022 – 2023: Year in Review and a Look Ahead,"Listen in as Cooley partners Chad Mills and Jason Kent reflect on the past year, discuss 2022 trends and take a look at the year ahead.

Key takeaways 2022 was a particularly active year for the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the proposed adoption of significant new disclosure rules relating to cybersecurity and climate-related information, as well as the final adoption of pay-versus-performance disclosure rules, representing a higher compliance burden on most public companies moving into 2023 and beyond.

While the SEC has not yet adopted proposed cybersecurity and climate-related information disclosure rules  nor has it proposed expected enhanced human capital and other disclosure rules related to environmental, social and governance (ESG)  the SEC, investors and, importantly, the plaintiffs bar, continue to actively focus on ESG disclosures by public companies.

Risk disclosure continues to be a focus too, with the SEC sending sample comment letters in late 2021 and 2022 addressing, among other things, climate change risks and exposure to Ukraine conflict-related risks in the Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections.

In addition to the pay-versus-performance disclosure rules, the SEC adopted new rules to require the use of universal proxy cards in contested elections, and companies are well-advised to revisit their bylaws to ensure that appropriate protective changes are effected.

Board diversity will remain a hot-button topic in 2023, with Nasdaqs comply or explain rule going into effect, as well as continued scrutiny from ISS, Glass Lewis and institutional investors.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – December One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts amendments to rules governing 10b5-1 plans, related disclosures On December 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had voted unanimously to adopt new rules regarding Rule 10b5-1 plans and related disclosures, in addition to other matters.

The following are the key changes to the affirmative defense to insider trading liability under Rule 10b5-1(c)(1): A mandatory cooling-off period (time between plan adoption and first trade) for directors and (Section 16) officers of the later of: 90 days following plan adoption or modification.

Two business days after the disclosure of the issuers financial results in a Form 10-Q or 10-K for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was adopted (but not to exceed 120 days after plan adoption or modification) before any trading can begin under the trading arrangement.

A mandatory 30-day cooling-off period for persons other than issuers or directors and officers before any trading can begin under the trading arrangement or modification.

(The SEC didnt adopt a cooling-off period for issuers, given pushback from commenters on how this would impact buyback programs.)

A condition for directors and officers to include a representation in their Rule 10b5-1 plan certifying that, at the time of the adoption of a new or modified plan: They are not aware of material nonpublic information about the issuer or its securities.

They are adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5.

Limitations on anyone other than issuers to: Use multiple overlapping Rule 10b5-1 plans, although theres an exception for separate 10b5-1 plan arrangements in place solely to enable sell-to-cover transactions upon vesting of equity awards (but not upon exercise of options).

Rely on the affirmative defense for a single-trade plan to one such plan during any consecutive 12-month period.

A condition that all persons entering into a Rule 10b5-1 plan must act in good faith with respect to that plan.

The amendments also create new disclosure requirements that include: Quarterly disclosure by registrants regarding the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and certain other written trading arrangements by a registrants directors and officers for the trading of its securities.

Annual disclosure of a registrants insider trading policies and procedures (filed as 10-K exhibit).

Certain tabular and narrative disclosures regarding awards of options close in time to the release of material nonpublic information and related policies and procedures.

Tagging of the required disclosures.

A requirement that Form 4 and 5 filers indicate by check box that a reported transaction was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c).

The final rules become effective 60 days after publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register.

Section 16 reporting persons will be required to comply with the amendments to Forms 4 and 5 for beneficial ownership reports filed on or after April 1, 2023.

Issuers will be required to comply with the new disclosure requirements in Exchange Act periodic reports on Forms 10-Q, 10-K and 20-F, and in any proxy or information statements in the first filing that covers the first full fiscal period that begins on or after April 1, 2023.

The final amendments defer by six months the date of compliance with the additional disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies.

SEC updates guidance on non-GAAP financial measures On December 13, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance updated its Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DIs), reflecting the SECs ongoing focus on use of potentially misleading non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – December One-Minute Reads,"The changes include these revisions and updates: C&DI 100.01 states that whether an adjustment thats not explicitly prohibited is misleading depends on the companys facts and circumstances; it also expands what may be misleading, indicating that normal recurring cash operating expenses are one example, and that an operating expense occurring repeatedly or occasionally, including at irregular intervals, will be viewed as recurring.

C&DI 100.04 updates prior interpretation regarding problematic individually tailored accounting principles and provides an expanded list of example presentations that may be considered misleading.

C&DI 100.05 is a new C&DI with examples of misleading labeling of non-GAAP measures.

C&DI 100.06 is a new C&DI explaining that a non-GAAP financial measure could be so misleading that even extensive, detailed disclosure about each adjustments nature and effect would not prevent it from being materially misleading.

C&DI 102.10 updates, breaks into subparts and expands examples of presentations of non-GAAP financial measures that would violate the equal or greater prominent requirement.

SEC announces enforcement results for 2022 On November 15, the SEC announced its fiscal year 2022 enforcement statistics , setting records and highlighting the current administrations robust enforcement activity.

According to the press release, the SEC filed 760 enforcement actions in 2022, representing a 9% increase over 2021, including 462 new enforcement actions, a 6.5% increase over 2021.

The SEC recovered a record $6.4 billion in civil penalties, disgorgement and prejudgment interest in actions, a 68% increase from $3.8 billion in 2021.

While civil penalties hit a record high of $4.2 billion in 2022, disgorgement penalties declined by 6% from 2021.

As reported by The Wall Street Journal , Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal highlighted the fact that the SEC imposed more penalties than disgorgements in 2022, which demonstrates that the potential consequences of violating the law are significantly greater than the potential rewards.

The SEC press release also addressed various other focus areas for enforcement, including investigations in parallel with criminal law enforcement, the use of data analytics, meaningful cooperation during an investigation, rewarding and protecting whistleblowers, environmental, social and governance (ESG), cybersecurity, crypto, financial fraud and public company disclosures, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among other topics.

A few key takeaways include: 72% of the 395 new independent directors added over the past year are from historically underrepresented groups.

98% of boards include two or more women directors, compared with 61% of boards in 2012.

18% of the incoming class of 2022 directors were age 50 and younger, up from 16% in 2021.

70% of boards report a mandatory retirement policy, and 53% of those boards have set the retirement age at 75 or older.

93% of companies disclose their boards racial or ethnic composition, up from 60% in 2021.

15% of companies included LGBTQ+ disclosure in their proxy statement, more than twice as many as in 2021 (6%).

Average board tenure is 7.8 years, up from 7.7 years in 2021, but down from 8.6 years in 2012.

Glass Lewis releases policy guidelines for US proxy voting, ESG initiatives On November 17, Glass Lewis published its 2023 US proxy voting policy guidelines , with several changes to its 2022 guidelines, including: It will transition from a fixed numerical approach to a percentage-based approach for gender diversity, and it will generally recommend voting against the nominating committee chair of any board that is less than 30% gender diverse at companies in the Russell 3000.

It will generally recommend voting against the nominating committee chair of any board with fewer than one director from an underrepresented community at companies in the Russell 1000.

It will generally recommend voting against the chair of the nominating and/or governance committee for companies in the Russell 1000 with particularly poor disclosure of director diversity and skills.

It will generally recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee where companies in the Russell 1000 have not provided any disclosure of individual or aggregate racial/ethnic minority board demographic information.

It will generally recommend voting against the governance committee chair of any company in the Russell 1000 that fails to provide explicit disclosure concerning the boards role in overseeing environmental and social issues.

It believes companies with material exposure to climate risk stemming from their own operations should provide thorough climate-related disclosures in line with recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.

It notes that boards of these companies should have explicit and clearly defined oversight responsibilities for climate-related issues, and that it may recommend voting against responsible directors in instances where it finds these disclosures to be absent or significantly lacking.

It will closely evaluate proposals to adopt officer exculpation provisions on a case-by-case basis and, unless a compelling rationale for the adoption is provided by the board and the provisions are reasonable, it generally will recommend voting against proposals eliminating monetary liability for breaches of the duty of care for certain corporate officers.

In addition, Glass Lewis made changes to its voting guidelines related to overboarding, board oversight of cybersecurity risks and the minimum percentage of long-term incentive grants that should be performance-based.

In its 2023 ESG initiatives policy guidelines , Glass Lewis made further changes from 2022, including: In their proxy statements, companies should provide clear disclosure concerning the identity of the proponent (or lead proponent, if multiple proponents have submitted a proposal) of any shareholder proposal that may be going to a vote, or it will generally recommend voting against the governance committee chair.

For shareholder proposals requesting racial equity or civil rights audits, it will assess these factors, after which it will generally recommend voting in favor of well-crafted proposals: The nature of the companys operations.

The level of disclosure provided by the company and its peers on its internal and external stakeholder impacts  and the steps it is taking to mitigate any attendant risks.

Any relevant controversies, fines or lawsuits.

It may recommend voting against proposals requesting companies adopt a policy that shareholders must approve severance payments exceeding 2.99 times the amount of the executives base salary and bonus, where companies have already adopted such policies.

ISS ESG updates Governance QualityScore methodology On October 31, ISS ESG announced changes to the methodology it uses to calculate its Governance QualityScore (GQS), which is a scoring and screening solution designed to assist institutional investors in reviewing a companys governance quality and governance risk."

ISS publishes cybersecurity disclosure benchmarking report On November 17, ISS published a progress report that benchmarks cybersecurity disclosures among the S&P 500 and Russell 3000, while referencing cybersecurity-related questions included in ISSs GQS.

Some key takeaways include: While 31% of the S&P 500 and 58% of the Russell 3000 provide just general disclosure when identifying and mitigating information security risks, 69% and 40% (respectively) disclose a clear approach.

11% of the S&P 500 and 48% of the Russell 3000 disclosed no directors with cybersecurity experience, while most S&P 500 companies disclosed having more than one director with cybersecurity experience.

While only 23% of the S&P 500 do not disclose whether or how often senior leadership briefs the board on information security matters, 62% of the Russell 3000 does not disclose the same information.

64% of the Russell 3000 disclose no information on the companys information security training program, compared to just 24% of the S&P 500.

61% of the S&P 500 and 49% of the Russell 3000 disclose entering into an information security risk insurance policy."
Cooley,Alaska Incorporates Virtual Currency Into Its Money Transmission Regulatory Regime,"A new rule amending Alaskas money transmission regulations expands the scope of money transmission activity subject to regulation to include virtual currency.

As a result, effective January 1, 2023, companies engaged in virtual currency money transmission to, from or within Alaska will be required to obtain an Alaska money transmission license.

The amended regulations also establish that virtual currency is a permissible investment, but only to the extent of a licensees virtual currency obligations to its customers (e.g., virtual currency custodied on behalf of such customers).

Expansion encompasses virtual currency

The regulation adopted by the Division of Banking and Securities (DBS) changes Title 3, Chapter 13, of the Alaska Administrative Code, effective January 1, 2023, to: Establish that an activity or transaction that would be covered as money transmission remains covered, if that activity or transaction is in the form of virtual currency (new 3 AAC 13.005).

Require a person engaging in money transmission activity involving virtual currency to submit a licensing application (new 3 AAC 13.006).

Define permissible investments to include virtual currency for outstanding virtual currency denominated in the same currency (amended 3 AAC 13.810).

Add a definition of virtual currency and expand the definition of monetary value to include virtual currency (3 AAC 13.990, as repealed and readopted).

Similar to other states that have expressly defined virtual currency for the purposes of money transmission regulation (or the equivalent), the DBS has adopted an expansive definition of virtual currency, defining it as a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value; and is not money, whether or not denominated in money.

The definition excludes, however, affinity and rewards programs and digital tokens related to online games, provided that certain criteria are met.

As a result of this change, companies that engage in any activities involving virtual currency in Alaska likely will need to assess whether those activities, if involving fiat money, would come within the scope of activity subject to regulation under the Alaska money transmission law.

For example, does the activity involving virtual currency constitute (or is it analogous to) receiving money or monetary value for transmission per  06.55.990(15) of the money transmission law?

Mapping blockchain-related activities back to the world of traditional centralized finance may be challenging, but this regulatory approach does have the virtue of at least trying to be technology-agnostic and regulating the activity (i.e., moving value on behalf of others) regardless of how it is performed.

Limited Licensing Agreement eliminated Prior to adopting this rule, the DBS had determined that it did not have the jurisdiction to regulate virtual currency activity under its money transmission statute.

Nevertheless, companies that engaged in activity involving fiat money and virtual currency generally were required to obtain an Alaska money transmission license.

To do so, such companies were required to enter into a Limited Licensing Agreement (LLA) with the DBS that, among other things, required a licensee to post a statement that its license had not been issued for the licensee to transmit virtual currency, using the phrase Please note that this license does not cover the transmission of virtual currency.

As a result of the explicit inclusion of virtual currency activity as money transmission activity requiring a license, the DBS is phasing out the LLA requirement, and LLAs currently in effect will be voided and removed from the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System record on January 1, 2023.

It is not clear if the change to the regulations will require current Alaska licensees that engage in virtual currency activity to take any action."
Cooley,Alaska Incorporates Virtual Currency Into Its Money Transmission Regulatory Regime,"It is not clear if the change to the regulations will require current Alaska licensees that engage in virtual currency activity to take any action.

Presumably, licensees will need to remove the disclaimer stating that the license does not cover virtual currency transmission, given that virtual currency activity is subject to licensing effective January 1; existing money transmission licenses should cover such activity to the extent previously disclosed to the DBS (e.g., in application materials), but more clarity on this point will be necessary.

Finally, companies engaged in virtual currency activity that they previously concluded did not require an Alaska money transmission license will need to reevaluate their compliance position when the new rule takes effect at the beginning of next year if they transmit or custody virtual currency to, from or within Alaska."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Public Enforcement Order Registry for Nonbank Financial Services Providers,"On December 12, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a proposed rule that would require nonbank covered persons to report certain public agency enforcement actions and court orders for publication in a publicly available, online database called the nonbank registration system (NBR).

In addition to requiring that nonbank covered persons submit filings to the NBR within 90 days of the effective date of any applicable order, the proposal would require nonbank covered persons to appoint a senior executive to attest to compliance with any such orders on an annual basis.

Interested parties may submit comments to the proposed rule through the Federal eRulemaking Portal , by email or via direct mail.

Comments must be received by the CFPB on or before February10,2023.

Proposed registration and filing requirements The CFPB proposes establishing the NBR pursuant to its authority under the Consumer Financial Protection Act to monitor markets for consumer financial products and services and to identify risks to consumers.

Consistent with its ongoing focus on so-called repeat offenders, the CFPB noted that the NBR would help identify and prevent further consumer harm from companies that repeatedly violate consumer financial protection laws.

The CFPB also noted in the proposed rule that a public registry of agency and court orders issued or obtained in connection with violations of law would help the [CFPB] and the broader public monitor trends concerning corporate recidivism relating to consumer protection law, including areas where prior violations of law are indicia of risk to consumers.

The proposed rule includes the following key provisions: Nonbank covered persons must register and submit to the NBR specific information about final, public orders issued by federal, state, or local agencies or courts.

Nonbank covered entities would be required to submit the information within 90 days of the effective date of any such order and update the NBR within 90 days of amendment, modification, termination, extension, or any other change to the information originally filed.

Orders triggering a filing obligation include those issued, at least in part, in any action or proceeding brought by a federal, state, or local agency and containing provisions that impose obligations based on alleged violations of certain consumer financial protection laws.

Applicable consumer financial protection laws include federal consumer financial law, any other law over which the CFPB has jurisdiction to enforce, the prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act and related rules, and state laws and rules prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices.

The proposed rule also would require nonbank covered persons to appoint a senior executive to complete an annual attestation regarding the companys compliance with orders filed with the NBR.

The attestation would include a written statement that describes the steps the executive took to review and oversee the entitys activities subject to the order and states whether, to the executives knowledge, the entity has identified any violations of or instances of noncompliance with an applicable order.

These ongoing and annual filing requirements resemble those already in place for many nonbank covered entities who must report regulatory enforcement actions and court orders to state regulators either directly or through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS).

Nonbank covered entities must attest to the accuracy of their record, including the regulatory action disclosures, each time a filing is submitted in the NMLS and annually to satisfy license renewal requirements."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Public Enforcement Order Registry for Nonbank Financial Services Providers,"Mortgage lenders that originate or service mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration must also submit notice to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) within 10 days of becoming the subject of allegations of violations of certain consumer financial laws or entering into agency or court orders that impose sanctions.

HUD also requires mortgagees to attest to compliance with those reporting requirements on an annual basis, although it updated the annual recertification process in January 2020 to remove statements attesting to compliance with all applicable HUD regulations after many mortgagees declined to complete such sweeping attestations.

Many state regulators post orders online  either on agency websites or on the NMLS Consumer Access site  and state attorneys general and federal agencies regularly publish orders with press releases notifying the public and other regulators of enforcement actions against nonbank covered entities.

According to the CFPB, some state agencies expressed concern regarding possible duplication between any registration system the [CFPB] might build and existing registration systems.

However, the CFPB stated that making the NBR publicly available would allow other regulators  tasked with protecting consumers to realize the same market monitoring benefits and enhance the ability of consumer advocacy organizations, researchers, firms conducting due diligence, and the media to locate, review, and monitor orders enforcing the law.

The CFPB also indicated that it may consider the information filed in the NBR when making supervisory and even civil money penalty decisions.

The CFPB noted that it considers nonbank covered persons compliance records when prioritizing supervisory resources and pointed to its congressional mandate to consider an entitys history of previous violations 1 when assessing civil money penalties, strongly implying that prior violations of state laws may lead to more severe penalties in CFPB enforcement actions.

What does this mean for you?

The proposed rule indicates that the NBR and related filing requirements would not be implemented until January 2024 at the earliest.

Additionally, the proposed rule is just that  a proposal  that may change after the CFPB receives and considers public comments.

Nevertheless, industry should expect that the CFPB will establish an online, publicly available database of enforcement actions that will need to be updated regularly and very likely will require an annual certification of compliance  or disclosure of instances of noncompliance  with any orders that appear therein.

Therefore, nonbank covered persons should be prepared to incorporate CFPB notice requirements into ongoing material event filing processes, and they should carefully consider any written attestations submitted by executive officers regarding compliance with ongoing orders.

If implemented as outlined in the proposal, the new registry will have far-reaching consequences for industry.

First, reporting federal, state, and local enforcement actions and court orders has never been a pleasant task for industry, but these matters now will carry additional significance if they are publicly available in a single database.

Although the CFPB emphasized the NBRs utility for regulatory agencies and research, plaintiffs counsel also will use the data to identify potential targets for class action lawsuits.

Additionally, the CFPBs consideration of historical state law violations in assessing civil money penalties increases the risks associated with entering into any public enforcement orders, as they may lead to the CFPB imposing repeat offender penalty amounts despite no prior CFPB consent orders.

Finally, the annual attestation requirement is reminiscent of HUDs annual recertification statements that were revised in January 2020 after industry declined to complete broad certifications of compliance with HUD rules."
Cooley,CFPB Proposes Public Enforcement Order Registry for Nonbank Financial Services Providers,"Similar to the CFPBs current proposal, HUD previously required mortgagees to certify that during the applicable period, the mortgagee complied with all HUD regulations and requirements necessary to maintain HUD approval, including the FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook, which expressly required mortgagees to comply with all federal, state and local laws.

2 After that sweeping language was used to impose treble damages under the False Claims Act, many mortgagees declined to certify without risk-mitigating caveats  and HUD ultimately narrowed the recertification statements.

The CFPBs proposal presents similar concerns by requiring nonbank covered persons to attest to compliance with all agency and court orders reported in the NBR, or to proactively report instances of noncompliance or violations, regardless of materiality.

As with the HUD certification statements, consent orders can contain broad language prohibiting violations of a number of consumer protection laws  even those that were not the basis of the order  such that attesting to compliance may present similar concerns of heightened risk.

Cooley,European Commission Proposes Extending Transition Period Foreseen in Medical Devices Regulation,"The implementation of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) was discussed on the second day of the meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) on 9 December 2022.

The European Commission proposes to extend the transition period currently foreseen in the MDR for devices certified in accordance with the Medical Device Directive (MDD) and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) through legislative amendment of the transitional provisions of the MDR.

The extension of the transition period would be in the form of a staggered approach based on the risk classification of devices.

The transition period foreseen in the MDR provides that the deadline for recertification of medical devices in accordance with the regulation is 26 May 2024.

A broad range of stakeholders, including the medtech industry, consider this timeline to be unattainable and have called on the European Commission to extend the recertification deadline.

This extension would be based on the risk classification of devices and would mean that devices certified in accordance with the MDD and the AIMDD will remain on the market in the European Economic Area (EEA) after the end of the currently applicable transition period.

The European Commission proposes the following targeted legislative amendments: Extension of the transitional provisions foreseen in the MDR based on the risk class of each device.

26 May 2027 for high-risk (Class III and Class IIb) medical devices 26 May 2028 for medium- and low-risk (Class IIa and Class I) medical devices Elimination of the sell-off date of 26 May 2025 for medical devices that are already available on the EEA market to prevent safe medical devices from being removed from the market.

EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides noted that the proposed amendments would apply solely to medical devices that are safe for patients.

Following discussion with the health ministers of the EU member states, Kyriakides acknowledged the need for interim measures in relation to CE certificates of conformity previously issued for medical devices that have expired or will expire soon.

Shortly after the EPSCO meeting concluded, the European Commission published a position paper prepared by the Medical Device Coordination Group.

The purpose of the position paper is to ensure a uniform approach to the application of market surveillance measures to bridge the gap between the expiration of certificates and the issuance of new certificates.

The position paper provides guidance on how competent authorities should apply Article 97 MDR to devices that do not comply with the MDR due to expiration of their CE certificates of conformity issued in accordance with the MDD and the AIMDD before being certified under the MDR.

In addition to the proposed legislative amendments, the European Commission intends to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the MDR by May 2027.

The purpose of the evaluation is to identify structural problems with the MDR, as well as potential medium- and long-term solutions to these concerns.

Moreover, the European Commission intends to fund actions to support the implementation of the MDR under the EU4Health programme starting in early 2023.

If you have any questions about the effect of the extension of the MDR transition period, please reach out to a member of your Cooley life sciences regulatory team."
Cooley,OFSI’s 2021 – 2022 Annual Review: Key UK Sanctions Highlights,"On 10 November 2022, the UKs Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) published its 2021  2022 Annual Review .

In this alert, weve summarised its main takeaways.

The publication of the Annual Review comes at a time when there has been a significant shift in sanctions policy in the UK, largely driven by the response of the UK and its allies to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The report indicates the material increase in workload by OFSI in dealing with the implementation of Russian-related sanctions and the necessary expansion of its capabilities.

What is also clear is that the Ukraine situation has provided the UK government and OFSI with the impetus to implement an expanded sanctions framework in the UK.

In addition to introducing expanded enforcement powers, OFSI is in the process of adopting a more visible and proactive enforcement approach, noting that the impact of Russian sanctions will result in a permanent and profound transformation to the way it operates.

Sanctions against Russia OFSIs Annual Review highlights how the financial sanctions imposed against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have impacted OFSIs activities.

Key statistics in OFSIs enforcement strategy against Russia for 2021  2022 include: A total of 18.39 billion in Russian assets were reported as frozen to OFSI through 20 October 2022.

Since the invasion, OFSI has received 236 sanctions breach reports.

OFSI received 642 licence applications under the Russia regime.

OFSI issued 33 general licences  31 solely in respect of Russia and two for mixed regimes including Russia.

OFSI signed more than 75 engagements with 50+ countries to ensure multilateral implementation of the sanctions system, including one cooperation agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the US sanctions authority).

OFSI issued two monetary penalties  both to fintech firms  for making funds available to the Russia National Commercial Bank.

There were 1,271 Russia regime-designated persons added to the consolidated list from 22 February to 24 August 2022.

In practical terms, the extensive demands placed on OFSI as a result of Russia-related sanctions have led to a significant expansion of its workforce, with OFSI expecting to more than double its employee count by the end of 2022.

Whilst for the time being this is to manage Russia-related workflows, it means that OFSI is well-placed to extend its enforcement activities.

Licensing The Annual Review also highlights the development of OFSIs licensing approach.

OFSI now has the power to issue general licences that allow multiple parties to undertake specified activities without applicants needing to submit a specific licence.

In 2021  2022, OFSI issued 17 general licences (in addition to 33 general licences issued in respect of the Russia regime), in comparison to only one for the previous year.

The use of general licences provides benefits to OFSI, allowing it to avoid dealing with multiple licence applications whilst providing parties with some clear parameters as to permissible activities sooner than would be the case if individual applications were to be made.

We can expect OFSI to continue using this power more widely going forward.

OFSI indicates that in developing its approach to general licences, it is seeking to align with key international partners, which would be a welcomed development.

Regarding specific or individual licensing, OFSI reports that it is continuing to develop more streamlined procedures for assessing licence applications and making licence decisions, having acknowledged that the process can be slow at times.

OFSI will continue to prioritise applications for humanitarian assistance licences, situations where there is a threat to human life, and/or issues of personal basic needs or issues deemed to be of strategic, economic or administrative importance.

Enforcement A main theme reported by OFSI is the strengthening of its enforcement powers."
Cooley,OFSI’s 2021 – 2022 Annual Review: Key UK Sanctions Highlights,"Enforcement A main theme reported by OFSI is the strengthening of its enforcement powers.

This has been predominantly achieved through the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 , which came into force on 15 June 2022, with key changes including: Enacting a strict civil liability test for imposing monetary penalties for financial sanctions breaches.

Creating a new legal power to publicise details of financial sanctions breaches even where no monetary penalty is imposed.

Enhancing powers to share information between government organisations.

During the reporting period, OFSI considered 147 reports of suspected financial sanctions breaches submitted by the public, with the number of reported breaches significantly increasing since the Ukraine invasion.

It also notes that it is receiving an increasing number of referrals of suspected breaches from international partners, highlighting the expansion of international cooperation in sanctions enforcement.

Indeed, a strong emphasis in the Annual Review is the extension of OFSIs activities with its international partners, a trend which we can expect to continue.

Looking ahead OFSI has recognised that the Russian sanctions regime is likely to continue dominating its work over the coming year and remains the most extensive regime currently in place.

Whilst OFSIs focus of the past six months has been responding to the implementation of the extensive Russian sanctions regime, the increase in OFSIs workforce and powers will enable it to take an active approach to enforcing sanctions more generally.

OFSI references it as an evolving enforcement strategy, noting that it will expand its intelligence function by developing a targeting capability, as well as implementing a new, intelligence-led, proactive compliance and enforcement approach.

The introduction of the Russia regime has been a testing issue for many.

Interestingly, OFSI acknowledges the difficulties faced by companies, stating that [w]e recognise the significant challenge that the Russian sanctions represent for those implementing them in the private and voluntary sectors and pay tribute to their commitment.

However, whilst the Annual Review highlights the necessary expansion undertaken by OFSI and its improved licensing capability, it is silent on the scope of practical guidance provided to companies.

In contrast to the European Union, there has been limited guidance issued by OFSI on the implementation of and compliance with Russian sanctions.

However, this may change in the coming year, as OFSI stated in the Annual Review that one of its objectives is to ensure that regulation is clear, fair, [and] effective and allows business to operate as smoothly as possible.

Cooley,Another Win for the SEC: Securities and Exchange Commission v. LBRY,"In Securities and Exchange Commission v. LBRY, Inc. , a federal court in New Hampshire found that under the Howey test, digital tokens sold by LBRY were securities, and that LBRYs offer and sale of those unregistered securities therefore violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.

1

In mid-2016, LBRY publicly launched its LBRY Network, a digital platform for distributing content in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology similar in its cryptography and consensus mechanism to the first widely adopted blockchain network, Bitcoin.

LBRYs professed long-term goals for the LBRY Network included serving as an alternative for YouTube and Amazon.

2

The rules that LBRY developed to publicly guide the operation of the LBRY Network allowed for the creation of one billion digital tokens native to the LBRY Network called LBRY Credits (LBC), of which 400 million would fall under the control of LBRY for various uses.

3 One of these uses was to fund the LBRY Networks continued development and provide profit for the [LBRY] founders with 100 million LBC.

4 Another use was the sale of 53.9 million LBC to the public directly through applications developed by LBRY itself and indirectly through third-party digital asset trading platforms.

5 In March 2021, the SEC brought an action against LBRY in the US District Court for the District of New Hampshire, claiming that LBRY had violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by offering and selling unregistered securities, seeking from LBRY civil penalties, disgorgement of monies LBRY obtained through these offerings, and injunctive relief.

6 LBRY raised two defenses to this claim: LBC was not, indeed, offered as a security.

LBRYs right to due process was violated because the SEC did not provide fair notice that its offerings were subject to securities law.

After discovery in the matter, both parties filed motions for summary judgment.

On November 7, 2022, Judge Paul J. Barbadoro granted the SECs motion.

In determining whether an offering of securities occurred, the LBRY court applied the well-known Howey test, which was first laid out in Securities and Exchange Commission v. W.J. Howey Co.

Both parties agreed that the first two prongs of the test had been met (i.e., that the offerings of LBC constituted investment[s] of money in a common enterprise).

However, LBRY contended that there was no expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of  a third party in its offerings of LBC  the third Howey prong  because LBC had a utility within the LBRY Network and some purchasers, thus, bought LBC for its consumptive use and not with a view to profit.

LBRY further argued that most of LBRYs public communications did not discuss the future value of LBC.

7 Watch all communications related to token distribution The LBRY court rejected LBRYs arguments regarding what LBRY characterized as the relative few communications it made regarding the future value of the token.

The LBRY court noted numerous instances in which LBRY made private and public statements connecting the value of LBC to its development of the LBRY Network and the future efforts LBRY would be taking to develop the network.

For example, it noted that LBRY had asserted in a blog post that [o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned, and that LBRY contended in an email to a private investor that [i]f our product has the utility we plan, the [LBC] should appreciate accordingly.

8

The retention of tokens may be a factor In its analysis, the LBRY court also indicated that LBRYs choice to hold 100 million LBC to fund LBRY Networks development and profit its founders was evidence that the offering and sale of LBC was made pursuant to an expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others."
Cooley,Another Win for the SEC: Securities and Exchange Commission v. LBRY,"The court reasoned that any reasonable investor who was familiar with [LBRYs] business model would have understood the connection between LBRY profiting by holding onto a certain amount of LBC and its advancement of LBCs value.

9

Having a utility does not in itself impact Howey analysis for a token The court also rejected LBRYs argument that the purchase of LBC for consumptive, and not speculative, use by some of its buyers suggests that LBC is not a security for any of its buyers.

The court suggested that the intended use of the token by a subset of LBC purchasers was of limited relevance to the overall analysis, which ultimately indicated that LBC was a security under the Securities Act.

10 SECs lack of prior similar enforcement action does not constitute lack of notice In arguing that the SEC had deprived LBRY of due process by not providing fair notice that LBC was a security, LBRY relied on its claim that this was the first enforcement case brought by the SEC for a digital token that was not issued pursuant to an initial coin offering (ICO).

LBRY cited Upton v. Securities and Exchange Commission , in which the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the SECs novel interpretation of a rule, after a long history of interpreting that same rule in a different way, could not be wielded against an unsuspecting defendant for behavior that the rule did not expressly prohibit, prior to the SEC publicly acknowledging its new interpretation.

11

However, the court distinguished Upton on the grounds that the SEC was not relying on a novel interpretation of a rule but on long-standing US Supreme Court precedent ( Howey) .

The LBRY court found that regardless of whether this was the first time the SEC had brought an action against a token issuer that had not conducted an ICO, LBRY could not claim it had not received fair notice that its conduct was unlawful.

Cooley,CFPB Reports Highlight Regulatory Concerns With Tenant Background Checks,"On November 15, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued two reports  titled  Tenant Background Checks Market Report  and the  Consumer Snapshot: Tenant Background Checks   reflecting concerns over incomplete and inaccurate data in tenant screening reports.

The reports expand on themes articulated in connection with the CFPBs 2022 list of consumer reporting companies and in a 2021 CFPB bulletin , namely, that the bureau views inaccuracies in tenant screening reports to have the potential to severely harm individuals financial lives, and it believes that the risks posed by such inaccuracies may be even more elevated as pandemic-related interventions protecting renters expire.

Interestingly, the reports were issued just a day after a White House meeting on tenant protections and rent affordability, which was attended by more than 70 tenant leaders and advocates, housing providers, legal advocates, and housing policy experts.

Overview of the reports The two reports are based on analysis of 17 tenant screening companies and more than 26,000 consumer complaints submitted to the bureau between January 2019 and September 2022.

Tenant screening companies are described by the bureau as entities that provide landlords and property managers with identity verification, rental history (including eviction records and rental payment histories), credit checks, income and employment verification, and/or criminal background checks.

The CFPB indicates that the information that these companies convey is often rife with errors, incomplete or outdated, and may have minimal value in actually predicting tenant behavior.

As such, the CFPB concludes that some tenant screening companies are not meeting the legal requirements under the [Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)] to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in the reports they compile.

The CFPB also stresses that while landlords and property managers relying on tenant screening reports are required to provide an adverse action notice to an applicant if they are denied or required to take on lease terms that are not required of others due to information in a screening report, they often do not do so.

As a result, renters were not consistently informed of their right to dispute information in their tenant screening reports and, thus, did not always understand how to file a dispute.

The final sections of both reports reflect the bureaus intent to continue monitoring tenant screening companies and take action to help renters and rental applicants exercise their rights.

In particular, the Tenant Background Checks Market Report emphasizes that the CFPB will take further action to ensure tenant screening companies are complying with FCRA by: Identifying guidance or rules that can be issued to ensure compliance.

Determining how to require background screening companies to develop and maintain appropriate and accurate consumer reporting practices.

Coordinating law enforcement efforts with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  which included its own statement in the press release accompanying the CFPBs reports  to ensure tenant screening companies maintain reasonable procedures to assure accurate information in the consumer reporting system.

Coordinating with federal and local government agencies to ensure tenants receive information about potential inaccuracies in their reports in a timely fashion, and that compliant adverse action notices are provided.

To support these statements, the Consumer Snapshot: Tenant Background Checks references recent CFPB publications concerning compliance with FCRA, underscoring the bureaus view that tenant screening companies must comply with FCRA and take note of the opinions outlined in the bureaus recent FCRA-focused publications.

What to expect?"
Cooley,CFPB Reports Highlight Regulatory Concerns With Tenant Background Checks,"What to expect?

The reports do not announce immediate legal action or regulatory reforms, but reflect the bureaus continued commitment to address inaccuracies in consumer reports, and its intent to coordinate with other federal agencies, such as the FTC, as well as state agencies , to hold participants in the consumer reporting industry accountable.

Given that the CFPBs interest in tenant protections is clearly shared by the FTC, as well as the White House, we expect that coordinated investigations and enforcement, in particular, of tenant screening companies, may be on the horizon."
Cooley,"Q3 2022 Venture Financing Report – Downward Trends Continue in Deal Count, Invested Capital and Pre-Money Valuations","Cooley handled 298 disclosable venture capital financings for Q3 2022, representing $8.1 billion of invested capital, continuing a downward trend for both metrics and representing the lowest for both since Q4 2019.

In Q2 2022, we reported 332 disclosable VC financings with invested capital of $16.6 billion, and in Q1 2022, we reported 401 disclosable VC financings with invested capital of $24.3 billion.

We have witnessed the downward trend in amounts raised during 2022 across all stages of financing, but it is most pronounced in later-stage deals (Series C and later).

For example, Series D and later deals have seen a 78% drop in amount raised during 2022, dropping from $10.5 billion in Q4 2021 to just $2.3 billion in Q3 2022.

The amount raised in Series C deals dropped more than 64%, from $3 billion in Q4 2021 to $1.1 billion in Q3 2022.

The drop from Q4 2021 to Q3 2022 was nearly 61% for Series B deals (from $5.3 billion to $2.1 billion), 50% for Series A deals (from $3.5 billion to $1.8 billion) and only 9% for seed deals (from $932 million to $849 million).

These declines in amounts raised are consistent with trends seen in the broader market.

The more significant drops in later-stage deals compared to early-stage deals is expected, given longer time horizons to exits in early-stage deals, leading to more stability for investors.

Median pre-money valuations also declined during Q3 2022 at all levels of financing, with the largest decrease occurring in later-stage deals.

The median pre-money valuation for Series D or later deals dropped from a record high of $3.5 billion in May 2022 to just $527 million in September 2022, the lowest median pre-money valuation seen for Series D or later deals since May 2020.

For Series C deals, median pre-money valuations dropped from $502 million in June 2022 to $130 million in September 2022, the lowest since August 2020.

The median pre-money valuation for Series B deals dropped from $164 million in June 2022 to $90 million in September 2022, the lowest seen since May 2020.

The decline in median pre-money valuation was less significant for Series A and seed deals, again likely reflecting more stability in early-stage deals due to longer time horizons for exits.

The median pre-money valuation for Series A deals dropped from $58 million in June 2022 to $45 million in September 2022, the lowest seen since July 2021.

For seed deals, the median pre-money valuation decreased slightly over Q3 from $18.6 million in June 2022 to $17.6 million in September 2022.

The average pre-money valuation for seed deals has remained relatively consistent since late 2021.

Even though invested dollars, deal volume and valuations were generally down, Q3 2022 deal terms themselves continued to be generally favorable for companies.

In Q3 2022, 95% of disclosable deals had non-participating preferred stock, down just slightly from the 97% reported for Q2 2022.

While still at a high 87% of deals for Q3 2022, the percentage of up rounds declined from 94% in Q2 2022 and is at the lowest level since Q3 2020, where 80% of deals were up rounds.

The percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision remained low, at just 4.4% of disclosable deals, up slightly from numbers earlier in 2022 and 2021.

Similarly, the percentage of deals involving a recapitalization also remained low at 1.3%, reflecting a small increase since early 2022 and all of 2021, where deals with a recapitalization made up less than 1% of disclosable deals.

In PitchBooks Q2 2022 Global League Tables , Cooley was ranked as the #1 law firm in the US for overall venture deal count.

Cooley also continued to hold the top spot globally and in the US for representation of companies in venture capital transactions.

The firm was credited as the second-most active law firm in the US and globally for representation of investors in VC deals and globally for overall venture deal count."

Spotlight on technology Deal volume and invested capital for technology company venture financings continued to decline in Q3 2022.

During the quarter, Cooley handled 182 disclosable financings of technology companies, representing more than $4.7 billion of invested capital.

This is the lowest deal volume for technology companies since Q3 2020, when Cooley handled 165 disclosable deals, and the lowest amount raised since Q1 2020, when Cooley handled 168 disclosable deals representing more than $3.7 billion of invested capital.

Average disclosable deal size during the quarter for financings of technology companies decreased to just over $26 million in Q3 2022, compared to more than $57 million in Q2 2022.

Spotlight on life sciences Deal volume and invested capital for financings of life sciences companies also continued to decline in Q3 2022.

During the quarter, Cooley handled 51 disclosable financings of life sciences companies, representing more than $1.5 billion of invested capital.

This is down slightly from 53 disclosable deals for life sciences companies, representing more than $2.4 billion of invested capital in Q2 2022.

Disclosable deal sizes for financings of life sciences companies also decreased to an average deal size of more than $31 million in the quarter, as compared to an average deal size of more than $46 million in Q2 2022 and well below the averages seen throughout 2021.

The percentage of life sciences financings structured in tranches increased to 20% of disclosable deals (from 19% in Q2 2022).

These percentages are high compared to the percentages of tranched deals for earlier in 2022 and all quarters in 2021, but low compared to Q3 and Q4 2020, where life sciences deals structured in tranches exceeded 20% of deals.

Cooley,Louisiana’s Virtual Currency Licensing Law Taking Effect (Finally),"In August 2020, Louisiana adopted the Virtual Currency Businesses Act (VCBA) to regulate virtual currency activity in the state.

In doing so, it joined New York as only the second US state to establish a stand-alone payments regulatory regime for virtual currency activities, although other states that have expressly addressed the regulation of virtual currency have generally done so through their existing money transmission laws.

The implementation of the Louisiana law was pending the promulgation of final regulations by the states financial regulator, the Office of Financial Institutions (OFI).

Those regulations were formally adopted through an emergency rule last month.

As a result, Louisianas virtual currency regulatory scheme finally takes effect on January 1, 2023, and applications for licensure are supposed to be available through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) as of that date.

A license or other equivalent permission is required for a covered entity to continue engaging in virtual currency business activity in Louisiana after June 30, 2023.

Louisiana Virtual Currency Businesses Act The stand-alone virtual currency regime established by the VCBA, and implemented by the OFI rulemaking, is more granular than most state approaches to virtual currency regulation.

In this regard, the structure and requirements of the VCBA are broadly similar to New Yorks long-standing BitLicense regulations.

Like New Yorks law, the VCBA requires a license to engage in virtual currency business activity with or on behalf of a Louisiana resident.

(A resident includes a person domiciled in or who has a place of business in the state, and a person is defined as an individual, partnership, estate, business or nonprofit entity, or other legal entity.)

The VCBA defines virtual currency as a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, and that is not legal tender, whether or not denominated in legal tender.

It defines virtual currency business activity as exchanging, transferring, or storing virtual currency or engaging in virtual currency administration.

This definition excludes , among other things, a digital representation of value issued by or on behalf of a publisher and used solely within an online game, game platform, or family of games sold by the same publisher or offered on the same game platform.

Virtual currency administration constitutes issuing virtual currency with the authority to redeem the currency for legal tender, bank credit, or other virtual currency, which suggests that stablecoins are likely also subject to regulation under the regime.

The transfer of virtual currency subject to regulation also is broadly defined to include assuming control of virtual currency from, or on behalf of, a resident and doing any of the following: (a) Credit[ing] the virtual currency to the account of another person; (b) Mov[ing]

the virtual currency from one account of a resident to another account of the same resident; [and] (c) Relinquish[ing] control of virtual currency to another person.

The licensing requirements for the virtual currency license are similar to those for a standard fiat currency money transmission license  and, to some degree, resemble the requirements for the New York virtual currency license application.

The application, which must be submitted through the NMLS, requires background information about the applicant, a business plan, information about Financial Crimes Enforcement Network registration and related compliance matters, biographical information and criminal background checks for control persons, and surety bond and net worth requirements.

The surety bond requirement is based on the volume of virtual currency activity (up to a $1 million volume-based surety bond maximum), but the banking department maintains the discretion to increase the requirement to $7million."
Cooley,Louisiana’s Virtual Currency Licensing Law Taking Effect (Finally),"The net worth requirement is the greater of $100,000 or 3% of total assets.

The calculation of net worth can include virtual currency measured by the average value of the virtual currency in United States dollar equivalent over the prior six months, subject to certain limitations.

Implementing regulations and timeline The OFI will begin accepting initial applications for licensure through the NMLS on January 1, 2023.

According to the regulations, completed applications for licensure submitted on or before April 1, 2023, will receive an approval, conditional approval, or denial by the end of June 2023.

(There is also a separate registration for persons engaging in a de minimis volume of virtual currency business activity in the US, but the regulations do not further elaborate on the process for registration, such as how it would be handled through the NMLS.)

Implementing regulations were published in the Louisiana Register on October 20, 2022 .

The regulatory rule filing is somewhat unusual because, for administrative reasons, the OFI published the unchanged draft regulations as a final rule, but immediately promulgated an emergency rule , striking the text inserted by the final rule and replacing it with the updated regulations informed by public comment.

Therefore, the actual rule in effect is not the final rule but, rather, the emergency rule currently at 10:I 1901-1937.

Notably, the implementing regulations include additional definitions not in the VCBA.

These definitions establish, among other things, the triggers for control of a regulated entity, and provide that failure to meet withdrawal requests constitutes an unsafe or unsound act.

Regulation of virtual currency under state payments regulations Although Louisiana is joining New York as the second state with a stand-alone virtual currency payments regulatory scheme, a number of states have already addressed the regulation of such activities under their money transmission laws.

Nearly all US jurisdictions regulate money transmission under state-specific licensing regimes, and a license may be required before a person can engage in certain types of virtual currency activities in a particular jurisdiction.

As a result, any company seeking to bring new virtual currency products and services to market in the US generally needs to consider the potential applicability of state money transmission licensing laws.

Despite a decade of experience with virtual currency, money transmission regulators have not found a consistent way to apply their laws to virtual currency activities (even though each states law generally applies to the same type of money-movement activity).

Roughly 13 states  other than Louisiana and New York  have expressly addressed the regulation of virtual currency through amendments to their money transmission statutes, while many others have issued some interpretive guidance.

A significant number of states still have not established a formal, public position on the regulation of virtual currency activity.

As a result, determining if a particular activity involving virtual currency is subject to state licensing may require a state-by-state analysis  and often entails significant uncertainty.

Broadly, however, states approaches to regulating virtual currency transmissions fall into four buckets: 1.

States that regulate both virtual currency activities and related fiat activities These states have specifically addressed crypto by amending money transmission statutes or regulations, or by issuing guidance, and have brought activities such as enabling crypto trading, custodying crypto, and transferring crypto (as well as fiat currency on- and off-ramps) within the existing money transmission regime."
Cooley,Louisiana’s Virtual Currency Licensing Law Taking Effect (Finally),"2. States that have indicated they do not regulate virtual currency activities but have expressly stated that they may regulate certain fiat currency activities in connection with virtual currency activities For example, facilitating the transfer of fiat currency in connection with the purchase of virtual currency through an exchange, or custodying fiat to facilitate crypto trades, may be subject to licensing in these jurisdictions.

3. States that have expressly stated that they do not currently regulate virtual currency activities (in some cases, even including certain associated activities involving fiat currency)

These states also have specifically addressed crypto by amending money transmission statutes or regulations, or by issuing guidance, but in so doing have explicitly excluded crypto-related activities from the money transmission law, including related fiat currency activities.

4. States that have not established any formal, public position regarding the applicability of their money transmission laws to virtual currency activities In these states, virtual currency activities (and related fiat currency activity) could still generally be subject to regulation as money transmission if the statute were interpreted to encompass virtual currency as money or monetary value, as applicable.

At least two states  Kansas and Texas  have indicated in guidance that certain activities involving stablecoins are subject to money transmission regulation, even though activities involving other virtual currencies (e.g., bitcoin) may not necessarily be.

Of note, despite this uneven and unclear regulatory regime across US states with respect to virtual currency activities, a number of well-known exchanges and trading platforms have been able to obtain money transmission licenses, and are therefore subject to safety and soundness examination and oversight in most states.

What now?

Given recent and persistent volatility in the digital asset space, the trend toward crypto-specific state legislation is likely to continue, even as there are increased calls for federal regulation.

In the near term, however, any company engaging in virtual currency activities will need to consider whether the Louisiana VCBA applies and, if so, start the application process soon in order to remain in operation in the state when the law takes final effect at the end of June 2023."
Cooley,CFPB Publishes Bulletin Analyzing Rise in Crypto-Asset Complaints,"On November 10, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin analyzing consumer complaints submitted to the CFPB over the past four years related to crypto-assets and platforms.

According to the CFPB, fraud, scams and transaction issues accounted for almost two-thirds of those complaints.

Indeed, shortly after the bulletins release, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in other public commentary described crypto as a new vector for fraudsters.

Underlying many of the complaints were concerns with the level of customer service provided by crypto companies when issues arose.

The bulletin describes risks to consumers and steps consumers can take to protect themselves, while highlighting areas of focus for crypto companies wanting to reduce their potential risk.

CFPBs analysis of complaints The CFPB considered more than 8,300 consumer complaints submitted between October 2018 and September 2022 from all 50 US states.

Based on that review, the CFPB found that fraud and scams lead the list of concerns raised by consumers, followed by transaction issues.

Fraud, scams, thefts and hacks According to the bulletin, alleged fraud or scams make up over half of the crypto complaints the CFPB has received so far in 2022, and that percentage has steadily increased in the past year.

In September 2022, fraud or scams accounted for 63% of all crypto-related complaints.

Consumers have reported large losses as a result of fraud or scams, and popular crypto platforms have found themselves the target of hacks, including by certain nation-state actors.

The bulletin reports that hackers associated with North Korea reportedly have stolen more than $2 billion in crypto-assets, with more than $1 billion reportedly lost between January 2022 and July 2022 alone.

Although the CFPB cautions consumers to watch out for signs of a scam and not to mix crypto-assets and romance, it also suggests that crypto firms are not without culpability.

The bulletin indicates that customer service deficiencies at crypto companies have create[d] opportunities for scammers to impersonate customer service representatives to gain access to consumers wallets and steal their crypto-assets, and that failures to timely respond to customer outreach exposes consumers to unnecessary risks.

The bulletin also questions whether crypto-asset platforms are effectively identifying and stopping fraudulent transactions in light of the prevalence of fraud and scam complaints.

Transaction issues, account access and frozen accounts Transaction issues accounted for the second-largest percentage of crypto-related consumer complaints.

Reported transaction issues occurred when buying or selling crypto-assets, or when attempting to withdraw assets from crypto platforms.

They included complaints about undisclosed or unexpected costs on crypto-asset platforms, fees assessed in contradiction of the companys disclosures and representations, and trouble with consumer account access.

The bulletin also reported an increased number of complaints regarding platforms freezing customer accounts and then filing for bankruptcy protection, with some consumers reportedly losing six figures or more.

Other complaints described companies refusing and ignoring requests from consumers to withdraw assets, often contradicting their disclosures.

What this means for crypto companies The bulletin comes after months of severe turbulence in the crypto market, and as a dramatic uptick in consumer participation in crypto-assets has been accompanied by a rise in consumer risks and consumer protection scrutiny.

It also follows the Department of Justices announcement earlier this year of the first director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to promote platform accountability, and the recent announcement that one of the largest crypto exchanges has filed for bankruptcy ."
Cooley,CFPB Publishes Bulletin Analyzing Rise in Crypto-Asset Complaints,"With all this activity, it is imperative for crypto companies to assess their controls and take action to reduce their potential risk.

The CFPBs bulletin highlights the need for crypto companies to have in place robust fraud identification and prevention controls, and provide customers with compliant disclosures to reduce the potential risk of government scrutiny and liability.

Providing a channel for consumers to raise concerns and direct complaints to the company to manage  rather than a regulator  is also a key takeaway that is particularly important at a time when crypto-assets and platforms are under scrutiny."
Cooley,PEG Releases New Statement of Principles for the Disapplication of Pre-Emption Rights,"On 4 November 2022, the UK Pre-Emption Group (PEG) issued a new Statement of Principles on disapplying pre-emption rights and associated template resolutions .

The Statement of Principles has been revised with immediate effect in line with the recommendations of the UK Secondary Capital Raising Review (SCRR) published in July 2022.

The SCRR was launched by HM Treasury in October 2021 in response to Lord Hills UK Listing Review and was asked to consider how to improve the efficiency of capital raisings by listed companies in the UK.

The SCRR made several recommendations to support the principle of pre-emption while increasing the ability to raise smaller amounts of capital quickly and give flexibility to companies that need to raise larger sums of capital more frequently.

The SCRRs recommendations were accepted in full by the UK government and endorsed by the PEG, which is currently working to establish the formal governance and membership structure proposed by the SCRR.

The PEG will make a further announcement when this work is complete.

Application of pre-emption rights and the Statement of Principles Pre-emption rights are a cornerstone of UK company law and are enshrined by the UK Companies Act 2006, which provides that they may be disapplied by a special resolution of shareholders at a general meeting of the company.

In addition, a company with a premium listing on the Financial Conduct Authoritys Official List that is incorporated outside the UK is required by the UK Listing Rules to ensure that its constitution provides for rights of pre-emption for shareholders that are at least equivalent to those statutory rights that apply to UK incorporated companies.

The Statement of Principles, which was last revised in 2015, provides guidance on the factors to be taken into account by companies and investors when considering the case for disapplying pre-emption rights.

The Statement of Principles applies to issues of equity securities for cash other than on a pre-emptive basis (i.e., other than pro rata to existing shareholders) by all companies (wherever incorporated) with shares admitted to the premium segment of the Financial Conduct Authoritys Official List.

Companies with shares admitted to the standard segment of the Official List, to the High Growth Segment of the London Stock Exchanges main market, or to trading on AIM, are also encouraged to adopt the principles.

The principles expressly apply to all issues of equity securities that are undertaken to raise cash, irrespective of the legal form of the transaction  this includes so-called cash-box transactions which may be structured as an issue of equity securities for non-cash consideration falling outside the statutory pre-emption under UK law.

In addition, several proxy advisory firms (in particular, ISS) have historically incorporated the thresholds set out in the Statement of Principles into their voting policies for UK incorporated companies that are listed in the United States.

Key changes in the new Statement of Principles The key changes in the new Statement of Principles are summarised below.

Increase in the pre-emption disapplication threshold The new Statement of Principles recommends that shareholders support resolutions at a companys annual general meeting for an annual disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of up to 20% of a companys issued share capital.

This comprises: Up to 10% of issued share capital, to be issued on an unrestricted basis.

An additional up to 10% of issued share capital to be used only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding 12-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue."
Cooley,PEG Releases New Statement of Principles for the Disapplication of Pre-Emption Rights,"In each case, companies may seek further authority to disapply pre-emption rights for up to an additional 2% of issued share capital, which may be used only for the purposes of a follow-on offer to retail investors and existing shareholders after a placing of equity securities.

The expected features of such follow-on offers are set out in the Statement of Principles and include, among other things, that qualifying shareholders should be entitled to subscribe for shares up to a monetary cap of no more than 30,000, that the number of shares issued should not exceed 20% of those issued in the placing, and that the price of the shares should be equal to, or less than, the offer price in the placing.

Conditions for use of the 20% disapplication authority Companies issuing equity securities non-pre-emptively pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights should: Prior to announcing the issue, consult in advance with key shareholders to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by law.

Give due consideration to the involvement of retail investors and existing shareholders not allocated shares in the placing.

It may be appropriate for companies to make shares available through a retail investor platform or a follow-on offer.

Explain the background to and reasons for the offer and the proposed use of proceedings, including details of an acquisition or specified capital investment.

As far as possible, make the issue on a soft pre-emptive basis.

Involve company management in the allocation process.

Report publicly on the issue via a Regulatory Information Service within one week of the placing, using the short template included in the Statement of Principles.

Enhanced authority for capital hungry companies Companies that need to raise larger amounts of capital more frequently may seek additional disapplication authority or a disapplication over a longer period than the recommended 15 months.

Companies should specifically highlight the reasons for any additional disapplication at the time the request is made for a general disapplication.

Companies that wish to be considered capital hungry for these purposes should make clear disclosure in their initial public offering prospectus.

Next steps for companies The PEG recommends that companies should obtain shareholder approval for capital raisings in line with the new guidance at their next annual general meeting, including the use of the template resolutions when seeking such shareholder approval.

Companies that wish to make a non-pre-emptive offer before that time under the new regime due to urgent or exceptional circumstances should follow the transitional measures agreed between the PEG and the SCRR."
Cooley,CFPB Takes Question of Its Constitutionality Straight to Supreme Court,"As widely reported, on October 19, 2022, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rulemaking on the grounds that the mechanism for funding the CFPBs operations is an unconstitutional violation of the appropriations clause of the US Constitution.

On November 14, the CFPB decided to skip review by the full panel of the Fifth Circuit and take this critical question right to the US Supreme Court, asking it to set the case for argument this term , given the significant legal and practical consequences of the outcome for the entire financial services industry.

Fifth Circuit struck down rulemaking on constitutional, rather than procedural, grounds In Community Financial Services Association of America v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a trade association asked the Fifth Circuit to strike down the bureaus 2017 payday lending rule because, it argued, the CFPB acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and therefore exceeded its statutory authority when it promulgated the rule, and the CFPBs funding mechanism  drawing funds from the Federal Reserves operating expenses rather than directly through the appropriations process  was unconstitutional.

As to the first question, the Fifth Circuit found that the CFPB had appropriately exercised its authority to declare certain practices unfair, finding that the bureau properly studied the issue in question, considered comments made during the rulemaking process, and had a reasonable basis to conclude that a particular act was unfair.

However, the Fifth Circuits determination that the CFPBs rulemaking process was appropriate was rendered moot by its determination that the CFPBs funding mechanism was unconstitutional.

CFPB argues to Supreme Court that funding mechanism is constitutional  and warns of collateral damage in ruling to the contrary In its petition to the Supreme Court , the CFPB claims the Fifth Circuits ruling is based on an unprecedented and erroneous understanding of the Constitutions appropriations clause and warns that a ruling to the contrary will call into question almost every CFPB action taken since it was created.

The CFPBs brief then marches through the history of the congressional appropriations process, and notes that a host of federal entities are funded through permanent appropriations, rather than an annual congressional authorization process.

The CFPB also notes that other financial services regulators derive funding from sources outside of congressional appropriations, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board.

Finally, the bureau notes that, even if the funding mechanism is constitutional, the Fifth Circuit failed to conduct an appropriate severability analysis, which would have more appropriately preserved the CFPBs ability to continue its functions despite the constitutional issues with the funding mechanism.

Whats next?

Only time will tell if the Supreme Court decides to pick up the case this term and how it will resolve this critical issue.

In the absence of legal clarity, the CFPB has nevertheless shown no signs of withdrawing from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement activity in the aftermath of the Fifth Circuits decision.

Indeed, the bureau has since the Fifth Circuits ruling promulgated new rules, continued conducting examinations and even settled a pending lawsuit."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – October One-Minute Reads,"SEC charges executives with insider trading despite purported 10b5-1 plan On September 21, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced insider trading charges against both the CEO and the former president of Cheetah Mobile for selling Cheetahs securities while in possession of material nonpublic information (MNPI), despite doing so under a purported 10b5-1 trading plan.

In its order, the SEC alleged that the executives established a 10b5-1 plan after discovering a significant decrease in advertising revenues, thereby avoiding losses by selling securities under the plan before disclosing the negative trend to stockholders.

Establishing the 10b5-1 plan under these circumstances negated its affirmative defense against insider trading liability, as a 10b5-1 plan must be established when the insider is acting in good faith and is not aware of any MNPI for it to be a valid defense.

This case serves as yet another example of the SECs resolve to hold executives accountable when they try to skirt federal securities laws to illegally trade on nonpublic information, said the chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisions Market Abuse Unit.

Cheetahs CEO also was charged for being involved in the companys misleading disclosures, including on the companys earnings call, surrounding a material negative revenue trend.

For more information on the charges, see this September 26 PubCo blog post on the case .

SEC releases electronic Form 144, announces compliance date On September 23, the SEC announced that the EDGAR system is ready to accept electronic Form 144 filings , and released a new page with resources for filing Form 144 electronically .

On October 18, the SEC also announced that the compliance date for the electronic Form 144 filing requirements will be April 13, 2023.

As covered in this PubCo blog post on SEC electronic submissions , in June the SEC adopted amendments to require certain forms that are currently permitted to be filed or submitted in paper format to be filed or submitted electronically through EDGAR, including Form 144.

After the compliance date, it will generally be mandatory to file Form 144 electronically.

DOJ focuses on director interlocks The Corporate Counsel recently blogged about the Department of Justices increasing focus on overlapping directorships that might violate Section 8 of the Clayton Act beyond just M&A activity, which generally prohibits competitors from having overlapping directors or managers.

On October 19, the DOJ has announced that seven directors have resigned from corporate board positions in response to concerns by the Antitrust Division that their roles violated the Clayton Acts prohibition on interlocking directorates, including directors from five different public companies.

Given this focus, companies should evaluate whether any of their directors or officers also serve on the board or management of a competitor and ensure that there is a process by which to screen and monitor for director and officer interlocks.

Corp Fin issues new Section 16 and Section 13 CDIs related to ETFs On August 25, the SEC Division of Corporation Finance (Corp Fin) posted new compliance and disclosure interpretations (CDIs) addressing issues regarding beneficial ownership under Section 16 and Rule 13d-3 related to exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

These new CDIs address questions that have arisen with the use of information barriers to avoid attributing beneficial ownership of some ETF-traded securities.

In summary: Question 109.02 asks whether an authorized participant (AP) in an ETF can rely on informational barriers to determine whether it is a beneficial owner of more than 10% of the ETFs portfolio securities that are acquired on its behalf in a confidential account, on a disaggregated basis from other accounts of the AP."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – October One-Minute Reads,"In this fact pattern, an ETF does not disclose the identities and quantities of its portfolio securities on each trading day, but allows an AP to complete creation and redemption transactions through a confidential brokerage account with an agent for the benefit of the AP.

According to the CDI, the AP can rely on informational barriers in this fact pattern as long as the arrangement is consistent with the Commissions guidance regarding the calculation and reporting of beneficial ownership status set forth in Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998).

Question 209.06 covers a scenario where an ETF has APs (or the APs parent holding company) whose directors or officers  serve as a director of an issuer of securities

[that were] purchased or sold as part of the ETFs in-kind creation or redemption baskets.

This can cause the AP or its parent company to be deemed a director of that issuer for Section 16 purposes based on implicitly deputizing that person to serve as a representative on the issuers board.

According to the CDI, an AP and its parent company can avoid being deemed to have a pecuniary interest in a security in the creation or redemption basket for Section 16 purposes if the ETF substitutes cash for the basket security, so that neither the AP nor anyone on its behalf would trade the security.

Question 105.07 lays out the same facts as CDI 109.02 above but instead relates to Rule 13d-3.

According to the CDI, the AP can again rely on informational barriers in this fact pattern to calculate its beneficial ownership, as long as the arrangement is consistent with the SECs guidance in Release No. 34-39538.

ISS publishes global benchmark policy survey On October 10, ISS published the results of its annual global benchmark policy survey , which is used every year to inform its policy development process.

Key findings highlighted by ISS, among others, include: A majority of investor and non-investor respondents would consider it a material governance failure if companies that are considered significant greenhouse gas emitters had an absence of adequate disclosure with regard to climate-related oversight, strategy, risks and targets according to a framework such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Investors also selected a company not setting realistic medium-term targets (through 2035) for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions (50%), not declaring a net-zero ambition by 2050 (47%), and not setting realistic medium-term targets (through 2035) for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions (45%) as the next most common governance failures among significant emitters.

Investor respondents, when considering the top three priorities for determining if a companys climate transition plan is adequate, replied with setting appropriate medium-term targets (42%), whether the companys capital expenditure outlook aligns with its long-term strategy and if the company has disclosed assumptions underpinning its strategic plans (41%), and the extent to which the companys disclosures are in line with TCFD or other framework recommendations (38%).

75% of investor respondents favored including commentary by auditors in the audit report on climate-related risks for significant emitters, while 64% supported climate-related risks being included by auditors in critical audit matters.

Most investors agreed that there should be a de minimis exception to ISSs recommendation (effective February 1, 2023) to vote against certain directors at US companies that maintain a multiclass capital structure with unequal voting rights  no more than 5% was the most popular threshold chosen.

Respondents also favored the chair of the governance committee and any director with supermajority shares as the appropriate targets for an adverse vote recommendation due to a multiclass structure."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – October One-Minute Reads,"Respondents also favored the chair of the governance committee and any director with supermajority shares as the appropriate targets for an adverse vote recommendation due to a multiclass structure.

Nearly two-thirds of non-investors replied that smaller companies should be exempted from negative recommendations for maintaining classified boards or a supermajority voting requirement, while most investors stated that they should not be exempt.

While 42% of investors indicated that most companies would benefit from an independent racial equity or civil rights audit where permissible, 45% indicated that any benefit would depend on company-specific factors, including outcomes and programs.

In addition, 56% of non-investors responded that company-specific criteria are the best determiners of which companies would benefit.

Among those who believed these audits should depend on company-specific factors or who disagreed that most companies would benefit from such an audit, most investors and non-investors (83% and 77%, respectively) identified company involvement in significant diversity-related controversies as indicative that a company would benefit from such an audit.

SECs final climate rules delayed On October 19, Bloomberg reported that the SEC is months away from finalizing expansive new climate disclosure requirements as the agency juggles investor demands for more transparency, tech glitches and a tough Republican legal threat.

The article also noted that SEC officials in private conversations have given no indication theyll finish the rules this year, according to several people in contact with the agency.

Given the volume of comments received, the decision in West Virginia v. EPA curbing the power of administrative agencies, and a technical glitch that caused the SEC to reopen the comment period, the delay from the October timeline included in the SECs agenda is not too great a surprise.

Cooley,"CFPB Reiterates Obligations of Credit Bureaus, Furnishers Under FCRA’s Dispute Provisions","On November 10, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau(CFPB) issued Circular 2022-07 , affirming the duty of consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) and furnishers to conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

This latest policy statement comes on the heels of a CFPB advisory opinion regarding inclusion of facially false data in credit reports and a blog post reminding furnishers that they must investigate all disputes received from CRAs  and may not deem those as frivolous or irrelevant to evade this obligation.

Importantly, the circular and the bureaus accompanying press release call for state attorneys general and state regulators to enforce FCRAs dispute provisions, and bring actions against entities that fail to timely or effectively investigate and resolve consumer disputes.

Overview of Circular 2022-07 FCRA requires that CRAs and furnishers conduct a reasonable investigation of all disputes received from consumers that are not frivolous or irrelevant.

The CFPB, drawing from supervisory examinations as well as consumer complaints, notes that CRAs and certain furnishers failed to conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes, which can adversely affect consumers eligibility for credit, insurance or housing.

Specifically, the circular highlights practices that the bureau deems contrary to FCRAs dispute provisions, and lays out a path for state attorneys general and state regulators to police such practices: CRAs and furnishers may not evade their obligation to investigate consumer disputes by requiring that consumers submit specific information or documentation beyond statutory requirements as a precondition to investigation, or by requiring that consumers provide dispute information in a particular format or through the entitys proprietary forms.

CRAs must promptly provide furnishers with all relevant information regarding a consumers dispute, including supporting documentation submitted by the consumer, such as bank statements, billing statements or checks.

Noting that information sharing between CRAs and furnishers typically is done electronically, the bureau said CRAs should provide furnishers with electronic images of consumers dispute documentation to show compliance with their statutory obligation.

The circular also reiterates the CFPBs view that furnishers must investigate all indirect disputes received from CRAs, and they may not circumvent this requirement by deeming a dispute frivolous or irrelevant.

What to expect CRAs and other participants in the credit reporting market continue to receive significant attention from the CFPB.

The circular is yet another example of the bureaus focus on the credit reporting industry, and reflects its renewed efforts to encourage states to regulate and enforce credit reporting practices .

It also follows the CFPBs recent trend of focusing on dispute resolution of all types  and the consumer protection implications of what they deem to be inadequate policies and procedures in this space.

We expect to see continued close coordination between the CFPB, state attorneys general and state regulators going forward, particularly in light of recent questions concerning the constitutionality of the CFPBs funding."
Cooley,Business Owner Pleads Guilty to Attempted Monopolization in Violation of Section,"On October 31, the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) delivered on its promise to pursue criminal enforcement of Section 2 of the Sherman Act when it secured a guilty plea from a highway paving contractor who propositioned his main competitor to enter into a market allocation scheme in an attempt to monopolize markets for highway crack sealing services.

The plea marks the first criminal enforcement under the monopolization statute of the Sherman Act in more than 40 years, and represents yet another step in the efforts of the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to dust off lesser-used theories, statutes, and case law to pursue an aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement .

1

The prosecution comes after a deputy assistant attorney general asserted that the DOJ had effectively ignored Section 2 when it came to criminal enforcement since the 1970s.

The DOJs criminal enforcement has traditionally focused on conspiracy fact patterns involving per se unlawful agreements between competitors, such as those to fix prices or allocate markets.

Against that backdrop, the remarks of DOJ leadership forecasting an interest in criminal enforcement of the monopolization statute sparked questions about how the DOJ would identify which monopolization violations were egregious enough to prosecute criminally, given that there is no per se or bright-line rule in the Section 2 context that distinguishes between lawful versus unlawful exclusionary conduct.

In fact, many courts struggle to differentiate between the two even when assessing alleged civil violations of the monopolization statute.

This recent action provides some guidance, though perhaps only in a limited context.

The conduct of the contractor, Nathan Zito, involved an invitation to conspire to allocate markets and avoid competing.

It is thus akin to an attempt to criminally conspire, and it more closely resembles a traditional criminal antitrust enforcement case rather than a civil monopolization case.

In this sense, while the case is certainly noteworthy and demonstrates the DOJs commitment to pursuing such invitations to conspire criminally under Section 2  as opposed to civilly, as it has on at least one occasion in the past  its significance should not be overstated.

United States v. Zito :

An invitation to collude to divide markets According to the charging document, in January 2020, Zito invited his main competitor to allocate markets for highway crack sealing projects.

Instead of agreeing to Zitos proposal, however, the competitor reported the incident to the DOJ, providing the government with evidence of Zitos proposal and anticompetitive intent through recorded phone calls.

Specifically, Zito proposed that he would withdraw from bidding on crack sealing projects in Nebraska and South Dakota if his competitor would withdraw from competing for such projects in Montana and Wyoming.

Zito also offered to pay his competitor for lost business in Montana and Wyoming, and he proposed that they memorialize the market allocation agreement.

The facts underlying the DOJs prosecution closely resemble a textbook market allocation scheme but for one important fact: There was no agreement.

Like price fixing, market allocation agreements are generally criminally prosecuted by the DOJ under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which requires evidence of an anticompetitive agreement between competitors for a finding of liability.

In this case, however, there was no agreement because Zitos competitor did not accept his invitation to collude.

If Zitos competitor had accepted the proposal, the DOJ almost certainly would have prosecuted the scheme under Section 1.

Instead, the DOJ charged the conduct as criminal attempted monopolization under Section 2, alleging that Zito and his competitor were frequently the only two companies that submit bids for crack sealing projects in the region."
Cooley,Business Owner Pleads Guilty to Attempted Monopolization in Violation of Section,"Thus, the DOJ argued, a successful market allocation scheme would have effectively allowed each to obtain a monopoly in their allocated states.

Consistent with that premise, Zito pled guilty to knowingly proposing the market allocation arrangement with a specific intent to gain monopoly power in the markets for highway crack sealing services in Montana or Wyoming.

Prior enforcement of invitations to collude In the past, the DOJ and the FTC have brought civil actions challenging invitations to collude.

For the past 30 years, the FTC has scrutinized invitations to collude across various industries, ranging from healthcare-related distribution to truck rentals under Section 5 of the FTC Act  a civil statute that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce (15 USC  45).

For example, the FTC has alleged that a publisher of coupon booklets unlawfully invited its only competitor to collude through the president and CEOs public statement made during an earnings call.

Another example involves the civil actions against Nationwide Barcode and InstantUPCCodes.com , in which the FTC alleged that a principal of one entity invited his competitor via electronic message to increase the prices for barcodes sold over the internet.

The DOJ also has criminally prosecuted invitations to collude as mail fraud and wire fraud, where communications took place by telephone, fax or email.

Those types of criminal enforcement actions are expected to continue.

In addition, in 1983, in United States v. American Airlines, Inc. , the DOJ brought a civil attempted monopolization case against American Airlines and its president for unsuccessfully inviting Americans major competitor, Braniff Airlines, to fix prices on certain city pair routes out of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

Braniff  like Zitos competitor  did not agree to the proposal but instead cooperated with the DOJ.

Absent an agreement on which to base a Section 1 charge, the DOJ brought an attempted monopolization action on the theory that the price-fixing scheme, if agreed upon, would have allowed these competitors to jointly monopolize the market for commercial air travel on the routes.

The shared monopoly theory has been criticized over the years, where the attempt was to jointly fix prices in a single market, but that criticism seems less applicable to an effort to divide markets, as in the Zito prosecution.

Relatedly, the agencies also have put down a marker that they intend to pursue signaling cases in which a competitor publicly signals its firms interest in engaging in coordinated price increases or capacity cuts, causing competitors to raise prices or reduce output.

For example, FTC Chair Lina Khan warned of the antitrust implications companies may face in the current inflationary environment for signaling to each other that theyre looking to engage in coordinated price hikes through public statements.

Important considerations for companies The DOJ is criminally prosecuting invitations to collude where the conduct resembles a failed attempt to form a cartel and the agreement, if executed, would allow the firms involved to monopolize markets.

Penalties can be stiff and may involve jail time, with violations of the Sherman Act carrying a maximum sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment and a maximum fine of up to $1 million.

Civil enforcement of certain invitations to collude is likely to continue.

In particular, the FTC and the DOJ are focusing on invitations to collude and signaling fact patterns predicated on public statements that appear to be aimed at facilitating coordinated price hikes or capacity cuts.

Companies should consider consulting counsel before publicly commenting (e.g., in earnings calls or industry conferences) on strategy with respect to future pricing, capacity, output, or customers."
Cooley,Business Owner Pleads Guilty to Attempted Monopolization in Violation of Section,"Companies should consider consulting counsel before publicly commenting (e.g., in earnings calls or industry conferences) on strategy with respect to future pricing, capacity, output, or customers.

As the DOJ and the FTC take a more aggressive tack on antitrust enforcement, it is important for companies to invest in an antitrust compliance program and regularly train personnel to reduce the likelihood of criminal and civil liability.

The DOJ has made clear that in evaluating charging decisions in criminal antitrust investigations, it will evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of a companys pre-existing antitrust compliance program, suggesting that an effective antitrust compliance program may prove critical in the face of criminal Section 2 charges.

Note: Other notable efforts include the DOJs recent wave of enforcement aimed at unwinding certain  interlocking directorates , which are prohibited under Section 8 of the Clayton Act; the FTCs efforts to reinvigorate Section 3 of the Clayton Act, which prohibits certain exclusionary distribution practices; and the DOJs ongoing efforts to pursue criminal per se treatment of wage-fixing and no-poach agreements ."
Cooley,No Poach Approach Continues DOJ Secures First Criminal Conviction,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division secured its first win in a criminal enforcement of labor market antitrust violations on October 27, 2022, when nurse staffing company VDA OC pleaded guilty to violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring with an unnamed competitor to allocate nurses and suppress wages of school nurses.

The company was sentenced to pay a criminal fine of $62,000, restitution of $72,000 and a court-ordered assessment of $400 by the US District Court for the District of Nevada.

1

The DOJs win against VDA follows the DOJs major trial losses just six months prior in other labor antitrust cases.

Summary of United States v. VDA OC, LLC

A grand jury indicted VDA and its former regional director, Ryan Hee, in March 2021 for conspiring to allocate nurses and to fix the wages of nurses working for the Clark County School District from October 2016 until July 2017.

2 VDA tried to dismiss the case, arguing, among other things, that the governments criminal prosecution violated its due process rights  in part because the DOJ guidance on criminal prosecutions for labor agreements was issued only a day before start of the conspiracy and because it would criminalize conduct never before recognized as criminal.

3

The district judge indicated that although he had not handled a case like this before, he was not inclined based upon his review of the law to grant dismissal, although he did not issue an actual denial of the motion to dismiss.

Although the company has pled guilty, Hee is scheduled to go to trial in April 2023.

What does this mean for you?

Although the fine imposed on VDA is relatively small, it is significant for a company of its size.

The DOJ calculated the fine based upon wages paid to the affected employees during the relevant time period  here, less than a year.

Thus, the fine amount could be exponentially higher for a larger company with a larger payroll, particularly if the conduct continued for a longer period of time.

This case further demonstrates that even limited agreements and conduct can lead to criminal prosecution.

VDA has said that the conduct giving rise to this case involved one telephone conversation and an email communication between an employee of VDA and a competitor, with both communications occurring on a single day.

4 Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said of the outcome that [t]odays guilty plea demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that workers receive competitive wages and a fair chance to pursue better work and that criminals who conspire to deprive them of those rights are held accountable.

Three other criminal labor market antitrust cases are currently pending in federal court.

It is certain that the DOJ will use this success to build momentum, but it remains to be seen if this matter will serve as the shift in tide the DOJ has been waiting for.

US civil enforcement also will continue The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently increased its attention to labor-related antitrust violations, announcing on July 19, 2022, that the agency and the National Labor Relations Board are engaging in information sharing, cross-agency training, and outreach related to areas of common regulatory interest , which include labor market developments relating to the gig economy and other alternative work arrangements; claims and disclosures about earnings and costs associated with gig and other work; the imposition of one-sided and restrictive contract provisions, such as noncompete and nondisclosure provisions; the extent and impact of labor market concentration; the impact of algorithmic decision making on workers; the ability of workers to act collectively; and the classification and treatment of workers.

Thus, we can expect civil violations in labor markets to continue as well.

Increase in labor market enforcement internationally International scrutiny on labor agreements also is on the rise."
Cooley,No Poach Approach Continues DOJ Secures First Criminal Conviction,"Thus, we can expect civil violations in labor markets to continue as well.

Increase in labor market enforcement internationally International scrutiny on labor agreements also is on the rise.

In October 2021, European Commission (EC) Executive Vice President and Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced a new era for cartel enforcement in the European Union, with a focus on non-classic cartels, including no-poach agreements, commenting that such agreements can have an impact on competition where they are used to keep wages down and where they restrict talent moving to where it serves the economy best.

Director-General Olivier Guersent of the ECs Directorate-General for Competition confirmed at a June 2022 conference in Paris that the EC is looking at how we could apply Article 101

[cartel prohibition] to these types of agreements in Europe.

5

Although the EC has yet to take action in this area, national competition authorities across Europe have started to examine these types of agreements in the context of anticompetitive behavior.

Cases of interest have centered around high-profile employees, such as tech engineers and athletes, but also include other industries, such as fast-food franchising and luxury fashion retail.

Poland The Polish competition authority (Urzd Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentw) started an investigation into the exchange of sensitive information and suspected collusion in respect of salary suspensions and termination clauses of basketball players contracts in April 2021.

In October 2022, the authority issued a combined fine of 197,616 euros to Energa Basketball Liga  Polands leading mens basketball league  and its 16 clubs.

This was the authoritys first no-poach infringement decision.

Portugal The Portuguese competition authority (Autoridade da Concorrncia) investigated the Portuguese Professional Football League in relation to an agreement between 31 sports clubs to not hire a player who unilaterally terminated their contract for reasons relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The authoritys statement of objection identified, among others, a reduction of quality in football matches as a result.

In April 2022, the league and football clubs were fined a total of 11.3 million euros.

Romania

In February 2022, Romanias competition council (Consiliul Concurenei) opened an investigation into seven automotive industry and tech companies concerning agreements to not contact or employ each others staff.

The authority also is examining suspected wage fixing.

Lithuania

The Lithuanian competition authority (Konkurencijos) imposed fines on the Lithuanian Basketball League and basketball clubs from between 1,000 euros and 17,000 euros in November 2021 for concluding anticompetitive agreements to not pay players after the end of the 2019  2020 basketball championship season.

Hungary The Hungarian competition authority (Gazdasgi Versenyhivatal) adopted a decision against the Association of Hungarian HR Consulting Agencies in December 2020 for including provisions in its ethical code relating to the fixing of minimum fees and the recruitment, hiring, and tender process.

The no-poach condition intended to divide up the market between members of the association by preventing employees from moving between companies and securing higher wages elsewhere.

The Hungarian competition authority identified those terms as restricting competition.

France The French competition authority (Autorit de la concurrence) fined manufacturers of PVC floor coverings in 2017 for, among other things, the agreement to exchange confidential information concerning staff salaries and bonuses, including a gentlemens agreement to not poach.

Netherlands As early as 2010, the Dutch court of appeal (Gerechtshof s-Hertogenbosch) decided against a no-poach agreement among hospitals that banned former employees from returning to work as self-employed agency workers at any hospital for a 12-month period."
Cooley,No Poach Approach Continues DOJ Secures First Criminal Conviction,"Spain Also in 2010, the Spanish competition authority (La Comisin Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia) adopted a decision against an agreement between transport freight forwarding agents that prohibited the hire of their respective employees without consent.

In 2011, the authority fined cosmetic product manufacturers for prohibiting cold calling or hire of respective staff without consent.

United Kingdom The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened its first investigation into wage fixing on the labor market in July 2022.

The CMA now is carrying out a cartel probe into four sports broadcasters allegedly fixing rates offered to freelancers.

Canada Competition law in Canada will soon go a step further and criminalize wage-fixing and no-poach agreements.

Other countries Labor market investigations also have been reported outside North America and the EU, including in Mexico , Brazil , Peru , and Colombia .

And, earlier this year, a court in China held nopoach and employee compensation-fixing agreements to be illegal for the first time.

Other investigations are certainly proceeding, and more are likely to come.

Next steps for companies In light of the increased agency activity regarding labor markets in the US and abroad, companies and employees should continue to consider implementing a robust antitrust compliance policy that not only covers the risks of price fixing or market sharing, but also addresses the potentially less obvious means of collusion.

In addition, they should consider antitrust training programs and engaging antitrust counsel surrounding any conduct that appears to raise red flags, based on the current enforcement trends.

Cooley,Vonage Settlement: FTC Focuses on Automatically Renewing Subscriptions,"On November 3, 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a $100 million settlement with Vonage , a provider of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services to residences and small businesses.

The FTC alleges that Vonage violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act by making it difficult for customers to cancel their VoIP subscriptions.

Specifically, the FTC alleges that Vonage: Required customers to speak with a live agent to cancel services they set up online.

Made it hard to locate the correct department to initiate cancellations.

Did not complete promised callbacks.

Subjected customers to long hold times.

Used aggressive sales tactics to retain customers once they did reach a live agent.

Disconnected calls, requiring customers to restart the cancellation process.

Used hidden early termination fees to further dissuade customers from cancelling.

The FTC alleges that these practices illegally caused customers to continue making payments for services they no longer wanted.

In its announcement, the FTC noted [t]his record-breaking settlement should remind companies that they must make cancellation easy or face serious legal consequences.

B2B transactions are not immune Notably, the FTC targeted not only Vonages practices in connection with residential consumers, but also its business-to-business (B2B) sales practices.

While many state laws governing automatically renewing subscriptions apply only to offers of goods or services acquired for personal, family or household purposes, the FTC views its enforcement authority more broadly.

Companies should take heed that the FTC may enforce the federal laws governing negative option offers even in the context of pure B2B transactions  particularly those involving small-business purchasers.

Understanding the FTCs negative option guidance The Vonage litigation is the latest in a long line of FTC enforcement actions involving automatically renewing subscriptions (also known as negative option plans).

In October 2021, the FTC updated its guidance in a new Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Negative Option Marketing .

This policy statement sets out specific principles the FTC contends companies should follow when offering automatically renewing subscriptions.

The FTCs guidance falls into three buckets: Disclosures The FTC tasks companies with clearly and conspicuously disclosing the material terms of any subscription offer.

While companies should refer to the full guidance, this includes stating in clear language that the consumer will be charged on a recurring basis unless they cancel, that such charges may increase after a trial period, the amount of such charges, the deadline for cancellation, and the date of future charges.

These disclosures also must include all information necessary to cancel the subscription.

The FTC further explains that such disclosures must be difficult to miss and easily understandable.

Among other things, this means the disclosures should visually stand out from accompanying text, cannot be in smaller text, and cannot be hidden behind a hyperlink or expandable text field.

These disclosures also must appear immediately adjacent to the button a user clicks to accept the terms of the subscription agreement (or adjacent to another mechanism for giving consent to the sales contract).

The FTC sets out additional specific requirements regarding disclosures, including for audio offers, in its policy statement.

Consent The FTC contends that companies must obtain the consumers acceptance of the negative option feature offer separately from any other portion of the entire transaction."
Cooley,Vonage Settlement: FTC Focuses on Automatically Renewing Subscriptions,"Consent The FTC contends that companies must obtain the consumers acceptance of the negative option feature offer separately from any other portion of the entire transaction.

This guidance arguably means that to avoid FTC scrutiny, companies need to secure consent to the terms defining the consumers automatically renewing payment obligation separately from any consent to the overall transaction  for example, by having customers check a box in a purchase flow that indicates they agree to the subscription terms, in addition to clicking a button to confirm the entire transaction.

While the FTCs guidance is not clear, this requirement appears particularly applicable where the transaction involves both an automatically renewing component and a one-time purchase bundled together.

More generally, companies must secure unambiguous affirmative consent, as further detailed in the FTCs policy statement.

Cancellation Most relevant to the Vonage litigation, the FTC tasks companies with providing simple, reasonable means for consumers to cancel that are at least as easy to use as the method the consumer used to initiate the subscription.

Among other things, the FTC policy statement prohibits sellers from subjecting consumers to multiple retention offers while they are trying to cancel their services or otherwise imposing delays on cancellation.

Companies also must provide cancellation options through the same medium they allow customers to use to sign up  for example, companies that enroll new customers online also must offer an online cancellation mechanism.

Where a company offers cancellation by telephone, it should provide, at a minimum, a telephone number, and answer all calls to this number during normal business hours, within a short time frame, and ensure the calls are not lengthier or otherwise more burdensome than the telephone call the consumer used to consent to the negative option feature.

Companies must then honor any attempts to cancel through these mechanisms.

Californias automatic renewal law

In addition to the FTC, dozens of states regulate automatically renewing subscriptions in what can be a daunting patchwork of different statutory requirements.

Californias law is among the most prescriptive, and it continues to be a robust source of public enforcement actions and private class action litigation.

Heres a summary of Californias requirements , including the most recent changes that took effect in July 2022.

Vonage settlement signals FTC focus on dark patterns While the Vonage settlement focuses particularly on improper hurdles to cancelling services, it reflects a broader FTC concern with so-called digital dark patterns, a term that refers to design practices that trick or manipulate users into making choices they would not otherwise have made and that may cause harm.

This September, the FTC issued a report titled  Bringing Dark Patterns to Light , which details dozens of tactics the FTC contends are harmful to customers.

For example, the report condemns dark pattern ads disguised as independent news articles, deceptive design elements of webpages and user interfaces that hide material disclosures or create undue urgency in purchasing decisions, marketing tactics that increase the risk of users inadvertently paying for goods or services they do not want, website flows that obscure privacy choices and, as seen in the Vonage settlement, roadblocks to cancelling subscriptions.

The Vonage settlement may be a sign of things to come, as the agency will likely continue looking for cases it can use to target more specific practices highlighted in the report.

Companies should police their advertising, purchase flows and cancellation processes accordingly."
Cooley,Life Sciences ESG Reporting Practices,"For companies of all industries, ESG matters have become an area of intense focus.

In addition to investor and activist pressure, the growth of ESG ratings  and proposed climate and broader ESG disclosure requirements in the US, EU and other jurisdictions  have led many companies to consider beginning or expanding ESG reporting efforts.

For life sciences companies, however, ESG reporting is often a particularly perplexing subject.

Investor focus on ESG matters is generally a more recent phenomenon for industry companies that also often are unsure which ESG topics are relevant to their business, especially earlier-stage companies.

We have prepared this report to help life sciences companies begin to answer such questions and provide insight into industry disclosure practices.

Cooley analyzed 45 environmental, social and governance (ESG) reports from US public biotech and pharmaceuticals issuers published in the past year.

The data below is limited to disclosure in stand-alone ESG, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or similar reports including dedicated reports under reporting framework templates, such as Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or CDP disclosures  and does not include disclosure in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.

However, in nearly all cases, issuers included significantly more information in such reports than in SEC filings, and it is extremely rare for SEC filings to contain more extensive quantitative or qualitative ESG disclosure.

Of the 45 reports analyzed, 44 are from Russell 3000 issuers.

As a general matter, the production of stand-alone, voluntary ESG reports is heavily concentrated among large-cap mature life sciences companies with numerous commercialized products and annual revenues of $500 million or more.

Nonetheless, our survey includes nine companies that we classify as early stage, which includes clinical-stage companies and early commercial-stage companies with two or fewer approved products and revenue of $75 million or less, as well as seven intermediate commercial-stage companies with two or fewer products and revenue between $75 million and $500 million.

There has been a significant increase in industry reporting over the past 18 months, and inaugural publications constitute the large majority of intermediate- and early-stage reports.

Given general market trends, and with many smaller companies either preparing or planning for ESG reports, we can reasonably expect a continued increase in the volume of reports, levels of quantification and earlier-stage reporting over the coming year.

Quantitative environmental disclosure The table above focuses exclusively on reports that provide quantitative disclosure on environmental metrics  it does not include reports that provide only narrative descriptions of company practices, commitments or philosophies.

All mature company reports include at least one quantitative environmental reporting metric, and mature companies represent 86% of all examples of quantitative reporting.

Quantitative environmental reporting examples Environmental issues are generally less material for life sciences companies, particularly companies that lack significant in-house manufacturing operations or complex supply chains.

Nonetheless, partially driven by cross-industry market practice and investor expectations, inclusion of environmental disclosure in ESG reports is common in life sciences reporting.

Although less heavily weighted than for other industries, environmental matters generally feature in ESG ratings methodologies applied to life sciences companies.

In addition, as the ESG subject perhaps best suited for quantification, environmental disclosure includes some of the most standardized performance metrics, which facilitate company comparability."
Cooley,Life Sciences ESG Reporting Practices,"In addition, as the ESG subject perhaps best suited for quantification, environmental disclosure includes some of the most standardized performance metrics, which facilitate company comparability.

Most likely due to the relative ease of tracking, energy and water use are marginally more common topics than greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, though we may expect this to change as companies expand their emissions-tracking capabilities in anticipation of finalization of the SECs climate change rule .

Scope 3 (indirect value chain) emissions disclosure remains relatively rare, as such emissions often are considerably more difficult to measure or estimate.

In addition to concerns about potential inaccuracies, for many life sciences companies with outsourced manufacturing operations and significant chemical supply chains, Scope 3 emissions disclosure may present a less positive view of company environmental impacts.

In addition, many reports analyzed were published following the release of the SECs proposed climate change rule in March 2022, which may have created concerns that publishing Scope 3 data could create future SEC reporting obligations.

External review of ESG reporting References to third-party assurance of ESG data remain relatively rare.

Disclosure in ESG reports may not capture the full extent of external audits, as companies often engage outside consultants or auditors to provide assurance for internal comfort purposes only.

ESG reporting frameworks referenced A large majority of reports included references to the role of reporting standards in shaping disclosure, though such standards are implemented with varying degrees of rigor.

While many reports do include the now market-standard appendix tables showing framework alignment, such tables often show only partial responsiveness.

Although approximately half of the reports included quantitative disclosure on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, less than a quarter referenced the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and provided responsive disclosure on climate governance, risk and strategy.

TCFD disclosure is increasingly favored by institutional investors, though it is less relevant for life sciences issuers for whom climate strategy and risk are less central to business.

With qualitative TCFD disclosure forming the basis of much of the SECs proposed climate rule, however, we expect this to be an area where industry companies increase disclosure.

Other frameworks referenced include the SASB, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).

SASB alignment The SASB standards are the clear industry favorite.

Unlike other more broadly applicable frameworks that feature many environmental and social topics less relevant to life sciences companies, the SASB standards are specific to the industry.

The SASB biotechnology and pharmaceuticals standards are primarily focused on product development safety and ethics, as well as product safety and availability.

Product and research disclosure Reflecting the SASB standards and industry ESG ratings methodologies, life sciences reports are heavily focused on product development topics, including supply chain, testing and access to medicines.

Nonetheless, disclosure topics vary widely, and there is often incomplete alignment with the SASB industry disclosure topics and accounting metrics.

Highly detailed or quantitative product and research disclosure

In addition to the wide variance in product disclosure topics, there is no clear convergence on topic quantification, with no quantified or otherwise highly detailed topic appearing in more than 30% of reports.

Even among mature company reports, the most common quantified topics product accessibility (i.e., geographic availability) and responsible sourcing (i.e., ethical supplier standards or sustainable supply chains)  only appeared in 34% of reports."
Cooley,Life Sciences ESG Reporting Practices,"Product social impact disclosure While detailed or quantitative reporting topics vary widely, it is increasingly common for life sciences reports to focus heavily on the inherent ESG-positive quality of their products, with many reports dedicating multiple pages to highlighting the social impact of their approved products and treatment gaps targeted by ongoing research.

Human capital disclosure Corporate governance and human capital are more highly weighted for life sciences companies in most ESG ratings due to the limited relevance of environmental, supply chain, labor standards, political controversy and other headline topics.

In addition, relatively limited financial expense is required to include governance disclosure and basic employee demographic data in ESG reports, particularly if such information is already included in more limited form in annual proxy statements.

As a result, such disclosure is often one of the more cost-effective means of improving ESG ratings.

While quantitative human capital disclosure is a near-universal practice, a much smaller percentage of reports include Equal Opportunity Commission EEO-1 workforce data.

Such disclosure in ESG reports or proxy statements is likely to rise in light of increased institutional investor pressure.

Although still relatively rare, descriptions of company initiatives specifically focused on diversity in scientific and technical roles is a notable, industry-specific human capital trend.

Governance disclosure Corporate governance disclosure in life sciences reports covers a wide range of topics, with substantive disclosure most frequently covering anti-corruption and competition practices, ESG oversight, and risk management processes.

Among the more quantifiable governance topics, detailed stakeholder engagement disclosure remains relatively rare.

Data privacy and cybersecurity disclosure Due to the sensitivities of trial data and trial participant privacy, data privacy and cybersecurity are heavily weighted topics in industry ESG ratings.

Nonetheless, quantitative data privacy disclosure, such as incident figures, is much rarer (seen in only 11% of reports).

With ongoing changes to investor and proxy advisor expectations and policies, ESG ratings methodologies, and regulatory disclosure requirements, we are likely to see sustained growth in life sciences ESG reporting, including increased quantification, reporting standards alignment, and earlier-stage company disclosure.

Cooleys ESG team is continuing to track industry disclosure trends and practices, particularly during the upcoming proxy season.

Cooley,NAIC Adopts List of Regulatory Considerations Impacting Insurance Company Investors,"As private equity and venture capital investors add insurance company investments to their portfolios, those investments may ultimately end up being regulated more than they bargained for.

Although private equity investment in insurance companies is not new, the market has seen increasing investments as of late, especially with respect to the life insurance industry.

In an October 2020 client alert , we discussed how such investments can trigger a change in control under state insurance laws modeled after the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act.

Background A person or entity that is acquiring control of an insurance company must first file a Form A with that insurers domestic state insurance regulator and secure approval for the proposed transaction prior to consummation.

Under state insurance law, control of an insurer is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer.

When analyzing control, insurance regulators do not just look at the individual or entity that directly holds the voting securities of the insurer  they look all the way up the corporate chain to any individual who beneficially owns, controls or holds with the power to vote 10% or more of the insurers voting securities.

Over the past year, however, some state insurance regulators have expressed additional concerns regarding private equity ownership or investment  and other complex investments  in insurance companies.

Under the auspices of the NAIC, these concerns were recently discussed in a list of 13 regulatory considerations , along with specific action items designed to address them.

Even for private investors that own less than 10%, which often includes venture capital, additional regulatory disclosures currently are being considered.

While many venture capital and other private investors have gone out of their way to stay below the 10% threshold, the NAIC Group Solvency Issues (E) Working Group is expected to consider additional disclosures and questions that would be helpful to insurance regulators in identifying whether a person that directly or indirectly owns less than 10% of the issued and outstanding voting securities of an insurance company nonetheless should be considered to control the insurance company.

This could be, for example, as a result of board or management representation or contractual arrangements.

It also could include noncustomary minority shareholder rights or covenants.

These additional disclosures and questions about those who own than 10% may be included in a Form A filing and/or in periodic regulatory filings, such as the annual Form B insurance holding company registration statement filings.

Increased federal interest The issuance of the NAICs list of proposed considerations coincides with increased federal interest in private equitys role in the insurance industry.

This past summer, US Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio whos chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, sent letters to the Treasury Departments Federal Insurance Office , as well as the NAIC, requesting their continuing consideration of private equitys growing role in the insurance industry.

Cooley,ESG Ratings: Considerations in Advance of Proxy Season,"As companies prepare for the 2023 proxy season, their ESG performance, as evaluated and rated by various third-party ratings providers, is a key focus.

With the growing importance of ESG to institutional investors, specialized funds and the general investing public, ESG ratings are an increasingly important investor relations concern.

While such ratings may influence investor decision-making throughout the year, for many companies and boards, ESG matters take on heightened importance in advance of annual meetings and related shareholder engagement efforts.

As a result, in the lead up to proxy season, many companies contemplate ratings improvement strategies, including proxy statement and other disclosure updates, policy adoptions and governance changes.

With the ever-growing variety and complexity of ratings, however, developing effective strategies can be a challenge.

Objectives and methodologies vary greatly among ratings providers, and there is often limited comparability (or even significant conflict) between different scores, leaving many companies confounded as to where to begin.

Below, weve highlighted a few key considerations and action items to assist companies in taking steps toward improving their ESG ratings ahead of the upcoming proxy season.

Which ESG ratings apply to my company?

Whether your company is subject to a particular ESG rating is generally based on the companys index, size and market.

For US-based companies, for example, ISSs Governance QualityScore applies to Russell 3000 and S&P 1500 issuers, and Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings apply to large- and medium-cap issuers.

Some ratings providers, including Moodys and Refinitiv, even provide ESG ratings for certain private companies.

To determine which ESG ratings apply to your company, we generally recommend reviewing your ISS and Glass Lewis proxy reports to determine which ESG ratings are included therein, engaging your investors to determine which ESG ratings they use that apply to your company, and reaching out to the ratings providers themselves.

In many cases, particularly if your company is in the Russell 3000, ratings providers will proactively contact companies to verify the data underlying their ESG ratings, which often creates a meaningful opportunity to build a relationship upon which to facilitate timely and accurate updates to your rating.

Which ESG ratings will appear in my companys ISS and Glass Lewis proxy reports?

Companies may be particularly concerned with ESG ratings that appear in ISS and Glass Lewis proxy reports, due to their widespread visibility to investors and other stakeholders.

The ESG ratings presented in these proxy reports, which are described further below, have no impact on either advisory firms proxy voting recommendations, but given their prominence in these reports, they often receive marked attention from companies and investors alike.

Moreover, even though these ESG ratings do not impact proxy voting recommendations, overlap can exist between the factors underlying the ESG ratings and the proxy voting guidelines linked to each advisory firms proxy voting recommendations (e.g., a classified board may negatively impact a companys ISS Governance QualityScore and trigger negative recommendations against the companys director nominees).

As a result, these ratings can be indicative of present or future ESG issues that could impact proxy voting recommendations.

However, before taking steps to improve any ESG rating  including those presented in your proxy reports  we recommend engaging with your investors and other stakeholders to determine whether this particular rating is meaningful to them.

ISS ISS includes two ESG ratings in its proxy reports  ISS Governance QualityScore and ISS Environmental and Social (E&S) Disclosure QualityScore  both of which are conspicuously placed at the top of proxy reports in bold and color."
Cooley,ESG Ratings: Considerations in Advance of Proxy Season,"Companies are invited to review, verify and provide feedback on the data underlying their QualityScores using a complementary data verification tool accessed through ISS Corporate Solutions Governance Analytics platform .

ISS Governance QualityScore measures a companys corporate governance practices across four categories  board structure, compensation, shareholder rights, and audit and risk oversight  and their associated risks relative to the companys index or region.

More than 260 factors are analyzed across the coverage universe (approximately 7,300+ companies in 30 markets, including constituents of the S&P 1500 and Russell 3000), of which up to 169 are used for any one company based on its region.

ISS E&S Disclosure QualityScore measures the depth and extent of a companys disclosures regarding the companys understanding of its environmental and social risks, its preparedness to face and mitigate those risks, and its commitment to being held accountable for those risks, relative to peer companies within the companys industry group.

More than 380 factors are analyzed across the coverage universe (approximately 5,300+ companies across 24 industry groups in the Americas, European and Australasia regions), of which around 240 are used for any one company based on its industry group.

The specific factors under analysis generally reflect several leading disclosure standards and frameworks  including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  and the factors that are related to these standards are more heavily weighted than other factors.

Glass Lewis Glass Lewis includes two third-party ESG ratings in its proxy reports  Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings and Arabesque ESG Profile  each of which is placed in the middle of proxy reports.

Sustainalytics (owned by Morningstar) sends a draft ESG Risk Ratings report to each company in the coverage universe (approximately 14,000+ companies, covering most major global indices) for feedback on an annual basis.

Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings measure the degree to which a companys economic value is at risk due to ESG factors or, more technically, the magnitude of the companys unmanaged ESG risks.

A companys ESG Risk Rating is comprised of a quantitative score and a risk category, where the quantitative score represents the degree of unmanaged ESG risks and the risk category is determined based on such quantitative score.

The five risk categories  negligible, low, medium, high and severe  are absolute, meaning that a life sciences company, for example, can be directly compared with an oil company or any other type of company.

Arabesque ESG Profile measures a companys performance on financially material ESG issues and reputational risk across the United Nations Global Compacts core principles.

The ESG score is intended to identify sustainable companies that are better positioned to outperform over the long run and is claimed to be computed using only information that significantly helps explain future risk-adjusted performance, while the Global Compact score is intended to provide a deeper understanding of reputational risk facing a company.

What is the audience for my companys ESG ratings?

Your ESG ratings improvement strategy should account for the fact that ESG ratings target a variety of audiences, including institutional investors, smaller investment funds and social impact investors, as well as the public.

Many companies are initially most focused on ESG ratings that appear in their proxy reports or that otherwise have significant public visibility, such as Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings that appear in Morningstar research reports and are shown free of charge on Yahoo Finance."
Cooley,ESG Ratings: Considerations in Advance of Proxy Season,"Unsurprisingly, ESG ratings that may be viewed by large numbers of investors, customers, employees and journalists can easily become sources of concern for boards and management teams.

Nonetheless, ESG ratings with the most visibility may not necessarily be the most impactful for all companies.

For example, for companies interested in attracting capital from social impact investors, ESG ratings that measure substantive ESG performance from a stakeholder materiality standpoint, such as the ISS Corporate Rating, may be particularly relevant.

For companies focused on their inclusion in ESG indices and exchange-traded funds, the more relevant ESG ratings would be those from providers such as MSCI, S&P Global and FTSE Russell, whose ratings form the basis for ESG index construction.

Hedge funds and asset managers also rely on a variety of ESG ratings, often including in-house ratings that may draw from multiple ratings or ESG datasets, such as Bloomberg and ESG Book.

According to a recent SquareWell study , nearly all of the worlds 50 largest asset managers use at least one ESG rating in their investment decisions, and more than half use at least four ESG ratings, with the most common being MSCI (92%), Sustainalytics (76%) and ISS (58%).

Given the complexity and the limited correlation of ESG scores across ratings, a one-size-fits-all approach to ESG ratings optimization is likely unavailable to most companies.

Instead, before investing in ESG ratings improvement efforts, companies should assess their overall ESG goals and consider which ratings are most relevant to actualizing those goals.

As part of such efforts, investor and stakeholder outreach can play a helpful role in assessing which ratings matter most to priority audiences.

Often, such engagement reveals surprises, such as funds focused on more niche industry-specific ratings or in-house ratings drawing from data providers heavily reliant on artificial intelligence and alternative data.

What are my companys ESG ratings aiming to measure?

An effective ratings optimization strategy also requires understanding the significant variation in the subject matter ESG ratings are aiming to measure.

While certain ESG ratings, such as Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings, aim to measure ESG in a relatively comprehensive manner  including substantive risk related to environmental and social practices in a wide variety of areas, as well as disclosure and governance quality  many others take a narrower approach.

For example, ISS QualityScores are focused almost exclusively on the quality of ESG disclosure and governance practices.

For such ratings, ESG risks arising from a companys business model are significantly less relevant (if at all) compared to alignment with reporting and governance best practices.

Even for ratings focused on substantive performance, there is a split between ratings that attempt to capture the full spectrum of ESG issues and those that focus on more limited subject matter, such as CDP scores, which exclusively measure climate reporting transparency, or industry-specific topics, such as the Good Pharma Scorecard, which is focused on life sciences trial data transparency.

Performance-focused ratings also are divided by different approaches to materiality.

On the one hand, ESG ratings such as the ISS Corporate Rating focus on company ESG topics through a stakeholder impact lens, scoring companies based on how their businesses impact third parties, such as employees, vendors and supply chain workers, or how they more broadly impact the environment.

Under such ratings, companies would receive negative scores if they have limited labor rights protections in their supplier agreements, have limited product recycling programs or have excessive water use or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regardless of any concrete indication of financial risk arising from such performance."
Cooley,ESG Ratings: Considerations in Advance of Proxy Season,"While such a scoring approach may align with popular conceptions of the function of ESG as a measure of good corporate citizenship, some of the most influential ratings for investment funds and ESG indices are defined by a narrower investor impact approach, which looks exclusively at ESG matters that may give rise to company financial risk.

MSCI, for example, recently stated that its ESG ratings are designed to measure a companys resilience to financially material

[ESG] risks, and that they are not a general measure of corporate goodness.

A recent Bloomberg study noted the limited impact of excessive GHG emissions on MSCI scores.

While this approach is quite similar to traditional Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) understandings of materiality, investor materiality ratings have attracted negative publicity , reflecting larger disagreements as to whether ESG ratings should reflect a broadening of the purpose of the corporation or simply an attentiveness to business risks potentially elided by traditional financial reporting.

This materiality split is also reflected in the differences between various ESG reporting frameworks and governmental regulations, with some adopting an investor materiality approach (e.g., the TCFD, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and current or proposed SEC and UK reporting regulations) and others adopting a double-materiality approach (e.g., the GRI and European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive regulations ).

How are my companys ESG ratings measured?

Although there are often limited score correlations across ESG ratings , many ratings providers employ a broadly similar industry-focused, materiality mapping approach to measuring ESG quality, whereby they identify which ESG factors are most material to particular industries and assign a relative weighting to each such factor for companies included in such industries.

Nonetheless, there is significant variation among ratings providers in which ESG factors are selected for measurement, what sources are used to measure those factors and the weights that are assigned to those factors.

Further, because a ratings providers proprietary frameworks are generally industry-specific, high variance in scores can exist across industries within a given ESG rating even where two companies practices are the same (e.g., if we assume a life sciences company and an oil and gas company have similarly robust human capital practices and disclosure, as well as similarly poor environmental risk management practices and disclosure, the life sciences company will generally have a higher ESG rating than the oil company, as human capital management is generally more heavily weighted for life sciences companies, and environmental risk management is generally more heavily weighted for oil companies).

Given the significant variance in methodologies across ratings providers and industries, adopting a generic market best practices ESG approach is generally an inefficient strategy for ratings improvement.

From a ratings standpoint, prioritizing improved disclosure and policies on a particular ESG topic should be driven by a substantive understanding of how different topics are measured and weighted, rather than an abstract view of the importance of certain ESG actions.

For example, companies with limited manufacturing operations often invest significant resources on environmental reporting, such as GHG emissions or water usage, only to discover that this has limited, if any, impact on their priority ratings.

While many ratings providers publish limited information on methodology and weighting, companies can often gain valuable insights by engaging with ratings providers to request reports and undertake data verification exercises.

What data sources are used to establish my companys ESG ratings?"
Cooley,ESG Ratings: Considerations in Advance of Proxy Season,"What data sources are used to establish my companys ESG ratings?

In measuring ESG quality, ratings providers draw upon a variety of data sources: company publications (e.g., SEC public filings, ESG reports and information posted on company websites), private data (e.g., company responses to solicited surveys) or alternative data (e.g., social media and governmental or nongovernmental datasets).

Some ratings providers rely exclusively on company publications (e.g., ISS QualityScores) and others pull data from more than one bucket (e.g., ISS ESG Corporate Rating, Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings, MSCI ESG Ratings and Moodys ESG assessments), generally to varying degrees (e.g., MSCI collects, on average, 45% of its data from alternative sources).

Even where ESG ratings do not include alternative data and rely exclusively on company disclosure, substantive scores inevitably are shaped by information and assumptions beyond company control, as ratings providers apply different questions and weightings to individual companies based on assumptions about topics material to their wider industry or individual business model.

Understanding the data sources and the assumptions underlying ESG ratings should play an important role in establishing an ESG ratings improvement strategy.

In addition to aligning ESG disclosures with subjects heavily weighted in key ratings methodologies, companies should consider using disclosure to counteract or correct the impact of alternative data or industry assumptions, such as pointing to the lower relevance of certain risk areas to a companys business model.

Along with directly engaging with ratings providers to discuss and correct mistaken assumptions about material topics and risks, we also recommend paying greater attention to ESG datasets and the role of alternative data.

As with financial reporting, boards and management teams should not assume that company disclosure is the only game in town in driving ESG ratings and broader public and investor perceptions.

First steps While companies are often frustrated by the baffling heterogeneity of the ESG universe, ESG reporting, at least, is becoming increasingly standardized due to efforts by government regulators (e.g., the SEC and European Commission) and standards boards (e.g., the ISSB) to create more uniform ESG disclosure requirements, in addition to partial market convergence around certain reporting standards, such as the TCFD framework for climate reporting.

On the other hand, there is little indication that ESG ratings are undergoing a similar convergence and consolidation; instead, recent years have seen a constant flow of new ratings offerings and often increased opacity from ratings providers on scoring methodologies.

As a result, companies hoping to adopt effective ESG ratings improvement strategies will need to take a proactive approach.

Besides engaging with investors and other stakeholders to better understand which ESG ratings to prioritize, making sense of the scoring methodologies also generally requires a proactive approach, including engaging with ratings providers directly to request ratings reports, taking advantage of data verification opportunities, and working with outside advisers, such as ESG consultants and law firms.

After having identified key ESG ratings and established an understanding of their scoring methodologies, we suggest working with advisers to develop formal ratings improvement plans.

Due to methodological factors discussed above, significant ratings improvement may be possible without fundamental changes to your companys business model, insofar as ratings are often driven more by the quality of disclosure and governance than by substantive environmental or social performance."
Cooley,ESG Ratings: Considerations in Advance of Proxy Season,"As a result, you may often work with advisers to identify numerous low-pain areas for improvement, such as the public disclosure of already existing policies and actions, the formalization of policies and principles that align with existing company practice, or improved disclosure on topics that you either already track or can reasonably track with minimal additional investment.

Even where ratings improvement does not require significant operational changes, advanced planning remains critical, as designing and implementing improved ESG policies and disclosure practices (and related internal controls) often requires considerable lead time, not including the time required to have such changes reflected in updated ESG scores.

As a result, starting as early as possible on your ESG ratings improvement strategy is strongly advised.

Whether you are concerned with annual meetings, attracting ESG-focused capital, avoiding shareholder proposals or simply placating important investors, improvement on relevant ratings will almost always require several months (if not considerably more) of preparation.

Even if ESG ratings are not an immediate investor concern (e.g., for many newly public companies) or if your company does not yet meet the criteria for coverage by some ratings (e.g., inclusion in the Russell 3000), these timing considerations mean that adopting a forward-looking ratings optimization plan may often be a wise approach."
Cooley,UK NSI Regime A New Dawn for UK National Security,"More than 11 months have passed since the UKs National Security and Investment Act 2021 (NSI Act) came into force, creating a stand-alone foreign direct investment review system in the UK for transactions in specified sectors.

To date, there has been limited data on the number of interventions and investigations under the NSI Act.

However, since the summer, the UK government has issued a total of nine final orders on whether to prohibit or permit a transaction subject to remedies.

Interestingly, out of these nine final orders, the government has prohibited two transactions and cleared seven subject to remedies.

While it is still too early to identify any emerging trends, weve set out below some of our key observations from these limited decisions to date.

A more interventionist authority Since the regime came into force, the government has blocked two transactions under the NSI Act, which stands in stark contrast to the previous regime, where the government did not block a single transaction on national security grounds in almost 20 years of its enforcement.

In July 2022, the government issued the first prohibition decision under the NSI Act  namely, the proposed licensing of intellectual property of vision-sensing technology by the University of Manchester to Beijing Infinite Vision Technology Company.

In the governments view, the licence agreement would create UK national security risks due to the dual-use application of the underlying technology, and the potential of the technology being used to build defence or technological capabilities.

Interestingly, this first prohibition decision was not subject to mandatory notification requirements under the NSI Act; instead, the parties voluntarily notified the transaction to the government, which then blocked it, highlighting the broad scope of the regime.

In August 2022, the government published its second prohibition decision, blocking a Hong Kong investor from acquiring the entire share capital of UK-based Pulsic Limited, an electronic design automation company; the government was concerned that Pulsics technology could be used to facilitate the building of integrated circuits for possible use in civilian or military applications.

Once again, the dual-use application of the technology gave rise to national security concerns.

Innovative clearance conditions For transactions that have been cleared subject to conditions, the government has not shied away from adopting somewhat interventionist measures to address its national security concerns.

In one decision, the government appointed a government observer to the board of the UK targets subsidiary.

In other transactions, the government has restricted an acquirers ability to undertake certain activities outside of the UK (such as research, development and manufacturing capabilities of certain products), or to restrict the influence of the acquirer over appointments of certain staff members within the target company.

It is noteworthy that in all but one remedial decision, the government ordered some form of control or restriction over access to information.

In some instances, these protections and restrictions were internal (i.e., preventing companies from sharing information with other companies in the same group), whereas in other cases, they were external (i.e., protecting sensitive information from external unauthorised disclosure).

A country-agnostic regime The NSI Act is living up to its word of being a country-agnostic regime, with the legislation applying equally to UK investors and foreign investors.

This is clear from the nine final orders, which captured investors from China, Hong Kong, the UAE, the UK and the US.

Sectors reviewed are broadly consistent with governments NSI annual report It is noticeable from the nine final orders that the main sectors in scope continue to be in the traditional sectors of military and dual-use and defence."
Cooley,UK NSI Regime A New Dawn for UK National Security,"This is broadly consistent with the data published in the governments annual report from earlier in the year (see our June 2022 client alert on the NSI regime annual report for more information).

However, it is equally clear from the blocked decisions that the government recognises the significant role of emerging or advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced materials, data infrastructure and energy, and is willing to intervene in those deals to protect UK national security.

Wide range of transactions in scope While most of the final order decisions concern share purchase transactions, the government is clearly interested in asset deals too; the first prohibition decision concerned an asset transaction and, once again, in a very recent decision, the government cleared an acquisition of assets subject to remedies.

The transaction in question concerned the asset development rights in a project seeking to improve the UKs ability to use renewable energy through developing various energy mechanisms and technologies  the Stonehill Project.

The government was concerned that the purchaser (Stonehill Energy Storage Limited, majority-owned by a Chinese government department) would acquire the ability to direct or control further development of the Stonehill Project, which could give rise to UK national security risks relating to the security of an important UK electricity asset, as well as services provided to the National Grid.

The deal was cleared subject to conditions, but once again demonstrates the expansive nature of the regime and the powers of the government to scrutinise a wide range of transactions on national security grounds.

A new dawn The last 11 months have been a busy period for the government, with no sign of slowdown.

In the new year, we should expect more of the same as the government continues its review of transactions.

Given the broad scope of the regime and the governments willingness to take enforcement action, businesses should continue to invest time upfront to assess the likely implications of the UK NSI regime and its potential impact on their deals."
Cooley,DOJ Focusing Antitrust Scrutiny on the Boardroom Is Your Board Ready,"In April 2022, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, head of the US Department of Justices Antitrust Division, fired a warning shot to companies: For too long, our Section 8 enforcement has essentially been limited to our merger review process.

We are ramping up efforts to identify violations across the broader economy, and we will not hesitate to bring Section 8 cases to break up interlocking directorates.

In September 2022, the Antitrust Division issued a spate of letters to public companies and private equity investors alleging that the companies board composition violated Section 8.

On October 19, 2022, the DOJ announced that seven directors had resigned from five corporate boards in response to concerns raised by the Antitrust Division.

The resignations unwound five alleged interlocks  in each case where at least one of the companies identified the other as a competitor in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings, although none of the companies admitted violating the law.

The DOJs press release quoted Kanter promising more enforcement actions: The Antitrust Division is undertaking an extensive review of interlocking directorates across the entire economy and will enforce the law.

Section 8: Whats an interlocking directorate?

Section 8 prohibits a person from serving as an officer or director of two corporations that are competitors.

It is a strict liability statute designed to nip in the bud incipient violations of the antitrust laws by removing the opportunity.

1

Specifically, Section 8 seeks to prevent such interlocks from leading to the exchange of competitively sensitive information or collusion.

Violations under Section 8 generally turn on the interpretation of the terms person, corporation and competitors, as well as the applicability of certain safe harbors.

The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have generally taken a very broad interpretation of each of these terms  i.e., person is interpreted to include individuals, corporations and unincorporated entities, while competitors is interpreted as companies in the same industry that offer substitutable products to similar customers  though whether such broad interpretations would hold up in court is not clear.

Importantly, in enforcing Section 8 prohibitions, the DOJ is limited to seeking injunctive relief, while private parties may seek either injunctive relief or treble damages.

The DOJ can and does sue for injunctive relief, the violation of which could result in civil contempt charges, but the agency has often accepted resignations and issued a press release, with the attendant adverse publicity.

And public companies have in the past faced shareholder derivative suits following the announcement of violations.

Companies also may face liability if interlocks lead to price fixing, market division agreements or the exchange of information that results in higher prices.

Monetary threshold and safe harbors Section 8 does not condemn all interlocking directorates between companies that compete with one another.

Both corporations must have assets on their balance sheets above the minimum amount (currently $41,034,000), which is inflation-adjusted annually.

Emerging company example: A startup company that has raised $30 million in capital falls below the $41,034,000 Section 8 monetary threshold.

2

There are also statutory exceptions for banks and where the competitive sales of the corporations are below minimum thresholds.

Section 8 defines competitive sales as the gross revenues for all products and services sold by one corporation in competition with the other  in that corporations last completed fiscal year.

3

The competitive overlap is viewed as de minimis , and the interlock is not prohibited, if one of the following applies: The competitive sales of either corporation are less than $4,103,400.

(This is the current threshold, which is subject to annual adjustment.)"
Cooley,DOJ Focusing Antitrust Scrutiny on the Boardroom Is Your Board Ready,"(This is the current threshold, which is subject to annual adjustment.)

The competitive sales of either corporation are less than 2% of that corporations total sales, which are the gross revenue for all products and services in the last completed fiscal year.

The competitive sales of each corporation are less than 4% of that corporations total sales.

In addition, the statute provides for a one-year grace period from the date of an intervening event (e.g., a transaction or a change in strategic direction that results in competitive sales over the threshold) that makes continued participation on the board of both firms unlawful.

Life sciences example of de minimus exemption: Clinical-stage pharmaceutical companies that do not generate any revenue fall into the de minimus exemption because they do not have competitive sales at all and certainly fall below the $4,103,400 exemption threshold, even if the company has assets in excess of $41,034,000.

Deep dive on key terms: Applicability to venture capital and private equity Liability under Section 8 generally turns on the interpretation of the terms person, corporation and competitors.

Interpretation of these terms has important implications, particularly to VC and PE investors.

Person On its face, the statute appears to prohibit the same individual from sitting on the board of two competitors.

But the government and private plaintiffs have taken the position that the statute captures board members deputized to represent the interests of the same investor  for example, a private equity firm cannot appoint one director to board A and another director to board B if A and B compete.

Although the law is unsettled, this interpretation has been accepted by some courts.

4 Importantly, the DOJs October 2022 press release described the resignations of two directors who did not sit on a competitors board themselves but, according to the DOJ, represented an investment firm that had a seat on a competitors board.

Corporation

The term corporation includes private and public companies, though there is an open legal question as to whether it applies to noncorporate entities such as limited partnerships  and with many funds set up as limited partnerships, this has potential implications for VC and PE funds  and limited liability companies, although the DOJ and the FTC may push the boundaries on a broad interpretation.

Competitors Section 8 prohibits an officer or director of one corporation from serving as an officer or director of another corporation if they are by virtue of their business and location of operation, competitors, so that the elimination of competition by agreement between them would constitute a violation of any of the antitrust laws.

This sounds straightforward, but as in other areas of antitrust enforcement, the boundaries that define the competition are not always clear.

For example, a pharmaceutical product may compete with other pharmaceutical products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, similar mechanism of action or same indication.

On the other hand, there may be strong arguments that one product does not compete with the other because they are used at different stages of the disease state.

These terms and the scope of the safe harbors continue to be the subject of debate.

Is your board Section 8 ready?

The DOJ is actively searching securities filings and other publicly available information to identify and pursue potential Section 8 violations.

Public companies therefore appear to have been a particular focus of the recent wave of resignations announced by the DOJ.

But, both public and private corporations should consider implementing the following strategies to assess and minimize risk in complying with the antitrust laws.

Evaluate board compliance Start by asking each current board member and officer to identify each company where they serve as an officer or director."
Cooley,DOJ Focusing Antitrust Scrutiny on the Boardroom Is Your Board Ready,"Evaluate board compliance Start by asking each current board member and officer to identify each company where they serve as an officer or director.

For board members appointed to represent an investor, identification of other companies in which the investor has board representation should be considered.

This may be a particular challenge for VC and PE firms that invest in and have board seats on multiple portfolio companies in the same sector.

Notably, in the DOJs October 2022 press release, four of the seven resigning board members were affiliated with investment firms.

In these circumstances, counsel can help evaluate and mitigate the risk of enforcement.

Establish a protocol to evaluate potential interlocks To prevent inadvertent violations of the antitrust laws and the potential for government scrutiny, companies should establish a protocol to identify and assess potentially problematic interlocks during the nomination process and on an ongoing basis.

Keep in mind that circumstances may change.

This is particularly true for startup companies, which may have no revenues or competitive sales today, but may generate such sales in subsequent years, creating potential exposure.

For this reason, even companies with no revenues should establish a protocol.

Consult counsel if you have questions about whether companies may be viewed as competitors As with many areas of antitrust law, defining the markets in which companies compete is not always clear cut.

Companies should consult with counsel before appointing any board member who sits on another board in the same industry.

And, when identifying competitors in securities filings, be aware that naming companies may have the unintended consequence of creating Section 8 exposure if a board member also sits on the board of an identified competitor.

Cooley,US Department of Labor Issues Proposed Rule on Independent Contractor Status,"On October 11, 2022, the Department of Labor (DOL) announced a proposed rule that would reinstate the economic reality test for determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

The DOL stated that the proposed rule would create a framework that is more consistent with the FLSAs text and purpose as interpreted by courts that have applied the economic reality test.

In addition, the DOL noted that the proposed rule would both preserve essential worker rights and provide for more consistency for employers, stating that the rulemaking is not intended to disrupt the businesses of independent contractors who are, as a matter of economic reality, in business for themselves.

The public has until December 13, 2022, to comment on the proposed rule online or via mail.

Background As we previously discussed in a January 2021 client alert , the DOL published a final rule during the Trump administration regarding the classification of independent contractors under the FLSA (2021 IC Rule).

That rule adopted a five-factor test to assess a workers economic dependence, emphasizing two core factors  the nature and degree of the workers control over the work and the workers opportunity for profit or loss  as the most probative as to whether or not an individual is an economically dependent employee.

However, in March 2021, the DOL under the Biden administration published a rule delaying the effective date of the 2021 IC Rule, then later withdrew it in its entirety.

In mid-March, a federal district court in the Eastern District of Texas vacated the withdrawal of the rule, restored the original rule and concluded that the 2021 IC Rule became effective on the original effective date of March 8, 2021.

The DOLs proposed rule now seeks to rescind the 2021 IC Rule and return to principles previously adopted by the Obama administration.

Proposed rule adopts six-factor economic reality test The economic reality test long applied by courts examines whether workers are economically dependent on their employer for work, or whether theyre truly in business for themselves.

The DOLs proposed rule adopts a multifactor, totality-of-the-circumstances analysis of the economic reality test to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor under the FLSA.

In this analysis, the factors analyzed do not have any predetermined weight, and no one factor is dispositive.

Although the proposed rule focuses on six factors, as described below, the agency notes that additional factors may be relevant in the analysis if the factors in some way indicate the worker is in business for themselves, as opposed to being economically dependent on the employer.

Factor #1: Opportunity for profit or loss depending on managerial skill This factor borrows from one of the core factors of 2021 IC Rule by focusing on assessing the degree to which a workers managerial skill affects the workers economic success or failure in performing the work.

However, unlike the approach in the 2021 IC Rule, the DOL now proposes to consider investment as a separate factor in the analysis.

Relevant considerations in applying this factor include: Whether the worker determines the charge or pay for the work provided (or at least can meaningfully negotiate it).

Whether the worker accepts or declines jobs, or chooses or can meaningfully negotiate the order and/or time in which the jobs are performed.

Whether the worker engages in marketing, advertising, or other efforts to expand their business or secure more work.

Whether the worker makes decisions to hire others, purchase materials and equipment, and/or rent space (as opposed to the amount and nature of the workers investment)."
Cooley,US Department of Labor Issues Proposed Rule on Independent Contractor Status,"Whether the worker makes decisions to hire others, purchase materials and equipment, and/or rent space (as opposed to the amount and nature of the workers investment).

The DOL also notes that whether the worker actually has an opportunity for a loss should be considered, because doing so may indicate independent contractor status, whereas workers who incur little or no costs or expenses, simply provide their labor, or are paid an hourly or flat rate are unlikely to experience a loss, suggesting employee status.

Factor #2: Investments by the worker and employer As mentioned above, the proposed rule now considers investment as a stand-alone factor in the economic reality test, to align with the approach taken by most courts.

This factor analyzes whether a workers investment is capital or entrepreneurial in nature, which supports independent contractor status.

Relevant investments can include those that increase the workers ability to do different types of or more work, reduce costs, or extend market reach, suggesting that the worker is in business for themselves.

However, costs borne by the worker simply to perform the job, such as tools and equipment, are not evidence of capital or entrepreneurial investment.

Notably for gig economy employers, the proposed rule states that the use of a personal vehicle that the worker already owns to perform work  or that the worker leases as required by the employer to perform work  is generally not an investment that is capital or entrepreneurial in nature, because such a vehicle is often used for personal reasons or was purchased for personal purposes.

The proposed rule also notes that a workers investments should be evaluated on a relative basis with the employers investments, in line with the approach taken by circuit courts.

Where a workers investment does not compare favorably to the employers investment, it suggests that the worker is economically dependent and therefore an employee.

Factor #3: Degree of permanence of the work relationship This factor analyzes whether the work relationship is indefinite or continuous, which suggests employee status, versus sporadic or project-based, which suggests independent contractor status.

However, the DOL emphasizes that a workers lack of permanent or indefinite relationship does not necessarily indicate independent contractor status if it does not result from the workers own independent business initiative.

In addition, the DOL notes that a lack of permanence may be inherent in certain jobs, such as temporary and seasonal work, which does not necessarily imply independent contractor status.

While a worker working exclusively for a particular employer speaks to the permanence of the work relationship, the proposed rule cautions that courts have found that workers not relying on their employers as their exclusive or primary source of income does not indicate whether an employment relationship exists, because many workers in the modern economy routinely seek out more than one source of income.

Factor #4: Nature and degree of control Unlike the 2021 IC Rule, which designated this as a core factor, the DOLs proposed rule de-elevates this factor to just one of its six-factor analysis.

This factor focuses on the level of control maintained by an employer over meaningful economic aspects of the work relationship.

Relevant considerations in analyzing this factor include whether the employer sets a workers schedule, supervises performance of work (including the ability to assign work), the workers ability to set a price or rate for goods or services provided by the worker or to influence the price or rate, and the workers ability to work for others.

Additionally, the proposed rule indicates that employers may exercise control mediated by technology."
Cooley,US Department of Labor Issues Proposed Rule on Independent Contractor Status,"Additionally, the proposed rule indicates that employers may exercise control mediated by technology.

The DOL notes that supervision can be maintained in many different ways that may not be obvious, including remotely through technology: Employers can remotely supervise their workforces, for instance, by using electronic systems to verify attendance, manage tasks or assess performance.

Employers also can implement monitoring systems that can track a workers location and productivity, and even generate automated reminders to check in with supervisors.

In addition, control can be indicated where an employer complies with legal obligations, safety or health standards, or requirements to meet contractual or quality control obligations, suggesting that the worker is economically dependent on the employer.

Factor #5: Extent to which the work performed is an integral part of the employers business This factor considers whether work is critical, necessary or central to the employers business: Where a workers performance of work is integral to the employers business, it suggests employee status, whereas a worker who performs work that is more peripheral to the business is more likely to be independent from the employer.

The proposed rule emphasizes that the critical question is whether the worker performs work that is central to the employers business, not whether the worker possesses unique qualities that render them indispensable as an individual.

For example, an operator who is one of hundreds or thousands of operators at a call center is still an integral part of the employers business even if that one worker makes a minimal contribution to the business when considered among the workers as a whole.

Factor #6: Skill and initiative This factor considers whether a worker uses specialized skills to perform work and whether those skills contribute to business-like initiative that is consistent with the worker being in business for themselves instead of being economically dependent on the employer.

A worker lacks specialized skills if they are dependent on training from the employer to perform the work, or where the work itself requires no training.

In contrast, independent contractor status is suggested where a workers specialized skills also demonstrate that the worker exercises independent business judgment.

Impact on employers Although the proposed rule is not finalized, it reflects an intent to return to the Obama administrations more rigid approach to independent contractor classification.

The proposed rule, if finalized, would make it difficult for certain workers to qualify as independent contractors under the FLSA, and it stands to have a significant impact on gig workers and other service workers under that statute.

However, notably, the proposed rule only applies to the FLSA, and the battlegrounds for worker classification overwhelmingly arises out of tax audits and unemployment insurance disputes at the state level.

Thus, while this rule is less favorable for businesses using independent contractors, its practical effect will be relatively less dramatic.

We will continue to monitor developments on the proposed rule.

Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Awaited Final Clawback Rule,"On October 26, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a new rule governing the recovery (i.e., clawback) of erroneously awarded incentive compensation.

The new rule implements Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and is codified in Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The new rule also amends, or impacts, certain other schedules, forms and rules, most notably Items 402 and 601 of Regulation S-K. The long-awaited new rule has been in motion for more than a decade.

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 10D to the Exchange Act, requiring the SEC to direct the national securities exchanges to establish listing standards that require issuers to develop and implement a clawback policy.

In July 2015, the SEC proposed rules to implement Section 10D and, following numerous comment periods  most recently in October 2021 and June 2022  the new rule has been adopted substantially as proposed, with a few deviations as discussed below.

Overview and new clawback requirements Under the new rule, national (US) securities exchanges and associations that list securities are required to establish listing standards mandating that each issuer adopt a clawback policy, comply with the policy and provide the required disclosures about the policy.

Issuers that do not adopt and comply with clawback policies that meet the requirements of the new listing standards will be subject to delisting.

The policy must provide that, in the event an issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement  including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period  the issuer will be required to recover from any current or former executive officers incentive-based compensation that was erroneously awarded during the three years preceding the date the restatement was required.

Key points to note Issuers will have up to one year plus 60 days following publication of the new rule in the Federal Register to adopt compliant policies, depending on when exchange listing standards go into effect.

The new rule becomes effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Covered exchanges are required to file proposed listing standards no later than 90 days following publication of the new rule in the Federal Register, and the listing standards must be effective no later than one year after publication.

Issuers will be required to adopt policies no later than 60 days after the effective date of the applicable listing standards, and they will be required to comply with the disclosure requirements in proxy and information statements and annual reports filed on or after the date such policies are adopted.

Smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies and foreign private issuers are NOT exempt.

The new rule generally applies to all listed issuers, including smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies and foreign private issuers.

Although the SEC acknowledged concerns expressed by commenters, it noted that unlike certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress did not direct the SEC to treat these types of issuers differently.

The SEC declined to exercise its discretion to exempt such issuers and noted its view that recovery of unearned incentive-based compensation, which encourages careful preparation and review of financial information, is equally appropriate for smaller and larger issuers.

Little r restatements will trigger recovery.

The most glaring difference from the SECs initial rule proposal in 2015 is the new rule will require companies to conduct a clawback analysis for little r accounting restatements."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Awaited Final Clawback Rule,"The most glaring difference from the SECs initial rule proposal in 2015 is the new rule will require companies to conduct a clawback analysis for little r accounting restatements.

The new rule requires listed issuers to adopt and comply with a compensation recovery policy that will be triggered in the event of both: Big R restatements, which correct errors that are material to previously issued financial statements.

Little r restatements, which correct errors that are not material to previously issued financial statements, but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were recognized or left uncorrected in the current period.

This is one of the most controversial aspects of the new rule, as expressed in SEC Commissioner Hester Peirces dissent that including little r restatements unnecessarily complicates the rule and may require clawback analysis when the error did not lead to erroneous compensation during the three-year period, or require a clawback of de minimis amounts while Commissioner Jaime Lizrragas statement noted that the rule will prevent the abuse of the potential little r loophole by folding both Big R and little r restatements into the rule.

Lizrraga went on to say that [e]mpirical evidence suggests that managers may try to use the discretion built into accounting standards to re-classify Big R restatements to little r restatements.

These types of restatements have made up an increasingly high share of all financial restatements in recent years.

Current and former executive officers are covered, with no misconduct requirement.

The new rule requires recovery from any current or former executive officer who received incentive-based compensation during the three-year look-back period preceding the date the restatement was required.

Executive officer includes all officers who play an important role in financial reporting and is defined consistent with the definition of officer set forth in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(f), including the president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or controller if no principal accounting officer), any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, and any other person performing a similar policymaking function for the issuer (including officers of a parent or subsidiary of the issuer).

Importantly, the new rule does not limit the scope of recovery to individuals directly responsible for preparing the financial statements or who were at fault for the accounting errors that resulted in a restatement.

In other words, negligence or misconduct is not required.

Incentive-based compensation is a principles-based concept.

The new rule defines incentive-based compensation as any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting measure.

The SEC opted to use a principles-based definition in order to capture newly developed forms of compensation and measures of performance.

In general, both equity and non-equity incentive plan awards are included, to the extent the grant or vesting thereof is based on financial reporting measures.

Financial reporting measures are defined broadly.

Pursuant to the new rule, financial reporting measures are those that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the issuers financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures, including non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, and other measures, metrics and ratios that are not non-GAAP measures, regardless of whether such measures are included in an SEC filing.

In addition, financial reporting measures also include stock price and total stockholder return (TSR), and therefore, the final rule encompasses incentive-based compensation tied to such measures.

Purely time-vesting equity awards are outside the scope of the new rule."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Awaited Final Clawback Rule,"Purely time-vesting equity awards are outside the scope of the new rule.

Equity awards, including stock options, for which vesting is contingent solely upon the completion of a specified employment period and/or attaining one or more nonfinancial reporting measures (and that were not granted contingent upon achieving any financial reporting measure performance goal) are not deemed to be based on the attainment of a financial reporting measure  and therefore are not within the definition of incentive-based compensation required to be covered by a clawback policy.

What amount of incentive-based compensation must be subject to recovery?

Erroneously awarded compensation subject to recovery is defined as the amount of incentive-based compensation received by the current or former executive officer that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that would have been received had such amount been determined based on the accounting restatement, without regard to taxes paid.

Reasonable estimates may be used to determine the effect of the accounting restatement for incentive-based compensation based on TSR or stock price, but issuers are required to maintain documentation of this reasonable estimate and deliver it to the exchange.

An issuer must recover erroneously awarded compensation in accordance with its clawback policy, unless such recovery would be impracticable.

The new rule allows an issuers board of directors very limited discretion in applying the policy, noting narrow exceptions to recovery where (1) the direct cost of recovery would exceed the recovered amount or (2) the recovery would violate home country law and additional conditions are met.

Issuers must make a reasonable attempt at recovery before determining that it is impracticable, must document their attempts at recovery and must deliver the documentation to the exchange.

In addition, the new rule allows an issuer to decline to recover compensation when recovery would likely cause a tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet qualification requirements.

Boards retain discretion, subject to reasonable restrictions, to determine the means of recovery.

The SEC recognized that the appropriate means of recovery may differ depending on the specific circumstances, noting that issuers are expected to recover erroneously awarded compensation reasonably promptly.

The amount of compensation required to be recovered is not limited under the new rule, but the rule requires boards to recover the full amount unless recovery is determined to be impracticable (as described above).

Indemnification is prohibited.

The new rule does not allow issuers to insure or indemnify any current or former executive officer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation.

Executive officers may be able to purchase an insurance policy from a third party to fund required recovery, but the issuer may not pay or reimburse the executive officer for the policy.

No exception to recovery due to potential state law conflicts.

In the new rule, the SEC declined to provide an exception to, or allow boards the discretion not to seek, recovery of covered compensation due to state law conflicts.

The SEC noted that even though executive officers who are seeking to defend themselves against recovery may raise objections grounded in state law, it believes that state law will not pose a significant obstacle to recovery, because issuers should have strong arguments that state laws in conflict with the new rule are preempted.

Each issuer must file its clawback policy as an exhibit to its annual report and disclose actions taken pursuant to the policy.

Each issuer must check boxes on its annual report to indicate whether the financial statements included in the filing reflect a correction of an error to previously issued financial statements and whether such corrections were restatements requiring recovery."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Awaited Final Clawback Rule,"In addition, disclosure regarding how issuers have applied their clawback policies will be required pursuant to new Item 402(w) of Regulation S-K. Next steps Issuers should begin to familiarize themselves with the new rule and consider the impact on their executive compensation programs, compensation arrangements and any previously adopted clawback policies.

Importantly, since previously adopted clawback policies and arrangements may not be consistent with the new rule, issuers will need to determine whether (and how) to amend existing policies or adopt separate Rule 10D-1 policies.

Issuers also will want to review noncompensation items affected by the new rule, such as their directors and officers insurance policies and indemnification agreements and their internal controls for evaluating restatements.

Please refer to this PubCo blog post for more information on the new rule, including a summary of the various statements made by the SEC chair and the other SEC commissioners at the meeting supporting and opposing the new rule."
Cooley,EU’s New ESG Reporting Rules Will Apply to Many US Issuers,"New environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting requirements in the European Union and the US are set to fundamentally change the nonfinancial reporting landscape.

The new EU rules will require ESG reporting on a level never seen before, and will capture a whole host of companies that previously were not subject to mandatory nonfinancial reporting requirements, including public and private non-EU companies that meet certain EU-presence thresholds.

For US issuers, the new EU rules will result in mandatory reporting on a broader set of ESG topics than those required under current and proposed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.

Even if your business is not covered by the new reporting requirements, we anticipate that you will feel the impact of these requirements if your business is part of the value chain of an entity that is required to report.

We expect to see companies sending and receiving ESG questionnaires to gather the data necessary for their ESG reports.

In addition to the proposed US climate change reporting rules, preparation for reporting under the new EU rules will be an important topic for fall board meetings and nominating and corporate governance committees.

If you have any questions or would like training for your teams, please contact a member of Cooleys international ESG team .

What are the new reporting requirements?

In the EU, political agreement has been reached on the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), meaning that the draft will soon enter into law.

The CSRD hugely expands the scope and content of current EU nonfinancial reporting obligations to capture a much wider range of entities and require reporting on a broader range of ESG topics in much more detail than before.

The information is to be included in a separate section of the management report, subject to mandatory audit, and will feed into a publicly accessible EU website.

Notably, the CSRD applies to EU companies and public and private non-EU companies that meet the thresholds described below.

As a result, US and other non-EU companies with EU business may be required to produce ESG reports in compliance with EU rules , even if such companies are not listed on a European exchange.

Although non-EU companies have the most extended timeframe for reporting, many EU subsidiaries of non-EU companies will be required to report earlier.

Non-EU companies with subsidiaries that are required to report earlier may, as a practical matter, want to consider reporting at the parent level early, instead of producing a separate subsidiary-level report, particularly those companies that already produce robust voluntary ESG disclosure.

In the US, there is a parallel, but more limited, move toward an expansion of mandatory ESG reporting obligations.

The SEC has adopted a more piecemeal approach than the CSRD, focusing its rulemaking on specific ESG topics, rather than mandating the publication of broad ESG reports.

In particular, the SEC has proposed climate change and cybersecurity reporting rules, and is expected to propose human capital and board diversity disclosure rules over the next year.

The CSRD empowers the European Commission to recognize sustainability reporting standards applied by non-EU countries as equivalent.

As the SEC has not and is not currently expected to propose equally broad sustainability reporting rules, it is unlikely that the SEC rules will be recognized as equivalent to all CSRD reporting standards (although some, such as climate change, may be recognized as equivalent).

As a result, for US issuers that fall within the scope of the new EU rules, compliance with the CSRD is likely to require the publication of a dedicated report."
Cooley,EU’s New ESG Reporting Rules Will Apply to Many US Issuers,"As a result, for US issuers that fall within the scope of the new EU rules, compliance with the CSRD is likely to require the publication of a dedicated report.

In addition, the CSRDs scope extends beyond that of most voluntary reporting standards currently applied by companies in the US and elsewhere, such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework or the 77 industry-specific standards of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

How can businesses prepare?

Weve provided our take on the practical implications and what you can do to best prepare your business for the new rules.

Staying up to date Anticipated this fall/winter, the final approval of the CSRD is the start of the process.

Boards and legal departments also will want to be attentive to developments related to European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) reporting standards (i.e., the EU standards companies will need to report to in order to comply with the CSRD), national implementation of the CSRD and any relevant third-country rules.

This is especially the case for non-EU companies that may be unaware of the CSRD and do not expect to have to comply with reporting regulations outside the countries in which they are domiciled or have registered securities.

The application of the CSRD to non-EU private companies may come as a shock to many companies.

Non-EU companies should continue to communicate with outside advisers and work on tracking EU revenue and future plans to work out whether they will be captured by the upcoming requirements.

Focusing on board oversight Board oversight of ESG is a hot topic for companies around the globe, particularly for US issuers due to the proposed SEC climate change reporting rules.

While many US public companies have created nominating and corporate governance committee oversight of ESG matters in recent years, the growth of highly technical ESG reporting (and SEC disclosure) has raised questions as to whether oversight should be, at least partially, shifted to audit committees, which historically are more experienced in oversight of public disclosure and financial reporting.

Such questions are now even more relevant, considering the amount of data required for reporting under the CSRD and the accompanying audit requirements.

Given the number of topics covered by the EU reporting standards, the CSRD also puts into question whether existing board committees will have the competence and bandwidth to oversee ESG reporting matters.

As a result, in addition to building out more robust management-level ESG teams, companies covered by the CSRD may want to consider establishing dedicated board committees or integrating ESG-reporting experience into their director recruiting plans.

Aligning reports In light of recent SEC comment letters and proposed rules, many US public companies are highly focused on aligning voluntary ESG reporting with related disclosure in SEC filings.

Similar considerations should apply for issuers subject to the CSRD.

In addition to integrating CSRD compliance into any existing ESG reporting activities, US issuers will want to be attentive to the risk of contradictions between financial, risk, and strategy disclosure contained in SEC filings and reporting under the CSRD.

Establishing internal controls In addition to preparing to track and report on the numerous ESG topics covered by the CSRD, boards and management will want to focus on establishing appropriate internal controls for CSRD reporting.

With the SECs proposed rules, greenwashing controversies in the US, the EU and the UK, and the increasingly quantified and detailed nature of voluntary reporting, putting in place internal ESG controls is already a hot topic for boards."
Cooley,EU’s New ESG Reporting Rules Will Apply to Many US Issuers,"The broad scope of the CSRD (as well as potential penalties for noncompliance), which represents the first significant regulatory mandate for many of the topics covered, further emphasizes the importance of establishing appropriate internal controls processes.

This may be especially challenging for private companies, which generally have much less developed internal controls for public reporting.

Even for those companies highly experienced in ESG reporting, the CSRD will likely require additional work to establish reporting processes and controls throughout the value chain adapted to a reporting framework that will undoubtedly deviate from the various existing standards.

Expecting ESG questionnaires Boards and management also should prepare to receive more ESG-related diligence questionnaires from the EU and other covered counterparties in connection with CSRD compliance.

This is because reporting boundaries will need to be expanded to cover material sustainability matters that are connected to the company by its direct or indirect business relationships (upstream and downstream), regardless of the companys level of control over them.

This is much broader than traditional financial reporting based on control.

For US issuers, as such questionnaires increase in frequency and detail  and play a more central rule in funds investment decision-making  it will be important to consider whether responses to such questionnaires raise selective disclosure issues under Regulation FD.

Such questionnaires also could increase in the future when the EUs corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDD), which is currently being negotiated, is agreed.

Educating and building out internal teams Many companies, especially those engaged in voluntary ESG reporting, have built robust internal ESG reporting teams.

The CSRD should provide further impetus for such efforts.

For many companies, ESG reporting has been primarily owned by marketing, sustainability or social impact teams, though many companies have begun legalizing their ESG disclosures by involving legal, financial reporting and internal audit functions.

The CSRD is likely to further encourage companies to establish robust ESG reporting teams, similar to those they may have for financial reporting.

Preparing for CSRD disclosure also will require educating reporting teams on the new EU reporting frameworks.

For US teams, this will include not only the challenge of reporting on certain topics less emphasized in US ESG reporting, but also adapting to a double materiality approach that includes an impact-materiality standard that deviates significantly from the SECs investor focused-concept, which itself informs numerous prominent ESG reporting frameworks and ratings.

Comparison of reporting obligations under the CSRD and the SEC rule The tables below provide a high-level comparison of the two regimes reporting standards, key features of each, and a timeline setting out to whom these reporting regimes will apply and when.

Comparing the content of the reporting standards For the CSRD, this comparison is based on current draft reporting standards  13 have been published that apply to entities in all sectors  but there are more to come, as the EFRAG plans to release 40 industry-specific standards and standards for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in 2023.

Reporting standards specifying the information that needs to be included in the sustainability reports of non-EU companies and SMEs will be adopted by June 30, 2024.

Where the entity is reporting at a consolidated level and one or more of its subsidiaries is relying on the CSRDs subsidiary exemption, the parent entity must comply with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)  and perform its assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities for the entire consolidated group  regardless of its group legal structure pursuant to these standards."
Cooley,EU’s New ESG Reporting Rules Will Apply to Many US Issuers,"The below comparison is based on the draft ESRS published by the EFRAG.

Under the draft CSRD, an initial set of ESRS must be adopted by June 30, 2023.

Public consultation on the standards ended on August 8, 2022, and the feedback received will inform the final draft standards to be put before the European Commission in November 2022.

All dates included below are preliminary and subject to change as the EU and US rules are finalized.

In particular, the dates for the SEC climate rule reflect the March 2022 rule proposal, though these dates are likely to be adjusted in light of the reopening of the comment period in October 2022.

EU  CSRD US  SEC Environment Climate change: This is a transition plan for climate change mitigation, associated policies, targets and resource allocation.

Among other things, the report must detail energy consumption, Scope 1 through 3 greenhouse gas emissions, GHG removal and mitigation initiatives.
            

A reporting entity must disclose its plans, implementing actions, and related financial and investment plans that will ensure its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

The proposed climate rule would require Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reporting, as well as Scope 3, if material.

Issuers also would be required to disclose climate risks, strategy impacts, and climate governance and risk management.

Climate reporting would be contained in annual reports filed with the SEC, as well as registration statements.

Pollution:

The report must set out policies, targets and resource allocation affecting pollution of air, water, soil, living organisms and food resources, among others.

The report must detail the pollutants generated or used during the production processes and that leave facilities as emissions, products, or as part of products or services, among others.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Water and marine sources: Report on how the company affects water and marine resources, in terms of positive and negative impacts and any actions taken (including policies, targets, action plan and resources).

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Resource and circular economy: The report must set out policies, targets and resources relating to the depletion of nonrenewable resources and the regeneration of renewable resources, and any actions taken to prevent, mitigate, or remediate impacts arising from resource use and the circular economy.

This report must detail resource inflows, outflows, waste and resource optimization.

It must detail the entitys ability to create partnerships to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, among others.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Biodiversity and ecosystems: Report on how the company affects biodiversity and ecosystems, in terms of positive and negative actual or potential impact, as well as any actions taken and results of such actions to prevent, mitigate, or remediate adverse impacts and protect/restore biodiversity and ecosystems.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Social Own workforce: The report must enable readers to understand how the undertaking affects the companys own workforce by covering working conditions, access to equal opportunities and other work-related rights.

SEC rules currently require discussion of companies human capital resources and strategies at a very high level of generality in annual reports  and the SEC may propose more substantive quantitative human capital and employee diversity disclosure in the next year.

Workers in the value chain: The report must set out how the company affects workers in its value chain through its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain (including its products and services, its business relationships and its supply chain)."
Cooley,EU’s New ESG Reporting Rules Will Apply to Many US Issuers,"This would have to include disclosure on processes for engaging with such workers, channels through which such workers can raise concerns, targets related to managing material impacts on such workers, and remediation of material impacts on such workers, among others.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Affected communities : The report must enable readers to understand how   the undertaking affects local communities through the companys own   operations and its upstream and downstream value chain (including its   products and services, its business relationships and its supply chain), any   actions taken, and how the undertaking manages risks and opportunities   relating to impacts and dependencies on affected communities.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Consumers and end users: The report must set out policies and targets that address the management of the material impacts its products and services have on consumers and end users  including impacts to a consumers privacy or health, processes for consumer and end-user engagement concerning actual and potential impacts, mechanisms through which consumers and end users can raise concerns, and approaches to mitigating material risks and remediating actual impacts.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Governance Governance, risk management and internal control: The report must detail the diversity, remuneration and risk management policies, among others.

It also must detail management composition, meetings and attendance rate.

In addition to long-standing rules regarding corporate governance (board structure and composition, director and management composition, etc.) required in annual proxy statements and elsewhere, the SECs climate change and cybersecurity rules include governance disclosure requirements, such as the organization of board oversight and director expertise related to climate and cyber matters.

Potential upcoming rulemakings may include expanded board diversity disclosure requirements.

Business conduct: This includes information on the companys strategy and approach, processes, procedures, and performance in respect of business conduct (including business ethics, corporate culture, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, etc.)

SEC and New York Stock Exchange/Nasdaq exchange rules include requirements regarding the content and disclosure of codes of ethics.

Key features of the reporting requirements EU  CSRD US  SEC Materiality (i.e., what matters for reporting) Double materiality, which means: Significant impacts from an investor perspective (i.e., reporting on ESG matters material to the companys value creation).

Significant impacts from a wider stakeholder perspective (i.e., reporting on ESG matters material to the companys impact on the economy, environment and people).

While on paper these materiality concepts appear quite distinct, the practical implications of this divergence remain to be seen.

For areas such as climate change, there is increasingly convergence between whats considered material for investors and whats considered material to society.

Investor perspective only Reporting boundaries Upstream and downstream value chain and the material sustainability matters that are connected to the company through its direct or indirect business relationships  regardless of its level of control over these value chain entities.

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reporting requirements only apply to direct company emissions and indirect emissions from purchased electricity or other forms of energy.

Scope 3 reporting requirements, when applicable, apply to upstream and downstream activities in value chains.

Due diligence requirements A description of the reporting entitys due diligence process with regards to sustainability matters by the entity or group must be provided.

The EU is currently separately negotiating new corporate sustainability due diligence rules."
Cooley,EU’s New ESG Reporting Rules Will Apply to Many US Issuers,"The EU is currently separately negotiating new corporate sustainability due diligence rules.

No requirement in current or proposed US SEC rules.

Forward-looking disclosures Reporting entities will be required to report on a forward-looking and retrospective basis.

The proposed climate rule would require disclosure of climate-related targets and goals, if any.

Attestation

The CSRD proposals would require limited assurance across all topics from first reporting with limited assurance standards that will be adopted by the European Commission before October 1, 2026.

Assurances will be required to address, among other things, compliance with the applicable ESRS and the processes carried out to identify the reported information.

The EU has expressed ambition to move toward reasonable assurance at a future date, perhaps as early as 2028, but it would need to be adopted as delegated legislation by the European Commission.
            

EU member states may choose to require assurances over sustainability reporting to be separate from the mandatory audit of the financial statement.

The SECs proposed climate rule would require a third-party attestation report covering Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, with limited assurance due for large accelerated filers for FY 2024 and reasonable assurance for FY 2026 (FY 2025 and FY 2027 for accelerated filers).

Who needs to comply and from when?

Date EU  CSRD US  SEC FY 2023 (reporting in 2024)

Large accelerated filers for all proposed disclosures, including GHG emissions metrics: Scope 1, Scope 2 and associated intensity metric, but excluding Scope 3 FY 2024 (reporting in 2025)

EU undertakings already subject to the current Non-Financial Reporting Directive (i.e., those designated as public-interest entities, such as companies listed on EU regulated markets)

Accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers for all proposed disclosures except Scope 3 Scope 3 reporting for large accelerated filers FY 2025 (reporting in 2026)

Large EU undertakings (including subsidiaries of non-EU companies), listed or not , if they satisfy at least two of the following criteria: A balance sheet total of more than 20 million euros.

A net turnover of more than 40 million euros.

An average of more than 250 employees over the financial year.

EU parent undertakings of a large group (consisting   of parent and subsidiary undertakings)

that on a consolidated basis satisfy at least two of the criteria set out above.

Smaller reporting companies (SRCs) for all proposed disclosures except Scope 3 Scope 3 reporting for accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers, though SRCs would be exempted FY 2026 (reporting in 2027)

Small and medium-size undertakings listed on the EU regulated markets (except micro-undertakings) FY 2026 (reporting in 2027), with an option to opt out for two further years Insurance undertakings and credit institutions FY 2028 (reporting in 2029)

Non-EU undertakings that satisfy both of these criteria: Generate a net turnover of more than 150 million euros in the EU for each of the last two consecutive financial years at the consolidated level (or, if not applicable, at the individual level).

Have at least one subsidiary or branch in the EU that is itself within the scope of the CSRD (i.e., subsidiaries that satisfy the criteria set out above, or branches that generated a net turnover of more than 40 million euros in the preceding financial year).

Non-EU undertakings should generally report at the consolidated (group) level."
Cooley,New California Laws Impacting Employers,"In late September 2022, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several new laws impacting California employers, which included the new California pay transparency law, which we considered separately in an October 5 client alert on the legislation .

Unless otherwise specified, the laws discussed below take effect on January 1, 2023.

COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave extension Effective September 29, 2022, AB 152 extends Californias COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave (SPSL) law, which was originally enacted in early 2021.

AB 152 extends the application of the current SPSL law for three months, through December 31, 2022 .

As we previously reported in a February 15 client alert , the states current SPSL law requires employers with 26 or more employees to provide supplemental paid sick leave to employees who are unable to work for COVID-19-related reasons, as well as use leave to care for family members.

The SPSL law provides for two banks of available sick leave, with each bank providing up to 40 hours of leave time.

The first bank provides leave for covered employees who are unable to work or telework due to qualifying COVID-19 reasons, which include being subject to a quarantine or isolation period, attending or accompanying a family member to an appointment to receive a vaccine or a booster, or caring for a child whose school or care provider is closed or unavailable due to COVID-19-related reasons.

The second bank provides for up to 40 hours of leave if the employee, or a family member for whom the employee is providing care, tests positive for COVID-19.

Importantly, AB 152 would not require any additional leave beyond the total of 80 hours from January 1, 2022, through December 30, 2022, but the law does change an employers ability to require testing and provides for a grant program for small-business owners and nonprofits, as described below.

Testing procedures Under current law, an employer has no obligation to provide leave time under the second bank if the employee refuses to provide documentation of a test result.

As amended, the SPSL law clarifies that employers also do not need to provide leave if an employee refuses to submit to a diagnostic test.

In addition, while under the current law an employer can require the employee to take a second test on or after the fifth day following an initial test, AB 152 amends the SPSL law so that an employer can require the employee to submit to a third diagnostic test within no less than 24 hours after the positive second test.

Employers must continue to provide tests at no cost to the employee.

California Small Business and Nonprofit COVID-19 Relief Grant Program

This new grant program allows small businesses and nonprofit organizations to apply for and receive grants of up to a maximum of $50,000 to offset costs incurred in providing supplemental paid sick leave between January 1 and December 31, 2022.

Among other requirements, eligible businesses must be incorporated as a C corporation, S corporation, cooperative, limited liability company, partnership, or limited partnership, or registered as a 501(c)(3), 501(c)(6), or 501(c)(19); have begun operating before June 1, 2021; be currently active and operating; and have 26 to 49 employees and provide payroll data and a supporting affidavit.

Emergency conditions protections SB 1044 provides for new employee protections in the event of an emergency condition to address situations where employees may feel compelled to or expected to continue working during natural disasters, such as wildfires, or may be exposed to greater danger as a result of being prohibited from accessing communications devices during active shooter situations."
Cooley,New California Laws Impacting Employers,"Under the law, in the event of an emergency condition, an employer will be prohibited from taking or threatening adverse action against any employee for refusing to report to or leaving a workplace or worksite when the employee has a reasonable belief that the workplace or worksite is unsafe.

An emergency condition is defined as any conditions of disaster or extreme peril caused by natural forces or a criminal act, or an order to evacuate a workplace, workers home or childs school due to a natural disaster or criminal act.

Notably, the law excludes health pandemics.

The law also prohibits employers from, in the event of an emergency condition, preventing employees from accessing their mobile devices to seek emergency assistance, assess the safety of the situation, or communicate with others to confirm their safety.

Certain classes of workers are excepted from the law, including first responders, disaster service workers and other employees required by law to render aid.

Where feasible, employees will be required to notify employers of the emergency condition requiring them to leave or refuse to report to the workplace or worksite.

If this is not feasible, employees must notify employers of the emergency condition as soon as possible after leaving or refusing to report to the workplace.

Off-duty cannabis use protections Effective January 1, 2024 , AB 2188 will make it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person in hiring, termination, or any term or condition of employment, or otherwise penalize a person, for the persons use of cannabis off the job and away from the workplace, or for an employer-required drug test that finds non-psychoactive cannabis metabolites in the persons hair, blood, urine or other bodily fluids.

Importantly, employers can continue to prohibit the use, possession of, or impairment by cannabis on the job.

Employers also may still conduct certain types of pre-employment or employer-required drug testing, if those tests are conducted through methods that do not screen for non-psychoactive cannabis metabolites.

According to the law, tests that screen for non-psychoactive cannabis metabolites have no correlation to impairment on the job.

While we expect more guidance from the state in advance of 2024, AB 2188 appears to sanction the use of certain tests including impairment tests, which measure an individual employee against their own baseline performance, and tests that identify the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  the chemical compound in cannabis that can indicate impairment and cause psychoactive effects  in an individuals bodily fluids.

The law would not apply to certain employers and employees, including employees in the building and construction trades and employers required by law to drug test or conduct certain background investigation or security clearance processes.

Designated persons leave Under existing law, the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) and the states paid sick leave law (formally known as the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014) both permit eligible employees to take time off to care for a family member, as defined in each statute.

AB 1041 expands the definition of family member in both statutes, allowing employees to take time off to care for a designated person.

For purposes of leave under the CFRA, a designated person is defined as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.

However, for purposes of leave under the paid sick leave law, a designated person is more vaguely and broadly defined as a person identified by the employee at the time the employee requests paid sick days.

In both instances, an employer may limit the employee to one designated person per 12-month period."
Cooley,New California Laws Impacting Employers,"In both instances, an employer may limit the employee to one designated person per 12-month period.

Bereavement leave AB 1949 requires employers with five or more employees to provide up to five days of bereavement leave to eligible employees (those employed for at least 30 days prior to commencement of leave) upon the death of a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, domestic partner or parent-in-law.

The leave  which need not be taken consecutively  must be completed within three months of the date of death.

If an employer does not have an existing bereavement leave policy, the leave may be unpaid.

However, an employee must be permitted to use other leave balances available to them, including accrued paid sick time, vacation or personal leave time.

AB 1949 also outlines provisions regarding documentation.

For example, employers may request appropriate documentation within 30 days of the first day of the leave to verify the need for leave, which includes a death certificate, published obituary, or written verification of death, burial, or memorial services from a mortuary, funeral home, burial society, crematorium, religious institution, or governmental agency.

If such documentation is furnished, however, employers are required to maintain it as confidential and not disclose it except to internal personnel or counsel, or as required by law.

Employers also are generally required to maintain confidentiality for any employee requesting leave under this law.

Employees using bereavement leave would also be protected from discrimination and retaliation.

Abortion-related privacy protections After the US Supreme Courts Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization decision earlier this year, California passed several laws aimed at protecting abortion access and the right of privacy with respect to personal reproductive decisions, including AB 2091 .

Effective September 27, 2022, this law prohibits an employer from releasing medical information that would identify an individual, or information that is related to an individual seeking or obtaining an abortion, in response to a subpoena or law enforcement request, if the subpoena or request is based on or intended for the purpose of enforcing another states laws interfering with a persons right to choose or obtain an abortion, or a foreign penal civil action.

A foreign penal civil action is defined as a civil action authorized by the law of a state other than this state in which the sole purpose is to punish an offense against the public justice of that state.

It remains an open question how AB 2091, along with other abortion-related laws from the state, will interact with other states restrictive abortion laws.

Reproductive health decision-making protections SB 523 , the Contraceptive Equity Act of 2022, amends the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to protect reproductive health decision-making, defined as including but not limited to a decision to use or access a particular drug, device, product, or medical service for reproductive health.

As amended, it will be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee or applicant on the basis of reproductive health decision-making, or require disclosure of information relating to an applicants or employees reproductive health decision-making as a condition of employment, continued employment, or benefit of employment.

SB 523 also clarifies that the existing protected category of sex includes reproductive health decision-making.

Minimum wage increase California employers are reminded that beginning January 1, 2023, the minimum wage in California will increase to $15.50 per hour for all employers ."
Cooley,New California Laws Impacting Employers,"Minimum wage increase California employers are reminded that beginning January 1, 2023, the minimum wage in California will increase to $15.50 per hour for all employers .

While in prior years the applicable minimum wage depended on an employers size, in July 2022, the states Department of Finance certified that based on the annual inflation rate in the prior year, the state hourly minimum wage must be increased, regardless of the number of workers employed by an employer.

This increase will also impact the minimum exempt salary for California employees, which will rise to $64,480 effective January 1, 2023.

Employers are reminded that many cities have their own minimum wage requirements that are higher than the states minimum wage.

In connection with the report, the Department of Education (ED) released its own reminder to colleges and universities of their obligations around disclosure and product neutrality, and threatened increased enforcement in that area.

The EDnoted it would look to the CFPB when evaluating such financial arrangements  a critical announcement given the bureaus recent assertion of broad jurisdiction over institutional lenders that offer private education loans as defined in the Truth in Lending Act (which does not exempt, as does Regulation Z, no-interest payment plans of fewer than 12 months).

This move also signals the resurgence of coordination between the CFPB and the ED, similar to what we saw under the Obama administration.

EDs cash management regulations In October 2015, the EDfinalized new cash management rules affecting IHEs that have arrangements with banks and third-party servicers processing Title IV credit balance refunds.

There are two types of arrangements covered in the cash management rules: tier one (T1) and tier two (T2).

The regulations require colleges and universities to disclose the contract establishing a T1 or T2 arrangement on their website, and provide the EDwith the web address of the contract.

Although the rules applicable to T1 and T2 relationships are different, there are some throughlines that provide the basis for the CFPBs research and report, which are important for IHEs to know.

In addition to publishing any T1 and T2 arrangements publicly, IHEs should focus on: Ensuring students have options and thorough information about the terms and conditions of any account under which they can receive their Title IV credit balances.

Securing the students consent to open the financial account before issuing the student a debit card or other means of accessing funds.

Not sharing student information with banks or other financial services providers until after the student has selected the financial account.

Ensuring that the student has convenient access to the financial account through a surcharge-free national or regional ATM network, and that there are no other fees associated with opening the account.

Ensuring the account is not marketed as, or converted into, a credit card.

Ensuring that the terms of the accounts are consistent with the best financial interests of the students opening them, accomplished by conducting a diligence review at least every other year.

Report finds misaligned incentives, regulatory violations in college-sponsored products The report focuses on the market for college-associated deposit accounts, one mechanism through which IHEs distribute hundreds of millions in federal student aid every year.

It also raises concerns about school-sponsored financial account disclosures and fees, as well as the opacity of agreements between universities and financial firms.

Specifically, the bureau found as part of its review that: IHEs did not prominently post the requisite disclosures on their websites, potentially making it difficult for students to assess their banking options and for policymakers to assess consumer risk, violating EDcash management regulations.

1 IHEs failed to present options through which students could receive direct payments in a neutral manner.

Instead, a large proportion of eligible students were directed to websites where they were presented with account options in ways that did not appear to meet EDcash management regulations.

2 IHEs, along with their partner financial institutions, often promoted products that were more costly than what students could receive from other providers or, in some cases, even at the same financial institution."
Cooley,"CFPB, Department of Education Take Aim at College-Sponsored Financial Products","Promotion of products with  unreasonable and uncommon financial account fees  violates the express purpose of EDcash management rules.

With one-third of surveyed accounts having a revenue-sharing agreement with the partner school, the report suggested that financial inducements associated with product sponsorships may compromise the ability of some colleges and universities to prioritize their students financial well-being.

The CFPB also analyzed the credit card market at colleges, but found the number of school- or organization-sponsored credit card agreements in effect and the number of accounts continued their multiyear decline.

ED notes regulatory violations, pledges increased enforcement In connection with the bureaus findings, the EDin a Dear Colleague advisory letter reminded IHEs of their obligation to ensure that campus financial products are consistent with students best financial interests pursuant to the EDs 2015 regulations.

The guidance emphasized the responsibility of IHEs to protect students when it comes to financial products, including that the terms of accounts offered under agreement with financial partners are consistent with the best financial interests of the students.

The EDfurther noted that institutions that administer Title IV funds act in a fiduciary capacity .

As a result, IHEs must meet the EDs regulatory obligations under the regulations with respect to arrangements with partner financial institutions, including: Ensuring student options for receiving credit balance payments are described and presented in a clear, fact-based, and neutral manner.

Disclosing sponsorship arrangements with financial institutions, including prior-year compensation.

Independently evaluating whether any fees assessed are consistent with or below prevailing market rates, and documenting this due diligence research.

The EDalso announced in its advisory letter that it will take steps to enhance enforcement of its cash management regulations by tracking new data and bringing on additional staff to conduct oversight of college banking arrangements.

Looking forward The report and the accompanying commitment of increased enforcement resources to monitor compliance with EDcash management rules and student best interest standards suggest institutions in this space should confirm their compliance.

Financial products marketed through IHEs have long been a focus for the bureau and Director Rohit Chopra.

The bureaus recent announcements and supervisory guidance illustrate its continued scrutiny and focus on such products, and it is likely to remain a focus moving forward.

In January 2022, the CFPB announced it would begin examining post-secondary schools , such as for-profit colleges that extend private loans directly to students, and it published an updated education loan exam procedures manual.

In the same month, the bureau announced it was soliciting public comment on potential junk fees charged by financial companies, including fees assessed for student loans and other student-oriented financial products.

In September, the CFPBs Supervisory Highlights Student Loan Servicing Special Edition asserted, among other things, that withholding transcripts from students until they make outstanding payments on their loans violates the unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) standard.

Given the robust enforcement the EDhas promised, IHEs and partner financial firms should take a close look at fees, terms, and disclosures for school-sponsored financial products.

Similarly, with the CFPBs announcement earlier this year that it is interpreting Regulation Z in a more expansive manner to include institutional lenders making private education loans, the bureau will likely flex its examination authority in this area.

Cooley regulatory analyst Shane Zerr also contributed to this alert.

Cooley,Antitrust Lawsuit by FTC and 10 States Focuses on ‘Loyalty Programs’,"On September 29, 2022, the Federal Trade Commission  alongside a bipartisan coalition of 10 state attorneys general  sued Corteva and Syngenta , challenging loyalty programs pursuant to which two of the largest pesticide manufacturers allegedly pay distributors to limit business with competing manufacturers.

The complaint  which seeks to shut down what the FTC calls an illegal pay-to-block scheme  borrows from the FTCs framework for challenging reverse payment settlements in the pharmaceutical industry, which the FTC calls pay-for-delay agreements.

The action underscores the aggressive antitrust enforcement agenda being pursued by the Biden administration, which appears willing to bring novel and/or dormant antitrust theories.

While focused on competition in agriculture, which remains a top enforcement priority, the case has potential ramifications across industries for loyalty programs and vertical contracting practices more generally.

Aggressive enforcement climate Over the past two years, the Biden administration has repeatedly promised to  tackle this new era of monopoly power , including in President Joe Bidens 2021 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy targeting the concentrated market power in agricultural input industries and in the channels for selling agricultural products.

The antitrust agencies under Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Chair Lina Khan at the FTC have been vocal about their goals.

Kanter stated in a keynote at the University of Chicago in April 2022: I am here to declare that the era of lax enforcement is over, and the new era of vigorous and effective antitrust law enforcement has begun  Were not afraid to take big cases and were not afraid to take on big companies.

Likewise, Khan warned in a keynote address to the International Competition Network in May that competition law in the United States is currently in the midst of a broad and sweeping reassessment and that [r]eforms, potentially significant ones, are ahead.

Most recently, in an early October Des Moines Register op-ed regarding the complaint against Corteva and Syngenta, Khan asserted: This case fits into the FTCs broader mission to use our power to promote fair competition for all Americans  whether its small businesses, independent farmers, or a mom or dad shopping for groceries.

Challenge to pesticide loyalty programs The FTCs claim centers on vertical contracting practices between leading pesticide manufacturers and their downstream distributors, and specifically the impact that loyalty payments made by Corteva and Syngenta have on generic competitors.

US antitrust law recognizes that volume-based discounts are almost always lawful, and that loyalty discounts generally reduce prices for customers and therefore are often procompetitive.

Loyalty discounts may be challenged, however, where a supplier has market power and adopts a program that forecloses competitors absent justification, typically as de facto exclusive dealing or under a predatory pricing rubric.

Such loyalty programs may be subject to scrutiny where they go beyond encouragement to purchase goods or services and explicitly limit or prevent distributors from dealing with other suppliers, and there are not justifications for such conduct.

Here, the FTC alleges that Corteva and Syngenta promise distributors a complex set of incentive payments, but condition the availability of such payments on the distributor limiting purchases of comparable generic products to a set percentage share.

The complaint further alleges that as there are only a small number of large distributors

[that] dominate the sale of crop-protection products in the United States, the scheme almost entirely forecloses generic competitors from efficient distribution of their products."
Cooley,Antitrust Lawsuit by FTC and 10 States Focuses on ‘Loyalty Programs’,"[that] dominate the sale of crop-protection products in the United States, the scheme almost entirely forecloses generic competitors from efficient distribution of their products.

The FTC repeatedly characterizes the conduct in terms of unlawful extension of the defendants patent monopolies, focusing on Corteva and Syngenta allegedly continuing to obtain monopoly profits after patent expiration.

In doing so, the FTC places the conduct within its framework challenging conduct by pharmaceutical companies that delays or forecloses generic entry, through what are often called pay-for-delay settlements.

The FTC also borrows from its pharmaceutical precedents in defining the relevant markets at issue narrowly, contending that Corteva and Syngenta hold monopoly power in individual crop-protection products, each of which contains at least one active ingredient that had been patented.

Such single-brand product markets are rare under US antitrust law, particularly following the US Supreme Courts 2006 Independent Ink decision that patents do not necessarily confer market power.

The FTC, however, has argued that price erosion following entry by generic pharmaceuticals is evidence that an active pharmaceutical ingredient may constitute a product market.

The FTC echoes this framework in alleging that each pesticide active ingredient is a relevant market because generic entry would result in lower prices.

These allegations are critical to the FTCs ability to plausibly allege its claims  and whether these pesticides instead compete in broader, differentiated product markets may be tested as the litigation unfolds.

Whats next for businesses?

While the outcome of the litigation remains far from certain, weve highlighted three key considerations for businesses within and beyond the agricultural sector.

First , the complaint is a marker that the FTC remains committed to pursuing an aggressive enforcement agenda and is willing to test novel theories in litigation.

We expect to see more non-merger investigations and enforcement out of the FTC and DOJ under the Biden administration.

Indeed, the FTCs press release on the Corteva and Syngenta complaint foreshadows future enforcement in the pharmaceutical industry, asserting that illegal rebates and kickback schemes to middlemen in the pharmaceutical industry amount to an anticompetitive tactic similar to the one alleged in todays complaint.

Second , the FTCs challenge to vertical agreements between manufacturers and their distributors serves as another reminder of this administrations enhanced concern about foreclosure of competitors and skepticism of efficiencies.

We expect the FTC to continue to be on the lookout for cases where there may be a perception that dominant suppliers use contracting to foreclose or limit the ability for competitors to reach consumers.

In that regard, the complaint not only notably alleges violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair methods of competition, and Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit agreements in restraint of trade and monopolization, but also brings a stand-alone claim under Section 3 of the Clayton Act.

Although Section 3 proscribes exclusive dealing and tying that substantially lessens competition, it is often considered coextensive with Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

Whether the FTC uses the litigation as a vehicle to attempt to reinvigorate Section 3 is a development worth watching.

Third , the complaint underscores the Biden administrations focus on exclusionary conduct in agricultural supply and distribution.

To the extent smaller competitors face barriers to competing that are artificially imposed by entrenched players, the time may be ripe for voicing those concerns to federal and state enforcers."
Cooley,NYC Issues Proposed Regulations Regarding Automated Employment Decision Tools Law,"On September 23, 2022, the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) published proposed regulations regarding the citys Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT) law , which goes into effect on January 1, 2023.

As previously reported on Cooleys cyber/data/privacy insights blog , the AEDT law will require employers and employment agencies in New York City to comply with an extensive series of requirements before using an AEDT in the hiring and promotion process.

Among other things, employers will be required to: Complete an independent bias audit of the tool.

Provide a publicly available summary regarding the audit and the distribution date of the tool.

Give notice to candidates and employees who have applied for a position and reside in the city that the tool will be used  as well as the job qualifications and characteristics the tool will measure in assessing candidates  and permit candidates to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.

Make available information about the source and type of data collected by the tool, and the employers data retention policy, unless disclosure of this information would violate law or interfere with a law enforcement investigation.

In enacting the AEDT law, New York City joined other jurisdictions, such as Illinois and Maryland , which regulate artificial intelligence-driven tools in the employment process, due to concerns of bias or disparate impact on certain groups.

Key definitions The DCWP will be collecting comments on the proposed regulations in advance of a public hearing scheduled for October 24, 2022.

Among other things, the proposed regulations seek to define certain key terms and clarify requirements for the bias audit, the publication of the results of the bias audit, and the notices that employers and agencies must provide to employees and candidates.

Weve outlined some of these elements here.

Substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making The AEDT law defines an automated employment decision tool as any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.

The proposed regulations clarify that the phrase substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making means to: Rely solely on a simplified output (e.g., score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.)

with no other factors considered.

Use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the output is weighted more than any other criteria.

Use a simplified output to overrule or modify conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.

(A simplified output is further defined as a prediction or classification that can take the form of a score, tag or categorization, recommendation, or ranking.)

Candidate for employment The AEDT law applies to employment decisions affecting candidates for employment or employees for promotion.

The proposed regulations define the former as a person who has applied for a specific employment position by submitting the necessary information and/or items in the format required by the employer or employment agency.

As such, the proposed definition clarifies that candidates must have made affirmative steps by submitting information or other items to be covered under the law.

Independent auditor The AEDT law requires that an independent auditor conduct a bias audit of any AEDT tool prior to using it.

The proposed regulations define an independent auditor as a person or group that is not involved in using or developing an AEDT that is responsible for conducting a bias audit of such AEDT."
Cooley,NYC Issues Proposed Regulations Regarding Automated Employment Decision Tools Law,"The proposed regulations define an independent auditor as a person or group that is not involved in using or developing an AEDT that is responsible for conducting a bias audit of such AEDT.

Although this definition provides some guidance, it remains unclear what level of independence is required of the auditor, including whether the auditor may be otherwise employed by the AEDTs vendor.

Bias audit requirements As discussed above, an AEDT cannot be used unless it has been subject to an independent bias audit no more than one year prior to the use of the tool.

The proposed regulations clarify the requirements of the bias audit, which now include calculations of a selection rate and impact ratio for each category required to be reported to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEOC Employer Information Report EEO-1 (race, ethnicity and sex).

Under the proposed regulations, selection rate means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT.

This rate is calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

On the other hand, impact ratio is defined as either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or (2) the average score of all individuals in a category divided by the average score of individuals in the highest scoring category.

Thus, an independent auditor conducting a bias audit must compare selection rates for each EEO-1 category and compare those rates to the most selected or favored category.

The kinds of calculations required in a bias audit depend on how the AEDT is used in the employment process.

When an AEDT selects individuals to move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, the bias audit must calculate for each category the selection rate, the impact ratio and, where an AEDT classifies individuals into groups, the calculations for the selection rate and impact ration must be performed for each such classification.

However, when an AEDT scores applicants or candidates, the audit must calculate the average score for individuals in each category, and calculate the impact ratio for each category.

Publishing results of a bias audit Prior to using an AEDT, employers must publish in a clear and conspicuous manner on their websites careers or jobs section, the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT, a summary of the results of the audit, including selection rates and impact ratios for all categories, and the distribution date of the AEDT, or the date the employer began using a specific AEDT.

The proposed regulations provide that employers can meet this requirement by including a hyperlink to an external website that contains the required information.

Further, the required information must remain posted for at least six months after last using the AEDT for an employment decision.

Notice to candidates and employees As discussed above, the AEDT law requires employers to provide notice to candidates and employees with specified information regarding the tools use and other requirements at least 10 business days prior to using the AEDT.

The proposed regulations permit the required notices to be given to candidates who reside in the city by including the notice on the employers websites careers or jobs section, in a job posting, or via email or mail.

An employer can satisfy the notice requirements for current employees by including it in a written policy, procedure or job posting, or providing it in person, or via email or mail."
Cooley,NYC Issues Proposed Regulations Regarding Automated Employment Decision Tools Law,"An employer can satisfy the notice requirements for current employees by including it in a written policy, procedure or job posting, or providing it in person, or via email or mail.

Although the notice must include instructions for how to request an alternative selection process or accommodation, the proposed regulations ambiguously state that an employer is not required to provide an alternative selection process.

The proposed regulations also clarify the laws requirement that employers provide information regarding the type of data collected and their data retention policy.

Employers may satisfy this requirement by posting the information to their websites careers or jobs section or by providing it in writing via mail or email.

If the notice is not included on the website, an employer must post instructions on how to make a written request for such information on its website.

Next steps While the proposed regulations are not final, employers can get ahead of the AEDT law by reviewing any AI tools used in the hiring or promotion process to determine whether those tools are covered by the law.

Employers using such tools should reach out to the tool vendors regarding their compliance with the AEDT law.

Employers also should train supervisors and human resources personnel regarding the laws myriad requirements, including its publication and notice provisions.

We will continue to follow updates to the AEDT law after the October 24 hearing.

If you have any questions about the AEDT law, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,The CAT and the Meerkat: A Tale of Most Favoured Nation Clauses,"On 8 August 2022, the UKs Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) unanimously set aside a 17.9 million fine imposed on the Compare The Market website (CTM) by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

The CAT held that the CMA had failed to show that CTMs historical use of wide retail parity obligations, also known as most favoured nation (MFN) clauses, had anticompetitive effects.

The CATs judgment is another example in the ongoing debate about how competition law should treat MFN clauses, adding to a fragmented legal landscape in which the European Commission, individual EU member states and the UK have taken various different approaches in recent years.

Weve summarised below the key points of the CAT judgment and explained what it means for businesses that use MFN clauses in their agreements with suppliers or customers.

Refresher on MFN clauses MFN clauses come in many forms.

At their core, MFN clauses prohibit contract party 1 from offering better terms to a third party than to contract party 2.

MFN clauses can relate to all aspects of a contractual relationship, including price, availability of products, services and quality.

The legal treatment of MFN clauses may differ based on several factors, as outlined below.

Whether the MFN is wide or narrow: Wide MFNs apply to a suppliers indirect sales channels (e.g., sales through other intermediaries), while narrow MFNs apply to a suppliers direct sales channel (e.g., through the suppliers own website).

Whether the MFN clause operates at the business-to-business or retail level: As explained below, wide retail MFN clauses are prohibited in the UK.

The industry impacted by the MFN clause: For example, some EU member states have prohibited MFN clauses in the hotel online booking sector.

The identity of the contract parties: For example, the upcoming EU Digital Markets Act will prohibit wide and narrow MFN clauses for certain services by designated gatekeepers.

Since 1 June 2022, UK legislation has included wide retail MFN clauses in its list of hardcore restrictions of competition, meaning that any agreement containing such a clause is presumed illegal.

In the EU, wide retail parity clauses are instead excluded from legislative safe harbours in contracts with online intermediation services, meaning that their competitive impact needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The CMAs challenge to MFN clauses used by CTM The CMAs November 2020 decision challenged agreements between CTM and 32 home insurance providers that contained wide retail MFN clauses preventing home insurance providers from quoting lower prices to consumers on other price comparison websites (PCWs).

The CMA found that the MFN clauses in question were in breach of competition law by effect because they: Reduced the insurers incentive to offer lower prices (e.g., promotional deals) to CTMs rivals.

Discouraged CTMs rivals from offering lower commission fees and thereby gain a competitive advantage over CTM.

Restricted CTMs rivals ability to expand because they were unable to secure a price advantage over CTM.

Limited competition between home insurers more generally.

(The CMA found that because the 32 insurers competed less strongly on price, other providers were subject to less competitive pressure, and competition on retail prices between all insurers competing on PCWs was reduced.)

The CMA also noted that the contracts with CTM prevented insurers from quoting lower prices on their own websites (i.e., via a narrow MFN clause), but found that such narrow MFN clauses were a feature of the market.

The CMA considered that narrow MFN clauses prevented insurers from free riding on investments made by PCWs into their own websites and services, because they stopped insurers from undercutting the prices shown on PCWs (where large numbers of customers would see offers) on their own websites."
Cooley,The CAT and the Meerkat: A Tale of Most Favoured Nation Clauses,"The CAT reverses the CMAs findings The CAT disagreed with the CMAs analysis and quashed the decision on the basis that the CMA had failed to show that the MFN clauses had anticompetitive effects.

In particular, the CAT criticised the evidence basis on which the CMA sought to base its decision, noting that it was anecdotal and untestable by either CTM or the CAT itself.

In the CATs view, the CMA had the burden of proving the adverse effect on competition on the balance of probabilities.

The fact that the CMA merely showed that the wide MFN clauses were contractually complied with was not enough for this purpose.

In particular, the CAT found that the CMA had not sufficiently taken into account that MFN clauses could have pro-competitive or at least neutral effects on the incentive of home insurance providers to lower commissions, promotional discounts, or the home insurance products themselves.

The CAT noted that wide MFN clauses only restricted the price at which home insurers could offer their products through PCWs  they did not restrict competition on the level of premiums  and faulted the CMA for not considering this in its analysis.

Furthermore, the CAT found that wide MFN clauses in the home insurance market would in many cases not prevent differential pricing between PCWs.

The CAT noted that for the wide MFN clauses to have an effect, a consumers risk profile would have to be identical across different PCWs, requiring the same questions to be asked and the same answers to be provided.

The CAT found that this was not necessarily the case in practice.

The CAT also clarified that wide MFN clauses are not by-object restrictions (i.e., presumptively anticompetitive regardless of effect).

The CAT found that wide MFN clauses could result in a number of different outcomes, not all of which were anticompetitive.

By way of example, the CAT referred again to competition between home insurance providers on prices offered to consumers, noting that this might even be sharpened as a result of home insurers having to offer the same low price across different sales channels.

Furthermore, the CAT emphasised that CTM and home insurers had agreed to the MFN clauses voluntarily and may have had commercial reasons for doing so.

Whats next?

The CATs judgment adds to the ongoing debate about the impact of parity clauses on competition and how these should be treated legally.

Shortly after the CAT judgment, the European Commission published the results of its market study on hotel distribution practices in the EU.

One finding of the market study was that laws in Austria and Belgium banning the use of wide and narrow online travel agent parity clauses in the hotel sector did not appear to have led to material changes in hotel distribution practices, including no material increase in commission rates or noticeable effect on hotel price differentiation strategies, relative to the other member states covered by the study.

The CATs findings are more in line with these market study findings than with the legislation in the UK banning wide retail parity restrictions.

Nevertheless, the CMA has not given any indication that it is reconsidering the status of wide retail MFN clauses as hardcore restrictions of competition law (although it also does not appear to have appealed the judgment).

Businesses will have to ensure that MFN restrictions  especially those with cross-border effects  are legally robust in what is an increasingly fragmented European landscape and assess any restrictions carefully."
Cooley,OFSI Imposes Monetary Penalty for Wine Industry Breach of Financial Sanctions,"On 27 September 2022, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) announced that it had imposed a 30,000 penalty against a UK registered company for contravention of the Ukraine (European Union Financial Sanctions) (No.2) Regulations 2014 and the Council Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 (Ukraine Misappropriation and Human Rights) , as internalised by UK law.

Weve summarised below the details of OFSIs investigation and its ramifications, including how the investigation is illustrative of the broad scope of financial sanctions and OFSIs enforcement policy.

Facts of OFSIs investigation The Hong Kong International Wine & Spirit Competition (HKIWSC)  an English incorporated company  organises an annual wine and spirits competition.

Wine companies showcasing their products must pay a fee to participate, and the winners of each years competition receive year-round marketing and promotion of their wine at trade fairs.

One of the competitions participants from 2017 to 2020 was the State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea Production-Agrarian Union (Massandra), a designated entity under UK sanctions.

As a result, all UK persons, entities and persons within the UK have been prohibited from dealing with, and making funds and economic resources available to, Massandra since its designation.

However, during that time frame, Massandra sent the HKIWSC 78 wine bottles and paid fees totalling up to 3,919.

In exchange, the HKIWSC publicised Massandras products.

On 7 December 2020, a third party submitted a suspected breach report to OFSI detailing the dealings between the HKIWSC and Massandra.

After investigating this report and obtaining further information from the HKIWSC by exercising its information powers, OFSI found five potential breaches between 2017 to 2020.

Four breaches were related to the receipt of funds and wine bottles  tangible economic resources  sent by Massandra to the HKIWSC.

A further breach was related to publicity the HKIWSC made available to Massandra in connection with its participation in the annual competition, as OFSI determined that the publicity HKIWSC made available to Massandra following entry to its competitions was an intangible economic resource.

This is because the publicity would be exchanged or used by Massandra in exchange for funds based on the reasonable inference it was for the purpose of increasing Massandras wine sales'.

Insights into OFSI enforcement This case serves as a timely reminder of the scope of financial sanctions regulations and provides valuable insight into OFSIs enforcement process.

Specifically: All UK companies should ensure they comply with applicable UK financial sanctions, irrespective of where their activities take place.

When considering the application of the restriction of making available economic resources to a sanctioned person, entity or body, companies need to be aware that economic resources are interpreted to include tangible and intangible economic resources.

OFSI has illustrated that the provision of publicity is an intangible economic resource, so companies need to be on notice to conduct a broad review of their activities when assessing their sanctions compliance.

The financial value of the intangible asset does not need to be determined by OFSI before it imposes a penalty.

This case concerned the wine industry, which underlines how financial sanctions apply across all sectors.

Voluntary reporting of a breach should not be underestimated as a crucial mitigating factor.

Indeed, in its announcement, OFSI concluded that there were no mitigating circumstances, as the HKIWSC had not carried out a voluntary disclosure.

Importance of risk mitigation In its public announcement, OFSI also highlighted that companies can reduce the risk of breaching financial sanctions regulations by: Improving their awareness of financial sanctions.

Assessing their business to identify if they do business with any sanctioned companies or individuals."

Cooley,Public Companies Update – October One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts final pay-versus-performance rules In August 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced its adoption of final rules requiring public companies to disclose information regarding the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to their named executive officers and company financial performance.

The new disclosure will be required in any proxy or information statement (in which disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K is required) of public companies, except foreign private issuers, registered investment companies and emerging growth companies.

Smaller reporting companies are subject to scaled disclosure requirements.

The disclosure will not be required in registration statements filed in connection with an initial public offering.

The final rules require companies to provide a table disclosing executive compensation information and financial performance measures for their last five fiscal years (three years for smaller reporting companies).

In the first year of disclosure, companies that are not smaller reporting companies will only be required to provide disclosure for three years (two years for smaller reporting companies) with an additional year added in each of the two subsequent years (one subsequent year for smaller reporting companies).

The table must contain the measure of total compensation included in a companys existing summary compensation table, as well as executive compensation actually paid, as calculated by the new rule.

Companies (other than smaller reporting companies) also will be required to provide a list of three to seven financial performance measures that they determine are the most important measures used to link company performance to compensation actually paid.

Covered companies must comply with the final rules in proxies and information statements covering fiscal years ending on or after December 16, 2022.

PCOAB issues audit committee resource In August, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board issued a new resource for audit committees , including questions that public company audit committees may consider as part of their ongoing auditor engagement.

The publication is divided by topic and includes questions relating to fraud and other risks, initial public offerings and M&A activity, audit execution, auditor independence requirements, quality control systems, and technology.

Some notable questions from the report include: How have economic factors (e.g., supply chain disruption, inflation) influenced the auditors risk assessment for the current years audit?

How does the lead auditor anticipate handling work going forward that was previously done by other auditors in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus?

How has the auditor considered the accounting implications of the key provisions in the debt and equity instruments that are issued to founders, sponsors, and private and public investors?

In the auditors view, how has staff turnover at the company impacted: The quality of the companys accounting and financial reporting processes and internal controls?

The companys preparation for the audit?

What are the audit firms policies or procedures for identifying, evaluating and addressing any threats to independence that may impact the services provided to the company?

The amendments increased this amount from $1,070,000,000 to $1,235,000,000, which may affect companies disclosure regarding their EGC status.

The amendments also contain adjustments for inflation to Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act, which includes dollar amounts for certain crowdfunding transactions that are used to determine eligibility for an exemption from registering securities under the Securities Act.

For more information, refer to the SECs fact sheet on JOBS Act inflation adjustments .

Division of Corporation Finance to add offices for crypto and industrial applications and services On September 9, the SEC announced that it plans to add an Office of Crypto Assets and an Office of Industrial Applications and Services to the Division of Corporation Finances Disclosure Review Program (DRP).

The Office of Crypto Assets will be responsible for reviewing filings involving crypto assets, as [a]ssigning companies and filings to one office will enable the DRP to better focus its resources and expertise to address the unique and evolving filing review issues related to crypto assets.

The Office of Industrial Applications and Services is intended to lighten the load of the Office of Life Sciences, which currently oversees filings from the largest number of companies, and will be responsible for the non-pharma, non-biotech, and non-medicinal products companies currently assigned to the Office of Life Sciences.

The DRP expects the new offices to be established later this fall.

ISS publishes proxy season key takeaways On September 1, Institutional Shareholder Services published its key takeaways from the 2022 proxy season .

Highlights include: Virtual-only shareholder meetings remained the majority format in 2021, even while usage declined.

While the number of vote no campaigns targeting directors of companies in the Russell 3000 reached a new high, the percentage of directors who received less than 80% support remained similar year over year.

Lack of racial and ethnic diversity seems to have been a significant factor for directors who did not receive majority support.

More than 50% of all governance-related shareholder proposals that made it to the ballot related to special meeting rights.

To ensure passage of charter amendments, smaller companies have increasingly been issuing preferred stock with enhanced voting rights, sometimes due to challenges in achieving a quorum.

S&P Global highlights rise in investor activism S&P Global recently published an infographic showing the striking rise in investor activism during the first half of 2022.

According to the publication, an all-time high of 777 activist campaigns were launched during such period, surpassing the previous record of 696 campaigns during the first half of 2020.

Seventy-five percent of the 777 campaigns launched had an environmental, social and governance (ESG) component, with social campaigns almost quadrupling since 2018 (from 46 campaigns in 2018 to 182 campaigns in the first half of 2022)."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – October One-Minute Reads,"Campaigns with an environmental aspect also increased from 6% in 2018 to 13% in the first half of 2022.

Consistent with the general theme of the 2022 proxy season, investor campaigns during the first half of the year had the lowest success/settled rate in the last five years (12%), though the information technology sector had the highest success rate at 19%.

ISS reports on key themes from climate disclosure comment letters On August 31, Institutional Shareholder Services posted an article  SEC Climate Disclosure Comments Reveal Diversity of Views  that explores key topics addressed in a representative range of comments to the SECs proposed climate-related disclosure rules .

The article highlights eight themes that the comments largely revolved around: Strong support for the proposed rules alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.

Support for the proposed rules alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the International Sustainability Standards Board frameworks.

Corporate concerns over compliance burdens (in terms of time and money).

Questions about the material relevance of the SEC proposals, including scenario analyses and whether data should be furnished or included in a companys filed financial accounts.

Diverse views on mandating indirect emissions (Scope 3) disclosures.

Concerns over the speculative nature of greenhouse gas disclosures and risks.

Broad support for board oversight of climate risks, but differences over granular disclosure requirements.

Disagreement over the SECs authority to require such disclosures.

The article further notes that most form letter comments expressed full support for the rules, while others were supportive but suggested that the requirements be aligned with other countries disclosure regimes."
Cooley,California’s Broad Pay Transparency Law Takes Effect Next Year,"On September 27, 2022, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 1162 , a broad pay transparency bill requiring employers to include pay ranges in all job advertisements effective January 1, 2023.

The bill also requires employers to submit expanded annual pay data reports that include pay data on employees hired through labor contractors to the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) beginning May 10, 2023, and every second Wednesday in May annually thereafter.

In enacting this law, California follows in the footsteps of several other jurisdictions and municipalities that have enacted similar legislation requiring pay ranges in job postings.

These jurisdictions include, but are not limited to, Washington (effective January 1, 2023), Colorado (currently in effect) and New York City (effective November 1, 2022).

Unlike other jurisdictions, however, California goes a step further to expand currently existing pay data reporting requirements to include reporting on mean and median pay data to better identify gender and race-based pay disparities, among other things.

We discuss the key requirements of the law below.

Pay disclosure requirements Like many other states, California currently prohibits employers from asking applicants about their salary history during the hiring process.

The state also requires employers to provide the pay scale for a position to an applicant upon a reasonable request.

Effective January 1, 2023, SB 1162 will expand these requirements by: Requiring employers with 15 or more employees to include the pay scale, defined as the salary or hourly wage range that the employer reasonably expects to pay for the position, in any job posting.

If the employer uses a third party to publish or post a job, they must provide the pay scale to that third party who must include it in the posting.

Requiring all employers to provide the pay scale for the position in which a current employee is employed, upon request.

Requiring all employers to maintain records of job title and wage history for each employee for the duration of employment and three years after the end of employment so that the states labor commissioner  who is authorized to inspect these records  can determine if there is still a pattern of wage discrepancy.

Pay data reporting requirements California currently requires private employers with 100 or more employees, which are also required under federal law to file annual Employer Information Reports (EEO-1) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to submit annual pay data reports to the states CRD.

Employers are required to include data on pay and hours worked by establishment, job category, sex, race and ethnicity.

SB 1162 broadly expands these reporting obligations by requiring all private employers with 100 or more employees to submit pay data reports to the CRD, regardless of whether they are required to submit EEO-1 reports to the EEOC, and expanding the number of data categories those employers are obligated to report.

The pay data reports will be due annually on the second Wednesday in May, beginning on May 10, 2023, and must include data covering the prior calendar year (the reporting year).

Specifically, the reports must include: The number of employees by race, ethnicity and sex in 10 job categories, based on a snapshot that counts all individuals employed in these categories during a single pay period of the employers choice between October 1 and December 31 of the reporting year.

The job categories include: Executive or senior-level officials and managers First- or mid-level officials and managers Professionals Technicians Sales workers Administrative support workers Craft workers Operatives Laborers and helpers Service workers

The number of employees by race, ethnicity and sex, whose annual earnings fall within each of the pay bands used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Occupational Employment Statistics survey ."
Cooley,California’s Broad Pay Transparency Law Takes Effect Next Year,"The number of employees by race, ethnicity and sex, whose annual earnings fall within each of the pay bands used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Occupational Employment Statistics survey .

Within each job category, for each combination of race, ethnicity and sex, the median and mean hourly rate.

The total number of hours worked by each employee in each pay band during the reporting year.

The employers North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code .

The employers clarifying remarks regarding the information provided, although this is not required.

In addition, employers with 100 or more employees hired through labor contractors within the prior calendar year must also submit a separate pay data report to the CRD covering those employees and disclosing the ownership names of all labor contractors used to supply such employees.

A labor contractor is defined as an individual or entity that supplies, either with or without a contract, a client employer with workers to perform labor within the client employers usual course of business.

Finally, the pay data reports must be made in a format that allows the [CRD] to search and sort the information using readily available software, although no further guidance is provided regarding this requirement.

Penalties for noncompliance Employees aggrieved by an employers noncompliance with the pay disclosure requirements may file a complaint with the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) within one year of the date they learned of the violation or file a civil action for injunctive relief.

If the DLSE finds that an employer violated the law, employers may be subject to civil penalties of $100 to $10,000 per violation.

The labor commissioner will determine the amount of the penalty based on the totality of the circumstances, including prior violations.

Importantly, no penalty shall be assessed for a first violation where an employer shows that all job postings for all positions have been updated to include the pay scale.

If an employer fails to file the pay data reports, the CRD can seek a court order requiring compliance and recover costs associated with seeking such order.

A court also can impose civil penalties of $100 per employee, and up to $200 per employee, for subsequent failures to file the report.

If an employer cannot comply because a labor contractor has not provided the required pay data information, a court may also apportion an appropriate amount of penalties to such contractor.

Next steps In preparing to comply with SB 1162s broad requirements, employers should: Consider conducting a privileged pay equity audit of their workforce and making related pay adjustments for any discrepancies as needed.

Determine the salary ranges for existing positions.

Ensure that all job postings include the required pay scale information.

Pay special attention to similar pay transparency laws currently in effect, or that will soon take effect, in other jurisdictions, if they have multistate operations.

Consider adopting a national policy addressing salary ranges to comport with the growing number of jurisdictions with pay transparency laws, if they have multistate operations.

Ensure any records maintenance policies are updated to comply with the laws record-keeping requirements.

Cooley,FCC Adopts NPRM to Address Spam Text Messages,"The Federal Communications Commission released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) seeking comment on regulations it could adopt to reduce spam and scam text messages.

The FCC noted that the number of illegal, unwanted texts has grown significantly over the last few years.

As a result, consumers have lost millions of dollars and jeopardized their privacy.

The FCC seeks comment on the following topics, which it believes could help eliminate the problem: Requiring mobile wireless providers to block text messages at the network level on the do not originate (DNO) list, or that appear to be from invalid, unallocated or unused numbers.

Forcing providers to implement caller ID authentication standards for text messages.

Asking whether the FCC should extend any mandate to include over-the-top (OTT) messaging applications delivered over internet protocol-based mobile data networks.

Gauging the extent to which spoofing is a problem with regard to text messaging.

Evaluating the effectiveness of device-level or application-based text blocking technologies at reducing illegal texts.

Adopting the same highly likely to be illegal criteria used for call blocking.

Protecting consumers from erroneous blocking of emergency text messages.

Mitigating the risk of erroneous blocking.

Assessing whether the FCC should mandate text blocking rules or rely on the wireless industrys voluntary efforts to prevent these texts.

Wireless telecommunications carriers and other providers of texting services should monitor and participate in the proceeding because the outcome will directly affect them by requiring many to upgrade their technology and change some of their operational practices.

Additionally, businesses that send out automatic text messages to consumers may be affected if the technology or methods used to deliver these messages is restricted or banned.

Comments and reply comments will be due 45 days and 75 days, respectively, after the NPRM is published in the Federal Register."
Cooley,CFPB Asks Public to Help Bolster Innovation in Mortgage Market,"On September 22, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a request for information (RFI) asking the public for ideas about how to improve consumer experiences refinancing their mortgages and, for consumers with hardships, novel methods for offering loss mitigation.

According to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra , [t]he mortgage market has not provided products that allow all households to save money by refinancing, which is a reference to the fact that consumers with smaller loan balances do not always benefit from refinancing their existing mortgage obligations.

The innovation-focused RFI also reflects a change in the bureaus position on encouraging innovation in the financial services markets, as the RFI issuance coincided with the bureaus announcement that it will no longer offer protections to individual companies via its Compliance Assistance Sandbox and No-Action Letters programs.

Interested parties may submit comments on the RFI through the Federal eRulemaking Portal , by email or via direct mail.

Comments must be received by November 28, 2022.

Innovative mortgage refinance ideas In its RFI, the CFPB raises concerns that todays mortgage refinance market provides limited opportunities for consumers to refinance smaller mortgages  a limitation the bureau states has disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic consumers, consumers with low-to-moderate incomes, and consumers in rural areas.

To address this concern, the bureau is soliciting comment on ways to encourage refinancing activities, such as the use of streamlined refinance programs.

The CFPB also raises in the RFI the possibility that adjustments to its ability-to-repay rules, which were enacted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, could stimulate positive refinance activity.

Of additional interest, the bureau asks commenters about the viability of new refinance products, such as those that would have an automatic refinancing trigger when certain conditions are met, or adjustable-rate mortgage loans where the interest rate moves downward but never increases above its original rate.

Innovations in loss mitigation The bureaus RFI highlights the success of COVID-related loss mitigation programs through which borrowers quickly received payment relief during the pandemic while having to provide to mortgage servicers virtually no documentation to support their hardship.

These COVID-related programs stood in stark contrast to programs available after the 2008 financial crisis, such as the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which required borrowers to submit significant amounts of paperwork to support their hardship and financial situation.

The CFPB is requesting comment on the ongoing viability of this type of loss mitigation relief, in particular with respect to assisting consumers impacted by natural disasters.

The bureau also is asking for recommendations to amend current mortgage servicing rules in a way that promotes the continued viability of automatic or streamlined loss mitigation options.

Whats next?

The notice and comment process can be slow, but this RFI presents an opportunity for innovative participants in the mortgage market  lenders, investors and fintechs  to share novel ideas for helping traditionally underserved sections of the homeownership universe.

On the mortgage servicing front, the RFI also offers market participants an opportunity to highlight the friction between the loss mitigation requirements set forth in 12 CFR  1024.41 and the expeditious delivery of loss mitigation assistance to consumers."
Cooley,"NYC to End Private Employer COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate on November 1, 2022","On September 20, 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that the city will end its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private employers on November 1.

Adams stated that lifting the mandate now puts the choice in the hands of New York businesses as to whether to require employee vaccination, subject to accommodations for religious or medical reasons.

The citys vaccine mandate for municipal employees, however, remains in effect.

Since December 2021, under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, the city had required private employers who maintained a workplace in New York City to prohibit the entry of any unvaccinated workers to work at that workplace, subject to accommodations for medical or religious reasons.

The mandate broadly applied to any employee, intern, volunteer or contractor, and to any workplace where work was performed in the presence of other workers or the public.

Private employers also were required to verify workers proof of vaccination and comply with various record keeping and posting obligations.

Next steps After November 1, New York City employers should re-evaluate their COVID-19 protocols and policies.

Employers should determine whether a mandate is necessary for their workplace, and the extent to which they will require employees to return to the office or implement a hybrid work policy.

Cooley,US-UK Data Access Agreement: Top Five Things to Know,"In May 2020, we published a blog post about the US-UK Data Access Agreement , a first-of-its-kind reciprocal agreement between the US and the UK.

Under the agreement, law enforcement agencies in either country could obtain stored electronic data from communications service providers (CSPs) in the other country for the purpose of countering serious crime via a much-streamlined process, thereby overhauling the infamously sluggish mutual legal assistance process.

After a lengthy wait, the UK and US governments announced that they intend to bring the agreement into force on 3 October 2022, at which point substantial volumes of electronic data in the US will become available to UK law enforcement (and vice versa).

In no particular order, weve outlined below the top five things you should know in order to prepare for the imminent launch date.

Recipients

The companies likely to receive an overseas production order (OPO) are CSPs  either in the US from UK law enforcement, or vice versa.

Broadly speaking, that means any private entity that provides to the public the ability to communicate, process, or store computer data via a computer or telecommunications system (or which processes or stores relevant covered data on behalf of such an entity).

Therefore, OPOs could be served on a huge variety of tech and communications firms in the US and the UK, including cloud storage companies, social media providers and messaging platforms.

While the agreement is reciprocal, it is anticipated that the bulk of OPOs will flow from UK law enforcement to US CSPs, as the explanatory memorandum to the agreement notes that  few UK CSPs hold data of interest to the US  (emphasis added).

Timing Recipients of an OPO issued by the UK will have, as a default, just seven days to produce the data stipulated to the UK authorities.

While we expect that early recipients of OPOs are likely to request extensions, its highly advisable to act quickly.

Liability Failure to comply with the order may render the recipient (and in certain circumstances, a director or officer of the recipient) in contempt of court.

In addition, failure to comply with an OPO may attract publicity and reputational damage.

Data protection UK and US recipients which do business in the European Union and are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will need to assess whether they have a legal basis 1 for sharing personal data with the law enforcement authorities submitting the OPO.

UK CSPs receiving an OPO from US authorities will need to assess whether the transfer of personal data to the US can be done in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR and applicable case law.

US CSPs receiving an OPO from UK authorities will not initially have the same concerns in light of the adequacy decision that the European Commission has granted to the UK.

However, if the commission were to withdraw its adequacy decision (on grounds that the agreement compromises the UKs level of data protection), US companies also would need to assess whether the transfer of personal data to the UK can be done in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR and applicable case law.

Challenge It is expected that OPOs may (and will) be challenged on a significant number of different grounds, including for breach of data protection laws and to determine applicability of US or UK legal privilege protections.

The primary venue to challenge OPOs sent by UK law enforcement will be the Courts of England and Wales; however, it is likely that challenges will be made concurrently in the US.

The scene is now set for critically important legal challenges to be made to help determine how the new process should be applied across the CSP community."
Cooley,US-UK Data Access Agreement: Top Five Things to Know,"The scene is now set for critically important legal challenges to be made to help determine how the new process should be applied across the CSP community.

Any parties served with an OPO are encouraged to seek legal advice as soon as possible to ensure suitable steps are taken to challenge the OPO, if necessary, and ultimately to assist in successful compliance with the OPO and balance the various competing interests whenever possible.

Companies that are likely to receive numerous OPOs would be especially well-advised to take steps to ensure their systems for handling OPOs are robust and to continue to stay abreast of the sorts of issues that may give rise to challenges.

Cooley,Misleading ESG Claims – Will They Wash?,"Greenwashing is the practice of a company providing information on its environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) policies, or its products and practices, with the intent to present an environmentally responsible public image that masks harmful business practices.

Legislators globally are issuing a spate of new rules and guidance requiring adverse environmental, human rights, or governance issues to be considered, disclosed and even mitigated by companies.

There also is growing pressure from consumers and regulators.

Consumers are increasingly seeking out products and services with strong ESG credentials and reportedly are willing to pay up to a 9% premium for environmentally friendly products.

Unsurprisingly, companies are seeking to leverage this consumer premium in the way that they advertise and market their products and services.

However, a 2021 report published by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that 40% of green claims made online were potentially misleading.

With the increased appetite for regulatory enforcement and ESG-related litigation, the potential risk exposure for companies publishing misleading ESG-related statements is becoming more acute.

Is the European Union set to become a front-runner?

In the EU, the European Commission (EC) has put greenwashing at the front and centre of its agenda.

Its aim is two-fold: First, to prevent consumers from being misled by unsubstantiated or inaccurate ESG claims, and second, to require disclosure of ESG data so entities along the value chain can make informed decisions on which materials or products to purchase and to whom they should sell.

The required disclosure exercise will no longer be limited to the reporting entity and its group, nor will it be limited to EU companies  corporates within scope will be required to carry out ESG-focused due diligence , and report on key aspects of their value chains.

To that end, in March 2022, the EC put forward a proposal for a directive that will amend the existing EU rules on Unfair Commercial Practices and Consumer Rights to tighten the rules on green claims.

In parallel, the EC is expected in November to present a proposal that will require companies to substantiate the claims they make in relation to the environmental footprint of their products and services by using standard methods for quantifying them.

The EC believes that these rules will make environmental information more reliable and create a more level playing field.

New rules also are set to enter into force in the EU on mandatory sustainability reporting.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), replacing the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, is anticipated for adoption in November.

The CSRD will significantly expand sustainability reporting obligations in the EU and will apply to a far broader range of companies than before, including large EU companies (even if they are not listed), non-EU companies that have a subsidiary or branch in the EU, and small and medium-sized enterprises listed on EU regulated markets.

Under the new rules, companies will have to report on their impact on sustainability matters and on information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the undertakings development, performance and position.

The information must cover the short, medium and long term, and will be specified in the mandatory sustainability reporting standards that the EC will adopt.

The mandatory sustainability reporting standards , currently being developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group , will include environmental matters, such as climate mitigation and adaptation, the circular economy, and use of water and marine resources.

The US clamps down It is not only in Europe that we are seeing this trend."
Cooley,Misleading ESG Claims – Will They Wash?,"The US clamps down It is not only in Europe that we are seeing this trend.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Gary Gensler, who was nominated as chair in 2021 by President Joe Biden, has signalled that disciplining corporate ESG disclosure is a top priority.

On 21 March 2022, the SEC released its long-awaited proposed climate change disclosure rules , with emissions and climate governance and risk disclosure requirements derived largely from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures framework.

Expected to be finalised in October 2022, the climate rule, alongside proposed or expected rulemakings on cybersecurity, board diversity and human capital management, is part of a broader trend of moving ESG disclosure out of the Wild West of voluntary reporting and subjecting such disclosure to SEC oversight and standardisation.

These rulemakings build upon SEC guidance and comment letter campaigns in recent years that have focused on inadequate disclosure of climate and related risks, as well as discordances between sustainability reports and SEC reporting.

In addition to its emphasis on standardising and improving issuer ESG disclosure, the SEC has focused its rulemaking and enforcement actions on ESG investing.

On 30 March 2022, the SEC published a report setting out its enforcement priorities, which included greenwashing in advisory services and investment products.

The SEC had already established a Climate and ESG Task Force in 2021 and specifically identified ESG investing as an area to be targeted.

Then, on 23 May 2022, the SEC issued its first penalty for activities within the remit of the task force.

The agency reached an agreement with BNY Mellon Investment Adviser that it would pay a US$1.5 million penalty after accusing it of misstating and omitting information about ESG investment considerations for mutual funds that it managed.

These actions were followed by the release of two proposed rule amendments on 25 May 2022 aimed at preventing greenwashing by funds and investment advisers, which, among other changes, would create new requirements around fund names and disclosure requirements related to ESG strategies and goals.

The SEC is investigating a broad range of industries and sectors for their ESG claims.

For example: The SEC filed a complaint against Vale SA , a Brazilian mining company, for allegedly fraudulent assurances in its sustainability reports and other public filings in relation to the Brumadinho dam, which later collapsed.

The SEC is investigating the asset management division of a leading investment bank for claims made by some of its ESG-related funds, but no further details are known at this stage.

Is the UK next?

The issue of greenwashing is firmly on the CMAs radar, and its Annual Plan 2021 to 2022 highlighted the prevention of misleading green claims as one of the regulators priorities in terms of enforcement.

The UK government also announced that it will grant the CMA enhanced powers to directly enforce consumer law , including the ability to fine firms up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching consumer protection laws.

This may include instances of greenwashing, which are likely to fall foul of the prohibition on unfair commercial practices in the Consumer Protection From Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.

The CMA recently launched an investigation into claims made by ASOS, Boohoo and George at Asda to  get to the bottom of whether the firms green claims are misleading customers .

In particular, the CMA will be scrutinising eco-friendly and sustainability claims made by the companies in respect of their fashion products, including clothing, footwear, and accessories.

This action follows the publication of the CMAs Green Claims Code in 2021 and its plans announced in January 2022 to review environmental claims in the fashion sector ."
Cooley,Misleading ESG Claims – Will They Wash?,"This action follows the publication of the CMAs Green Claims Code in 2021 and its plans announced in January 2022 to review environmental claims in the fashion sector .

We understand that the CMA has written to the three companies outlining its concerns and will use its information-gathering powers to obtain evidence to progress its investigation.

How the review develops will depend on the CMAs assessment of the evidence before it.

Possible outcomes include securing undertakings from the companies to change the way they operate, taking the firms to court to seek enhanced consumer measures (such as payments to consumers to redress any harm) or simply closing the case without further action.

(For more guidance on the CMAs Green Claims Code, which provides a framework to help businesses make environmental claims that inform and, importantly, do not mislead consumers, refer to Cooleys October 2021 Productwise blog post .)

It is not just the CMA that is taking action in the UK.

The Advertising Standards Authority has been active , banning several campaigns by companies for the practice of exaggerating the total environmental benefit of their products in a misleading manner.

Concurrently, the director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), Lisa Osofsky, has highlighted ethical investments subject to fraud as a key challenge for prosecutors going forward.

In May 2022, the SFO secured its first ESG-related victory at trial , with the convictions of two individuals involved in running a fraudulent green investment scheme in Brazil.

The agency said that its seven-year investigation uncovered an intricate web of money transfers, forged documents and invented identities used to scam investors under the false pretence of environmental protection.

Global Forestry Investments was presented to investors as a secure, well-managed, ethical investment scheme that would help protect the Amazon and support local communities, but the proceeds in fact were being channelled into the two executives bank accounts.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also has expressed that greenwashing is a growing concern.

At the COP26 summit in November 2021, FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi noted that greenwashing cannot be allowed to persist.

1

This comes against a backdrop of a proliferation of rules around ESG-related disclosures to investors, such as the EUs Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, and the FCAs climate-related financial disclosure regime and proposed sustainability disclosure requirements, which are expected to be published this year.

Stakeholders in this area should monitor these developments closely.

What does this mean for companies?

Ultimately, companies will need to be diligent in ensuring that all ESG-related operational practices match up to any statements made publicly, whether to investors, consumers or other stakeholders.

They also could limit the scope of such statements to avoid the risk of facing regulatory action for making bold claims that are not supported by operational reality.

Limited disclosures must be carefully drafted so as not to run the risk of being considered omissions of material details and falling foul of the rules in that way.

With the growth of whistleblowing, any mismatches between marketing and reality are more likely than ever to be discovered.

One thing is clear: While misleading claims around ESG may have washed with regulators in the past, that is no longer the case.

We will continue to see investigations, prosecutions, and possibly convictions for companies and their directors engaging in such claims.

Cooley,"CFPB Targets Buy Now, Pay Later Lending","On September 15, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a report analyzing trends in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) industry.

In particular, the CFPB finds that the BNPL industry has experienced rapid growth since 2020 and that, while BNPL products offer certain benefits to consumers, the bureau believes that borrowers are receiving uneven disclosures and consumer protections when using those products.

CFPB reports trends in BNPL loans Based on data collected between 2020 and 2021, the CFPB reports: A 4% increase in the percent of applicants who were approved for credit.

A $135 increase in the average purchase amount financed by a BNPL loan.

A 2.6% increase in the percent of borrowers who were charged at least one late fee each year  with those late fees accounting for an additional 1.9% of lender revenue over such time and an overall 1.7% increase in lender revenues attributable to consumer fees.

CFPB identifies competitive benefits of BNPL loans The report identifies potential benefits in two categories.

Ease of use: BNPL products are easy to use and accessible, have a high credit approval rate, and provide an instantaneous credit decision.

The repayment structure is straightforward and simple for consumers to understand.

Product discovery: The app-driven acquisition model serves as a discovery engine that helps users browse many products and brands via a process that, over time, becomes tailored to the individual users interests.

CFPB expresses concern over potential consumer risks of BNPL loans The CFPB expresses concern over potential consumer risks in three broad categories, as outlined below.

Lack of consistent consumer protections The CFPB states its belief that disclosures to consumers seeking to use BNPL products are inconsistent across providers, including with respect to loan terms, cost of credit, dispute resolution and the requirement to use autopay for loan repayment.

Specifically, the CFPB concludes that dispute resolution, which is the top-ranking BNPL-related complaint category in the CFPBs Consumer Complaint Database, presents obstacles for consumers and can result in financial harm as consumers are required to pay remaining installments while the resolution of a dispute or product return is pending.

Data harvesting The CFPB also states its belief that BNPL lenders often collect consumer data and monetize it, increasing the maximum lifetime value that can be extracted from a consumer through other product features and marketing campaigns.

In particular, the CFPB expresses concern that data harvesting has been maximized by lenders adoption of an app-driven acquisition model in which consumers complete their application on the lenders proprietary app  a development that is leading many executives to view BNPL products as shifting into marketing functions.

In his statement on the report , CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said the bureau will begin coordinating with the Federal Trade Commission on its proposal to regulate data collection .

Chopra believes the FTCs data harvesting rules, when finalized, will be enforced by the CFPB in the financial services arena.

Overextension The CFPB report states that the BNPL business model may encourage consumers to overextend on debt by accumulating several loans within a short period of time and/or taking out loans over a sustained period, which may impact consumers ability to meet non-BNPL obligations.

Additionally, the report finds a significant increase in the purchase sizes enabled by BNPL products  with consumers often purchasing 50% to 80% more than they would if paying by other means.

Thus, the CFPB sees potential overextension from two directions: Consumers not only making more purchases than normal but also spending more on each purchase."
Cooley,"CFPB Targets Buy Now, Pay Later Lending","Thus, the CFPB sees potential overextension from two directions: Consumers not only making more purchases than normal but also spending more on each purchase.

Focus on regulatory landscape Chopra also stated that the CFPB would work to ensure that borrowers have similar protections to credit card consumers, regardless of whether their purchases are made using a credit card or a BNPL loan.

For example, the report refers to the following regulations currently applicable to credit card issuers that may be logically applied to BNPL loans: Regulation Z requires credit card issuers and creditors of open-end credit to give consumers resolution rights with respect to disputes, allowing consumers to withhold payment while an issue is being resolved.

The CFPB states its belief that most BNPL lenders are not following these provisions, and consumers are often required to pay installments with respect to disputed amounts while the disputes are pending.

The Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits creditors from requiring automatic withdrawal for the payment of loan installments (also known as autopay).

The report finds that most BNPL lenders are requiring borrowers to use autopay, and some BNPL lenders make removing the autopay feature burdensome or impossible.

Regulation Z prohibits credit card issuers from charging borrowers multiple late fees for the same missed payment .

The report finds evidence of multiple late fees being charged on the same missed payment; however, it notes that this practice had changed by the time of publication.

The lack of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking from the CFPB would suggest a formal rule remains a ways off.

In Congress, BNPL remains an area of interest, with frequent questions to Chopra from lawmakers and a hearing on the issue in November 2021 .

Lawmakers, broadly speaking, mirror Chopras concerns over: Unsustainable debt.

Lack of adequate consumer disclosure or notice.

Consumer credit reporting.

Consumer data privacy, control and security risks.

However, no notable BNPL bills were introduced in this Congress."
Cooley,Seattle Expands Protections for Independent&nbsp;Contractors,"Effective September 1, 2022, employers hiring independent contractors who perform services in Seattle must comply with the Independent Contractor Protections Ordinance .

The ordinance requires covered hiring entities to provide independent contractors with certain disclosures prior to entering into a contract and at the time of payment, as well as a notice of rights before work begins.

Under the ordinances broad definitions, a covered contractor is any self-employed person who: Has no employees.

Performs services in whole or in part in Seattle.

Will receive or can reasonably expect to receive at least $600 in total compensation from the hiring entity during a calendar year.

A covered hiring entity includes any company regularly engaged in business or commercial activity, including not-for-profit organizations.

We discuss the key requirements of the ordinance below.

Pre-work written disclosure First, the ordinance requires a hiring entity to provide the contractor with a pre-work written disclosure identifying certain terms and conditions before beginning work.

The required information includes: Date of disclosure.

Name of the independent contractor.

Name of the hiring entity.

Contact information for the hiring entity, including but not limited to physical address, mailing address, telephone number and/or email address, as applicable.

Description of work.

Location(s) of work and regular place of business of independent contractor or hiring entity.

Rate(s) of pay.

Pay basis (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, fee per project, piece rate, commission).

Tips and/or service charge distribution policy, if applicable.

Typical expenses incurred in the course of work, and which expenses will be paid or reimbursed by the hiring entity, if applicable.

Deductions, fees, or other charges that the hiring entity may subtract from payment and accompanying policies for each type of charge, if applicable.

Payment schedule.

If an existing agreement such as a written contract between the parties already contains the above required information, no separate pre-work written disclosure is necessary.

However, if any information is missing, the hiring entity should prepare a document containing the missing information, with supporting documentation, so that all the required information can be found in a single document.

Curiously, hiring entities can provide piece-meal notice of any changes to up to six of the above items, but must issue a revised disclosure if there are changes to more than six items.

Descriptions of work are critical under the ordinance: The Seattle Office of Labor Standards (OLS) notes that the description must include all terms and conditions that the hiring entity would require to be met as a pre-condition to payment for the agreed upon work, as [a]ny terms and conditions not itemized in the pre-contract disclosure may not be relied on by the hiring entity as a basis for the failure to make timely payment under the ordinance.

Notice of rights Second, the ordinance provides that hiring entities furnish a notice of rights to contractors before they begin work.

The notice must include: The rights to pre-contract disclosures, timely payment and payment disclosures.

The right to be protected from retaliation.

The right to file a complaint with the OLS or to bring a civil action for a violation of the law.

Any contractor already working for an entity as of September 1 must be provided with the notice of rights (and the pre-work disclosure) by the next date of compensation or September 30, 2022, whichever is sooner.

Payment disclosures Finally, the ordinance requires hiring entities to provide certain disclosures each time they provide the contractor with compensation for services.

Each disclosure must include: Date of disclosure.

Name of independent contractor.

Name of hiring entity.

Description of services covered by payment (e.g., description of project, tasks completed or hours worked)."
Cooley,Seattle Expands Protections for Independent&nbsp;Contractors,"Name of independent contractor.

Name of hiring entity.

Description of services covered by payment (e.g., description of project, tasks completed or hours worked).

Location of services covered by payment.

Rate or rates of pay.

Tip compensation and/or service charge distributions, if applicable.

Pay basis (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, fee per project, piece rate, commission), with accounting of method(s) for determining payment earned during the pay period.

Expenses reimbursed, if applicable.

Gross payment.

Deductions, fees or other charges, if applicable.

Net payment after deductions, fees or other charges.

If the payment is based on the number of hours worked, a statement of hours for which payment is being made may suffice.

In other cases, if the pre-work disclosure provides that payments are to be made in installments based upon phases of a project being completed, the payment disclosure should identify the project milestones or parts of the work described in the pre-contract disclosure for which the payment is made.

In addition to the payment disclosure, the ordinance requires contractors to be paid in accordance with the terms of any contract between the parties, the terms in the pre-work disclosure, or within 30 days after completion of services.

Other requirements, retaliation protections and violations Hiring entities are required to keep electronic or hard copy records that document compliance with the ordinance for three years.

Although these records may include the disclosures, notice and payment information, the OLS notes that [e]mails and text messages attaching such disclosures or notices should also be retained as evidence that documents were in fact provided to the independent contractor on specific dates.

Any hiring entity failing to retain these required records is subject to a rebuttable presumption that the entity violated the ordinances recordkeeping requirements.

Contractors also are protected from retaliation for exercising rights protected by the ordinance and may file a complaint with the OLS, which administers the ordinance.

For example, the OLS notes that protected activity includes making inquiries about or informing others about their rights under the ordinance, or informing the hiring entity or filing a complaint alleging a violation of the law.

Potential adverse actions against a contractor include temporarily or permanently denying or limiting the contractors access to work, offering less desirable work, or terminating, deactivating or taking any other action that would dissuade a reasonable person from exercising rights under the ordinance.

Significantly, the ordinance also creates a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an adverse action is taken against a contractor within 90 days of a contractors protected activity.

Hiring entities violating the law may be subject to payment of unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, civil penalties, fines and interest.

Next steps Employers who engage independent contractors to perform services in Seattle should update any independent contractor agreements and payment forms for the required information.

Employers also should distribute the required notices as appropriate.

Employers may use the OLS pre-work disclosure , notice and payment disclosure documents, but they are not required to.

In addition, employers should review their policies and practices relating to hiring independent contractors to ensure compliance with the ordinance.

Cooley,OFCCP Extends Deadline to Object to Type 2 Consolidated EEO-1 Report Disclosure,"As previously reported in our September 15 client alert , the US Department of Labors Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) announced that it had received a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all Type 2 Consolidated EEO-1 Reports filed by federal contractors from 2016 to 2020.

The agency permitted covered contractors to object to disclosure of their reports until September 19.

On September 15, however, the OFCCP extended this deadline to October 19, 2022 , to ensure that covered contractors have time to ascertain whether they are covered and submit objections.

The OFCCP indicated that some contractors had also raised questions regarding whether they are included in the pool of covered contractors during the requested time frame.

In response, the OFCCP announced that it would email contractors that it believes are covered by the FOIA request, using the address provided by contractors that have registered in its Contractor Portal.

The agency also stated that contractors may contact the OFCCP FOIA Help Desk by phone or email with any questions not covered in the agencys FAQs .

If you have any questions about OFCCP developments, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,"OFCCP Updates Guidance on Privilege Considerations for Compensation Analyses, Considers Disclosure of Contractors’ EEO-1 Reports in Response to FOIA Request","On August 18, 2022, the US Department of Labors Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) made two significant announcements affecting federal contractors.

First, the agency issued Directive 2022-01: Advancing Pay Equity Through Compensation Analysis , which replaces its original directive from March 2022 to clarify guidance regarding contractors compliance with compensation analysis obligations.

Second, the agency announced it received a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all Type 2 Consolidated EEO-1 Reports filed by federal contractors from 2016 to 2020.

The agency stated that the information sought could be protected from disclosure, but suggested skepticism over whether such protections were warranted.

Covered contractors have until September 19, 2022, to object to the disclosure of their Type 2 EEO-1 Consolidated Reports.

We discuss these two developments in detail below.

Revised compensation analysis directive All federal contractors are required, as part of their annual affirmative action obligations, to perform an in-depth analysis of their compensation systems to determine whether there are gender, race or ethnicity-based disparities.

Many employers retain outside counsel to assist in conducting privileged pay analyses.

The revised directive marks a significant change in the OFCCPs prior position on whether contractors are required to disclose such privileged analyses, and it makes clear that the agency will not require the production of privileged communications or attorney work product in reviewing compliance with these compensation analysis obligations.

In addition, as outlined below, the revised directive clarifies the types of documentation the agency expects to review and reminds contractors that they are required to develop and execute action-oriented programs to address any disparities.

Requesting additional information The OFCCP confirms that it may request additional information regarding compliance if a contractors audit reveals disparities in pay, including additional compensation data, follow-up interviews, and additional records and information.

The agency notes, however, that the most useful form of documentation is the contractors full compensation analysis.

Alternative options and documentation As noted above, the OFCCP confirms that it will not require production of attorney-client privileged communications or attorney work product.

If a contractors full compensation analysis contains privileged information, the OFCCP now proposes that contractors may do one of the following: Provide a redacted version of the compensation analysis.

Conduct a separate, nonprivileged analysis during the relevant audit period and provide that analysis to the OFCCP in full.

Provide a detailed affidavit setting forth facts that demonstrate compliance.

Regardless of which alternative a contractor pursues, contractors will be required to provide the following information to enable the OFCCP to assess whether a contractor has satisfied its obligations: When the compensation analysis was completed.

The number of employees that the compensation analysis included , and the number and categories of employees that the compensation analysis excluded .

Which forms of compensation were analyzed, and how different forms of compensation were separated or combined for the analysis (e.g., base pay alone, base pay combined with bonuses, etc.).

Confirmation that compensation was analyzed by gender, race and ethnicity.

The method of analysis employed by the contractor (e.g., type of statistical test conducted).

The agency also identified other information that is not required but it has deemed helpful in understanding how contractors evaluate their compensation systems, including all employee pay groupings evaluated, an explanation of how and why employees were grouped for the analysis, and which, if any, variables were considered in the analysis."
Cooley,"OFCCP Updates Guidance on Privilege Considerations for Compensation Analyses, Considers Disclosure of Contractors’ EEO-1 Reports in Response to FOIA Request","Developing action-oriented programs to address disparities Contractors must develop and execute action-oriented programs if their compensation analyses identify gender, race or ethnicity-based pay disparities.

The OFCCP could request documentation demonstrating that a contractor investigated the reasons for the pay disparities.

It also could require documentation regarding the nature and scope of the program(s) that the contractor implemented to address such problem areas, as well as how the contractor intends to measure the impact of these programs on employment opportunities and identified barriers.

FOIA request for contractors EEO-1 reports The Type 2 Consolidated EEO-1 Report is an annual report that multi-establishment employers must file, which includes demographic data for all employees of a company, categorized by race/ethnicity, sex and job category.

The OFCCP received a FOIA request asking for a spreadsheet of these Type 2 Consolidated EEO-1 Reports for all federal contractors, including first-tier subcontractors, from 2016-2020.

The OFCCP clarified that compensation information is not included as part of the request.

As noted above, the agency believes the requested information could be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4, which protects against the disclosure of trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person

[that is] privileged or confidential.

However, the OFCCP is inviting companies with concerns over disclosure to provide objections substantiating the basis for withholding such information.

According to the OFCCP, any objection submitted by a contractor must address the following questions to enable the OFCCP to determine whether the information should be withheld or disclosed: What specific information from the EEO-1 report does the contractor consider to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information?

What facts support the contractors belief that this information is commercial or financial in nature?

Does the contractor customarily keep the requested information private or closely held?

What steps have been taken by the contractor to protect the confidentiality of the requested data, and to whom has it been disclosed?

Does the contractor contend that the government provided an express or implied assurance of confidentiality?

If no, were there express or implied indications at the time the information was submitted that the government would publicly disclose the information?

How would disclosure of this information harm an interest of the contractor protected by Exemption 4 (such as by causing foreseeable harm to the contractors economic or business interests)?

Covered employers  which the OFCCP believes includes approximately 15,000 contractors  may file their objections to the broad request through an online portal the agency developed to collect and track such objections, or by email to OFCCPSubmitterResponse@dol.gov .

The OFCCP also has developed FAQs regarding the request.

Objections will be independently evaluated by the OFCCP.

If the OFCCP determines that it will disclose the information over an objection, it will provide written notice to the contractor with the reason the objection was not sustained, a description of the information that will be disclosed and a specified disclosure date.

Employers should note, however, that if a covered contractor fails to respond to the notice by September 19, the OFCCP will assume that the company has no objection to disclosure and will begin the process of sending the contractors Type 2 EEO-1 Report data to the FOIA requester.

Next steps Employers who submitted a Type 2 Consolidated EEO-1 Report between 2016 and 2020 should consider objecting to its release in response to the FOIA request, if they believe those reports contain confidential and proprietary business information.

Those who fail to object should assume that their reports will be disclosed."
Cooley,"OFCCP Updates Guidance on Privilege Considerations for Compensation Analyses, Considers Disclosure of Contractors’ EEO-1 Reports in Response to FOIA Request","Those who fail to object should assume that their reports will be disclosed.

Contractors should navigate compensation analyses carefully in light of the revised directive.

Although the OFCCP walked back its prior position on privilege, it also cautioned that contractors will not be found in compliance if they simply invoke privilege and provide OFCCP with no or insufficient documentation of compliance.

Contractors should consider the benefits of conducting two different analyses as now sanctioned by the OFCCP: one subject to privilege and one not subject to privilege (which can be submitted to the OFCCP).

Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"SEC drafts strategic plan for 2022 to 2026 On August 24, 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had published a draft of its strategic plan for fiscal years 2022 to 2026 , with an accompanying request for public comment .

The draft strategic plan lays out three overarching goals to: (1) [p]rotect working families against fraud, manipulation, and misconduct; (2) [d]evelop and implement a robust regulatory framework that keeps pace with evolving markets, business models, and technologies; and (3) [s]upport a skilled workforce that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and is fully equipped to advance agency objectives.

The strategic plan also includes several components for each primary goal.

For a more detailed overview, refer to this Cooley PubCo blog post on the SECs strategic plan .

SEC charges crypto company with Section 5 violations In our August edition of One-Minute Reads , we discussed a recent novel insider trading case in which the SEC found certain digital assets to be securities, and the potential for this finding to lead to enforcement actions against crypto asset companies for the sale and offer of unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

As of August 16, this possibility has come to fruition, as the SEC announced charges against a group of entities and their founder for their roles in unregistered crypto offerings.

According to the SEC complaint , the company conducted an unregistered offering of a crypto asset, including via an initial coin offering, illegally raising over $16 million in proceeds through unregistered offers and sales of these securities.

We will follow this litigation as it progresses and continue to monitor for other SEC actions relating to digital assets as securities subject to Section5.

SEC chair comments on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act On July 27, SEC Chair Gary Gensler gave remarks at the Center for Audit Quality on what we have learned from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in commemoration of its 20th anniversary.

Gensler addressed the role SOX played in restoring public trust after the Enron and WorldCom scandals, while also highlighting key areas where there is still room for improvement.

Notably, Chair Gensler asked the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to consider adding updated auditor independence standards to its agenda, and stated that the SEC may take a fresh look at the SECs auditor independence rules as well.

Gensler acknowledged the importance of SOX in establishing the PCAOB, but noted that it has been too slow to update auditing standards, though he expects there could be measurable progress on standard-setting in the next year.

He also touched on auditing inspections, investigations and enforcement  highlighting the PCAOBs role in the recent charges against Ernst & Young for cheating by its auditors on ethics exams  as well as the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) and the lack of US inspections of audits and investigations in China.

See this Cooley PubCo blog post on the HFCAA for additional color, and refer to this Cooley PubCo blog post on SOX for more information on Genslers remarks.

Semler Brossy issues report on ESG executive compensation metrics On July 18, Semler Brossy published its ESG + Incentives 2022 Report , providing benchmark data on the prevalence and types of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) metrics being used by the S&P 500 in their executive compensation programs.

Per the report: 70% of the S&P 500 that filed their proxies between April 2021 and March 2022 included an ESG metric in their compensation programs (compared to 57% during the same period in the previous year).

Of these companies, 95% included human capital management metrics in their compensation programs (the most common related to diversity, equity and inclusion)  in comparison, 23% included environmental metrics and 41% included other metrics, such as cybersecurity."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – September One-Minute Reads,"Notably, 98% of all companies that incorporated ESG metrics into their compensation programs have done so in their annual incentive plans (ESG metrics in long-term incentive plans remain relatively uncommon, at just 14%).

The most prevalent structure for ESG metrics is as part of a scorecard (41%), followed by a discretionary structure wherein ESG is included as an additional layer that might impact final payouts (23%).

Glass Lewis releases 2022 proxy season review On August 4, Glass Lewis released its Proxy Season 2022 Briefing , providing an overview of its initial observations and voting recommendations from the 4,574 reports on US publicly traded companies with an annual meeting held between January 1 and June 30, 2022.

Some key takeaways from Glass Lewiss report include: Support was recommended for 86% of directors, with negative recommendations stemming most commonly from initial public offering governance concerns, insufficient board gender diversity, no independent lead or presiding director, and having an affiliate on a committee.

Support was recommended for 84.3% of say-on-pay votes, with negative recommendations stemming most commonly from concerning pay practices (excessive grants/compensation at 41.6%), poor program or award design structure (34.9%), pay/performance disconnects (34.7%), other concerning pay practices (16.7%), and insufficient responses to shareholders (15.8%).

Support was recommended for 85.7% of equity plans, with negative recommendations stemming most commonly from the presence of evergreen provisions (44.7%), repricing provisions (27.3%), timing or excessive nature of grants (12.4%), costs of plan (13%), and excessive dilution/overhang (6.8%).

Cooley tax team highlights implications of Inflation Reduction Act On August 16, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law, which includes several significant tax provisions, among other important items.

This client alert on the IRA from the Cooley tax team highlights a few key tax provisions of the act, mainly the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), which imposes a 15% AMT on US corporations with profits exceeding a certain threshold, and a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of any stock repurchases by publicly traded US corporations and certain US subsidiaries of publicly traded non-US corporations, subject to several exceptions.

The corporate AMT will apply for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, with the excise tax taking effect for applicable buybacks after this same date.

Cooley,A Guide to the Unitary Patent System and Unified Patent Court,"Introduction By early 2023, a new unitary patent system and Unified Patent Court (UPC) is expected to become operational.

The new system provides for a single unitary patent that will cover all European Union member states that have ratified the UPC Agreement.

1

The current European patent system will still be available to the 27 non-contracting states that are party to it in parallel.

Once the new system is in place, the same application process will be used to obtain unitary patents as is currently used to obtain European patents at the European Patent Office (EPO).

The only difference will be in the post-grant procedure.

For the EU member states that have signed the UPC Agreement, it will no longer be necessary to validate the European patent individually in those territories.

The current validation process will still be available if the owner of the patent decides not to use the unitary patent system.

However, it is not possible to convert a European patent already granted before the UPC Agreement comes into force into a unitary patent.

If a unitary patent is desired once the European patent grants, the deadline to elect the unitary patent is one month from grant of the European patent.

Once elected, the unitary patent cannot be un-elected.

The UPC will be the court responsible for enforcing both unitary patents and existing European patents.

However, in the seven years after the UPC Agreement comes into force, it will be possible to opt out of the jurisdiction of the UPC in respect of granted European patents.

The opt-out will last for the entire lifetime of the patent.

It will be possible to register opt-outs before the UPC Agreement comes into force, during the so-called three-month sunrise period.

The sunrise period will only begin when Germany deposits its instrument of ratification of the UPC Agreement.

We dont yet know when this will occur, but it is expected to be in the last quarter of 2022.

If no opt-out is filed, the UPC will share jurisdiction with the national courts of the UPC member states.

It will also be possible for European patents that originally opted out of the UPC to opt in once again, provided no litigation has been initiated in any designated European country.

What are the main benefits and drawbacks of a unitary patent?

There are several benefits and drawbacks to consider in deciding whether to elect the unitary patent system or to opt granted European patents out of the jurisdiction of the UPC.

We set out below a few factors to consider: Benefits Drawbacks The renewal fees for a unitary patent will be considerably lower than the combined renewal fees of the 17 current member states of the unitary patent system.

If you do not wish for protection in all contracting member states, then a unitary patent may be more expensive to maintain than national patent rights in a small number of important territories.

The administrative load is lower since you only have to worry about a single renewal fee rather than a separate fee for each member state.

It is not possible to convert from a unitary patent to national rights.

This means that even if your business needs change and you only need protection in one or two countries covered by the unitary   patent, you must pay the renewal fee and maintain the unitary patent covering for all jurisdictions.

The patent being unitary also means that if there is alleged infringement in the 17 member states, the patent can be enforced in all states simultaneously through the UPC rather than having to act through separate national courts.

This could make certain types of cross-border infringement easier to stop.

The patent being unitary means that if the patent is attacked by a third party and revoked, you lose protection in all 17 member states."
Cooley,A Guide to the Unitary Patent System and Unified Patent Court,"The patent being unitary means that if the patent is attacked by a third party and revoked, you lose protection in all 17 member states.

Having a unitary patent may cause future licensing agreements to be more complex if, for example, it is desired to license the patent to separate parties in multiple countries covered by the unitary patent.

What is the UPC?

The UPC will be a new specialised international patent court established to settle disputes relating to both European patents and unitary patents.

It will have exclusive jurisdiction for unitary patents.

During the seven-year transitional period, the UPC will also automatically have jurisdiction over all nationally validated European patents of participating countries, including European patents granted before the UPC Agreement comes into effect, unless the European patent has been proactively opted out.

The UPC will, as a general rule, have exclusive competence in respect of civil litigation on matters relating to European patents, European patents with unitary effect, supplementary protection certificates issued for a product covered by such a patent, and European patent applications.

It will have jurisdiction over contracting member states.

What will the UPCs procedure comprise?

A written procedure where the parties submit detailed pleadings.

An interim procedure where directions are given for further steps leading to trial, and other preparations for trial are made.

This may include an interim conference with the parties.

An oral procedure that could include the questioning of witnesses and experts under the control of a presiding judge.

Award of damages, which could include an interim award of damages.

Costs decisions.

What language will the UPC proceedings be conducted in?

Proceedings in the Court of First Instance of the UPC must be conducted in an official EU language of the contracting member state hosting the relevant division of the UPC.

Contracting member states may also designate one of the official languages of the EPO (i.e., English, French or German) in addition to, or instead of, the official language of the contracting member state hosting the division.

Alternatively, the language in which the patent was granted may be used if agreed to by the parties, or on the basis of fairness and the circumstances of the case, the judges so decide with the consent of the parties.

As most patents subject to the UPC will be available in English, it is likely that English will be the predominant language used.

What powers will the UPC have?

Court experts: In addition to hearing party-appointed experts, the UPC will have the power to appoint a court expert to resolve specific technical or other questions in relation to the cases before it.

Disclosure and information: The UPC will have the power to order parties and third parties to provide specified evidence and information, and to seek the assistance of non-EU courts to obtain documents or testimony.

Saisie-contrefaon (proof of the infringement): The UPC will be able to make an order to preserve evidence by allowing court officials to gain access without notice to the business premises of the alleged infringer.

Freezing orders: The UPC may make a freezing order, requiring a party not to remove from its jurisdiction any assets located there or deal in any assets.

Provisional and protective measures: The UPC will have the power to grant provisional and protective measures against an alleged infringer, including injunctions, seizure and delivery up of products suspected of infringing a patent.

How much will it cost to issue proceedings at the UPC and what costs will be recoverable?

The cost of issuing proceedings will vary according to the type of action.

Infringement actions, counterclaims for infringement, actions for declaration of non-infringement and actions for compensation for license of a right will cost a fixed fee of 11,000 , and applications to determine damages will cost 3,000 ."
Cooley,A Guide to the Unitary Patent System and Unified Patent Court,"Where the value of the action is over 500,000 , there will be an additional value-based fee, calculated as set out in the relevant rules.

For all other procedures and actions before the Court of First Instance, the fees are set out at Section III of the rules.

For appeals and applications before the Court of Appeal, the fees are set out at Section IV of the rules.

A link to a copy of the rules and their annexes is included below.

2

A successful party will be entitled to recover reasonable and proportionate costs.

A ceiling is set on recoverable costs, which is subject to the value of the claim.

The scale of ceilings for recoverable costs is set out in the annex to the rules.

The maximum award of recoverable costs is 2 million for a case valued at more than 50 million .

For particularly complex cases, the ceiling may be raised but cannot exceed a maximum of 5 million .

The court has discretion, on request of a party, to lower the ceiling if the amount of recoverable costs would threaten the economic viability of the requesting party, particularly if that party is a university, nonprofit organisation, public research organisation or natural person.

Notes These are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, and Sweden.

The following countries are likely to be covered by the unitary patent in the future: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Considered Pay-Versus-Performance Disclosure Rule,"Background On August 25, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted pay-versus-performance rules (codified in Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K), 12 years after the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) imposed on the SEC the obligation to craft such rules, and seven years after the SEC first proposed rules for this disclosure.

Final rules Pay-versus-performance table

The final rules require covered companies to provide the information set forth in the table below (the pay-versus-performance table).

The asterisks indicate items from which smaller reporting companies (SRCs) are exempt.

Year Summary Compensation Table Total for PEO Compensation Actually Paid to PEO Average Summary Compensation Table Total for Non-PEO NEOs Average Compensation Actually Paid to Non-PEO NEOs Value of Initial Fixed $100 Investment Based On: Net Income [Company-Selected Measure]*

Y5* Time period covered Covered companies must comply with the final rules in proxies and information statements covering fiscal years ending on or after December 16, 2022.

The final rules require inclusion of the pay-versus-performance disclosure for each of the companys five most recently completed fiscal years (three years for SRCs ).

In the first year of disclosure, non-SRC covered companies are only required to provide disclosure for three years ( two years for SRCs ) with an additional year added in each of the two subsequent years ( one subsequent year for SRCs ).

Summary compensation table totals For each covered fiscal year, the pay-versus-performance disclosure must include the total compensation as reported in the companys Summary Compensation Table (SCT) for the principal executive officer (PEO) and as an average for the other named executive officers (NEOs).

Compensation actually paid The pay-versus-performance disclosure must include compensation actually paid to the PEO and as an average to the other NEOs.

Compensation actually paid is not the same as compensation realized or received and is calculated using a prescribed formula.

The formula is based on the total compensation measure included in the SCT, with adjustments to the amounts disclosed for equity awards and pension benefits, as summarized below.

These adjustments must be disclosed in footnotes to the columns showing compensation actually paid.

Companies will also be required to disclose in footnotes any valuation assumptions that are materially different from those disclosed at the time of grant of such equity awards.

SRCs are not required to disclose amounts related to pension benefits for purposes of calculating compensation actually paid.

Compensation actually paid must be calculated in accordance with the following steps: Step 1: Start with the SCT total value for the applicable year.

Step 2: Make the following adjustments with respect to amounts reported in the SCT for equity awards and pension benefits.

Equity Awards Deduct the amounts reported in the SCT for equity awards For awards granted in the covered fiscal year :"
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Considered Pay-Versus-Performance Disclosure Rule,"Equity Awards Deduct the amounts reported in the SCT for equity awards For awards granted in the covered fiscal year :

Add the year-end fair value if the award is outstanding and unvested as of the end of the covered fiscal year; Add the fair value as of the vesting date for awards that vested during the covered fiscal year; and Ignore any such awards that were forfeited or determined to be ineligible to vest during the covered fiscal year For awards granted in prior years : Add or subtract any change in fair value as of the end of the covered      fiscal year (compared to the end of the prior fiscal year) if the award is      outstanding and unvested as of the end of the covered fiscal year; Add or subtract any change in fair value as of the vesting date (compared to the end of the prior fiscal year) if the award vested during the covered fiscal year; and Subtract the amount equal to the fair value at the end of the prior fiscal year if the award was forfeited during the covered fiscal year Add the dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid on equity awards in the covered fiscal year prior to the vesting date Pension Benefits Subtract the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of all defined benefit and actuarial pension plans Add the following two components: Service cost (i.e., the actuarially determined service cost for services rendered by the executive during the applicable year), calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); and Prior service cost (i.e., the entire cost of benefits granted in a plan amendment (or initial plan adoption) during the covered fiscal year that are attributed by the benefit formula to services rendered in periods prior to the plan amendment or adoption), calculated in accordance with GAAP; if the prior service cost is a negative amount as a result of an amendment that reduces benefits relating to prior periods of service, then such amount would reduce the compensation actually paid Action items Coordinate efforts as soon as possible (i.e., well ahead   of the usual proxy filing preparation timeline) with key company departments   (e.g., finance/accounting, legal, human resources, investor relations, public   relations) and outside advisers (e.g., compensation consultant, valuation   expert and legal counsel); this calculation is likely to be very   time-intensive, particularly with respect to stock options and market-based   performance awards.

Ensure the company is well-versed in calculating the fair   value of stock awards and stock options on an ongoing basis after the grant   date, and begin building these recalculations into the end-of-year process,   to the extent not already done.

Note that compensation actually paid is NOT equivalent   to realized pay, though companies should consider whether it is helpful to   add voluntary disclosure addressing the connection between realized or   realizable pay and performance.

Financial performance metrics Total shareholder return.

Covered companies must include (1)the value of a fixed investment of $100 scaled by cumulative TSR for the company (calculated in the same manner as in the stock performance graph required under Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K), and (2)the value of a fixed investment of $100 scaled by cumulative TSR for the companys peer group (using either the same peer group used for the performance graph (Item 201(e)) or as set forth in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A)).

Changes to the peer group used in a prior fiscal year must be explained in a footnote, including the reason for the change and a comparison of the companys TSR to both the old and new peer groups."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Considered Pay-Versus-Performance Disclosure Rule,"Changes to the peer group used in a prior fiscal year must be explained in a footnote, including the reason for the change and a comparison of the companys TSR to both the old and new peer groups.

For each fiscal year in the table, the amount included for the company and its peer group should be the cumulative TSR as of the end of that year, which means that the measurement period would begin with the market close on the last trading day before the earliest fiscal year in the table, through and including the end of the companys last completed fiscal year.

Net income .

Covered companies must include their net income for each covered fiscal year, calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Company-selected measure .

Covered companies must disclose a financial performance measure chosen by the company as the most important financial measure it uses to link compensation actually paid to company performance for the most recently completed fiscal year.

The measure is not required to be reported in the companys financial statements; however, similar to disclosure of non-GAAP target levels in the CD&A, if the company-selected measure is a non-GAAP financial measure, the company must disclose how the number is calculated from audited financial statements.

Companies that do not use any financial performance measures to link executive compensation actually paid to performance, or that only use measures already required to be disclosed in the table (i.e., TSR and net income), are not required to disclose a company-selected measure or its relationship to executive compensation actually paid.

Action items Carefully determine the companys peer group with input   from the compensation committees independent compensation consultant, as any   changes to the peer group will impact the TSR reporting requirements.

Prepare an initial draft of the pay-versus-performance   table to determine (1)how executive compensation actually paid to the   NEOs will be viewed when compared to the TSR and other required performance   measures, and (2)whether it would be appropriate to include any   voluntary additional measures in the required table.

Narrative and/or graphical disclosure using the pay-versus-performance table Following the pay-versus-performance table, the rules also require a clear description, in narrative or graphical form (or both), of (1)the relationship between compensation actually paid to the companys NEOs as shown in the table and the companys financial performance measures included in the table, and (2)the relationship between the companys TSR and the TSR of the peer group.

In addition, companies that elect to provide additional voluntary performance measures in the pay-versus-performance table must also include a description of the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and each such performance measure across all covered fiscal years.

Action item Determine the most appropriate format for the relationship disclosure, ensuring that it is consistent with CD&A disclosure.

Tabular list of most important performance measures In addition to the tabular disclosure discussed above, the final rules require covered companies (other than SRCs) to disclose an unranked list of three to seven of the companys most important financial performance measures used by the company to link executive compensation actually paid to company performance for the most recently completed fiscal year (the Tabular List).

The Tabular List must include the company-selected measure.

Companies will be permitted to include non-financial performance measures in this list if they are among the companys most important performance measures, but only if the company discloses at least three financial measures (or fewer if the company only uses fewer, which is permitted if all are listed), and would still be subject to a maximum of seven performance measures."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Considered Pay-Versus-Performance Disclosure Rule,"Companies that do not use any financial performance measures to link executive compensation actually paid to company performance would not be required to present a Tabular List.

Companies have the option to disclose this list in three different ways: in one list with at least three and up to seven performance measures in two separate lists, one for the PEO and one for the remaining NEOs in separate lists for the PEO and each NEO

If the company elects to provide separate lists, each list must include three and up to seven performance measures, subject to exception for companies using fewer measures.

Action items Consider the most important performance measures for   the Tabular List, including the company-selected measure; compensation   consultant input will be vital.

Consider whether these measures will differ from measures   that are expected to be disclosed in the CD&A and whether additional   narrative disclosure would be helpful in explaining the selected measures or   in justifying executive compensation decisions in the CD&A (including, for example, disclosures regarding realized or realizable pay versus performance).

Additional considerations Location of disclosure.

The final rules provide companies with flexibility in determining where in the proxy or information statement to provide the required disclosure.

Companies may choose to cross-reference other disclosures describing the companys processes and calculations for determining executive compensation included elsewhere in the applicable filing.

Inline XBRL.

Consistent with other recent disclosure rules proposed and adopted by the SEC, the final rules require companies to separately tag each amount disclosed in the pay-versus-performance table, block-text tag the footnote and relationship disclosure, and tag specific quantitative data points within the footnote disclosures, all in Inline XBRL.

SRCs only have to provide the required Inline XBRL data beginning with the third filing in which they provide the pay-versus-performance disclosure.

Action items Determine placement of the pay-versus-performance table,   which we expect will generally be outside of the CD&A, unless the   compensation committee used the underlying information in making executive   compensation decisions.

Note that tagging will result in increasing the   accessibility of the data required by the final rules, so it is likely to be   considered by institutional investors and proxy advisory firms, though the   impact is still yet to be seen.

Final takeaways Companies   should start preparing for the required disclosures now .

With the   final rules applying as soon as the 2023 proxy season, we recommend beginning   to consider and gather the information that will be needed to comply with the   requirements in the rule, especially because this is a data-heavy requirement,   and disclosure will be required for fiscal years prior to 2022.

Create a team of key members of the companys human resources, accounting and finance, legal, investor relations and corporate communications departments and engage early and often with the companys compensation committee and outside compensation, valuation and legal advisers to ensure all are aligned on the   steps necessary to comply with the final rules and coordinate efforts prior   to the start of the 2023 proxy season.

Keep in mind that the final rules are focused on compensation actually paid, which does not generally align with the way compensation committees determine executive compensation at the start of a fiscal year and is not the same as realized pay.

The pay-versus-performance table and the other required disclosures may   not capture the design considerations taken into account when executive compensation is awarded."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Long-Considered Pay-Versus-Performance Disclosure Rule,"The pay-versus-performance table and the other required disclosures may   not capture the design considerations taken into account when executive compensation is awarded.

Clear and thoughtful CD&A disclosure will be especially important in the 2023 proxy statement in the event there are apparent discrepancies between information disclosed in the CD&A and the pay-versus-performance disclosure ."
Cooley,Colorado Expands Notice Requirements for Employees Upon Termination,"When a Colorado employees employment terminates for any reason, employers are required to provide certain information to the employee regarding unemployment insurance benefits.

Colorado expanded employers notice requirements under Senate Bill 22-234 , which was passed on May 25, 2022.

Employers now must include the following information in a notice of unemployment insurance benefits form upon termination: The employers name and address.

The employees name and address.

The employees identification number or the last four numbers of the employees Social Security number.

The employees start date and the date of the employees last day worked.

The employees year-to-date earnings and wages for the last week worked.

The reason the employee separated from the employer.

This information must be included in addition to the information employers already were required to provide to Colorado employees in the unemployment insurance notice, including a statement that unemployment insurance benefits are available to unemployed workers who meet state-enacted criteria, contact information for unemployed workers to file a claim, information needed to file a claim, and contact information to inquire about the status of a claim after it is filed.

Next steps The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment is expected to provide a revised notice form soon.

We also anticipate additional guidance on the level of detail required when listing the reason for an employees separation.

In the interim, Colorado employers should review their separation procedures and update their required notices to include the additional requirements listed above.

Cooley,"Florida Temporarily Blocked From Enforcing Individual Freedom Act, but Employers Should Proceed With Caution","On August 18, 2022, the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida temporarily blocked enforcement of the Individual Freedom Act (IFA), also known as the Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees (WOKE) Act, against employers by the Florida Commission on Human Relations and the Florida attorney general.

We reported on the IFAs broad scope in a previous client alert .

In the matter of Honeyfund.com Inc. v. Ron DeSantis, et al. , No. 4:22-cv-00227 (N.D. Fla. Aug. 18, 2022), the court ruled that the IFA violates the First Amendment because it is not sufficiently narrowly tailored and is impermissibly vague as to violate the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.

The court also denied a stay of the injunction pending a likely appeal by the state, so the injunction remains in place for the foreseeable future.

However, employers should be aware that the injunction does not prohibit individuals, such as purportedly aggrieved employees, from bringing a private cause of action.

Cooley will continue to follow updates to the IFA.

Cooley,ISS Opens Survey for 2023 Policy Changes; Glass Lewis Seeks Informal Feedback,"ISS Policy Survey Toward the end of each year, Institutional Shareholder Services updates its proxy vote recommendation policies for meetings held on or after February1 of the following year.

As part of that process, ISS collects information from institutional shareholders, corporate issuers, corporate directors and other market constituents in the form of an annual survey.

The survey questions provide a first look at certain policies that ISS is considering changing or adopting (though of course not all of the questions become policy updates, and there are typically policy updates not mentioned in the survey).

The response deadline for this years ISS survey is Wednesday, August31, at 5:00pm EDT .

We recommend that issuers and other interested parties respond to the survey, so their feedback will be incorporated into the policy development process.

Items in the survey that we found especially interesting for US issuers are outlined below.

Governance-related questions Sunset for governance structures ISS finds problematic In 2020, ISS updated its voting policy regarding newly public companies with problematic capital structures to indicate that no sunset of greater than seven years from the date of the IPO would be considered reasonable.

ISS is now seeking input on what the appropriate sunset period is for the other governance structures it finds problematic (i.e., classified board and/or supermajority voting requirements).

The answer choices to the survey question suggest that ISS is trying to determine whether respondents view seven years or a lesser period as a reasonable sunset for these other governance structures.

ISS also is seeking input on whether smaller companies should be exempted from the sunset period for classified boards and supermajority vote requirements and, if so, which companies should be considered sufficiently small enough to warrant such an exemption (i.e., companies outside the Russell 3000, S&P 1500 or S&P 500).

Supermajority voting threshold Under its current policy, ISS considers any vote requirement that requires more than a majority of the outstanding shares to amend a companys governing documents as a problematic governance practice.

However, ISS recognizes that a supermajority vote requirement set at two-thirds of the shares outstanding is easier to achieve or eliminate as the shareholder base evolves than a supermajority vote requirement set at a higher level (e.g., 75%, 80% or 85%).

The survey question suggests that ISS is considering whether a supermajority vote requirement that requires only two-thirds of the shares outstanding should be considered acceptable.

Unequal voting rights Pursuant to a policy adopted in 2021, starting in 2023 ISS will recommend against directors atallcompanies with governance structures that provide their shareholders with unequal voting rights, whether newly public (unless the provision will sunset no more than seven years from the date of the initial public offering) or mature.

ISS plans to apply a de minimis exception to this policy in cases where the capital structure is not deemed to meaningfully disenfranchise public shareholders (e.g., where most of the super-voting shares have already been converted into regular common shares).

The survey asks respondents what percentage of the total voting power held by owners of the super-voting shares should be considered de minimis and what other relevant factors should be considered to exempt companies from this policy.

ISS also is seeking input on which directors are the appropriate targets for adverse recommendations due to the presence of a capital structure with unequal voting rights.

The survey question offers a range of responses from all directors to only the directors who hold super-voting shares."
Cooley,ISS Opens Survey for 2023 Policy Changes; Glass Lewis Seeks Informal Feedback,"The survey question offers a range of responses from all directors to only the directors who hold super-voting shares.

In addition, in the instance where public shareholders do not have the ability to vote on certain directors, ISS is seeking input on whether adverse votes against the limited number of independent directors as a protest for multiclass structure should be considered appropriate.

Shareholder proposals calling for third-party racial equity or civil rights audits ISS notes that in response to racial justice protests, shareholders have increased engagement with companies on issues of diversity and racial equity, including seeking better disclosure on representation in the workforce, and information about corporate programs for employees of color.

As a result, in 2021 ISS reviewed its policy regarding assessing proposals calling for racial equity and/or civil rights audits, and adopted a new policy in 2022.

The new policy implements a case-by-case approach of evaluating the relevant facts and circumstances relating to the companys disclosure and performance in the area of racial equity and/or civil rights.

The survey questions suggest that ISS is trying to further refine its case-by-case approach by better understanding how respondents view these audits and which factors respondents consider relevant to determine when a company may benefit from such an audit.

Capitalization-related questions Share issuance mandates at cross-market companies under ISS US coverage US-listed companies incorporated in certain other markets (e.g., the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands) may be required by the laws of the country of incorporation to seek approval for all share issuances, even where such approval is not required by applicable listing rules.

ISS is seeking input on whether it should continue to evaluate these proposals under the policy of the market of incorporation, which is generally based on local codes of best practice that may not otherwise be applicable to companies without a local stock market listing, or whether it should develop a new policy for share issuance mandates at cross-market companies.

The survey questions suggest that ISS is trying to determine the scope and application of a new policy, including the level of dilution that would be considered acceptable for issuances without preemptive rights, the frequency with which companies should seek shareholder approval for share issuance mandates, and whether the same policy should apply to US domestic issuers listed solely in the United States, dual-listed companies and foreign private issuers.

Climate-related questions ISS added new policy recommendations in 2022 regarding say-on-climate proposals in response to the increased presence of these proposals since 2020.

Its policy currently calls for a vote on a case-by-case basis based on a number of factors.

Questions in the survey suggest that ISS is trying to determine which factors are the most important to investors when it comes to the minimum criteria needed for approval of a management-proposed climate transition plan .

The range of answers is varied and includes a fill-in-the-blank response option.

ISS 2022 voting guidelines currently recommend a vote on a case-by-case basis for management say-on-climate proposals.

The surveys questions indicate that ISS is looking to form a firmer policy recommendation and to decide whether to change its vote recommendation from a case-by-case basis to a vote for climate transition plan proposals.

Other questions in the survey relate to climate board accountability and critical audit matters policies in the worlds largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters (currently, the Climate Action 100+ focus group), and financed emissions for large companies in the banking and insurance sectors."
Cooley,ISS Opens Survey for 2023 Policy Changes; Glass Lewis Seeks Informal Feedback,"The survey questions suggest that ISS is still considering what rises to the level of material governance failures for the largest GHG emitters that would warrant a recommendation against a director or group of directors for its climate board accountability policy.

The range of answers spans lack of disclosures, absence of a statement of ambition to align with the Paris Agreement, unrealistic GHG emissions targets (i.e., realistic targets do not rely on technologies that are not yet commercially available and are not overly reliant on offsets), and evidence of past poor GHG emissions performance and trajectory.

Questions regarding critical audit matters/key audit matters could be part of ISS effort to fulfill its promise to provide additional data to support its current policy that recommends against incumbent directors of the largest GHG emitters in cases where the company is not adequately disclosing climate risk and does not have quantitative GHG emission reduction targets covering a significant portion of the companys direct emissions.

A question in the survey about financed emissions suggests that ISS is trying to better understand investors expectations around large companies in the banking and insurance sectors regarding their lending, investment and underwriting activities with companies (or projects) significantly contributing to GHG emissions, and also gauge the trajectory of investors expectations on climate-related disclosure and performance over time.

With respect to investors expected actions on financed emissions, survey answers range from doing nothing to requiring disclosure of directly or indirectly financed emissions, setting emissions targets, or committing to cease financing or underwriting new emissions altogether.

Glass Lewis informal feedback As in prior years, Glass Lewis employs a less formal feedback process from market participants on its voting policies , inviting parties to submit feedback on its guidelines by emailing guidelinescomments@glasslewis.com .

Glass Lewis recommends submitting any feedback by Thursday, September 15 ,to ensure sufficient time for review as part of the 2022  2023 round of policy guideline updates.

We expect Glass Lewis, like ISS, to publish its updated policy voting guidelines before the end of the year.

As a refresher, Glass Lewis updates for 2022 were focused on (among other topics): Board diversity Glass Lewis generally recommends voting against the nominating committee chair of a board with fewer than two gender-diverse directors for Russell 3000 companies and with no gender-diverse directors for other companies.

Glass Lewis generally recommends compliance with state law board composition requirements.

Starting in 2023, Glass Lewis will generally recommend voting against the nominating committee chair of a Russell 3000 board with less than 30% gender diversity and of an S&P 500 board with no disclosure of individual or aggregate racial/ethnic minority board demographic information.

Enhanced board diversity disclosure Glass Lewis may recommend against nominating chair if S&P 500 company fails to include adequate gender and racial/ethnic disclosure.

Environmental and social risk oversight While Glass Lewis maintains no specific policy on environmental and social risk oversight and reviews on a case-by-case basis, its 2022 policies stress the importance of adequate disclosure regarding material risk factors through the lens of long-term shareholder value and board involvement in risk oversight."
Cooley,CFPB Asserts New Authority Over Data Security&nbsp;Practices,"On August 11, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a Consumer Financial Protection Circular taking the position that providing [i]nadequate security for the sensitive consumer information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by  [a] company can constitute an unfair practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA).

1

Because insufficient data security is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition, 2 the CFPB considers this to be an unfair practice  even in the absence of a data breach.

CFPB asserts expanded authority for information security Financial institutions that provide services to consumers are subject to the requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

The GLBA requires covered financial institutions and service providers to maintain an information security program with several specific requirements, such as imposing limitations on who can access customer information, requiring the use of encryption to secure information, and requiring the designation of a single qualified individual to oversee an institutions information security program (the Safeguards Rule).

The GLBAs Safeguards Rule is implemented by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

3

In the August 11 circular, the CFPB asserts that information security programs are also subject to CFPB oversight, as maintaining adequate consumer data protections would be required to comply with the CFPAs prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP).

An unfair act or practice is one that: Causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers.

Is not reasonably avoidable by consumers.

Is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

4

The CFPB enumerates several instances where inadequate data security practices are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, including through data breaches, cyberattacks, exploits, ransomware attacks and other exposure of consumer data.

5 Such harms are not reasonably avoidable to consumers, as information security programs are controlled or implemented by the financial institution, and the consumer has little say over these programs.

The CFPB also notes that in conducting the balancing test required by the third UDAAP prong, it expects that the risk of substantial injury to consumers will outweigh any benefits to consumers or competition through cost savings.

Further, the CFPB attempts to support its conclusion through a review of caselaw that identified instances in which data management practices were evaluated in reference to the FTCs prohibition on unfair acts or practices.

For example, in 2006, the FTC sued an online check processor alleging that it was an unfair practice to create and deliver checks without properly verifying that the person requesting the check was authorized to draw on the associated bank account.

6

The court concluded that failing to conduct adequate identity verification indeed violated the FTC Acts UDAAP provision.

In 2012, the FTC sued several associated entities for failing to use appropriate measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access.

7

In that case, a court confirmed that the FTC had the authority under the FTC Act to regulate cybersecurity as a potentially unfair act.

The CFPB also outlined actionable steps financial institutions can take to protect consumer data, including: Implementing multi-factor authentication.

Creating password management policies and procedures.

Providing timely software updates.

Renewed focus on data privacy?

In 2016, the CFPB issued a consent order against a payment processor alleging that the company had engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA relating to false representations made regarding the companys data security practices."
Cooley,CFPB Asserts New Authority Over Data Security&nbsp;Practices,"In that instance, the CFPBs decision to issue the consent order was connected in large part to the fact that the company had represented to consumers that the company employed reasonable and appropriate measures to protect consumer data from unauthorized access.

But the consent order identified several elements of the companys data security program that belied this representation, including that the company failed to: Use appropriate measures to identify reasonably foreseeable security risks.

Provide adequate employee training.

Use encryption technologies.

In many ways, the recent circular revives UDAAP as a tool previously used by the CFPB to require enhanced consumer protections related to the offering and provision of financial services.

That said, the 2016 consent order focused on affirmative representations the company had made to consumers.

The August 11 circular thus goes further in arguing that a lack of adequate data security measures can constitute a UDAAP violation independent of any representations made by a covered entity.

Jurisdictional questions The circular also creates several jurisdictional questions regarding oversight of the data security practices of consumer financial institutions.

As acknowledged in the circular, the CFPB believes that a covered entitys insufficient data protection or information security practices could both trigger UDAAP liability under the CFPA and violate the GLBA Safeguards Rule.

Conversely, it is less clear whether there are instances in which information security practices could be considered an unfair act or practice, but not a violation of the Safeguards Rule (or vice versa).

It also appears that the CFPB and FTC could be taking a collaborative approach to the protection of consumer data held by financial institutions.

On the same day that the CFPB issued its circular, the FTC announced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) seeking public comment on commercial surveillance practices.

While the ANPR did not specifically address the role of financial institutions in consumer data collection, it is clear that financial institutions that collect, store and transmit sensitive consumer data should take steps to ensure proper data integrity and security policies and procedures are in place, as these issues appear to be key initiatives for both agencies.

Notes 12 US Code  5536(a)(1)(B).

12 USC  5531.

The GLBA also includes privacy protections that require financial institutions to provide customers with initial and annual privacy notices, and limit the circumstances under which a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about a customer or consumer.

The Privacy Rule is implemented by the CFPB through Regulation P. Id.

Actual injury is not required to satisfy this prong.

Cooley,"District of Columbia’s Scaled-Back Non-Compete Ban Takes Effect October 1, 2022","On July 27, 2022, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser signed into law long-debated amendments to the Ban on Non-Compete Agreements Amendment Act of 2020.

The Non-Compete Clarification Amendment Act of 2022 scales back many of the broad restrictions on non-compete agreements in the original bill, the effective date of which was delayed due to business community opposition.

The amended act will go into effect on October 1, 2022 , barring any unlikely congressional action during the mandatory review period.

As we explained in our February 2021 and April 2022 client alerts, DCs original non-compete bill would have constituted one of the broadest statutory bans on non-compete agreements in the US.

As initially signed, it would have prohibited the use and enforcement of non-compete agreements for virtually all employees working in DC.

The original bill also banned anti-moonlighting policies, including policies that prohibited employees from operating their own businesses while working for an employer, and prohibited competitive activities outside employment.

The new amendment scales back several of these restrictions, including limiting non-compete agreements to highly compensated employees, clarifying protections for employers confidential and proprietary information, and permitting certain anti-moonlighting restrictions.

Key provisions of the amendment New definition of non-compete provision The amendment now defines a non-compete provision as a provision in a written agreement or a workplace policy that prohibits an employee from performing work for another  or from operating the employees own business.

The amendment clarifies that it does not limit an employers ability to, among other things: Restrict or prohibit employees from [d]isclosing, using, selling, or accessing the employers confidential employer information or proprietary employer information.

Restrict or prohibit employees from concurrently working for another entity because the employer believes it could result in disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or otherwise pose a conflict of interest.

It also permits otherwise lawful non-compete provisions to be included in long-term incentive plans, which include bonuses, equity compensation and stock options typically earned over more than one year.

In light of this revised definition, employers will be permitted to maintain workplace policies and anti-moonlighting restrictions that prohibit outside, simultaneous employment or business activity as long as such restrictions only cover activities that conflict with the employers, industrys or professions established rules regarding conflicts of interest, or result in disclosure of confidential or proprietary information.

Notably, the amendment is silent regarding whether employers in DC can continue to restrict post-termination solicitation of their customers, consultants, employees or contractors, and therefore appears to continue to permit such restrictions.

Non-compete compensation threshold

In line with other jurisdictions, such as Colorado and Washington state , DC will now permit non-compete agreements only for highly compensated employees who make at least $150,000 per year , with limited exceptions.

Compensation is broadly defined to include hourly wages, salary, bonuses or cash incentives, commissions, overtime premiums, vested stock, and other payments provided on a regular or irregular basis.

The $150,000 threshold will increase beginning in 2024 in accordance with the Department of Labors Consumer Price Index."
Cooley,"District of Columbia’s Scaled-Back Non-Compete Ban Takes Effect October 1, 2022","The $150,000 threshold will increase beginning in 2024 in accordance with the Department of Labors Consumer Price Index.

Non-compete ban still applies to covered non-highly compensated employees Subject to limited exceptions, the amendment still bans non-compete agreements for all other non-highly compensated employees who either spend (or are anticipated to spend) more than half of their work time working in DC or  if their employment is based in DC  regularly spend a substantial amount of work time in DC and not more than half their time in another jurisdiction.

Notice and other requirements The amendment also imposes several other requirements upon employers who intend to present non-compete agreements to highly compensated employees.

Effective October 1, employers must: Specify in the non-compete agreement the services, roles, industry or competing entities the employee is restricted from performing work for or in.

Specify in the non-compete agreement the geographical limitations of the restriction.

Restrict the non-compete agreement to a one-year term from the date of separation, with limited exceptions.

Provide the non-compete agreement to the employee in writing at least 14 days before commencing employment or the date the employee must execute the agreement.

Provide notice containing specific language that references the original bill and refers the worker to the DC Department of Employment Services for more information.

Employers must comply with an additional disclosure requirement if any workplace policy includes a provision that could be interpreted as a non-compete provision, such as a prohibition on moonlighting where it would, for example, result in the employees disclosure or use of the employers confidential or proprietary information or constitute a conflict of interest.

Employers must provide a written copy of the provision to all employees affected by that policy within 30 days after each employees acceptance of employment, within 30 days after October 1, 2022, and any time the policy changes.

Anti-retaliation protections The amendment reiterates that employees who inquire about, object to or even request a copy of their non-compete agreement are protected from retaliation.

Penalties and enforcement DCs mayor and attorney general are authorized to enforce the amended ban.

Employers in violation may be assessed administrative penalties of $350 to $1,000 for each violation and, for violations of the anti-retaliation provisions, penalties of at least $1,000.

Penalties increase with each subsequent violation.

An aggrieved employee also may pursue relief by filing a complaint with the mayor or filing a civil action.

Next steps for employers In advance of the October 1 effective date, employers with employees working in DC should review their non-compete agreements and employment policies and prepare to comply with the amendments requirements, which will apply to non-compete agreements entered into on or after October 1, 2022.

Employers should ensure that employees meet the applicable compensation threshold and analyze whether a particular non-highly compensated employee falls within the amendments definition of a covered employee.

Employers with moonlighting or outside activities policies also should prepare to comply with the amendments notice requirements.

In addition, employers should train relevant managers and human resources staff regarding the broad anti-retaliation provisions of the amendment.

Cooley,A Guide To Navigating Bankruptcy's Impact On IP Licenses,"Editor's note: Authored by Bob Eisenbach andEvan Lazerowitz, this article was originally published in Law360 .

With a potential recession on the horizon, licensees of intellectual property may increasingly find their licensors seeking protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

For many companies  particularly those in the life sciences and technology sectors  IP, including in-licensed IP, may be their most valuable asset.

It is therefore critical for IP licensors and licensees to understand how their licenses will be treated in bankruptcy and consider ways to protect their license rights should a bankruptcy be filed.

This article explores some of the significant issues left open by the U.S. Supreme Court's seminal 2019 decision in Mission Products Holdings Inc. v. Tempnology LLC,[1] holding that a debtor-licensor's rejection of an executory trademark license acts as a prepetition breach rather than as a rescission of the license.

The article also offers practical drafting considerations for licensors and licensees that may help address bankruptcy's impact on IP licenses.

The Bankruptcy Code's IP Licensee Protections Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that, notwithstanding a licensor's rejection of an executory contract containing an IP license, the licensee can elect either to treat the contract as terminated by the rejection or to retain its IP rights and continue to use the IP for the remainder of the term of the contract.[2] Section 365(n), however, is subject to one important limitation: It only applies to IP as specifically defined in Section 101(35A) of the Bankruptcy Code.[3]

That definition is limited to: A trade secret; An invention, process, design or plant protected under Title 35; A patent application; A plant variety; A work of authorship protected under Title 17; and A mask work protected under Chapter 9 of Title 17.

While many would expect trademarks to be included, U.S. Congress intentionally left trademarks out of the Bankruptcy Code's definition of IP.

There are also questions about the extent of protection for foreign patents and possibly other types of IP.

The Supreme Court's Tempnology Decision The issue of whether trademarks are protected from the effects of rejection in bankruptcy was the subject of extensive court decisions until ultimately being decided by the Supreme Court in Tempnology.

Because Section 101(35A) of the Bankruptcy Code does not mention trademarks, the federal courts of appeal had split over whether rejection of a trademark license terminated the trademark licensee's rights.

In Tempnology, the Supreme Court squarely held that, under Section 365(g),[4] a debtor-licensor's rejection of an executory trademark license acts only as a prepetition breach and not as a rescission of the license, and that the licensee retains whatever rights it had under the trademark license agreement prior to breach.[5]

In a two-page concurring opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote separately ""to highlight two potentially significant features"" of the Supreme Court's holding, both of which raise questions that practitioners should carefully consider.

First, Justice Sotomayor stated that ""the Court does not decide that every trademark licensee has the unfettered right to continue using licensed marks postrejection.""

The ""baseline inquiry remains whether the licensee's rights would survive a breach under applicable nonbankruptcy law,"" and she posited that ""[s]pecial terms in a licensing contract or state law could bear on that question"" in particular cases.[6]

Second, Justice Sotomayor wrote: The Court's holding confirms that trademark licensees' postrejection rights and remedies are more expansive in some respects that those possessed by licensees of other types of intellectual property."
Cooley,A Guide To Navigating Bankruptcy's Impact On IP Licenses,"Those variances stem from [Section] 365(n), one of several subject-specific provisions in the Bankruptcy Code that ""embellis[h] on or twea[k]"" the general rejection rule.[7] After describing Section 365(n)'s provisions that require royalty payments to be made and preclude offsetting damages against those payments, Justice Sotomayor stated, ""[t]his provision and others in [Section] 365(n) mean that the covered intellectual property types are governed by different rules than trademark licenses,"" and noted that these ""differences may prove significant for individual licensors and licensees"" but do not alter the outcome in the Tempnology case.[8] Where Does Tempnology Leave Licensors and Licensees?

Although Tempnology held that rejection does not terminate a trademark license, it left unresolved several issues important to licensors and licensees.

These include the licensee's rights and obligations after a trademark license is rejected, and whether Tempnology's reasoning applies to other types of intellectual property not covered by Sections 101(35A) and 365(n).

In enacting Section 365(n), Congress provided a relatively clear set of rules governing the rights and obligations of a licensee that elects to retain its license rights after rejection.

Specifically, the licensee retains its IP rights for both the term of the license and any extensions as of right, explicitly retains the right to enforce any exclusivity provisions in the license agreement and, to the extent provided in the license agreement or an agreement supplementary to the license, the right to request to receive the embodiment of the IP.

In return, the licensee must continue to make all required royalty payments due under the license agreement and waive the right to setoff and to any administrative claims based on the licensor's breach.[9] Since Section 365(n) does not apply to trademarks, there are no such statutory rules in place for the post-rejection rights of a licensee of a trademark or of any other type of IP not covered under Section 101(35A).

Instead, as the Tempnology majority opinion held, after rejection ""the licensee can continue to do whatever the license authorizes.

""[10]

As a result, the key to understanding where Tempnology leaves licensees  and licensors and their bankruptcy estates  after rejection is the terms of the license agreement itself.

Put differently, Tempnology merely confirmed that rejection does not terminate a trademark licensee's rights; it did not answer the important question of what happens after rejection.

Practical Drafting Considerations After Tempnology Given the Tempnology court's determination that the licensee's rights after rejection will be governed by whatever the license authorizes, practitioners drafting licenses of trademarks  and potentially licenses of other IP not covered by Sections 101(35A) and 365(n)  should carefully consider how the license agreement treats the licensee's rights, and obligations, after breach by the licensor.

This is of special concern in the trademark arena.

In rejecting a trademark license, the trademark owner  or its bankruptcy trustee should the case start or end up in Chapter 7  is expressly rejecting the licensor's obligations to continue to perform.

In light of the consumer protection and quality signifier functions of trademarks, the trademark owner's failure to perform could have significant consequences for the licensee.

Among the typical license obligations of a trademark owner are maintaining quality control over the mark, reviewing and approving new trademarked products that the licensee may be licensed to introduce to the market and, in some instances, supplying goods to the licensee that the licensor was obligated to manufacture.

Without such performance, the trademark licensee could find itself with materially different rights after rejection.

In a post-Tempnology world, the terms of the license will likely govern the parties' post-rejection relationship."
Cooley,A Guide To Navigating Bankruptcy's Impact On IP Licenses,"In a post-Tempnology world, the terms of the license will likely govern the parties' post-rejection relationship.

As courts have yet to grapple with the consequences of rejection, parties negotiating trademark licenses should carefully weigh how to address these risks through inclusion of post-breach provisions in the license agreement, potentially including adjustments to royalty or other payments after rejection.

Here are some concepts and provisions to consider.

Delegate quality control rights to the trademark licensee or others.

Under trademark law, if a trademark owner fails to exercise control over the quality of trademarked goods, the trademark could end up abandoned.

Bankruptcy means there is a material risk that the trademark owner or licensor could cease operations, or otherwise fail to ensure quality control.

Parties drafting a trademark license agreement should consider specifying quality standards and, as part of a post-breach provision, assess whether the licensor's quality control obligations could be delegated to the licensee.

An exclusive licensee in particular may have the best incentive to maintain quality control.

Provide a mechanism for new product approval or other step-in rights.

The parties could specify that, after the licensor's breach, the licensee  or some other third party  would become responsible for new product approvals, using quality and other commercial standards set forth in the license agreement.

If other licensor obligations would remain unperformed after breach, provisions could be added to allow the licensee, perhaps in conjunction with other licensees of the same trademark where applicable, to step into the licensor's role in performing these functions.

Provide for alternatives to licensor-manufactured goods.

If the licensor is required to manufacture and provide licensed goods to the licensee to distribute or use, the parties should consider addressing what happens when the licensor fails to do so.

One approach would be another post-rejection step-in right, authorizing the licensee to contract with a third party to manufacture the goods or, if preferable, allow the licensee to manufacture the goods after rejection or other breach.

Contractually incorporate Section 365(n)'s core concepts.

Since Section 365(n)'s balancing of the licensee's rights and obligations are relatively clear under the statute, the parties to a trademark license could incorporate Section 365(n)'s key provisions directly into the trademark license agreement, adjusted as appropriate to address the impact of the licensor's nonperformance.

Address automatic stay considerations.

These step-in and related rights might be viewed as the licensee exercising control over the trademark.

Since the trademark would remain property of the bankruptcy estate, the licensee might consider requesting, as part of an order approving the rejection of the trademark license, that the automatic stay be lifted to permit the licensee to exercise all step-in and other rights in the license agreement.

Consider a post-rejection termination right for the licensor, despite Tempnology.

Although Tempnology held that rejection is breach and not rescission, the parties could contractually provide the licensor with a termination right, even if due to the licensor's breach by rejection in bankruptcy.

Potential licensees may find such a right unacceptable but Tempnology does not appear to prohibit such a termination right.

Include a wind-down period or other termination provisions.

The parties might also consider a provision implementing a wind-down period following rejection or other licensor breach, especially where the arrangement would become unworkable if the licensor filed bankruptcy or went out of business.

This could provide the licensee with license rights for a limited period of time to conclude the relationship, perhaps with reduced royalty or other financial obligations."
Cooley,A Guide To Navigating Bankruptcy's Impact On IP Licenses,"This could provide the licensee with license rights for a limited period of time to conclude the relationship, perhaps with reduced royalty or other financial obligations.

Tempnology's reasoning appears capable of extension outside the trademark area to other IP rights left unprotected by Sections 101(35A) and 365(n).

These could include foreign patents  at least to the extent not protected under Title 35  and perhaps data sets or other rights that may not be fully covered under the protections for trade secrets, patents or copyrights.

It stands to reason that since trademark licensees are protected from the consequences of rejection under Tempnology, licensees of other forms of intellectual property also outside of Section 101(35A)'s definition should be similarly protected to the extent the license authorizes those rights.

Parties drafting license agreements of such uncovered IP should likewise consider including provisions to address the post-rejection scenario.

Conclusion Tempnology was a watershed decision at the intersection of IP and bankruptcy law, but it left open a number of issues with significant potential consequences for licensors and licensees.

Through careful drafting of trademark and other IP license agreements, parties can help anticipate, and hopefully avoid, the most disruptive impacts of rejection in bankruptcy.

Cooley,Indemnity and Insurance: How Directors and Officers Can Enhance Their Protections,"Whether they are new executive leaders or longtime members of a corporate board, directors and officers should be considering two prongs of protection  a robust insurance program and a tailored indemnification agreement.

Directors and officers can face significant personal exposure whenever their company is involved in a dispute or investigation.

For example, for the past 10+ years, stockholder litigation has accompanied 80% to 90% of public M&A deals, in which stockholders assert breach of fiduciary duty claims or disclosure claims.

Ongoing market volatility and increased regulatory efforts add to the potential for exposure.

Prudent directors and officers  and any funds that place them on boards or in leadership positions  should avail themselves of all available legal protections in charter provisions, D&O insurance and indemnification agreements individualized to their needs.

In fact, looking to the company for indemnification vis--vis its charter provisions and indemnification agreements is generally the first line of defense.

As an initial point, individualized indemnification agreements offer several advantages over any indemnification provisions in organizational documents, as outlined below.

Easier enforcement Indemnification agreements may be more easily enforced by directors and officers because they are bilateral contracts reflecting bargained-for consideration in the form of an individuals agreement to accept or continue service with the company  and cannot be amended without the directors and officers consent.

Broader, more thorough protection Indemnification agreements also typically provide broader and more thorough protection of directors and officers indemnity rights than statutes and organizational documents.

A well-written indemnification agreement should include, for example: Definitions of key terms  Pay attention to terms that define the scope of indemnification, such as claims, proceedings, expenses and losses.

Outside directors and venture funds  

If applicable, include language that extends the indemnification and advancement rights provided to a venture funds designee (an outside director) to the venture capital fund appointing the director.

Advancement of defense costs  Advancement is not automatically mandatory, so a good agreement should specify that the company shall provide advancement.

The advancement language also should cover expenses incurred by the individual both as a current and a former director or officer.

Fees-on-fees  The agreement also may specifically provide for, or preclude, expenses incurred in successfully asserting a claim for indemnification or advancement under the agreement or the companys governing documents.

While it is routine for directors to be indemnified in suits brought by third parties, they are not necessarily entitled to indemnification for attorneys fees and costs should they need to sue the corporation to enforce their indemnification rights under an agreement, organizational document or applicable law.

An indemnification agreement can expressly provide the right to be indemnified in such fees-on-fees disputes.

Procedure for determination of entitlement and time frames  

The agreement should set forth a time frame for the determination of whether indemnity is owed and establish a means by which the indemnitee may appeal or contest the determination, as well as include procedures and deadlines.

This can be critical in moving the claim forward and providing clarity to the person seeking indemnification.

Priority  Often, a director or officer may have indemnification rights separate from those offered by the company, including from a private equity fund or other sponsor.

In this case, it is important for both parties to specify the relative priority of each indemnitor source in the event multiple parties are liable to the director or officer for indemnification.

Insurance"
Cooley,Indemnity and Insurance: How Directors and Officers Can Enhance Their Protections,"Insurance  

The indemnification agreement typically will require that the company provide D&O liability insurance that protects the indemnitee to the same extent as the most favorably insured of the companys and its affiliates current directors and officers.

D&O insurance filling in the gaps The next line of defense  D&O insurance  has terms that incorporate by reference the companys indemnification obligations and then serves to fill gaps where indemnification is not otherwise available to directors and officers (i.e., bankruptcy or derivative suits).

For those becoming a director or officer, the scope of the D&O policys protections should undergo an evaluation, in conjunction with an indemnification agreement.

In the event of a claim against a director and officer, the availability of relief and reimbursement should be evaluated under both the policy and the indemnification agreement to pursue all possible sources of recovery.

If you have questions about indemnification agreements, please reach out to Rachel Katz, Jacquelyn Burke or other members of the Cooley insurance group."
Cooley,Guidance Notes Offer Insight On UK National Security Regime,"Editor's note: Authored byChristine Graham, Caroline Hobson and Anna Caro,this article was originally published on Law360 .

On June 16, the U.K. government published its first annual report on the operation of the U.K. national security and investment regime.

Since then, on July 19, the U.K. government issued its long-awaited market guidance notes[1] on the National Security and Investment Act, which is based on an analysis of notifications received to date and feedback from stakeholders on their experiences of the regime.

The notes focus on whether commonly raised scenarios require mandatory notification, which has understandably tended to be the area of most interest.

Following on from the publication of the annual report, the notes add a greater level of transparency regarding the regime, providing welcome guidance to businesses and their legal advisers on submitting notifications, the types of acquisitions of control subject to mandatory notification and the disclosure and publication of information relating to the NSI Act.

As the notes were developed in part from feedback from stakeholders, they provide a valuable insight into the types of notifications and queries received by the U.K. government to date regarding the operation of the regime.

Summary of Main Points Addressed in the Notes Notifications For voluntary and mandatory notifications, the government has clarified that notifiers should provide as much detail as possible about the activities of the entity or asset in scope, make specific reference to the relevant sector definitions in the notifiable acquisition regulations[2] and avoid the use of technical language.

Structure charts are an important part of the notification form, and are needed for the government to fully understand the ownership structure of the entities and assets before and after the acquisition has been completed.

In particular, the notes clarify that it is important to include the ultimate controller of the acquirer to assist the government in deciding whether to make use of its call-in power.

Temporary Acquisitions of Control

The notes helpfully illustrate two scenarios in which the appointment of liquidators and receivers may require mandatory notification: If a liquidated entity has shares in a solvent entity, and the liquidator or receiver gains voting rights over those shares during the insolvency process and prior to the shares being sold, this constitutes an acquisition of control that may be notifiable if the other relevant tests are met.

If a director is declared bankrupt, and its shares in a solvent entity are transferred over to a trustee in bankruptcy during the insolvency process, this also is regarded as an acquisition of control that may be notifiable if the other relevant tests are met.

Granting Security Over Shares The notes clarify that the granting of share security is not a notifiable acquisition requiring mandatory notification, even if it involves an entity carrying on activities covered under the mandatory notification sectors.

This is because there is no acquisition of control being acquired.

This clarification is consistent with the response previously provided by the government in responding to a query raised by the City of London Law Society.[3]

However, and notwithstanding this clarification, the notes point out that, where legal title is transferred or control passes in some other way and the shares fall within the mandatory sectors, then a notifiable acquisition has taken place and must be notified.

Indirect Acquisitions of Control As set out under the NSI Act, it is possible for investors and other parties to acquire control indirectly over entities carrying on activities in one of the 17 specified sectors, and to fall in scope of the mandatory regime, where there is an unbroken chain of majority stakes all the way through to that entity of interest.

The notes provide some helpful examples of how this may happen in practice."
Cooley,Guidance Notes Offer Insight On UK National Security Regime,"The notes provide some helpful examples of how this may happen in practice.

Internal Reorganizations

The notes confirm that internal reorganizations also are in scope where they result in an acquisition of control over an entity, even if the ultimate beneficial owner remains the same.

Although that is a rare scenario, the notes explain that such reorganizations may raise national security risks, for example, by enabling a hostile actor to pursue malign actions over the entity.

Parties contemplating a restructure should be aware of the potential timing impact if a mandatory notification is required.

Voting Rights and Mandatory Notification The NSI Act captures the acquisition of voting rights that enable a person to secure or prevent the passage of any class of resolution governing the affairs of the target entity.

The notes confirm that contractual rights  e.g., rights in a shareholders' agreement  are not voting rights and will not trigger a mandatory notification, provided such contractual rights do not amount to control of such voting rights and do not enable the acquirer to secure or prevent the passage of all resolutions of a particular class.

It may be the case that contractual rights  either alone or together with other interests or rights  enable an acquirer to materially influence the policy of a company.

Such rights would still fall outside the mandatory regime, but may be subject to call-in by the U.K. government.

Publication of Information The notes explain that the government will not publish information regarding the receipt and acceptance or rejection of individual notifications, but it may choose to publish information regarding call-in notices or final notifications.

Where the government makes a proactive announcement, it will aim to provide advance notice to the parties.

Where a final order has been made, the government is required to publish notice of the order.

A recent example of this is the government's publication of its first final order prohibiting the licensing of vision-sensing technology[4] by the University of Manchester to Beijing Infinite Vision Technology Co. Ltd. Whitelist of Investors The notes clarify that the government is monitoring closely whether it would be appropriate to make exemptions from mandatory notification requirements based on the characteristics of the acquirer  i.e., a whitelist of investors  but there are currently no plans to exempt certain businesses and investors from the mandatory notification regime.

Other Guidance Updates On July 20, the government published new guidance on the applicability of the NSI Act to new-build downstream gas and electricity assets.[5]

The guidance is intended to assist developers of new-build downstream gas and electricity infrastructure to understand what types of assets and acquisitions in the sector are within the scope of the NSI Act, and when to submit a voluntary notification.

The guidance also provides specific examples of acquisitions in the sector that would be in scope of the NSI Act.

In addition, the government has updated its guidance on the notifiable acquisitions regulations[6] to clarify when an acquisition in the downstream oil sector will be subject to a mandatory notification under the NSI Act.

Outlook

This is the first set of notes to be published by the government since the NSI regime came into force on Jan. 4.

The notes and the additional guidance outlined above are welcome updates that provide more clarity, insight and certainty for businesses and their legal advisers on the U.K. government's approach to NSI notifications  and the overall operation of the NSI regime.

The government has welcomed suggestions for topics to include in future publications, with a further set of market guidance notes expected in early 2023.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – August One-Minute Reads,"SEC adopts final proxy voting advice rules On July 13, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had adopted final rules governing proxy voting advice that, among other things, rescind certain provisions it adopted in 2020 , which included conditions that proxy voting advice businesses (e.g., ISS and Glass Lewis) were to satisfy in order to rely on the exemptions from the proxy rules information and filing requirements.

The final rules rescind two of the conditions: That companies that are the subject of proxy voting advice have such advice made available to them in a timely manner.

That clients of proxy voting advice businesses are provided with a means of becoming aware of any written responses by companies to proxy voting advice.

The final rules also rescind a note to Rule 14a-9 added in 2020, which contained examples of material misstatements or omissions related to proxy voting advice.

These final rules will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

For more information, refer to our client alert about the final rules , as well as this SEC proxy voting advice fact sheet and this PubCo blog post about the new amendments .

SEC proposes amendments to shareholder proposal rule On July 13, the SEC also announced it had proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8 , the rule governing shareholder proposals, which would narrow certain substantive bases for a company to exclude a shareholder proposal from its proxy statement.

In November 2021, Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14L narrowed the interpretations of certain substantive bases for exclusion, making it more difficult for companies to exclude shareholder proposals.

(Refer to this client alert on the bulletin and this PubCo blog post about the bulletin for more information.)

This new proposal may further limit the ability of companies to exclude shareholder proposals by narrowing three more bases for exclusion.

Substantial implementation exclusion:

Under the proposed amendments, a proposal would only be excludable under this provision if the company has already implemented the essential elements of the proposal.

Duplication exclusion: Under the proposed amendments, a proposal would only be excludable under this provision if it addresses the same subject matter and seeks the same objective by the same means as another proposal submitted for the same shareholder meeting.

Resubmission exclusion: Under the proposed amendments, a proposal would constitute a resubmission under this provision if it substantially duplicates a prior proposal by addressing the same subject matter and seeks the same objective by the same means.

The SEC is now accepting public comments on the proposed rules.

SCOTUS issues important administrative law decision On June 30, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling in West Virginia v. EPA limiting the power of the administrative state, which may portend trouble for the SECs proposal on climate-related disclosure.

The Supreme Court held that the Clean Air Act of 1970 does not give the Environmental Protection Agency authority to issue broad systemic regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

The court rooted its opinion in the major questions doctrine, which holds that courts must be skeptical of agency efforts to assert broad authority in regulating matters of vast economic and political significance, requiring, in those instances, that the agency point to clear congressional authorization to regulate.

Given the basis for this decision, the major questions doctrine may be used against other significant agency regulations too, including those of the SEC.

Media and politicians already have specifically singled out the proposed SEC rule on climate change as potentially falling within this doctrine (e.g., this Reuters article on the Supreme Court emission ruling and this Wall Street Journal article on the SECs climate rule).

For more information on the decision and its potential ramifications for agency rulemakings, refer to this PubCo blog post about the SCOTUS ruling .

SEC files charges in novel insider trading case involving digital assets On July 21, the SEC announced that it had charged a former Coinbase manager and two others with insider trading relating to digital assets.

In its complaint, the SEC alleged that the former manager knew what crypto assets (or tokens) would be made available for trading  information Coinbase identified as material nonpublic information in its policies  and tipped off his brother and friend.

Notably, the SEC found that the defendants allegedly purchased at least 25 crypto assets, at least nine of which were securities  (emphasis added).

Consistent with the SECs recent position toward cryptocurrency, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal commented, We are not concerned with labels, but rather the economic realities of an offering.

In this case, those realities affirm that a number of the crypto assets at issue were securities, and, as alleged, the defendants engaged in typical insider trading ahead of their listing on Coinbase.

This finding that crypto assets are securities has sent ripples through the industry, as companies behind crypto assets could now be open to SEC enforcement actions for the sale and offer of unregistered securities.

Importantly, the SECs characterizations of these assets as securities are mere allegations and must be proven in the course of litigation.

Cooley,CFPB Bolsters Jurisdictional Claim Over Financial Services Industry’s Digital Marketing Vendors,"On August 10, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an interpretive rule stating that digital marketing providers that commingle the targeting and delivery of advertisements to consumers on behalf of financial services companies are subject to the CFPBs jurisdiction.

The interpretive rule arguably builds the jurisdictional groundwork for further action in connection with the CFPBs market monitoring initiatives around technology company data collection .

It also expands the scope of entities that are service providers, pursuant to the Consumer Financial Protection Act, and therefore subject to the CFPBs authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP), which the CFPB also now interprets as encompassing discrimination.

Overview of CFPBs interpretive rule As a general matter, the CFPB has jurisdiction over a covered person, which is an entity that offers or provides a financial product or service for use by consumers primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

The CFPB also has some jurisdiction, including with respect to prohibiting unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, over service providers, which are entities that provide a material service to a covered person in connection with their offering of a consumer financial product or service.

However, Congress carved out from the definition of a service provider an entity that provides ministerial support to covered persons or time or space for an advertisement for a financial product or service through print, newspaper or electronic media.

Under this new interpretation, the CFPB indicates that digital marketing providers are providing a material service, and are therefore service providers when they identify or target prospective customers and/or select or place content to affect consumer engagement.

The CFPB also states that a digital marketing company that does more than provide time or space for advertisements falls outside the scope of the congressional service provider exception, and therefore comes under the aegis of the CFPB.

As an example, the CFPB offers that a digital marketing provider would come under its jurisdiction as a service provider if it targets or delivers advertisements to users with certain characteristics  even if those characteristics are chosen by the financial services provider  or if it plays a role in delivery and audience selection, such as through algorithms or use of data analytics.

CFPBs tying of UDAAP to discrimination becomes more critical for digital marketing companies While certain areas of CFPB jurisdiction are murky  for instance, the CFPB is currently litigating over the reach of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to marketing practices  one area is crystal clear: The CFPB has asserted that it has the authority to take action to prevent a service provider from committing or engaging in UDAAP.

Notably, on March 16, 2022 , the CFPB decreed that a discriminatory act, such as engaging in targeted advertising or marketing in a discriminatory way, constitutes an unfair practice.

Thus, even if a digital marketing companys practices are not subject to ECOA, the CFPB could claim that the companys strategies were nevertheless discriminatory, and therefore unfair and a violation of federal law.

(The Department of Justice recently entered into a settlement over allegedly discriminatory digital marketing practices pursuant to the Fair Housing Act , but without reference to ECOA, the latter of which being the law within the CFPBs jurisdiction.)

What to expect?

Financial services companies have long monitored their own marketing activities for fair lending and UDAAP risk, and also have sought to oversee their vendors practices.

While this announcement generated headlines about what it means for Big Tech, there are numerous lead generators and marketing strategy companies that will, based on the CFPBs pronouncement, find themselves subject to potential scrutiny."

Cooley,Florida Enacts Broad Amendment to State Civil Rights Act,"On April 22, 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law the Individual Freedom Act, also known as the Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees (WOKE) Act, with an effective date of July 1, 2022.

It provides a private cause of action to Floridian employees after exhausting administrative remedies if such employees are required by an employer to participate in any workplace training that promotes various viewpoints concerning race, color, sex or national origin, including critical race theory.

Employers must carefully review all required employee trainings  especially trainings discussing race, color, sex or national origin  to ensure that they comply with the broad coverage of this new law.

Key provisions The Individual Freedom Act amends the Florida Civil Rights Act to add as an unlawful employment practice subjecting an employee as a condition of employment to any training, instruction or other required activity that espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels any of the following concepts: Members of one race, color, sex or national origin are morally superior to members of another race, color, sex or national origin.

An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive.

An individuals moral character or status as either privileged or oppressed is necessarily determined by his or her race, color, sex or national origin.

Members of one race, color, sex or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color, sex or national origin.

An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex or national origin, bears responsibility for  or should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of  actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex or national origin.

An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity or inclusion.

An individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex or national origin, bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish or other forms of psychological distress because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex or national origin.

Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist, or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex or national origin.

The new law does not prohibit discussion of the above concepts as long as any training or discussion of them is given in an objective manner without endorsement of the concepts.

The law applies to all employers with 15 or more employees and, as with other violations of Florida anti-discrimination law, aggrieved employees may file a private cause of action after exhausting administrative remedies.

Next steps As noted above, the new law contains a number of broad concepts and terms, including what it means to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel certain beliefs.

Further, it is unclear when an employer crosses the line from providing training or discussion in an objective manner permitted under the new law to endorsing any of the prohibited concepts.

In light of the breadth of the new law, employers with Florida employees should proceed with caution in assessing their employee training programs.

Employers with multistate operations also should understand the risks associated with continuing to provide the same training to Florida employees that they offer employees in states with required harassment training laws, such as New York.

If employers choose to continue to require the same employee training programs to employees without regard to location, they risk complaints and lawsuits from employees in Florida."
Cooley,Florida Enacts Broad Amendment to State Civil Rights Act,"If employers choose to continue to require the same employee training programs to employees without regard to location, they risk complaints and lawsuits from employees in Florida.

However, the new law prohibits only required activity, so employers should consider making any current training programs optional for Florida employees while waiting for further guidance.

If you have any questions about the new law, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,Tax Implications of the Inflation Reduction Act,"On August 7, 2022, the US Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act ( House Resolution 5376 ), which contains tax, climate and healthcare provisions.

The legislation is widely expected to be passed by the House of Representatives without changes and signed into law by President Joseph R. Biden shortly thereafter.

The Inflation Reduction Actcontains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code  ), including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases.

Despite earlier proposals, the legislation does not contain any changes to the tax treatment of carried interest or the cap on deductions for state and local taxes.

This alert highlights a few key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Actthat may be applicable to Cooley clients.

Corporate alternative minimum tax In tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Actimposes a 15% alternative minimum tax (the Corporate AMT  ) on US corporations with financial accounting profits exceeding a certain threshold.

This provision is expected to impact large corporations that have previously reported high income on their financial statements but have significantly reduced  or even eliminated  their cash tax liability as a result of certain attributes or book-tax differences, such as companies with significant stock-based compensation.

Very few corporations are expected to be subject to the Corporate AMT as currently proposed.

In an analysis of an earlier version of the proposal, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that about 150 taxpayers would be subject to the tax each year.

The Corporate AMT would generally apply to US corporations  excluding S corporations, regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts  with an average of more than $1 billion of annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) during a three-year measurement period.

The Corporate AMT would also apply to a US corporation (including, for these purposes, a trade or business engaged in by a foreign corporation within the US) in a foreign-parented multinational group if, over the three-year measurement period, the US corporations average annual AFSI is at least $100 million and the multinational groups average annual AFSI exceeds $1 billion.

A corporations AFSI is the net income or loss set forth on the corporations applicable financial statement (generally a Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K or other audited financial statement) for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments to reflect accelerated tax depreciation and certain other items.

The provision was amended with the intention that otherwise unrelated companies under common ownership of an investment fund will not have their AFSI aggregated for purposes of the $1 billion threshold.

In some cases, the Corporate AMT may simply accelerate taxes, as payments made under the Corporate AMT can be used as a credit in future years when a corporations regular tax liability exceeds its liability under the Corporate AMT.

In other cases, the Corporate AMT may permanently increase overall tax liability.

For example, taxpayers with significant net operating losses from tax years prior to 2020 may realize a permanent increase in tax liability because the Inflation Reduction Act precludes carryforwards for financial statement net operating losses arising in such years.

Excise tax on corporate stock repurchases For publicly traded US corporations and certain US subsidiaries of publicly traded non-US corporations, the Inflation Reduction Actimposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of any stock that is repurchased by the corporation or its specified affiliate (generally, corporations or partnerships of which the corporation owns more than 50%) during the tax year."
Cooley,Tax Implications of the Inflation Reduction Act,"The taxable amount is reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued by the repurchasing corporation during the taxable year, including the fair market value of any stock issued or provided to employees of the corporation or a specified affiliate.

The excise tax is subject to several exceptions (the contours of which are uncertain), including carve-outs for repurchases that are part of a tax-free reorganization, contributions to employee retirement or stock ownership plans, repurchases that are treated as dividends, and corporations that repurchase stock with a total value of no more than $1 million during a taxable year.

The excise tax applies to repurchases of stock after December 31, 2022.

While the excise tax only applies to repurchases of stock after December 31, 2022, corporations may already have shares outstanding that are subject to repurchase rights, including redeemable preferred stock and stock issued in the initial public offering of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).

The excise tax could also be triggered in transactions not conventionally viewed as stock repurchases, including: Mergers or other reorganizations involving cash payments to the targets shareholders to the extent that such payments are funded with the targets cash or debt incurred or assumed by the target in the transaction.

Payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares.

Payments to dissenters.

Divisive reorganizations that use a split-off structure.

In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to define repurchase to include economically similar transactions.

Unless the fair market value of stock treated as repurchased in a tax year is less than the fair market value of stock issued by the covered corporation in that tax year, or another exception applies, such transactions could expose a covered corporation to the excise tax.

Other tax provisions Other notable tax-related provisions in the Inflation Reduction Actinclude: A two-year extension (to tax years beginning before January 1, 2029) of the loss limitation rules applicable to noncorporate taxpayers under Section 461(l) of the Internal Revenue Code.

An increase in the research tax credit available to offset the payroll taxes of qualified small businesses under Section 41(h) of the Internal Revenue Code.

An increase in IRS funding of approximately $80 billion over 10 years, with nearly $46 billion for enforcement efforts such as digital asset monitoring and compliance activities.

A new excise tax on drug producers who fail to comply with new drug pricing requirements.

The reinstatement of a Superfund excise tax on crude oil and certain imported petroleum products at a rate of 16.4 cents per barrel (indexed to inflation) beginning January 1, 2023.

The permanent extension of an excise tax on coal from US mines.

Climate- and energy-related taxes, tax credits and other incentives."
Cooley,FCC Expands Satellite Use of 17 GHz Spectrum,"The Federal Communications Commission has adopted new rules to expand the use of spectrum in the 17 gigahertz band to transmit data to Earth.

This decision allows the spectrum, which previously had been reserved for feeder links and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service, to be used by any geostationary satellite operators providing fixed-satellite service.

It also is noteworthy because the FCC rejected requests to set this spectrum aside for terrestrial wireless use and instead affirmed that it should be used for satellite services.

Historically, 17 GHz spectrum has been used for feeder links, which send signals from the Earth to satellites, but the FCC made the band available to DBS operators for space-to-Earth transmissions in 2007.

This decision makes the spectrum from 17.3 to 17.7 GHz and 17.7 to 17.8 GHz available to other satellite service operators using geostationary satellites to reach fixed customer locations.

The new rules also authorize blanket licensing of earth stations in the 17 GHz frequencies, including earth stations used in moving vehicles.

The FCC expects that the new spectrum will be used to support broadband operations  and that satellite operators will take advantage of spot beam technology to reuse the spectrum efficiently across the US.

As the FCC has done in other proceedings where it has opened up spectrum to new uses, the decision adopts safeguards to protect existing users.

These include requirements that satellites operating at 17 GHz be separated in space, power limits, frequency reuse and coordination requirements, and other technical limitations on operation.

It also protected some existing earth station operations from harmful interference and revised its coordination requirements for new earth stations in the band.

While the rules allow geostationary satellites to operate in the 17 GHz band, they do not address non-geostationary (NGSO) satellites.

In response to requests from NGSO operators, the FCC asked for comment on issues affecting whether this band should be made available for such operations, including if there is a need for more spectrum for NGSO operations and the technical feasibility of sharing the band between geostationary and NGSO satellites while protecting incumbent users.

Comments and reply comments on these questions will be due 60 and 90 days, respectively, after notice of the decision is published in the Federal Register .

This decision fits squarely within the FCCs recent history of expanding spectrum availability for broadband services and requiring spectrum to be shared between existing and new users to support that goal.

It also is a relatively rare example of a decision that specifically supports satellite broadband, rather than focusing on terrestrial services.

As a result, satellite operators in the US will have access to significant additional spectrum to support their broadband services, and to meet increasing demand for those services."
Cooley,FDA Unveils Considerations for Rescinding Breakthrough Therapy Designation,"On June 24, 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a draft guidance document on the Considerations for Rescinding Breakthrough Therapy Designation .

The guidance explains how the FDA may rescind a drug or biologic candidates breakthrough therapy designation during its development (this guidance does not apply to medical devices 1 ).

The agency is accepting public comments on this guidance through August 23, 2022.

What is breakthrough therapy designation (BTD)?

BTD is an FDA expedited drug development program under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 USC 356(a), for drug candidates with preliminary clinical evidence for potentially substantial improvement over existing therapies to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

A sponsor of a BTD drug will have meetings with and timely advice from the FDA review team throughout the development process, and the FDA has committed resources to expedite the review of the marketing application of the drug, including rolling review.

Although a sponsor may request BTD for its drug candidate concurrently with the submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, according to a 2014 guidance on expedited programs , the FDA generally expects the required preliminary clinical evidence to be derived from phase 1 or 2 trials, ideally from comparison studies with a sufficient number of patient subjects.

The FDA also expects a BTD request to be submitted before the end-of-phase 2 meeting.

2 FDA can rescind BTD While the FDA can grant BTD to qualified drug candidates, it can also take it away.

During the development process, sponsors generate new data and information, and the clinical evidence supporting BTD may change.

According to the 2014 guidance, the FDA periodically assesses BTD drug candidates, and if the agency determines that a candidate no longer meets the criteria for BTD, it may rescind the designation to save the resources for other qualified drugs.

The FDA will offer the sponsor an opportunity to oppose to its rescission decision.

Upon receiving notice of the FDAs intent to rescind BTD, the sponsor may request a meeting with the FDA and voluntarily withdraw, rather than force rescission of the BTD in a process known as Withdrawn After Granting (WAG).

Each year, more sponsors face rescission rather than voluntarily withdrawing through the WAG process.

The 2014 guidance did not provide details on how the FDA makes a rescission decision, but the current draft guidance offers numerous scenarios in which the FDA will consider rescinding a BTD, including: As a result of a newly approved drug, where the BTD drug no longer meets the BTD criteria regarding substantial improvement over existing available therapies.

When emerging data for the BTD drug does not support the designation (e.g., a phase 3 trial failing to meet its primary endpoint, or new safety information impacting the drugs benefit-risk profile).

If the sponsor is no longer pursuing the drugs development.

The FDA considers the quality of evidence in determining whether BTD recission is appropriate.

For example, the agency gives greater weight to data from trials with larger populations, a well-understood and widely accepted, well-constructed clinical endpoint, or other robust design features (e.g., randomization, blinding).

Overview of other expedited programs Besides BTD, the FDA offers three other expedited programs for drug candidates (including biological products) intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions: Fast track designation is given to drug candidates with nonclinical or clinical data that may demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need to treat a serious condition, or to qualified infectious disease drugs.

Features of the program include frequent interactions with the review team and rolling review.

The FDA may rescind the designation if the qualifying criteria is no longer met."
Cooley,FDA Unveils Considerations for Rescinding Breakthrough Therapy Designation,"Features of the program include frequent interactions with the review team and rolling review.

The FDA may rescind the designation if the qualifying criteria is no longer met.

The key difference between fast track designation and BTD is that fast track designation does not require clinical evidence, which means that sponsors could obtain fast track designation earlier in the development process.

Accelerated approval pathway is for drugs with a meaningful advantage over available therapies to treat a serious condition, based on a demonstrated effect on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

3 Priority review designation is given to marketing applications for drug candidates that can provide a significant improvement in treating a serious condition or under certain other conditions.

The FDA intends to take action on such applications within six months of receipt, instead of the standard 10 months generally required for review.

4 A sponsor may apply for all four expedited programs for its drug candidate, and should reach out to regulatory counsel to discuss the advantages and potential benefits each program may provide for a particular development program.

The timeline below summarizes when to submit requests for each of the expedited programs.

Considerations The expedited programs can provide invaluable regulatory tools for pharmaceutical and biotech companies because they can help bring a drug or biological product to market faster or in a more cost-efficient way.

The FDAs draft guidance serves as a good reminder that once given, these designations are not set in stone.

If you are considering an expedited program for your drug candidate or suspect that the FDA may rescind a previously awarded designation, reach out to your Cooley team for assistance.

Cooley summer associate Sarah Miller also contributed to this alert.

Notes For medical devices, the FDA grants breakthrough devices designation, which originated from a different part of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 USC 360e-3), to devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

Breakthrough devices must also meet at least one of the following four criteria: (1) represents breakthrough technology; (2) no approved or cleared alternatives exist; (3) offers a significant advantage over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or (4) availability of the device is in the best interest of patients.

The designation offers FDA guidance to sponsors during the development and prioritized review of their regulatory submissions.

See the 2014 guidance.

Changes to the withdrawal procedures for accelerated approval pathway may be coming later this year, as pending legislation to reauthorize FDA user fee amendments (i.e., the FDA Safety and Landmark Advancements Act) includes a provision on accelerated approval that would expedite the procedures the FDA can use to withdraw such approval.

These review times are set forth in the FDAs Prescription Drug User Fee Act reauthorization performance goals : In particular, the FDAs current target is to review and act on 90% of standard New Drug Application and Biologics License Application (BLA) submissions within 10 months and 90% of priority submissions within six months.

The FDAs target times to review biosimilar BLAs are described in the FDAs Biosimilar User Fee Act reauthorization performance goals ."

Cooley,FCC Plans to Seek Comments on Facilitating Space Economy,"The Federal Communications Commission has released a draft of a notice of inquiry (NOI) scheduled for consideration at its open meeting on August 5, 2022.

The NOI seeks comments on FCC licensing of in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing (ISAM) missions, which include activities such as repairing in-orbit spacecraft, removing debris and satellite refueling.

One goal of this proceeding is to identify ways the FCC can promote continued growth, innovation, and development in ISAM operations.

To that end, the FCC hopes to learn more about current and future ISAM activities that may require FCC licensing, frequency allocations, or other approvals.

In particular, the FCC aims to identify how to facilitate and reduce barriers for ISAM missions by modifying the licensing processes.

Space safety, including orbital debris remediation, is a primary concern for the FCC, which recognizes that while ISAM operations can produce new orbital debris, they also could help clean up existing debris.

The NOI, therefore, seeks comments on the current and future spectrum needs for ISAM missions, as well as whether the FCC should modify its rules on orbital debris mitigation.

The FCC also asks if there are any different regulatory issues presented by ISAM activities beyond Earths orbit.

This NOI is the latest in the FCCs efforts to learn how it can promote commercial space operations.

The NOI also aligns with the Biden administrations December 2021 Space Priorities Framework , and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policys ISAM National Strategy released in April 2022.

There may be incremental changes to the NOI before the FCCs vote next month, but we expect the FCC to vote to approve it.

Industry commenters may submit their views to the FCC through comments and reply comments, which will be due 45 days and 75 days, respectively, after publication in the Federal Register."
Cooley,NCA and OFSI Publish Red Alert on Russian Financial Sanctions Evasion,"On 12 July 2022, the UKs National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) published a red alert report on some of the common techniques used by Russian sanctioned persons to evade financial sanctions in the UK.

The red alert supports the current heightened scrutiny of the UK governments sanctions regime, and it is designed to encourage public and private sector cooperation on sanctions compliance.

Context The UK governments sanctions regime has designated many of the elites who control Russias economic interests and have had some sort of involvement in the support of the war in Ukraine.

Some of these designated persons (DPs) have employed a range of techniques to circumvent sanctions and prevent them from impacting their personal and commercial holdings in the UK.

DPs do this by using associates, such as family members and close contacts, via enablers to transfer assets to trusted proxies, sell or transfer assets at a loss to realise their value before sanctions take effect, and divest investments to ensure ownership stakes are below the 50% threshold.

The NCA and OFSI red alert aims to set out key indicators and examples of the types of techniques commonly used by DPs, and what activities and behaviour to look out for.

Whilst the red alert is focused largely on guidance to professional firms, it is of wider value, and corporates should take note of it when assessing sanctions risks.

Sanctions indicators The alert highlights 34 indicators or red flags indicating that a DP could be trying to evade financial sanctions, including: Changes of beneficial ownership of a DPs corporate structure to non-Russian family members or associates.

Movement of assets previously associated with a DP, where funds are then disbursed offshore through secrecy jurisdictions.

Use of trust arrangements or complex corporate structures involving offshore companies to hide the DPs ownership interest.

Transfers of ownership to previously unknown individuals whose economic consumption, displays of wealth or financial footprint do not correspond with their newly reported wealth.

DPs using pooled accounts in which banks see only the name of the enabler and not the client.

Use of banks and financial organisations owned by close associates of DPs.

Evidence of suspicious consulting invoices at non-market rates.

The appointment of a nominee director to manage the assets of the company, as well as obfuscation of beneficial ownership through the use of nominee shareholders and a deed of trust between the parties where the DP claims to have divested the asset.

Numerous transfers of shares from sanctioned entities to non-sanctioned entities involving corporates incorporated by the same people and company.

Holding companies based in jurisdictions that are offshore and/or historically linked to assets in the former Soviet Union.

Transactions by holding companies linked to DPs with Swiss bank accounts, as well as British Virgin Islands or Cypriot legal persons.

Payments received by UK businesses, often in innovative areas such as fintechs, owned in part by Russian nationals and/or others implicated in previous major trade-based money laundering schemes.

The red alert states that, where a firm identifies activity which falls under indicators detailed in the alert, and the firm falls under the regulated sector, it should make a suspicious activity report (SAR) before the NCA.

A SAR is an information report alerting law enforcement that certain client or customer activity is suspicious and might indicate money laundering or terrorist financing.

Even where activity does not constitute a SAR, firms are encouraged to report any relevant information."
Cooley,NCA and OFSI Publish Red Alert on Russian Financial Sanctions Evasion,"Even where activity does not constitute a SAR, firms are encouraged to report any relevant information.

Industry recommendations The red alert also provides six recommendations to assist businesses in identifying possible financial sanctions evasion and in calculating business and customer risks: Arms-length transactions must be documented and should not be taken at face value by firms, particularly when assessing indirect control that a DP may exert over the entity.

A failure to undertake appropriate due diligence should be considered a red flag for complicity and breach/circumvention offences.

Firms should carefully assess complex corporate structures and the commercial justification for them as part of enhanced due diligence for high-risk clients.

Firms should note that issues of aggregation of ownership can be further complicated where differing approaches to it are applied across the European Union, UK and US, and more than one owner seeks to divest their shareholding.

Firms should conduct enhanced due diligence and follow up with the competent authority if they come across documentation purporting to present a change of ownership by a company linked to a DP.

In instances where companies have provided legal assessments regarding the transfer of ownership, firms should carry out their own legal assessments to come to an independent determination.

Cooley,"Q2 2022 Venture Financing Report – Deal Volume, Invested Capital and Early-Stage Pre-Money Valuations Decline","Cooley handled 332 disclosable venture capital financing deals for Q2 2022, representing $16.6 billion of invested capital.

Both numbers are down from Q1 2022, when Cooley handled 401 disclosable VC financing deals with invested capital of $24.3 billion.

The invested capital in VC financing deals for Q2 2022 is at its lowest since Q4 2020, when Cooley handled 353 disclosable deals representing $14.3 billion in invested capital, while deal volume is at its lowest since Q3 2020, when Cooley handled 308 disclosable VC financing deals.

Though consistent with generally reported market dynamics, the slowdown in deal volume and invested capital is something to watch during the second half of 2022 to see if the trend continues.

In early-stage VC financing deals, median pre-money valuations also declined somewhat, returning to levels comparable to valuations from the later part of 2021, but still high compared to valuations from early 2021.

Series Seed deals had a median pre-money valuation of $17.1 million, with Series A deals at $60 million, in June 2022.

Although slightly down from highs in late 2021 and early 2022, these medians remain elevated compared to numbers from the first half of 2021.

Series B deals saw a slightly greater decline in median pre-money valuations during Q2 2022, dropping from a record high median pre-money valuation of $300 million in January 2022 to $164.4 million in June 2022; however, the June 2022 median pre-money valuation for Series B deals is still above those seen in early 2021, which were in the range of $150 million.

Even in the current climate, median pre-money valuations in later-stage VC financings increased after the decline in Q1 2022, with June 2022 boasting a record high median pre-money valuation of $4.3 billion for Series D or later deals.

Although invested dollars, deal numbers and valuations were generally down, Q2 2022 deal terms themselves continued to be favorable for companies.

In Q2 2022, 97% of disclosable deals had non-participating preferred stock, down slightly from the record high of nearly 98% for Q1 2022.

The percentage of up rounds remained high at 94% of disclosable deals, again slightly down from 97% in Q1 2022.

Deals with a pay-to-play provision remained low at just 4.5% of disclosable deals, though this does represent an increase over 3% of disclosable deals in Q1 2022.

Similarly, the percentage of deals involving a recapitalization also remained low at 1.5%, but this is an increase over Q1 2022, when deals with a recapitalization made up less than 1% of disclosable deals.

Cooley continued to hold the top spot globally and in the US for representation of companies in venture capital transactions in PitchBooks Q1 2022 Global League Tables .

The firm also was credited as the second-most active law firm in the US and worldwide for representation of investors in VC deals and in overall venture deal count.

Spotlight on life sciences Deal volume and invested capital for financings of life sciences companies continued to decline in Q2 2022.

During the quarter, Cooley handled 52 disclosable financings of life sciences companies, representing more than $2.2 billion of invested capital.

This is down from 70 disclosable deals representing more than $2.4 billion of invested capital in Q1 2022  and is a notable drop from 86 disclosable deals with more than $5.4 billion in invested capital in Q4 2021.

Cooley,UK Government Publishes First Market Guidance Notes on NSI Act,"On July 19, 2022, the UK government published its long-awaited Market Guidance Notes on the National Security and Investment (NSI) Act, based on an analysis of notifications received to date and feedback from stakeholders.

The notes focus on whether commonly raised scenarios require mandatory notification, which has tended to be the area of most interest.

In particular, the notes provide welcome guidance on submitting notifications, acquisitions of control and the publication of information relating to the NSI Act.

Summary of main points addressed in the notes Notifications For voluntary and mandatory notifications, the government has clarified that notifiers should provide as much detail as possible about the activities of the entity or asset in scope, make specific reference to the relevant sector definitions in the Notifiable Acquisition Regulations , and avoid the use of technical language.

Structure charts are an important part of the notification form, and are needed for the government to fully understand the ownership structure of the entities and assets before and after the acquisition has been completed.

In particular, the notes clarify that it is important to include the ultimate controller of the acquirer to assist the government in deciding whether to make use of its call-in power.

Temporary acquisitions of control The notes helpfully illustrate two scenarios in which the appointment of liquidators and receivers may constitute an acquisition which may require potential mandatory notification: If a liquidated entity has shares in a solvent entity, and the liquidator or receiver gains voting rights over those shares during the insolvency process and prior to the shares being sold, this constitutes an acquisition of control that may be notifiable if the other relevant tests are met.

If a director is declared bankrupt, and its shares in a solvent entity are transferred over to a trustee in bankruptcy during the insolvency process, this also is regarded as an acquisition of control that may be notifiable if the other relevant tests are met.

Granting security over shares The notes clarify that the granting of share security is not a notifiable acquisition requiring mandatory notification, even if it involves an entity carrying on activities covered under the mandatory notification sectors.

This is because there is no acquisition of control being acquired.

This clarification is consistent with the response previously provided by the government in responding to a query raised by the City of London Law Society .

However, and notwithstanding this clarification, the notes point out that, where legal title is transferred or control passes in some other way and the shares fall within the mandatory sectors, then a notifiable acquisition has taken place and must be notified.

Indirect acquisitions of control As set out under the NSI Act, it is possible for investors and other parties to acquire control indirectly over entities carrying on activities in one of the 17 specified sectors, and to fall in scope of the mandatory regime, where there is an unbroken chain of majority stakes all the way through to that entity of interest.

The notes provide some helpful examples of how this may happen in practice.

Internal reorganisations The notes confirm that internal reorganisations also are in scope where they result in an acquisition of control over an entity, even if the ultimate beneficial owner remains the same.

Although that is a rare scenario, the notes explain that such reorganisations may raise national security risks, for example, by enabling a hostile actor to pursue malign actions over the entity.

Voting rights and mandatory notification The NSI Act captures the acquisition of voting rights that enable a person to secure or prevent the passage of any class of resolution governing the affairs of the target entity."
Cooley,UK Government Publishes First Market Guidance Notes on NSI Act,"The notes confirm that contractual rights are not voting rights and will therefore not trigger a mandatory notification, provided such contractual rights do not amount to control of such voting rights and do not enable the acquirer to secure or prevent the passage of all resolutions of a particular class.

It may be the case that contractual rights  either alone or together with other interests or rights  enable an acquirer to materially influence the policy of a company.

Such rights would fall outside the mandatory regime, but may be subject to call in by the UK government.

Publication of Information The notes explain that the government will not publish information regarding the receipt and acceptance or rejection of individual notifications, but it may choose to publish information regarding call-in notices or final notifications.

Where the government makes a proactive announcement, it will aim to provide advance notice to the parties.

Where a final order has been made, the government is required to publish notice of the order.

A recent example of this is the governments publication of its first final order prohibiting the licensing of vision-sensing technology by the University of Manchester to the Beijing Infinite Vision Technology Company.

White list of investors The notes clarify that the government is monitoring closely whether it would be appropriate to make exemptions from mandatory notification requirements based on the characteristics of the acquirer (i.e., a white list of investors), but there are currently no plans to exempt certain businesses and investors from the mandatory notification regime.

Other updates On July 20, 2022, the government published new guidance on the applicability of the NSI Act to new build downstream gas and electricity assets .

The guidance is intended to assist developers of new build downstream gas and electricity infrastructure to understand what types of assets and acquisitions in the sector are within the scope of the NSI Act, and when to submit a voluntary notification.

The guidance also provides specific examples of acquisitions in the sector that would be in scope of the NSI Act.

In addition, the government has updated its guidance on the Notifiable Acquisitions Regulations to clarify when an acquisition in the downstream oil sector will be subject to a mandatory notification under the NSI Act.

Outlook

This is the first set of notes to be published by the government since the NSI regime came into force on January 4, 2022.

The notes and the additional guidance outlined above are welcome updates which provide more clarity, insight and certainty for businesses on the UK governments approach to NSI notifications  and the overall operation of the NSI regime.

A further set of guidance is expected in early 2023.

Cooley,SBA Proposes Certification Process Changes for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses,"Background The Small Business Administration has issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish a federal governmentwide certification program for Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (VO SBCs) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (SDVO SBCs).

The rule proposes the implementation of Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA FY21) and requires, among other changes, the transfer of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vets First Verification Program to the SBA.

The SBA is also proposing to implement the Veterans Certification Program under a new 13 Code of Federal Regulations Part 128.

Comments on the proposed rule are due to the SBA on or before August 5, 2022.

The VO and SDVO small business programs, set forth in 38 US Code 8127, authorize federal contracting officers to restrict competition to eligible VO and SDVO SBCs for VA contracts.

To be eligible for VA contracts, VO and SDVO SBCs must be verified by VAs Center for Verification and Evaluation in accordance with 38 USC 8127.

There is currently no governmentwide SDVO SBC certification program, and firms seeking SDVO SBC sole source or set-aside contracts with federal agencies other than the VA only need to self-certify their status as SDVO SBCs.

Mechanics of the proposed rule Section 862 of the NDAA FY21 transfers responsibility for certifying VO and SDVO SBCs to the SBA starting January 1, 2023.

It also creates an SBA certification requirement for SDVO SBCs seeking sole source and set-aside contracts across the federal government.

Section 862 provides a one-year grace period after the January 1 transfer date for currently self-certifying businesses to file an application for SDVO SBC certification.

Self-certified SDVO SBCs that apply within the one-year grace period will maintain eligibility until the SBA makes a final eligibility decision.

Firms already verified by the Center for Verification and Evaluation before January 1 transfer date will be deemed eligible for VA set-aside contracts for VO and SDVO SBCs during the time that remains in the firms three-year term of eligibility.

To remain SBA-certified after the transfer date, firms must meet all conditions of eligibility as described in the SBAs regulations.

Though not required by Section 862, the SBA also is proposing to grant reciprocity to businesses participating in its 8(a) Business Development and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) programs that are owned and controlled by one or more veterans or, in the case of SDVO SBCs, service-disabled veterans.

Both the 8(a) and WOSB programs require applicants to demonstrate ownership and control to be eligible for certification.

According to the SBA, the ownership and control requirements for the 8(a) and WOSB programs are basically the same as those set forth in this proposed rule for VO SBCs and SDVO SBCs.

Given this, the proposed rule provides an expedited application and review process for 8(a) and WOSB-certified firms seeking VO or SDVO SBC certification.

In such cases, the SBA would confirm the identified individuals eligibility as a veteran or service-disabled veteran before granting certification.

The SBA believes reciprocity between its certification programs will create program administration efficiencies while reducing processing time for applicants.

Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments Regarding Proxy Rules’ Applicability to Proxy Advisory Firms,"On July 13, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission held a lively meeting at which it voted to adopt final amendments regarding the applicability of the proxy rules to proxy advisory firms, which are also known as proxy voting advice businesses (PVABs).

The amendments relating to PVABs, such as ISS and Glass Lewis, remove certain conditions to the availability of exemptions from the information and filing requirements of the proxy rules for PVABs; these conditions were only recently added as part of rules adopted by the previous presidential administration in 2020.

The key reversal from 2020 is the rescission of the conditions that: Companies that are the subject of proxy voting advice have such advice made available to them before or at the same time PVABs make it available to their clients.

Clients of PVABs are notified of any written responses by companies to such proxy voting advice.

The amendments also reversed course from the 2020 rules by rescinding a note to Rule 14a-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that provided examples of situations when the failure to disclose material information regarding proxy voting advice may be misleading and discussed the limited circumstances under which statements of opinion would subject PVABs to liability under Rule 14a-9.

Finally, the amendments rescinded the 2020 supplemental guidance regarding the proxy voting obligations of investment advisers.

The amendments leave intact the determination that proxy voting advice is a solicitation subject to the proxy rules  including liability under Rule 14a-9 for material misstatements or omissions of fact  and the conflicts of interest disclosure requirements that were memorialized in the 2020 rules.

The amendments, which passed by SEC commissioner votes of 3 to 2 along party lines, will become effective 60 days after publication in theFederal Register.

For information on the SEC commissioners views and statements regarding the amendments, refer to our Cooley PubCo blog post .

Background In 2020, the SEC adopted final rules regarding proxy voting advice provided by PVABs .

The 2020 rules, among other things: Codified the SECs interpretation that proxy voting advice is generally a solicitation subject to the proxy rules.

Added new conditions to exemptions that PVABs generally rely on to avoid the proxy rules information and filing requirements, including: New conflicts of interest disclosure requirements.

A requirement that PVABs adopt and disclose policies and procedures designed to ensure that companies that are the subject of proxy voting advice have such advice made available to them in a timely manner, as well as a requirement that clients of PVABs are provided with a means of becoming aware of any written responses by companies to proxy voting advice.

Added Note (e) to Rule 14a-9, the anti-fraud provision for proxy materials, to include examples of material misstatements or omissions related to proxy voting advice.

The amendments adopted by the SEC reversed the additions of items 2(b) and 3 in the 2020 rules, which never actually went into effect, as discussed in greater detail below.

Final amendments The 2020 rules added paragraph (9) to Rule 14a-2(b), which specifies certain conditions that a PVAB must satisfy in order to rely on the exemptions from the proxy rules information and filing requirements.

The just-adopted amendments remove the conditions that: Companies that are the subject of proxy voting advice have such advice made available to them in a timely manner.

Clients of PVABs are provided with a means of becoming aware of any written responses by companies to proxy voting advice."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments Regarding Proxy Rules’ Applicability to Proxy Advisory Firms,"Clients of PVABs are provided with a means of becoming aware of any written responses by companies to proxy voting advice.

These conditions were adopted in 2020 in response to concerns by companies that the analyses by PVABs contained errors and methodological weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their voting recommendations, and that companies did not have adequate opportunities to engage with the PVABs regarding their advice to correct errors on a timely basis.

The rescission of these conditions will reignite these concerns for companies, with companies continuing to only have the option of filing supplemental proxy materials to respond to proxy voting advice they know about and disagree with.

In addition to the rescission of the conditions themselves, the amendments remove accompanying safe harbors and exclusions that relate to these conditions.

However, the other condition added in the 2020 rules for reliance on the exemptions  that PVABs provide their clients with certain conflicts of interest disclosures in connection with their proxy voting advice  remains in place.

The 2020 rules also codified that PVABs proxy voting advice generally constitute a solicitation subject to the proxy rules, including Rule 14a-9, which prohibits any solicitation from containing any statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact.

Rule 14a-9 also requires that solicitations must not omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading.

As part of the 2020 rules, Rule 14a-9 was amended to add Note (e) to provide examples of proxy voting advice that may, depending on the facts and circumstances, be misleading within the meaning of the rule, specifically citing as a potential example the failure of a PVAB to disclose its methodology, sources of information, or conflicts of interest.

The amendments delete Note (e) from Rule 14a-9, removing the specific examples of proxy voting advice that may be subject to the rule.

However, the SEC was intentional in stating that this deletion does not alter the scope of Rule 14a-9 or its application to proxy voting advice  the deletion instead is purportedly aimed at removing the risk of confusion created by Note (e).

The SEC also reiterated its position included in the proposing release that Rule 14a-9 liability does not extend to mere differences of opinion between PVABs and companies, subject to certain limited circumstances in which a statement of opinion contains a material misstatement or omission of fact.

Finally, the amendments rescinded supplemental guidance the SEC issued to investment advisers in 2020 about their proxy voting obligations.

The 2020 supplemental guidance addressed investment advisers use of automated proxy voting systems hosted by PVABs, which have amounted to robo-voting in the views of many companies.

The 2020 supplemental guidance was primarily intended to assist investment advisers in considering company responses to proxy voting advice that would have been more readily available as a result of the 2020 rules  given the rescission of the conditions discussed above, the SEC determined this guidance also should be removed.

Observations and commentary Engagement with proxy advisory firms will continue on their terms.

Under the final proxy advisor rules, proxy advisory firms will be left with broad discretion in determining when and how to engage with companies relating to their voting advice.

With the rescission of the conditions in the 2020 rules aimed at fostering engagement, there is no regulatory impetus for proxy advisory firms, including ISS and Glass Lewis, to engage with companies or to ensure that company responses to voting advice are received by shareholder clients."
Cooley,SEC Adopts Amendments Regarding Proxy Rules’ Applicability to Proxy Advisory Firms,"While market forces have led to engagement with companies through voluntary procedures, the timing and nature of this engagement will continue to rest with these proxy advisory firms  and there is no guarantee the current practices will be maintained.

The larger trend of reversing the prior administration continues.

In a November 2021 client alert , we had noted the possibility of a larger trend at the SEC under the current presidential administration to reverse course on some of the work done under the previous administration  and the amendments covered in this alert do little to dispel this notion.

As Commissioner Hester Peirce notes in her statement regarding the amendments : [T]he request made of the staff was a difficult and pointless one  find a way to redo a freshly adopted rule without any new information to suggest that such a rewrite is warranted.

The SECs most recent rulemaking agenda suggests that this trend may continue, with the potential revisiting of recently adopted SEC guidance and rules relating to human capital disclosure, disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers, and the whistleblower program."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Amendments to Shareholder Proposal Rule,"On July 13, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission held a lively meeting at which it voted to propose amendments to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the rule governing shareholder proposals to be included in a companys proxy statement to be presented for a shareholder vote.

The proposed amendments would amend three of the bases on which a company may exclude a shareholder proposal from its proxy statement: The substantial implementation exclusion in Rule 14a-8(i)(10).

The duplication exclusion in Rule 14a-8(i)(11).

The resubmission exclusion in Rule 14a-8(i)(12).

The SEC is soliciting comments on the proposed rules, which passed by SEC commissioner votes of 3 to 2 along party lines.

For information on the SEC commissioners views and statements regarding the amendments, refer to our Cooley PubCo blog post .

The comment period will be open until the later of 30 days after the proposing release is published in the Federal Register or September 12, 2022 (60 days from the date that the rules were proposed).

Interested parties can submit comments on the SEC website .

Background Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act provides a means by which shareholders can submit proposals for inclusion in a companys proxy statement to be presented for a shareholder vote, saving the shareholders the effort and expense of doing a separate proxy solicitation.

In addition to setting forth the procedural and eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals to a company, Rule 14a-8 identifies several substantive bases a company can rely on to exclude a shareholder proposal from its proxy statement.

Typically, before excluding a shareholder proposal, a company will request assurance from the staff of the SECs Division of Corporation Finance via a written no-action letter that the staff will not recommend an enforcement action if the company omits the proposal on the basis of one of the exclusions described in the no-action letter requesting relief.

In 2020, the SEC adopted amendments modifying the criteria foreligibilityand resubmission of shareholder proposals in Rule 14a-8, which only took effect for meetings held after January 1, 2022.

The proposed amendments do not address these requirements, which remain in effect.

However, the SEC noted in the proposed rule release that it continues to assess the impact of these amendments.

In addition, in November 2021, the Division of Corporation Finance published Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14L (SLB 14L), which provides guidance on the staffs interpretation of certain bases on which a company may exclude a shareholder proposal, including the ordinary business exclusion and the economic relevance exclusion, making it more difficult for companies to exclude shareholder proposals including, in particular, social and environmental proposals.

(See this Cooley client alert for more information on SLB 14L).

The effect of the 2020 amendments and SLB 14L has been an increase in proposals submitted to companies, along with a significant decrease in the number of successfully excluded proposals during the 2022 proxy season.

The proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8 aim to provide clarification with respect to three more substantive bases for exclusion, which may further limit the ability of companies to exclude shareholder proposals from proxy materials, if adopted.

Proposed amendments Substantial implementation exclusion The substantial implementation exclusion in Rule 14a-8(i)(10) permits a company to omit a shareholder proposal that the company has already substantially implemented.

The rationale underlying the exclusion is to avoid shareholders having to consider a proposal that management has already acted upon.

The substantial implementation exclusion is one of the most commonly used bases by companies for excluding a shareholder proposal, and has assumed additional importance following the narrowing of other exclusions in SLB

14L."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Amendments to Shareholder Proposal Rule,"14L.

To provide guidance on what substantially implemented means, the proposed amendments would specify that a shareholder proposal may be excluded on this basis if the company has already implemented the essential elements of the proposal (emphasis added).

The SEC believes that an analysis that focuses on the specific elements of a proposal will provide more predictability in determining whether it has been substantially implemented, though the SEC acknowledges that the amendment would still require a substantive analysis to determine which elements of the proposal are essential elements.

Importantly, a company would only be permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal on this basis if all of its essential elements have been implemented.

As an example of the practical implications of this proposed amendment, the SEC points to a proposal seeking the adoption of a proxy access provision that allows an unlimited number of shareholders meeting certain ownership thresholds to nominate up to 25% of a companys board, where the company had already adopted a proxy access provision allowing 20 shareholders meeting certain ownership thresholds to nominate up to 20% of a companys board.

While the SEC staff has historically concurred in excluding this proposal on the basis of substantial implementation under these facts, the release notes that exclusion would not be appropriate under the proposed amendments, as the ability of an unlimited number of shareholders to aggregate their shareholdings would be an essential element of the proposal.

As another example, the SEC describes a proposal requesting a report from the companys board of directors on a particular topic, noting that the staff may determine that the company has not implemented an essential element of this proposal if the company has an existing report that comes from management, rather than the board.

Duplication exclusion Rule 14a-8(i)(11), the duplication exclusion, permits a company to exclude a shareholder proposal that  substantially duplicates another proposal previously submitted to the company by another proponent that will be included in the companys proxy materials for the same meeting (emphasis added).

The purpose of this exclusion is to eliminate the possibility of shareholders having to consider two or more substantially identical proposals submitted to an issuer by proponents acting independently of each other, and is utilized far less frequently than the substantial implementation exclusion.

To add clarity to this exclusion, the proposed amendments would provide that a proposal substantially duplicates another proposal if it addresses the same subject matter and seeks the same objective by the same means.

As an example of the change contemplated by this amendment, the release provides two proposals: (1) a proposal requesting that the company publish in newspapers a detailed statement of each of its direct or indirect political contributions or attempts to influence legislation; and (2) a proposal requesting a report to shareholders on the companys process for identifying and prioritizing legislative and regulatory public policy advocacy activities.

While the SEC staff historically has concurred with applying the duplication exclusion to these proposals, given that they concern the same subject matter, these proposals would not be deemed substantially duplicative under the proposed amendment, as they seek different objectives by different means.

The release also notes that the proposed amendments would reduce incentives for shareholder proponents to submit a proposal quickly, as the amendments would potentially enable consideration of a later-received proposal, even if similar and covering the same subject matter as the earlier proposal."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Amendments to Shareholder Proposal Rule,"Resubmission exclusion The resubmission exclusion in Rule 14a-8(i)(12), a rarely used basis for exclusion, allows a company to exclude a shareholder proposal if it addresses substantially the same subject matter as a proposal, or proposals, previously included in the companys proxy materials within the preceding five calendar years  if the issue was voted on at least once in the last three years and received support below specified thresholds (which were amended as recently as 2020).

The underlying rationale for this exclusion is to prevent companies from having to include proposals that have been recently presented for a shareholder vote and did not receive much support.

In 1983, the SEC specified that this exclusion would apply to a proposal with substantially the same subject matter as a prior proposal.

The proposed amendments would revise this standard to a proposal that substantially duplicates a prior proposal, which would be defined as a proposal that addresses the same subject matter and seeks the same objective by the same means as the prior proposal, matching the amendments proposed to the duplication exclusion.

The SEC believes that this change would enable shareholder proponents to make adjustments to their proposals to obtain broader support and allow other shareholders to offer their own proposals with different means of addressing the same issues.

The release provides two proposals as an example to which the resubmission exclusion applies under the existing standard but would not apply under the proposed amendment: (1) a proposal requesting that the board adopt a policy prohibiting the vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives due to a voluntary resignation to enter government service (a government service golden parachute); and (2) a proposal requesting that the board prepare a report to shareholders regarding the vesting of such government service golden parachutes that identifies eligible senior executives and the estimated dollar value of each senior executives government service golden parachute.

Although these proposals address the same subject matter, government service golden parachutes, according to the proposed amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(11), these proposals do not seek the same objectives by the same means and, therefore, the later proposal would not be excludable on this basis.

Observations and commentary If adopted, the paths to exclude shareholder proposals will continue to narrow.

After the publication of SLB 14L, which narrowed the ordinary business exclusion, the 2022 proxy season has seen dramatic declines in the success rate of companies attempting to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements for a shareholder vote.

The proposed rules, if adopted, will further narrow the fact patterns in which these bases would be available to companies.

This is particularly important for the substantial implementation exclusion, which historically has been one of the most commonly used bases.

Final rules, if adopted as proposed, would meaningfully alter the rate at which these requests are granted  and would leave companies with significantly reduced options compared to a couple of years ago for excluding a shareholder proposal from their proxy statements.

This narrowing of options is especially important given the significant increases in shareholder proposals in recent years, including many covering matters related to environmental, social and governance factors."
Cooley,"Illinois Expands Bereavement Leave Requirements Effective January 1, 2023","Illinois recently enacted amendments to the states Child Bereavement Leave Act, which expand the circumstances for which bereavement leave is available.

Effective January 1, 2023, the bereavement leave law will be known as the Family Bereavement Leave Act.

In addition to unpaid leave for bereavement related to the loss of a child, the amended law will require unpaid leave for bereavement related to the loss of other family members, as well as for absences due to miscarriage or stillbirth, failed adoption or surrogacy agreement, and other fertility-related reasons.

Unpaid bereavement leave entitlement The Family Bereavement Leave Act will require employers to provide up to two weeks (10 workdays) of unpaid bereavement leave for employees to: Attend the funeral or alternative to a funeral of a covered family member.

Make arrangements necessitated by the death of the covered family member.

Grieve the death of the covered family member.

Be absent from work due to: A miscarriage or stillbirth.

An unsuccessful round of intrauterine insemination or an assisted reproductive technology procedure.

A failed adoption match or an adoption that is not finalized because it is contested by another party.

A failed surrogacy agreement.

A diagnosis that negatively impacts pregnancy or fertility.

Covered family members are an employees child, stepchild, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, parent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchild, grandparent or stepparent.

For purposes of the amended law, a domestic partner is a person legally recognized as an employees domestic partner, or a person in a committed, personal relationship with the employee (and who is not in a domestic partnership with any other person) whom the employee designates to the employer as that employees domestic partner.

In the event of the death of more than one covered family member in a 12-month period, an employee is entitled to up to six total weeks of bereavement leave during the 12-month period.

The Illinois bereavement leave requirement does not allow an employee to take unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or in addition to the unpaid leave time permitted by, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.

Leave procedures An employee has to provide the employer with at least 48 hours notice of the employees intention to take bereavement leave, unless providing this notice is not reasonable and practicable.

Bereavement leave must be completed within 60 days after the employee receives notice of the death of the covered family member or the date on which a miscarriage, stillbirth, failed adoption or surrogacy agreement, or other covered fertility-related reason occurs.

An employer cannot require employees to identify which category of event the leave pertains to as a condition of taking leave, but an employer can require reasonable documentation to substantiate the leave.

For leave resulting from a miscarriage or stillbirth, failed adoption or surrogacy agreement, or other covered fertility-related reason, reasonable documentation is a form provided by the Illinois Department of Labor and filled out by a health care practitioner or documentation from the adoption or surrogacy organization.

Penalties The civil penalties for violating the bereavement leave law, or retaliating against employees for exercising their rights under the law, remain the same: for a first offense, a civil penalty of up to $500 for each employee affected, and for a second or subsequent offense, a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each employee affected.

A court also can grant equitable relief.

Illinois employers should review the new bereavement leave requirements and update their policies and practices with respect to bereavement leave accordingly.

If you have any questions about or related to Illinois leave requirements, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,What Is Broadband? FCC Chair Proposes New Standards for Answering That Question,"Beginning a process that will lead to a report on the availability of broadband service in the US, Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has proposed that the FCC adopt new standards for what qualifies as broadband internet access service and for determining whether broadband deployment is sufficient to meet American needs.

The proposal would be the first update to the broadband standards in many years and could have a significant effect on FCC internet policies, including whether it will reinstate its network neutrality rules.

Under the Communications Act, the FCC is required to report annually on whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed on a reasonable and timely basis.

This evaluation is based on the FCCs determination of what qualifies as advanced telecommunications capability, which it has changed as technology evolves and historically has been based on the speeds available from internet access providers.

The FCC last adopted a new standard in 2015, when it set the minimum speed for advanced services at 25 megabits per second (Mbps) downstream and 3 Mbps upstream.

Chairwoman Rosenworcel is proposing to raise the minimum speed for broadband to 100 Mbps/20 Mbps.

This will reduce the percentage of the country that is deemed to have broadband service and make it harder for the FCC to conclude that broadband is being deployed on a reasonable and timely basis.

She also is proposing to set a national goal of 1 gigabit per second downstream and 500 Mbps upstream speeds for the future, although that would not be a binding standard.

In addition, Chairwoman Rosenworcel has proposed that, for the first time, the FCC consider affordability, adoption, availability, and equitable access in determining whether broadband is being deployed sufficiently.

This would broaden the scope of the FCC review beyond the percentage of the population that has access to service at benchmark speeds to a wider range of issues, including whether certain groups, such as low-income households or members of minority groups, can obtain access at the benchmark speed.

This more granular analysis also would make it more difficult for the FCC to conclude that broadband is being deployed on a reasonable and timely basis.

The impact of adopting Chairwoman Rosenworcels proposals could be significant.

For instance, the FCC has used determinations about the availability of broadband service in considering whether to adopt network neutrality rules.

For that reason, any change that leads to a determination that broadband is not being deployed in a reasonable and timely manner could result in regulatory changes.

The FCC proceeding that will consider these proposals is in a preliminary stage, and the FCC has not yet requested comments on broadband availability.

As the FCC currently has two Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners, it is possible that the Republican commissioners could block including these proposals in the final request for comments.

Nevertheless, Chairwoman Rosenworcels announcement almost certainly will trigger comments on these issues no matter what is included in the notice, and once the fifth FCC commissioner is confirmed, it is likely that these proposals will be adopted in the final broadband deployment report."
Cooley,"CFPB Tightens Obligations of Credit Bureaus, Users Under FCRA’s ‘Permissible Purpose’ Provisions","On July 7, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an advisory opinion interpreting the permissible purpose provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

The advisory opinion states that consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) may not share consumer reports unless they have reason to believe a user has a legally permissible purpose for requesting the information, and that the information it provides relates to the consumer subject to the request.

The opinion also makes clear that CRAs and users of consumer reports have specific obligations to protect consumers privacy and may face criminal liabilities for violating FCRAs permissible purpose provisions.

Overview of CFPBs advisory opinion The advisory opinion comes against the backdrop of a number of CFPB initiatives and announcements related to credit reporting, including a recent CFPB interpretive rule that encouraged states to pass more laws regulating the credit reporting industry .

The opinion also builds on a CFPB advisory opinion warning CRAs that the use of name-only matching procedures to match information to consumers does not satisfy their obligation to assure maximum possible accuracy in consumer reports.

Further, it comes in the wake of the CFPBs April 2022 lawsuit against a CRA for alleged violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

Specifically, the CFPBs advisory opinion outlines its interpretation of obligations of CRAs and consumer report users under FCRAs permissible purpose provisions, including that: FCRA identifies a limited set of permissible purposes for which a CRA may provide a consumer report to a user, such as to determine an individuals eligibility for credit, employment or housing.

CRAs may not provide a consumer report pursuant to FCRA under any circumstance not expressly permitted by the statutes permissible purpose section.

The permissible purposes authorized by FCRA are consumer specific and only apply with respect to the consumer who is the subject of the users request.

A CRA may only provide a consumer report to a user if it has reason to believe that the user has a permissible purpose for requesting information about the individual.

A CRA must also have reason to believe that all of the information it includes in a consumer report relates to the specific consumer who is the subject of the request.

Accordingly, a users mere request to obtain consumer information does not provide a CRA with a reason to believe the user has a permissible purpose for doing so.

Using name-only matching procedures or insufficient identifiers to match information to consumers also does not give a CRA reason to believe all of the information it provides pertains to the consumer and, thus, can result in CRAs providing consumer information to users who lack a permissible purpose, as well as violations of consumers privacy.

Providing consumer reports of multiple people as possible matches without taking steps to identify the individual subject to the request also is not permissible.

The use of disclaimers by CRAs about insufficient matching procedures in their consumer reports does not cure a violation of FCRAs permissible purpose requirements.

Users of consumer reports are strictly prohibited from using or obtaining consumer reports without a permissible purpose.

CRAs and users of consumer reports, including their agents and employees, may face criminal liability for violating these requirements, such as by obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or providing consumer information to unauthorized persons.

What to expect CRAs and other participants in the credit reporting market have received significant attention from the CFPB in recent months."
Cooley,"CFPB Tightens Obligations of Credit Bureaus, Users Under FCRA’s ‘Permissible Purpose’ Provisions","What to expect CRAs and other participants in the credit reporting market have received significant attention from the CFPB in recent months.

The advisory opinion is yet another example of the bureaus focus on the credit reporting industry, and it sends the message that the CFPB will not hesitate to take action against entities it deems to be in violation of FCRAs permissible purpose provisions and thereby failing to adequately protect consumers privacy.

This is underscored by the multiple citations within the advisory opinion to past CFPB and Federal Trade Commission enforcement actions concerning violations of FCRAs permissible purpose provisions.

The CFPB says the advisory opinion applies to all consumer reporting agencies  not only to the nationwide CRAs.

CRAs of all sizes, including specialty CRAs, should review their policies and procedures to determine whether these are reasonably designed to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information included in consumer reports and comply with FCRAs permissible purpose provisions.

Importantly, CRAs also should consider whether they are taking sufficient steps to match information to the consumer who is the subject of the report prior to providing that report to users.

Users of consumer reports should similarly review existing processes to make sure that they have a permissible purpose under FCRA for requesting and obtaining consumer reports and that the permissible purpose is consistent with the purpose certified to the CRA from which the report is obtained.

Advisory opinions are issued by the CFPB pursuant to its Advisory Opinions Policy , which was announced in 2020.

Under the policy, stakeholders may submit requests for the bureau to issue an advisory opinion, which takes the form of an interpretive rule, to resolve regulatory uncertainty.

Issuance of advisory opinions is consistent with the bureaus increased reliance on guidance to convey supervisory expectations on a broad range of consumer financial protection issues, as recently announced by Director Rohit Chopra .

To that end, on June 29, the CFPB issued an advisory opinion warning debt collectors that convenience fees may violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act .

In May, the CFPB issued two circulars, one involving the misuse of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations name or logo , and another reminding creditors using complex algorithmic credit models of their obligation to provide clear adverse action notices to consumers .

We expect the bureau will continue to leverage the use of guidance to communicate its positions on consumer financial protection laws as a way to regulate industry conduct without using traditional rulemaking processes."
Cooley,Colorado’s New Limitations on Restrictive Covenants Take Effect in August 2022,"Effective August 10, 2022, Colorado employers will need to comply with significant new limitations on noncompete agreements and other post-termination restrictive covenants.

The Colorado legislature passed House Bill 22-1317 , which imposes new employee income thresholds on noncompete and customer nonsolicitation agreements, and includes additional notice, venue and choice of law rules for restrictive covenants.

HB 22-1317 builds on Colorados existing restrictive covenant statute (CRS 8-2-113), which already restricts the use of noncompete and customer nonsolicitation agreements to limited situations, and imposes criminal liability and fines for violations of the states noncompete rules.

Colorados existing noncompete statute Under CRS 8-2-113, Colorado employers currently are prohibited from entering into noncompete agreements, including customer nonsolicitation provisions, unless the restrictive covenant is one of the following: Part of a contract for the purchase and sale of a business or its assets.

Part of a contract for the protection of trade secrets.

Part of a contractual provision providing for recovery of the expense of educating and training an employee who has worked for an employer for less than two years.

Entered into with executive and management personnel and officers and employees who constitute business professionals to executive and management personnel.

Though this statute has been in effect for years, Colorado recently introduced criminal liability for violations of the restrictive covenant requirements.

As of March 1, 2022, any violation of the noncompete and customer nonsolicitation restrictions in CRS 8-2-113 is classified as a class 2 misdemeanor, which could lead to up to 120 days in prison and/or a $750 fine.

New limitations on restrictive covenants Beginning August 10, 2022, HB 22-1317 will further limit the use of restrictive covenants in Colorado.

The new laws requirements (summarized below) will apply to any agreements entered into with Colorado employees on or after August 10, 2022.

Restrictive covenants entered into on or after that date must comply with these new requirements or otherwise will be void .

Failure to comply also subjects employers to serious penalties.

Although HB 22-1317 does not explicitly address independent contractors, Colorado courts have extended CRS 8-2-113 to independent contractors in the past and may follow suit with the amended statute.

Highly compensated salary thresholds Most significantly, noncompete and customer nonsolicitation agreements, with limited exceptions, will be void unless the employees meet certain salary thresholds for highly compensated workers at the time the agreement is entered into and at the time it is enforced.

For noncompete agreements , employees must earn $101,250 annually (or the adjusted salary threshold then in effect).

For customer nonsolicitation agreements , the employee must earn at least 60% of the highly compensated threshold (currently $60,750 ).

In addition to these new salary threshold requirements, a restrictive covenant in Colorado must be no broader than reasonably necessary to protect the employers legitimate interests in trade secrets.

Nevertheless, certain existing exceptions for restrictive covenants will remain in effect under the new statute.

For example, even if the applicable salary threshold is not met, a noncompete or customer nonsolicitation restriction will be permissible in connection with the purchase and sale of a business or its assets, as well as in agreements providing for recovery of training and education expenses.

However, in order for an employer to make use the training and education exception, the training must be distinct from standard on-the-job training, and recovery of expenses must be limited to the reasonable costs of the training and decrease over time after completion of the applicable training."
Cooley,Colorado’s New Limitations on Restrictive Covenants Take Effect in August 2022,"Additionally, HB 22-1317 still permits reasonable confidentiality provisions as long as they do not prohibit the disclosure of: Information arising from the workers general training, knowledge, skill or experience.

Information that is readily ascertainable by the public.

Information that the worker otherwise has a legal right to disclose.

Strict notice requirements Under HB 22-1317, employers must provide notice of a noncompete or customer nonsolicitation restriction to prospective employees before they accept an offer of employment .

For existing employees , such notice must be provided at least 14 days before either the effective date of the restrictive covenant or the effective date of the change(s) in the employees terms or conditions of employment that serve as consideration for the midstream restrictive covenant.

Notice under HB 22-1317 also must identify the agreement by name, state that the agreement contains a covenant not to compete and/or a customer nonsolicitation restriction, and direct the worker to the specific sections or paragraphs of the agreement that contain the restrictive covenant(s).

Additionally, the notice must be provided in a separate document signed by the employee and accompanied by a copy of the restrictive covenant agreement.

Colorado governing law and venue required HB 22-1317 also mandates the use of Colorado law and venue in all agreements containing covered restrictive covenants.

If the employee primarily resides and works in Colorado as of the date of termination, the restrictive covenants agreement cannot require adjudication outside of Colorado.

Additional penalties for noncompliance In addition to existing criminal liabilities for violation of CRS 8-2-113, employers may now be subject to additional penalties for entering into, presenting or attempting to enforce any restrictive covenant that is void.

Employers that violate the provision may be liable for a penalty of $5,000 for each worker or prospective worker, as well as actual damages, injunctive relief, reasonable costs and attorneys fees.

Insight and next steps Employers with Colorado employees should review their restrictive covenant agreements and prepare to comply with HB 22-1317s new requirements, which will apply to agreements entered into or renewed on or after August 10, 2022.

When proposing and entering into noncompete and customer nonsolicitation agreements, employers should ensure that the employees meet the applicable salary thresholds or that the agreements otherwise satisfy one of the statutory exceptions.

Employers also should tailor restrictive covenants to be no broader than reasonably necessary to protect their legitimate interests in trade secrets and prepare the required notices to be provided alongside any restrictive covenants.

SEC insider trading charge highlights risks of remote work On June 29, the SEC announced insider trading charges against an individual for illegally trading in a companys securities in advance of an announcement of a potential acquisition of the company.

According to the complaint , the defendants domestic partner was an employee of the target company and the defendant and employee worked out of their shared home, where the employee allegedly discussed the potential acquisition in the defendants presence.

Using this information, the defendant purchased call options one day before the acquisition was announced, resulting in unlawful profits after the stock price rose.

This case serves as a stark example of the risks posed by remote working environments and is an important reminder to use caution when discussing  or otherwise making available  any material nonpublic information, even when at home and around trusted people.

SEC updates electronic filing requirements On June 3, the SEC announced that it had adopted amendments to require certain forms that currently may be submitted on paper to be filed electronically through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, as well as mandating the use of Inline XBRL structured data language for submitting financial information required in Form 11-K. Key documents that now require electronic filing include the glossy annual report, Form 144 and Form 6-K, with the new rules also permitting electronic submission of certain foreign language documents.

These changes will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register and include specific transition periods for the documents covered by the amendments.

Georgeson releases early proxy season review Georgeson recently published its 2022 early proxy season review summarizing submission and voting trends for environmental and social shareholder proposals at Russell 3000 companies during the 2022 proxy season.

Key takeaways from the report, which reflects proposals through May 16, include: There were 924 shareholder proposals submitted, significantly surpassing the record-breaking number of submissions in the 2021 season."
Cooley,Public Companies Update – July One-Minute Reads,"While environmental, social and governance (ESG) shareholder proposals increased more than 10% year over year, shareholder support for environmental and social (E&S) proposals declined significantly  from 35% to 20% of environmental proposals this season and from 18% to 9% of social proposals this season.

Of the 71 shareholder proposals including greenhouse gas reduction strategies or targets, 56 requested inclusion of Scope 3 emissions; only four of the 56 proposals passed, with eight failing and 31 being withdrawn (the results for the remainder have yet to be revealed).

While the number of shareholder proposals increased, the number of governance proposals declined 10% year over year.

Vanguard speaks on say on climate In May, Vanguard published its current perspective on say on climate proposals, which discourages companies from holding say on climate votes, given the substance of the proposals and the lack of established standards.

Vanguard did, however, recognize the value of say on climate votes at companies where climate change-related risks are material, as a vote could help inform investor perspectives.

If a company does choose to hold a vote, Vanguard expects the company to provide clear disclosure of the rationale, detail the oversight mechanisms and implications of the vote, and produce robust reporting in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.

The Conference Board publishes report on diversity and ESG expertise On May 19, The Conference Board published Board Composition: Diversity, Experience, and Effectiveness , a report exploring current trends in ESG expertise and board diversity  and their implications on board composition, size and education.

The report found that the percentage of directors with experience in business strategy decreased, even though operational and financial experience increased.

The report cautioned that while companies may be attracting directors with knowledge in specific areas  boards should not sacrifice business strategy experience to achieve functional expertise.

Additional key takeaways from the report include: The percentage of directors with international experience decreased  in the S&P 500 from 19.6% in 2018 to 14.4% in 2021 and in the Russell 3000 from 10% in 2018 to 8.1% in 2021.

Companies are increasingly using in-house and outside resources for director education; the usage of both in the S&P 500 grew from 25.3% in 2018 to 29.1% in 2021 and in the Russell 3000 from 11.8% in 2018 to 16.4% in 2021.

While board diversity disclosures have increased significantly, that increase has not been matched by increases in racial/ethnic diversity of the boards themselves  disclosures in the S&P 500 grew from 11.4% in 2018 to 73.3% in 2021.

Board sizes are growing, which may be attributable to company efforts to increase diversity and specialty expertise on their boards.

The number of women on boards continues to grow, with women now holding 30% of board seats in the S&P 500 and 24% of board seats in the Russell 3000.

Cooley,CFPB Targets Convenience Fees,"On June 29, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an advisory opinion declaring that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) prohibits debt collectors from collecting pay-to-pay or convenience fees unless applicable law or the agreement creating the debt expressly authorizes the fee.

According to the opinion, debt collectors also may be acting in violation of the FDCPA when using a third-party payment processor that charges such fees, if the processor remits to the collector any amount in connection with that fee.

The CFPB considers convenience fees to include any fees incurred by consumers to make payments to a debt collector through a particular channel, such as by phone or online.

The CFPBs opinion and accompanying press release follow a number of recent pronouncements by the agency focusing on what it considers to be junk fees.

The opinion also serves as a signal to debt collectors and original creditors that the CFPB may subject convenience fees to more exacting scrutiny, whether under the FDCPA or the prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA).

Overview of CFPBs advisory opinion The CFPBs advisory opinion builds on the agencys prior statements in Bulletin 2017-01 .

It also provides new insight into the CFPBs narrow interpretation of when the FDCPA allows the collection of convenience fees and scope of potential liability when using a payment processor that collects convenience fees.

Section 1692f(1) of the FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from collecting any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.

In a view that the CFPB acknowledges departs from the interpretation of some courts, the advisory opinion reaffirms the CFPBs position that: Convenience fees are amounts subject to Section 1692f(1).

Debt collectors may collect convenience fees under Section 1692f(1) only when (1) the agreement creating the debt expressly permits the charge and some law does not prohibit it; or (2) some law expressly permits the charge, even if the agreement creating the debt is silent.

When the law neither expressly authorizes nor expressly prohibits a fee, it is not permitted by law.

In that circumstance, a debt collector may not collect the fee unless the agreement creating the debt expressly permits the fee.

Debt collectors violate Section 1692f(1) when they use a payment processor that collects a convenience fee from a consumer and remits to the debt collector any amount in connection with that fee.

Further, the opinion rejects the notion adopted by some courts that state contract law permits debt collectors to collect fees that are the subject of a separate agreement.

In the CFPBs view, the FDCPA only permits collecting amounts authorized by contract when the amount is expressly authorized by the contract creating the debt.

CFPBs opinion may signal scrutiny beyond debt collectors subject to FDCPA The CFPBs advisory opinion purportedly speaks to just debt collectors  those that regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed to another  under the FDCPA.

However, the opinions potential implications are much broader.

Notably, earlier guidance suggests that the CFPB could take the view that the opinion reaches all covered persons, including original creditors, that collect or use a third-party payment processor that collects convenience fees.

The advisory opinion cautions that even if convenience fees comply with Section 1692f(1) of the FDCPA, debt collectors must still take care to comply with  the [CFPAs] prohibition on [UDAAP], when assessing [convenience] fees."
Cooley,CFPB Targets Convenience Fees,"The CFPB in Bulletin 2013-07 also took the position that original creditors collecting on their own debt  though not subject to the FDCPA  may violate the CFPAs UDAAP prohibitions by engaging in conduct prohibited by the FDCPA.

Bulletin 2013-07 expressly identified a violation of Section 1692f(1) of the FDCPA as a potential UDAAP.

Accordingly, the CFPB could take the position that covered persons under the CFPA that collect, or use a third-party payment processor that collects, convenience fees not allowed by Section 1692f(1) violate federal law, regardless of whether they are subject to the FDCPA.

The CFPBs announcement is yet another reminder that institutions must understand their fee assessment practices  and those of their vendors.

This includes not just understanding what fees are charged and when, but also how those fees are disclosed and whether there is a basis for doing so."
Cooley,US Supreme Court to Review Department of Justice Dismissal Authority,"On June 21, 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to review a US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit decision holding that the federal governments ability to dismiss False Claims Act (FCA) lawsuits is controlled by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41, rather than being foreclosed by the governments decision not to intervene.

Rule 41 provides that a court may grant a plaintiffs request to dismiss a case on terms that the court considers proper.

1

The Supreme Courts decision to review this case signals an interest in potentially resolving a decades-long split over the scope of the governments authority to dismiss FCA cases, and the applicable legal standard.

The FCA allows private actors to sue individuals or entities for submitting false or fraudulent claims to the government.

A plaintiff  known as a relator  must file suit under seal and provide notice to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which can investigate and determine whether to intervene and pursue the litigation itself.

If the government decides to pursue the litigation, the relator still retains some rights to continue as a party to the action, but cannot prevent the government from later dismissing the action, as long as the relator receives notice and the opportunity for a hearing.

2

If the government declines to intervene, the relator can still pursue a civil suit against the defendant and share any recovery with the United States.

The key issue in the Third Circuit was whether the government has any authority to dismiss an FCA suit after initially declining to intervene.

Polansky v. Exec. Health Res. , 17 F.4th 376, 393 (3d Cir. 2021), involved a qui tam suit filed in 2012 by a former employee of Executive Health Resources, alleging the company was falsely certifying that inpatient hospital admissions were medically necessary in order to obtain higher reimbursement rates.

The DOJ investigated and declined to intervene.

Seven years after the suit was filed, as the parties were preparing for summary judgment, the government moved to dismiss the case in district court.

The dismissal was granted and later affirmed by the Third Circuit, which ruled that although the government must intervene before seeking to dismiss, its motion to dismiss was effectively a combined motion to intervene and dismiss.

The court rejected Polanskys argument that the government lost its right to seek dismissal because it declined to intervene.

Following the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit, the Third Circuit held that the governments request for dismissal was governed by Federal Rule 41(a).

That is, when the litigation has progressed beyond the filing of an answer, the action may be dismissed at the plaintiffs request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.

3

In practice, that is a relatively low threshold to dismissal.

The Supreme Courts review of this case should provide needed clarity as the government continues to take a closer look at qui tam suits and seeks to weed out frivolous cases or those that conflict with government priorities.

This initiative stems from the 2018 DOJ memorandum, known as the Granston memo, which advised DOJ attorneys to consider seeking dismissal to achieve seven goals including to  prevent parasitic or opportunistic qui tam actions .

The resulting increase in dismissal motions exacerbated a circuit split on when dismissal is appropriate.

The standard adopted by the District of Columbia Circuit provides that the government has an unfettered right to dismiss an FCA case.

4

The Ninth and Tenth Circuits, however, curbed the governments ability somewhat by requiring the government to identify a valid governmental purpose and show the relationship between the purpose and dismissal.

5 Relators also can defeat dismissal by showing that it would be arbitrary and capricious."
Cooley,US Supreme Court to Review Department of Justice Dismissal Authority,"5 Relators also can defeat dismissal by showing that it would be arbitrary and capricious.

6 In 2020, the Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either rule and instead applied the standard set forth in Rule41(a), a move endorsed by the Third Circuit in Polansky .

What does this mean for the future of qui tam litigation?

The Supreme Courts decision in this case hopefully will provide needed clarity about the governments role and appropriate procedures for FCA cases.

The government opposed Polanskys petition on grounds that the FCA is best read to preserve the Executive Branchs virtually unfettered discretion to dismiss an action brought in the name of the United States to remedy a wrong done to the United States.

If the Supreme Court rejects that interpretation and agrees with Polansky  that the government loses its authority to dismiss if it declines to intervene  it would vastly undercut the governments authority over and ability to manage FCA litigation, and could raise constitutional concerns about the FCAs whistleblower provisions.

On the other hand, a decision that Rule 41 applies or that the government must simply provide a rational basis for dismissal would help to cement the governments dismissal authority, but likely result in little noticeable change to the state of FCA litigation.

Cooley,"CFPB Paves Way for Increased State Regulation, Enforcement of Credit Reporting Practices","On June 28, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an interpretive rule under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) clarifying that states have the ability to protect their residents by enacting their own fair credit reporting laws, notwithstanding existing federal law.

Specifically, the interpretive rule highlights the bureaus position that the FCRA preempts state laws regulating the conduct of consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), furnishers and users of consumer reports only in certain limited, enumerated instances.

The CFPBs rule emphasizes that states can enhance consumer protections by passing stricter laws regulating credit reporting practices when expressly not preempted by the federal statute.

Preemption under the FCRA The interpretive rule states that: State fair credit reporting laws that are more protective of consumers than the FCRA are generally not preempted unless they fall within one of the preemption categories enumerated under FCRA Section 1681t(b).

The FCRAs express preemption categories are narrow and targeted in scope, as they only relate to the specific conduct required or subject matter regulated under each preemption provision.

Thus, if a state law does not concern the subject matter or conduct regulated under a FCRA preemption category, it is not preempted.

The FCRA generally only regulates how long certain information (e.g., bankruptcies) can continue to appear on a consumer report, but does not otherwise preempt state requirements related to whether  or when  certain information can initially be included in a consumer report.

The interpretive rule provides examples of state fair credit reporting laws that would not, according to the bureau, be preempted by the FCRA  which, not surprisingly, focus on many of the same issues the bureau has flagged in recent months: State laws forbidding CRAs from including information about medical debt, eviction information, arrest records, or rental arrears in a consumer report (or from including such information only after a certain period of time).

State laws prohibiting furnishers from reporting certain information to CRAs, such as medical debt, or requiring that furnishers report certain information only after a period of time.

State laws requiring that CRAs provide, at the consumers request, disclosures and information covered by the FCRA in languages other than English.

What to expect?

Most states already have enacted their own fair credit reporting laws, but only a handful of them, such as California, confer additional protections to those provided under the FCRA.

The interpretive rule paves the way for states to more strictly regulate credit reporting practices at the local level.

A state-by-state approach  tailored to each state legislatures specific agenda and priorities  would require the credit reporting industry to comply with a patchwork of state statutes, in addition to the FCRA.

Additionally, the interpretive rule hits on two recent CFPB initiatives.

First, it is another example of the CFPBs recent efforts to encourage states to become more active in a number of consumer protection areas, including by pursuing enforcement under the Consumer Financial Protection Act and state laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and practices.

Second, it reiterates the CFPBs renewed focus on medical debt reporting , which has been the subject of three separate guidance documents published by the bureau since the beginning of the year.

Consistent with Director Rohit Chopras position that medical debt should not be included in consumer report due to its lower predictive value , the CFPBs push for states to regulate the furnishing and reporting of medical debt does not come as a surprise.

The interpretive rule takes a similar position with respect to rental history and eviction records, indicating that such information is critical to consumers access to housing and credit but often rife with errors."
Cooley,"CFPB Paves Way for Increased State Regulation, Enforcement of Credit Reporting Practices","Furnishers of medical debt data or rental information should thus expect increased scrutiny by the bureau, as well as stricter regulations at the state level.

Finally, while the interpretive rule gives the green light for states to enact stricter fair credit reporting laws, we also expect that zealous state attorneys general and regulators will leverage the CFPBs reasoning to limit the scope of the FCRAs preemption under their existing state credit reporting requirements."
Cooley,How Companies Can Hedge Risk of Mass Arbitration,"Mass arbitration is a recent trend where companies are hit with thousands of identical consumer or employment arbitration claims.

Led by a resourceful plaintiffs bar that uses targeted online ads to locate potential claimants, coordinated groups of consumers and employees are weaponizing arbitration agreements to create massive leverage against technology companies.

The consequences for companies and employers are stark: Under the applicable arbitration rules or the companys arbitration agreement, the company pays most of the filing and arbitrator fees in consumer or employment arbitrations.

With millions of dollars in initial filing fees alone in a mass arbitration, companies must consider of how to mitigate the risk of this emerging form of claim.

Background For years, companies have included a combination of arbitration clauses and class action waivers in their terms of service, terms of use, and user agreements.

For consumers and employees who accepted the arbitration agreement, they were bound to arbitrate on an individualized basis.

In practical terms, this strategy limited the exposure these companies faced from large class action litigation, and allowed consumers and employees to bring claims in a more efficient forum.

However, in a calculated move to overwhelm companies with the prospect of astonishingly high institutional arbitration fees, plaintiffs firms turned to social media and online claim aggregators to enlist thousands of consumers and employees, often without sufficient prior vetting of the claims.

Recent changes in the fee schedules for arbitration institutions, which require the company to pay for the majority of fees  as well as commitments many companies have made in their arbitration clauses to pay most or all of the fees  have allowed these plaintiffs firms to create significant pressure without having to invest in the case.

For companies facing mass arbitration, the financial consequences are significant.

Under most arbitration rules, the company is on the hook for filing and administrative fees  regardless of whether the claims have any merit.

As a result, the initial filing costs borne by companies can quickly escalate into the millions of dollars.

To make matters worse, California adopted legislation requiring companies to pay arbitration fees within 30 days of the due date, and added sanctions for failure to pay, including plaintiffs attorney fees or the case being removed to court.

While the mass arbitration phenomenon began several years ago, it appears to be gaining momentum, with new plaintiffs firms entering the market.

Recent cases involving Amazon, Uber, DoorDash, Postmates and Intuit demonstrate that companies targeted with mass filings face the undesirable choice of having to pay millions of dollars in arbitration fees upfront or liquidating the plaintiffs firms with substantial settlement amounts under the threat of many more cases being filed after the initial wave.

How to mitigate the risk of mass arbitration While the law regarding mass arbitrations is continuing to develop, some strategies to mitigate the risk do exist.

To be successful, a company must implement these strategies before it receives notice of a mass arbitration.

Not all of these strategies have been tested before courts, and companies need to ensure their clause remains free of unconscionable provisions that could put the arbitration agreement as a whole at risk.

Some strategies that companies should consider when revising their existing arbitration agreements are listed below.

Include small claims court options Dispute resolution clauses should preserve both parties right to opt for small claims courts, where available, due to their much lower (and usually nominal) fees."
Cooley,How Companies Can Hedge Risk of Mass Arbitration,"Include small claims court options Dispute resolution clauses should preserve both parties right to opt for small claims courts, where available, due to their much lower (and usually nominal) fees.

Reconsider delegation clauses Not all threshold issues need to be sent to an arbitrator for resolution via a delegation clause (i.e., a provision where the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide gateway issues around arbitrability).

Companies also should take care in drafting carve outs to delegation clauses for certain threshold issues to avoid incurring unnecessary arbitration fees (e.g., whether the parties have complied with any pre-arbitration steps or whether the plaintiffs have violated the class action waiver in the agreement).

Use an alternative arbitration provider Companies should compare and carefully select the most cost-effective arbitration provider for their needs.

Not all arbitral institutions have adopted specific rules and protocols to address mass arbitrations.

Opt for ad hoc arbitration Another approach to drastically diminish the arbitration costs is to opt for ad hoc arbitration (i.e. , arbitration not administered by an institution).

However, there are drawbacks to this approach, including forgoing the advantages of established rules and an administering institution, particularly when thousands of individual claims are filed.

Mandate a pre-dispute resolution process An option to decrease costs and ensure that only serious claimants participate in the dispute resolution process would be to provide a tiered clause that includes mandatory individualized conferences prior to initiating arbitration.

Require individual requests for arbitration To further deter unmeritorious claims, companies should add provisions requiring claimants to file individual requests for arbitration, setting out the identity of the plaintiff and the plaintiffs counsel, a detailed description of the legal claims being asserted and the requested relief, including a good-faith calculation of the specific amount in dispute.

Revise cost-splitting provisions To the extent permitted under applicable law and arbitration rules, companies should remove unconditional promises to pay arbitration filing fees from their terms of use.

Similarly, discretion should be given to allow for fee shifting against claimants who brought frivolous or vexatious claims.

Consider batch arbitration Companies should strongly consider a clause that requires mass arbitrations to be consolidated into batches to allow for more streamlined dispute resolution.

Such a clause also can benefit consumers, as it will allow for a more efficient adjudication of their claims.

For example, the arbitration clause could provide that when 100 or more requests of a similar nature are filed at the same time, the arbitrations will be administered in batches of 100 cases each, with one arbitrator and one set of administrative fees per batch.

Utilize online dispute resolution (ODR)

In recent years, ODR has started to gain traction as an alternative to more conventional forms of dispute resolution.

Ecommerce companies, for example, have successfully utilized ODR platforms to resolve a high number of consumer disputes every year.

Although this approach is yet to be widely tested outside of ecommerce, it offers the benefit of significantly decreasing the costs that often are incurred in traditional arbitration.

Remove mandatory arbitration provisions Finally, companies may want to reconsider whether individual mandatory arbitration still represents the best dispute resolution system for their needs.

Some companies already have opted to revert to court litigation and class actions, although the majority  even after having to face a mass arbitration  continue to use arbitration, albeit with several of the risk mitigation strategies described above."
Cooley,How Companies Can Hedge Risk of Mass Arbitration,"Insight and next steps The risk of mass arbitrations continues to grow, and companies should no longer ignore the threat posed by this litigation strategy.

Arbitration clauses in terms of service, terms of use, and user agreements should be drafted (or amended) carefully with a forward-thinking approach, giving due consideration to the unique challenges mass arbitrations pose.

To that end, companies should not reflexively keep the same arbitration agreement on which they have relied for so long.

They should instead explore alternative and more tailored solutions that meet the needs of their customer base or employees, while also ensuring a fair and reasonable dispute resolution process for themselves.

Cooley,Corporate Criminal Liability in the UK – What’s&nbsp;Next?,"On 10 June 2022, the UK Law Commission published the results of its review into the laws that govern corporate criminal liability in the UK and its proposals to reform them .

There has been a long-held concern amongst enforcement authorities, and legal commentators, that current UK law makes it exceptionally difficult to hold global organisations with complex management structures liable for criminal offences.

Serious Fraud Office Director Lisa Osofsky acknowledged as long ago as 2018 that the SFO finds itself hamstrung by the identification principle, which made sense 100-odd years ago, when corporations were run by two, three or four people.

1

Under the existing identification principle, the prosecution must demonstrate that the directing mind or will  typically the most senior manager(s) and/or director(s) of the entity  was personally engaged in the relevant criminal conduct.

Recent case law has interpreted the concept of the directing mind or will very narrowly and, as a result, has made it even more difficult for a company to be found liable for a criminal offence.

2 Proposals for reform In good news for companies under investigation, the Law Commission rejected a complete shift to the American system, which is more akin to the concept of vicarious liability whereby companies are held responsible for any criminal act committed by any employee acting in the course of their employment with an intention of benefitting the company.

Instead, the Law Commissions options paper sets out 10 possibilities for how to reform the law in this area: Retain the existing rules where a prosecutor must demonstrate the directing mind or will of the company was involved in the criminal conduct.

Create a new offence of failing to prevent certain identified fraud offences (e.g., fraud by false representation, false accounting, etc.)

by an associated person, who also may be an employee of agent.

Create a new offence of failing to prevent human rights abuses.

Create a new offence of failing to prevent ill-treatment or neglect.

Create a new offence of failing to prevent computer misuse.

Make publicity orders available in all cases where a company is convicted of an offence.

Introduce a regime of administratively imposed monetary penalties.

Under this proposal, if someone associated with the company committed fraud which was intended to benefit the company, then the company would be liable for paying a fine unless it could show it took reasonable precautions to prevent the wrongdoing.

Introduce new civil actions in the High Court based on the Serious Crime Prevention Orders.

The new regime would contain powers to impose monetary penalties, as well as punitive and preventative measures, on a company found to have behaved in a way that was likely to facilitate fraud.

Introduce a new reporting requirement that would require companies to report the anti-fraud procedures they have in place to prevent fraud by their staff.

Allow the conduct to be attributed to a company if a member of the companys senior management engaged in, consented to or connived in the offence.

Two proposals were put forward for how to define senior management: Someone who plays a significant role in the making of decisions about how the whole or a substantial part of the organisations activities are to be managed or organised, or someone who actually manages or organises the whole or a substantial part of those activities.

As above, but where the CEO and chief financial officer automatically would be classed as senior managers.

There are two aspects of the Law Commissions report that are of particular note to stakeholders."
Cooley,Corporate Criminal Liability in the UK – What’s&nbsp;Next?,"There are two aspects of the Law Commissions report that are of particular note to stakeholders.

Firstly, as is currently available to companies when facing prosecution today for certain offences (such as the offence of failing to prevent bribery under section 7 of the Bribery Act), companies would be able to avail themselves of the defence to failing to prevent offences 3 that they had adequate procedures (or, possibly, reasonable procedures in all the circumstances) in place to prevent the conduct in question from being committed by an employee, agent or associated person.

Precisely what those adequate procedures should look like is a discrete question of fact and highly dependent upon the nature of the company itself.

4

Secondly, the Law Commission also explored the possibility of widening the civil remedies available in relation to economic crime.

Specifically, it considered implementing a regime of general obligations upon corporations with administrative or civil penalties overlaying this framework for those corporations that fail to demonstrate adequate compliance.

The Law Commission considered that such a new civil regime may free up the resources of regulators to focus on serious economic crime without having to deal with more administrative breaches that might properly be considered merely regulatory  and where the corporation in question did not act dishonestly or deliberately.

Next steps The Law Commissions paper simply sets out options for the UK government to consider, and although it is unclear when exactly the law in this area will change, it looks increasingly likely that a change will happen.

Given the scope of the proposals, it appears inevitable that there will be an increased focus on the strength of compliance systems and an increase to the scope of corporate criminal liability.

5

There is now, therefore, an opportunity for companies to review their existing compliance systems and prepare themselves for the likely changes on the horizon prior to any formal legislation being passed.

Given that prevention is often better than a cure, and the potentially increased focus on compliance we have identified, companies are advised to consider getting ahead of these changes, and start reviewing their existing policies and procedures now, in order to identify potential gaps and improve those systems.

They also should consider adequately stress-testing these systems to weather any foreseeable crisis that may arise  from an accusation of fraud by a whistleblower to an investigation by an enforcement authority into human rights abuses.

Notes:

In her oral evidence before the House of Lords Select Committee on the Bribery Act 2010, 13 November 2018 See, e.g., The Serious Fraud Office v. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC

[2018] EWHC 3055 (QB):

In order to be considered the directing mind and will, and therefore to engage corporate liability, it was suggested an individual must have full discretion to act independently of instructions of the Board with regard to the relevant function and should not be responsible to the Board or others for the manner in which he discharges his duties.

For example: Failing to prevent human rights abuses; failing to prevent ill-treatment or neglect; failing to prevent computer misuse.

However, it should be noted that there is limited and high-level governmental guidance available .

See the statement from Penney Lewis, a professor and Law Commissioner for criminal law, that there is broad consensus that the law must go further."
Cooley,Looking to Embed Insurance on Your Website? Know These Licensing Rules First,"Editor's note: Co-authored by Heidi Lawson, Alexander Traum and Michael Coburn, this article was originally published by Legaltech News .

Across a range of industries, companies are increasingly looking to embed insurance into their platforms, providing their consumers tailor-made insurance coverage at the point of sale.

Embedded insurance products are often closely integrated with a companys website to permit its customers to seamlessly purchase insurance online while they are purchasing other goods or services.

But companies considering this embedded insurance model must confront the complicated, and sometimes confusing, world of the USs state-based insurance regulatory regime.

As weve previously written here , companies seeking to enter into the highly-regulated insurance space should be familiar with certain key regulatory issues.

This article provides an overview into the perhaps the most fundamental regulatory issue that is essential to understand before launching an embedded insurance offering: licensing.

Licensed Insurance Producer

In order to sell an embedded insurance product through its website a company may need to be licensed as an insurance producer.

Any person or entity selling, soliciting or negotiating insurance must be licensed as an insurance producer (producer being a general term for either an agent or broker) or qualify for an exemption from such licensing requirements.

A license is required in each state in which the insurance products are offered and for each type (or line) of insurance offered.

Where activities are transacted online, this typically means that a license is required in all U.S. jurisdictions.

In obtaining an insurance producer license, a company must take into consideration certain state-specific requirements related to corporate structure, name approval, qualification with the secretary of state, address and appointment of certain individuals as officers.

Most importantly, even if the licensed entity will be selling the insurance via an online platform without using any individual agents to interact with consumers, such entity will still need to identify at least one natural person, known as the designated responsible licensed producer (the DRLP), to be responsible for the producers compliance with all state insurance laws and regulations.

Managing General Agency Rather than just selling insurance to its customers, an embedded insurance provider may decide to operate as a managing general agency (MGA) in order to have greater control over pricing and designing its embedded insurance products.

MGAs are licensed insurance producers who are delegated authority by their carrier partners to underwrite insurance policies and, in certain instances, pay claims.

The MGA model may make sense for embedded insurance providers with access to customer data that would allow them to underwrite and price insurance policies more cost effectively and efficiently than the insurance companies with whom they are partnering.

It is important to note here that although MGAs are often referred colloquially in the industry as any insurance producer that also has the authority to underwrite insurance, state insurance laws have specific criteria of what constitutes an MGA and the regulatory obligations that attach when such criteria are met.

Therefore, one must analyze whether a MGA-type model is indeed a true MGA, as a matter of law, in order to ascertain the regulatory and licensure regime that applies.

Marketing Partnership Instead of becoming a licensed producer itself, a company looking to embed insurance on its platform may decide to host a third-party licensed producer.

Under this scenario, the company would only provide the platform through which the third-party licensed insurance producer could sell its insurance products, similar to a company hosting a banner advertisement on its website."
Cooley,Looking to Embed Insurance on Your Website? Know These Licensing Rules First,"If a company decides to pursue this route, the company will face legal limits on how it may market the insurance offerings as well as how it may be compensated.

Whether or not licensed as an insurance producer itself, a company will still need to partner with an adequately licensed (or authorized) insurance carrier to underwrite the policies.

SaaS Partnership

Although a company may be willing to be licensed as an insurance producer to offer the embedded insurance product on its platform, it may still decide to partner with an insurtech to provide the technology necessary to support the embedded insurance product.

In such cases the company will partner directly with the insurance carrier to sell insurance on behalf of the carrier as their agent or broker in exchange for a commission but will also partner with an insurance technology provider to develop and maintain the SaaS infrastructure and APIs necessary to operate the offering.

This option may make sense if a company is willing to become fully licensed itself but lacks the technological know-how needed to offer a seamless embedded insurance offering on its platform.

Full-Stack Insurance Carrier

While the options discussed above remain the most common in the embedded insurance model, companies may also offer embedded insurance as full-stack insurance companies.

Like an insurance producer, an insurance carrier must, subject to certain exceptions beyond the scope of this article (e.g., on a surplus lines basis), be licensed, or authorized, in each state in which insurance policies are placed.

In order to become authorized as an insurance carrier, a company will need to disclose extensive financial and personal information to its domestic regulator, raise significant amounts of capital and comply with state seasoning requirements which require a non-domiciliary insurance company to operate satisfactorily in another jurisdiction for a minimum period of time before being authorized to transact business in that state.

Notwithstanding the significant capital and regulatory hurdles of becoming a full-stack insurance company, a company may decide to become licensed as an insurance carrier in order to exercise greater control over its business while capturing more of the value chain.

Other Alternatives There are other intermediate steps that company may consider prior to owning a full-stack insurer.

For example, a company may decide to acquire a relatively small percentage of an existing shell insurance company in partnership with other unaffiliated investors.

Such investors may at a later time, subject to any applicable regulatory approval requirement, acquire greater ownership of the insurer.

Alternatively, a company may decide to form a captive insurer, which has less onerous regulatory requirements than a full-stack carrier but, generally speaking, will still require the use of a third-party authorized fronting carrier to provide the direct coverage pursuant to which the captive will then provide reinsurance capacity.

Although companies looking to embed insurance on their platforms must attend to a variety of insurance regulatory issues on an ongoing basis after launching, determining what license(s) to obtainand what that means in practiceis a necessary first step."
Cooley,CFPB Seeks Comments on Credit Card Company Penalty Policies,"On June 22, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) seeking comments from credit card issuers, consumer groups, and the public regarding credit card late fees and late payments, as well as revenue and expenses related to the imposition of late fees.

In particular, the CFPB is evaluating credit card penalty policies in relation to the Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 and Regulation Z.

CFPBs request for information The ANPR focuses on the penalty fee provisions of the CARD Act and Regulation Z.

Specifically, Section 149(a) of the CARD Act provides that penalty fees or charges associated with a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan must be reasonable and proportional to the omission or violation that triggered the fee.

1

The CFPB has previously implemented regulatory provisions pursuant to Section 149(b), which states that the CFPB may establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any penalty fee or charge  is reasonable and proportional to the omission or violation to which the fee or charge relates.

2

These sections are implemented in part by Regulation Z, which requires that the amount of a fee represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of that type of violation.

3

Alternatively, a card issuer may impose a penalty fee in an amount compliant with a separate safe harbor provision, often referred to as the immunity provision 4 (currently $30 for the first violation and $41 for a subsequent violation of the same type occurring with the next six billing cycles), which imposes a fee cap subject to an annual inflation adjustment.

To evaluate these statutory provisions, and to understand the domestic credit card market more broadly, the CFPB is seeking responses to 38 questions spanning several different categories.

The CFPB is interested in, among other things: Factors used by card issuers to set existing levels of late fees: For example, what factors do card issuers use to determine the amount of the late fee to charge per incident for late fees assessed to cardholders who were previously assessed a late fee in at least one of the previous six billing cycles?

Costs and losses: For example, what types of costs are associated with credit card late payments, such as losses due to nonpayment or costs of funding delinquent accounts?

Deterrence: For example, whether late fees deter future late payments.

More generally, the CFPB seeks to understand how card issuers facilitate or encourage timely payments.

Cardholder behavior: For example, what categories do card issuers use to classify cardholders based on their late payment behavior?

Autopay:

Do issuers offer autopay and, if so, what is the current rate of cardholder enrollment?

Notifications of upcoming due date: For example, cardholders can describe actions and methods through which card issuers contact them about an upcoming due date (other than through periodic statements).

Safe harbor provisions: For example, what late fee safe harbor amount would be sufficient for purposes of allowing card issuers to recover, through late fees, their costs in collecting late payments?

Cost analysis provisions: For example, whether and how card issuers are using cost analysis provisions as opposed to the safe harbor provisions.

Other categories: The CFPB also has asked for comments on staggered late fees, courtesy periods and fee waivers, and revenue and expenses.

The CFPB has requested that card issuer commenters provide their responses based on information relevant to their domestic consumer credit card portfolios, while other commenters should base their answers on their knowledge of the domestic consumer credit card market.

Interested parties may submit comments through the Federal eRulemaking Portal , by email or via direct mail.

Comments must be received on or before July 22, 2022."
Cooley,CFPB Seeks Comments on Credit Card Company Penalty Policies,"Interested parties may submit comments through the Federal eRulemaking Portal , by email or via direct mail.

Comments must be received on or before July 22, 2022.

Focus on fees The ANPR is the latest of several steps the CFPB has recently taken that indicate the CFPBs particular interest in combating late fees.

In January 2022, the CFPB published a request for public input seeking comments related to back-end fees.

(We covered the CFPBs request in a client alert: CFPB Requests Information on Consumer Financial Products or Services Fees ).

In that request, the CFPB indicated that it would use the information it collected to inform its rulemaking, guidance and enforcement priorities.

Additionally, the CFPB noted that it had identified particular products and services that could impose substantial costs to consumers, including credit cards.

The CFPB then indicated in a March report that credit card issuers charged $12 billion in late fees in 2020.

Of particular note, the press release for the report highlighted that fees have continued to rise due to the annual inflation adjustment contained in the immunity provision.

Finally, in April, Director Rohit Chopra indicated before the House Committee on Financial Services that the CFPB would explore late fees because it is important that this market is competitive.

Taking together the ANPR and the CFPBs recent activity surrounding late fees, it appears the CFPB is considering potential changes to the immunity provision.

More broadly, credit card issuers and other industry stakeholders should take note of the CFPBs continued interest in this area.

Cooley,SEC Climate Change Disclosure Proposal: What&nbsp;Non-US Companies Need to Know,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed new rules that would require extensive climate change disclosure in registration statements and periodic reports.

The Wall Street Journal has called this proposal the biggest potential expansion in corporate disclosure since the creation of the Depression-era rules over financial disclosures that underpin modern corporate statements.

Elements of the proposal include: Risk f actors: This element provides prescriptive requirements for a detailed discussion of climate-related risks (both physical and transition risks), and their actual or likely material impact on business strategy and outlook, including consolidated financial statements, business operations and value chains.

Governance and risk management : This element requires identification of board and management climate oversight bodies, as well as a description of the process to assess climate risks and a description of transition plans, if any.

Climate-related targets or goals would also need to be disclosed, if set.

Audited f inancial s tatements:

This element mandates an additional note showing metrics that break out the impact of the climate-related risks and expenses on a line-by-line basis, and disclosure of the impact of any climate-related risk or event on estimates and assumptions used to produce the financial statements.

Greenhouse g as (GHG) e missions d

isclosure: This element requires all public companies to measure and disclose direct (Scope 1) and energy-related (Scope 2) emissions.

Larger companies must disclose supply chain (Scope 3) emissions, if material, and provide third-party attestation for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.

Foreign private issuers (FPIs) and non-US companies considering a US initial public offering or secondary listing in the future also would be impacted by these rules, if adopted as proposed.

Some specific considerations for non-US clients are laid out below.

For more in-depth analysis, we encourage you to refer to the Cooley PubCo blog posts on this topic from March 24 and March 28, 2022 , as well as our April 2022 client alert .

1.

What will the final rules look like, and when will they kick in?

The SECs proposal is just that  a proposal, not yet adopted and binding  and is subject to public comment, the period for which was recently extended to June 17 .

Given the level of interest in the topic, we expect that there could be fairly significant changes to the proposal ahead of adoption.

In addition, the proposal already has seen significant media, political and legal attention, and we expect whatever rules are adopted likely will be subject to legal challenges.

The proposal has an (optimistic but possible) effective date of December 2022, which would require compliance for large accelerated filers for fiscal year 2023, and other filers for fiscal years 2024 and 2025.

2. Will FPIs benefit from any exemptions?

The proposal applies substantially all the rules to FPIs, with some minor modifications to address the use of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for calculating the climate-related financial statement metrics and setting the organizational boundary for GHG measurement.

Because information included on a Form 6-K is furnished rather than filed, periodic Form 6-Ks from FPIs that include the required disclosure may be excluded from certain liability provisions, as compared to domestic Form 8-K/10-Q filers.

Overall, the SEC appears less willing to exempt FPIs from the proposed climate change disclosures than it has been previously when imposing new rules.

The SEC notes that climate change impacts foreign companies just as it does domestic companies  and requiring FPIs to provide this disclosure is important to achieving the SECs goal of more consistent, reliable and comparable information across registrants, regardless of jurisdiction of incorporation."
Cooley,SEC Climate Change Disclosure Proposal: What&nbsp;Non-US Companies Need to Know,"That being said, the proposal does include a request for comment on any ways in which FPIs should be treated differently than domestic companies, including if compliance with any alternative reporting regimes  in particular whether the International Sustainability Standards Board (which is an IFRS-related body)  should be acceptable to qualify FPIs as compliant with SEC regulations, similar to how IFRS is acceptable alongside US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

3.

Will there be phase-in periods for emerging growth companies (EGCs) or newly public companies?

The current proposal includes longer transition periods and exemptions for supply chain (Scope 3) GHG disclosures and third-party attestation for smaller reporting companies, but no specific exemptions for EGCs.

Indeed, the SECs view is that because of their broad impact across industries and jurisdictions, climate-related risks may pose a significant risk to the operations and financial condition of domestic and foreign issuers, both large and small.

However, the proposal does request comments on exempting EGCs from some or all of the disclosure rules (including a blanket exemption from Scope 3 disclosures), and the SECs Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee is considering recommending that the SEC provide more scaling and phase-in periods for EGCs and smaller reporting companies, and address considerations that could deter companies from conducting IPOs.

The proposed rules could require climate-related disclosures in IPO registration statements with no phase-in period.

As a result, if the rules are implemented as proposed, late-stage private companies could need to plan accordingly to ensure they have the internal and external resources in place to enable compliance.

4.

What will the impact be for technology and life sciences issuers?

As noted above, the SECs view is that climate risks manifest themselves across industries.

Whileimmaterialsupply chain(Scope 3) emissions generally are not required to be disclosed under the proposal,disclosure maystillbe requiredfor Scopes1 and 2emissions,even if itcould be argued that they areimmaterial.

Although many internet and early-stage life sciences companies have very limited Scope 1 and 2 emissions, such asemissions from company-owned delivery vehicles (Scope 1) or emissions from electricitypurchasedto run servers(Scope 2), such issuers still could be requiredto quantify andprovideattestationover these limited sources of emissions.

Whilethequantification and attestationprocess for such limited emissions issuers could bestraightforward compared to companies with complex manufacturing operations and supply chains, such efforts may nonetheless causea drain on resources.

5.

Will your home jurisdiction or other potential listing venues adopt similar requirements?

And, even without a legal requirement, will investors demand a similar level of climate disclosure?

The SEC has been clear that it views the growth of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, as well as the proliferation of requests by investors for climate-risk information, as an indication that many investors consider climate change disclosure to be material to their overall investment decisions, and one of the goals of this proposal is to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-related information for investors.

Given the pressure from institutional investors to provide climate-risk information, companies may feel obligated to provide climate disclosure, even absent a formal requirement.

FPIs and other registrants with dual listings also will need to consider home jurisdiction requirements and their interaction with the potential SEC rules, which may prove inconsistent."
Cooley,SEC Climate Change Disclosure Proposal: What&nbsp;Non-US Companies Need to Know,"FPIs and other registrants with dual listings also will need to consider home jurisdiction requirements and their interaction with the potential SEC rules, which may prove inconsistent.

While the SECs proposal incorporates some concepts and vocabulary from the widely adopted Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, other regulators around the world have been rapidly developing their own climate disclosure standards, which are aligned with the TCFD to varying degrees.

Examples include: The European Unions Sustainable Finance Taxonomy and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

The UK Financial Conduct Authoritys climate policy statements.

The Securities and Exchange Board of Indias Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting for the 1,000 largest Indian public companies.

The Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore stock exchanges moves to mandatory ESG reporting.

Other regional initiatives, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations sustainable finance standards.

However, in many respects, the proposed SEC rules go beyond the requirements of TCFD-aligned reporting in other jurisdictions, and FPIs may end up including more detailed climate disclosure than their home country requires.

For companies considering a public listing (or in some non-US jurisdictions, even large private companies), the increasing global breadth of these standards mean that adopting mandatory ESG reporting may be more a question of when, and under what standards, rather than if.

6.

What should FPIs and companies that are considering US listings be thinking about now to prepare?

Consider the climate expertise of your board and management team, as well as any need to invest in personnel, consultants or training.

Bear in mind that climate-related targets and plans that are currently internal-only might need to be publicly disclosed in some form if the SEC proposal is enacted in its current form.

Consider climate-related compliance costs in future budgeting, including the potential need for additional training and third-party service providers.

When building out financial reporting and investor relations functions, think about how a future climate reporting team could fit into your structure, culture and reporting schedule.

Consider if you have enough visibility over your supply chain to collect the information for supply chain (Scope 3) GHG reporting.

Start a dialogue with your auditors about the proposed financial statement notes and third-party attestation requirements so you understand how these would be handled if the proposal is enacted in its current form.

Stay tuned for further developments in climate change disclosure in the US and in your home jurisdiction."
Cooley,Washington State’s Silenced No More Act: What&nbsp;Employers Need to Know,"Background Washington states Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1795 , also known as the Silenced No More Act, took effect June 9, 2022, and prohibits nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions that prevent an employee or contractor from disclosing or discussing conduct the individual reasonably believes to be illegal acts of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wage and hour violations, sexual assault, or other conduct recognized as being against a clear mandate of public policy.

Companies with employees or independent contractors who are Washington state residents should be aware that the act will require changes to many commonplace employment and contractor agreements.

The act will implicate nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions in many existing standard offer letters, confidential information and invention assignment agreements, separation or settlement agreements, and consulting/independent contractor agreements.

Who is covered under the act?

The act will implicate nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions in agreements between companies and current, former, or prospective employees or independent contractors who are residents of Washington state.

The act applies to all employers regardless of size and to any company that engages at least one independent contractor in Washington state, and defines an employee as a current, former, or prospective employee or independent contractor.

The act highlights that any nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision in any agreement signed by an employee or contractor who is a Washington resident will be governed by Washington law.

Therefore, Washington state employers or companies that engage independent contractors in Washington cannot contract around the acts requirements through choice of law provisions.

What does the act prohibit?

The act prohibits employers from entering into or enforcing a provision of any agreement that prohibits discussion or disclosure of: Conduct that the individual reasonably believes to be illegal discrimination, illegal harassment, illegal retaliation, a wage and hour violation, or sexual assault.

Conduct that is recognized as being against a clear mandate of public policy.

The existence of a settlement involving any of the above conduct.

Importantly, the act still allows companies to prohibit the disclosure of the settlement amount paid under a settlement agreement and to protect trade secrets, proprietary information or confidential information that does not involve illegal acts.

The act also provides employees and contractors protection against retaliation.

Companies may not discharge, discriminate or retaliate against any current, former, or prospective employee or independent contractor for discussing or disclosing any work-related conduct that an employee or independent contractor reasonably believes to be illegal harassment, illegal discrimination, illegal retaliation, wage and hour violations, or sexual assault that is recognized as illegal under state, federal or common law  or that is recognized as being against a clear mandate of public policy  which occurs in the workplace, at work-related events coordinated by or through the employer, between employees, or between an employer and an employee, whether on or off the employment premises.

What are the consequences for violating the act?

Significantly, the act applies retroactively to existing agreements that contain nondisclosure or nondisparagement provisions prohibiting employees or contractors from engaging in the kind of discussions or disclosures permitted by the act.

Existing agreements are not grandfathered in under the new law.

As of June 9, 2022, noncompliant provisions in an employment agreement, contractor agreement, agreement to pay compensation in exchange for the release of a legal claim, or any other agreement between an employer and an employee or contractor are void and unenforceable."
Cooley,Washington State’s Silenced No More Act: What&nbsp;Employers Need to Know,"Entering into a new agreement that contains noncompliant provisions or attempting to enforce an existing agreement that contains noncompliant provisions may result in penalties.

Specifically, the act provides for a minimum damages award of $10,000, plus attorneys fees and costs.

It is important that employers recognize the acts retroactive effect before attempting to enforce existing noncompliant provisions in varying employment or contractor agreements.

Employers do not necessarily need to re-paper their current agreements, as employees cannot recover damages for noncompliant provisions in agreements entered into before June 9, 2022, unless the employer seeks to enforce invalid provisions.

Notably, agreements to settle legal claims entered into before June 9, 2022, are exempt from the retroactive effect of the law.

The acts effect on existing Washington law As many Washington employers are aware, before the passage of the act, Washington employers already were prohibited from utilizing employment agreements that restricted workers from disclosing claims of workplace sexual assault and sexual harassment under Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 49.44.210.

The act overturned RCW 49.44.210, but effectively has expanded its protections by prohibiting the use of nondisclosure or nondisparagement provisions in a wider range of contexts.

Practical guidance for employers Employers should review their existing forms for use with Washington employees and contractors, and revise those forms to include language specifying that employees and contractors may disclose the specific topics identified in the act.

Employers also must be diligent in ensuring that they do not try to enforce noncompliant provisions.

Cooley is available to help any employer seeking guidance on necessary changes to their employment, contractor, and settlement and separation agreements for compliance with the act going forward.

Cooley,Public Companies Update – June One-Minute Reads,"SEC committee discusses climate and SPAC proposals On May 6, the Securities and Exchange Commissions Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee met to discuss the SECs recent rule proposals regarding climate-related disclosure and SPACs.

(For more information on the proposals, refer to this PubCo blog post , this PubCo blog post and this PubCo blog post .)

At the meeting, the committee voted on a number of potential general recommendations.

With respect to the SECs climate-related proposal, such recommendations included an affirmation of the committees belief in the importance of climate disclosure and a request to the SEC to perform a more detailed cost-benefit analysis of the proposal, especially with respect to smaller companies.

It also included potential recommendations for the rules to: Provide more scaling and phase-in periods for emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies.

Expand safe harbors from liability.

Create an incentive structure, rather than a penalty structure.

Address considerations that could deter companies from conducting IPOs, as well as the overall potential impact on very small companies.

Consider the impact on private companies of public companies potential reluctance to include them in the value chain.

Consider industry-specific requirements and eliminate the costly and slow attestation requirement.

Treat the disclosure as furnished, not filed.

Delay the disclosure due date and delay the general phase-in dates to give companies more preparation time.

The committee also encouraged the SEC to keep the SPAC alternative viable, and included potential recommendations for the proposed rules to: Require more disclosure earlier in the process to avoid information asymmetry.

Provide nuanced guidance to clarify who has underwriter status.

Provide a safe harbor for the disclosure of projections.

Lengthen time frames in the Investment Company Act safe harbor for identifying a target and completing a deSPAC transaction.

SEC staff comments on non-GAAP adjustments in collaboration agreements According to MarketWatch, a number of biopharma companies have adjusted their accounting practices relating to certain payments in response to a 2021 exchange of letters between Biogen and SEC staff.

In the letters, SEC staff objected to the companys exclusion of material upfront and premium payments made in connection with collaboration and licensing agreements from non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP net income.

Biogen eventually agreed to discontinue these adjustments going forward and to recast prior period information, but biopharma companies should be aware of the SECs view on non-GAAP adjustments for upfront payments reflected in the exchange  and should consider whether any changes to their own practices are warranted.

California court strikes down states board gender diversity statute On May 13, the Los Angeles County Superior Court determined that Senate Bill 826, a law requiring that all public companies listed on a major exchange and headquartered in California have a minimum number of women directors, violates the equal protection provisions of the California Constitution, and enjoined implementation and enforcement of the statute.

After a lengthy bench trial beginning in December 2021, the verdict found that the state failed to show there was a compelling state interest, or that SB 826 is necessary or narrowly tailored.

In determining that the state failed to meet this standard, the court found that there was no Compelling Governmental Interest in remedying discrimination in the board selection process because neither the Legislature nor Defendant could identify any specific, purposeful, intentional and unlawful discrimination to be remedied."

ESG incentives on the rise On May 10, Pay Governance released a Viewpoint report on the rise of inclusion of environmental, social and governance metrics in corporate incentive plans, exploring the question of whether executives are excessively benefitting from these incentives.

The report noted that 69% of S&P 500 companies reported the inclusion of ESG metrics in their incentive plans in their 2022 proxy statements, a significant increase from the 52% reported in 2021, if that percentage holds for the remainder of the year.

The report also focused on criticism that these ESG targets will just lead to more pay and not more ESG, which Pay Governance found to not be empirically supported, and noted that its research indicates that compensation committee members are acting conservatively in setting and scoring ESG goals.

Audit Analytics publishes financial restatements report In May, Audit Analytics published 2021 Financial Restatements  A Twenty-One-Year Review , an update of its report covering the prior 20 years of financial restatements.

Most notably, the report found a striking 289% increase in the total number of restatements from 2020 to 2021  1,470 restatements, the highest number since 2006.

This significant rise was attributable to SPACs, which contributed to 77% of the total restatements in 2021 due to SEC guidance on SPAC accounting issued in 2021.

(For more information, refer to this PubCo blog post .)

Excluding SPAC-related restatements, there was a 10% year-over-year decrease in total restatements.

Other key takeaways from the 2021 report include: 62% of restatements were reissuance restatements (big R), the highest proportion since 2005.

Debt and equity securities accounting was the top issue necessitating restatements in 2021, both including and excluding SPAC-related restatements.

The number of restatements with a negative impact on net income decreased from 37% in 2020 to 32% in 2021 (excluding SPAC-related restatements).

61% of restatements in 2021 covered an annual report, with the balance covering quarterly financials (excluding SPAC-related restatements).

For SPAC-related restatements, 35% related to redeemable shares and 42% related to warrants.

Cooley,New York DFS Guidance on Stablecoins Issuance Establishes Requirements for Reserve Assets and Redeemability,"On June 8, 2022, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) released industry guidance regarding US dollar-backed stablecoins issued by virtual currency entities regulated by DFS.

The guidance, which applies to entities licensed under the states virtual currency (BitLicense) regulations 1 or chartered as limited purpose trust companies under the New York Banking Law, sets forth baseline requirements for stablecoins issued under DFS oversight.

The requirements are intended to mitigate key regulator concerns related to stablecoins, such as the appropriateness of asset reserves that back stablecoins and the ability of holders to redeem stablecoins for US dollars.

Baseline requirements for stablecoins issuance The guidance states that DFS will apply the following general conditions to issuances of US dollar-backed stablecoins that are subject to DFS approval.

Backing and redeemability A stablecoin must be fully backed by reserve assets.

DFS will require the market value of reserve assets to  as of the end of each business day  equal or exceed the nominal value of all outstanding units of the stablecoin.

The issuers policies on redemption must be clear and conspicuous, and approved by DFS.

Under such policies, a lawful holder of a stablecoin must have a right to redeem units of the stablecoin in a timely fashion (e.g., not more than two full business days after receipt of an order) at par (i.e., at a 1:1 exchange rate for the US dollar), net of ordinary, well-disclosed fees.

The terms redemption and timely must be defined in the issuers policies.

Asset reserves Any assets that form the reserve must be segregated from the issuers proprietary assets and held with a US state or federally chartered depository institution with FDIC-insurance and/or, if approved by DFS in advance, other asset custodians.

Reserve assets are limited to specified types of assets, such as certain US Treasury bills, reverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by US Treasury bills, government money-market funds, and deposits at US state or federally chartered depository institutions.

Independent audits At least monthly, an independent certified public accountant (CPA) must attest to managements assertions regarding the sufficiency of the reserve assets.

At least annually, an independent CPA must also attest to managements assertions regarding the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with the requirements for the monthly attestations.

The monthly and annual reports must be submitted to DFS and made public.

Other requirements and considerations The guidance makes clear that DFS believes it has the authority to, and may, impose additional requirements regarding the issuance of stablecoins.

DFS may also assess other risks in deciding whether to authorize any particular stablecoins issuance, such as risks related to cybersecurity, Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, consumer protection, safety and soundness, and the stability and integrity of the payment system.

Issuers of stablecoins currently supervised by DFS have three months to come into compliance with the general conditions set forth in the guidance.

Comments and outlook While numerous state banking departments currently regulate activities involving virtual currencies under their money transmission laws (including through laws that have been expressly amended to address virtual currency activity), there has been limited state-specific guidance regarding stablecoins.

Most significantly, outside of New York, the Texas Department of Banking has for several years taken the position that stablecoins backed by sovereign currency are regulated under its state money transmission law because stablecoins that are pegged to sovereign currency may be considered a claim that can be converted into currency and thus fall within the definition of money or monetary value under the Texas statute."
Cooley,New York DFS Guidance on Stablecoins Issuance Establishes Requirements for Reserve Assets and Redeemability,"That is, the holder has a claim to the sovereign [currency] backing the coin because the issuer has taken on the obligation to provide sovereign currency in exchange for the stablecoin at a later time.

In other words, Texas reasoned that issuing a stablecoin with a right of redemption is tantamount to holding money or monetary value on behalf of the holder of the stablecoin, and is therefore subject to money transmission regulation.

While many other state money transmission laws have similar definitions of regulated money transmission activity, it appears that no other state has issued similar public guidance.

Based on recent developments, it is possible that other state banking departments could follow New Yorks lead and expressly address regulation of stablecoins alongside regulation of virtual currency, either under their money transmission laws or perhaps via a standalone virtual currency regime.

For example, in California, existing pending legislation (Assembly Bill 2269) proposes to regulate virtual currency activity and, in relevant part, provide an absolute prohibition on licensees from exchanging, transferring, or storing a stablecoin whose value relative to the United State dollar or another national or state currency is determined primarily by methods other than reserve assets

[emphasis added].

If more states conclude that stablecoins are a money transmission product, or expressly affirm that stablecoins issuance is money transmission activity, stablecoins could be more broadly subject to existing prudential requirements for money transmitters, including requirements to hold, at a minimum, equivalent assets in low-risk, highly liquid investments.

However, the requirements imposed by New York are more stringent than for traditional money transmission or stored value products, in particular with respect to required monthly attestations from an independent CPA regarding the sufficiency of the reserve assets.

(Traditional money transmission regulations require licensees to internally manage and confirm the sufficiency of their holdings against outstanding customer obligations, and require only that annual financial statements be audited.)

Although several legislative proposals with respect to stablecoins have been proposed at the federal level, the release of the New York guidance demonstrates that DFS is not waiting for action by Congress to address prudential concerns regarding risks posed by stablecoins.

As with some other recent federal proposals, such as the Lummis-Gillibrand bill , the guidance requires issuers to maintain reserves of at least 100% of the nominal value of outstanding stablecoins in low-risk, highly liquid assets.

Therefore, algorithmic stablecoins  such as TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that crashed in May 2022, or Decentralized USD, the algorithmic stablecoin on Tron that launched shortly before the TerraUSD crash  would not be approved for issuance by entities overseen by DFS. 2

At the federal level, the Lummis-Gillibrand bill would permit non-depository institutions (operating under a state or federal charter or license) to issue stablecoins, and authorize a special depository institution charter under both state law and the National Bank Act for stablecoin issuance, while also permitting banks and credit unions to issue stablecoins.

3

Given the difficult political climate and limited number of days to legislate before the midterm elections, however, it is unlikely that the Lummis-Gillibrand bill (or other federal bills addressing cryptocurrency regulation) will become law this year.

The bills could nevertheless serve as the policy foundation for debate that resumes when the next Congress is seated in January 2023.

The DFS stablecoins issuance guidance follows the April 2022

Cooley,New York DFS Guidance on Stablecoins Issuance Establishes Requirements for Reserve Assets and Redeemability,"DFS industry letter emphasizing the importance of employing blockchain analytics tools in an effective virtual currency business compliance program.

We expect DFS will continue to seek to lead on the regulation of virtual currency business activities.

Notes 23

NYCRR Part 200.

DFS, however, states that its regulatory guidance does not apply to USD-backed stablecoins listed, but not issued, by DFS-regulated entities.

DFS does expect regulated entities that list USD-backed stablecoins to consider this guidance when submitting a request for coin issuance or seeking approval for a coin self-certification policy.

Sens. John Boozman (R-Arkansas) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan) are reportedly working on another bipartisan bill to address the regulation of cryptocurrency.

Cooley,UK Publishes First Annual Report on the National Security and Investment Regime,"On June 16, 2022, the UK government published its first annual report on the operation of the UKs National Security and Investment (NSI) regime, covering the first three months since the regime came into force on January4, 2022.

While the report stresses that long-term trends cant be identified in such a short period of time, the volume of notifications is slightly below the lower number of filings initially anticipated.

This may be attributable to the slowdown in M&A activity, but it suggests that the regime (at least initially) is not leading to a surge in benign notifications, which is reassuring.

Overall, the report concludes that the regime appears to be operating well, with the government keeping to its statutory timeframes and only a minority of deals being called-in on national security concerns.

No penalties have been imposed on parties for non-compliance, and there have been no criminal prosecutions or judicial reviews of decisions taken under the new regime.

We have summarised below our four key takeaways from the report.

1.

There were fewer notifications than originally anticipated In the first three months of the regime coming into force, the government received 222 notifications, of which 196 were mandatory filings, 25 were voluntary, and one was a retrospective validation application for a transaction completed without approval.

Out of the 222 notifications, 17 were called-in for further assessment.

If this trend continues, it means that notifications will reach approximately 900 per year, lower than the 1,000 to 1,830 originally estimated.

The call-in numbers will be around 68 per year, which is running at approximately the anticipated rate of 70 to 95 per year.

The report suggests that the figures may be lower than estimated due to a general decline in M&A activity towards the end of last year, which may have continued into the first part of this year.

In any event, the report notes that it only covers the first three months of operation, so limited trends or patterns can be inferred from the data.

2.

Mandatory notifications most commonly fell within the defence sector, while voluntary notifications most commonly fell within professional, scientific and technical activities While the government received mandatory notifications across each of the 17 specified sectors of the economy, the five most common sectors were defence, military and dual-use, critical suppliers to government, artificial intelligence, and data infrastructure.

Interestingly, the government received the fewest mandatory filings in synthetic biology, which may suggest that the sector definition is unambiguous.

For voluntary notifications, the five most common areas related to professional, scientific and technical activities, data infrastructure, other service activities, energy, and computing hardware.

3.

Of the 17 transactions called-in for further assessment, three were cleared and 14 were still being assessed as of March 31, 2022 Of the 17 called-in transactions, the majority were assessed after a mandatory notification.

The main sectors in scope were military and dual-use, defence, and critical suppliers to government.

4.

The 30-working day review period is working well, with few notifications being rejected for being incomplete According to the report, the average time for the government to confirm that a mandatory notification is complete is three working days, which is consistent with our experience in practice.

Only a small number of notifications have been rejected as incomplete for failing to include enough information about the transaction or covering multiple acquisitions that should have been submitted as two notifications.

Indeed, it has been reported that several mandatory notifications were rejected because they should have been submitted as voluntary filings.

The statutory time limit for the government to call-in a notification once accepted is 30 working days."
Cooley,UK Publishes First Annual Report on the National Security and Investment Regime,"The statutory time limit for the government to call-in a notification once accepted is 30 working days.

The government has stayed within this time limit for every notification received, with the shortest review period taking only 11 working days.

What does this all show?

Despite the broad scope of the UK NSI regime and the ambiguity of certain sector definitions, the number of notifications during the relevant period is reassuring and suggests that the regime may not be leading to a surge in benign notifications.

The government is responding quickly to notifications and keeping to the statutory timeframes, which is good news for businesses.

While it is not surprising that the government is calling-in transactions in defence and military and dual-use, companies are reminded that deals involving cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence and data infrastructure are also being closely scrutinised.

The government has not shied away from using its call-in powers.

While no specific deals have been disclosed in the report, two call-ins were publicly announced in May 2022 in the microchip and telecommunications sectors.

Businesses should expect the government to continue to use these powers to scrutinise and intervene in transactions on national security concerns.

For the relevant period, the government has not blocked any deal on national security concerns nor has it imposed any conditions to mitigate such concerns.

Again, its too early to draw any conclusions here, but it will be interesting to see how the situation evolves in the coming months.

On the same date the annual report was published, the government also published a memorandum of understanding on the operation of the NSI regime, establishing a framework of cooperation, coordination and information sharing between the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the body in which the Investment Security Unit (ISU) sits.

While the memorandum does not give rise to any legally binding obligations on the part of the CMA or BEIS, it is a statement of intent which will be taken into account by the relevant staff at each body.

Of note, the memorandum provides that BEIS and the CMA may seek to share information on transactions being considered under their respective legal frameworks to enable effective coordination and alignment.

The CMA will, for example, continue to engage on an informal basis with BEIS in relation to mergers that are notified to the CMA or which the CMA becomes aware of which might be relevant to the ISU.

In addition, where the CMA is informed that an acquisition has been called-in by the ISU, the CMA will endeavour to notify (and update, as appropriate) the ISU on the status of a particular merger, and the ISU will take similar steps.

Businesses should therefore anticipate closer cooperation and information sharing between the two bodies going forward.

Cooley,New EU and UK Sanctions Aimed at Russia and Belarus: What You Need to Know,"On 3 June 2022, the European Council finally adopted the sixth set of economic and individual sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus.

The new measures , which came after weeks of member state negotiations, focus on oil imports and transport, broadcasting outlets, export restrictions, further financial and business-related restrictions, and the criminalisation of sanctions breaches.

Additional individuals also have been added to the travel ban and asset freeze lists.

The UK has announced a series of similar measures.

European Union sanctions Weve outlined below the key measures of the EU sanctions package.

Oil import restrictions The EU has banned the purchase, import, and transfer of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia into the EU.

This ban comes into effect immediately but includes provision for a wind-down period for crude oil and petroleum contracts.

EU member states which import Russian oil via pipelines will be able to rely on a temporary exception until the European Council decides otherwise.

However, onward sales of this oil within or outside the EU will not be permitted.

Bulgaria also has agreed a special temporary derogation until the end of 2024, which will allow it to continue importing crude oil and petroleum products from Russia via maritime transport.

Similarly, Croatia will be able to import Russian vacuum gas oil required for the functioning of its refinery until the end of 2023.

Oil transport services EU operators will be prohibited from insuring and financing the transport of Russian crude oil or petroleum products to third countries.

This prohibition will not apply to the execution of contracts concluded before 4 June 2022 until 5 December 2022.

Broadcasting suspension The EU has suspended the broadcasting activities of three additional Russian state-owned outlets: Rossiya RTR/RTR Planeta, Rossiya 24/Russia 24 and TV Centre International.

They will not be able to distribute content via any means in the EU, and advertising of products and services by all EU persons in any content produced or broadcast by the outlets will be prohibited.

Export restrictions The EU has expanded the list of advanced technology items banned from export to Russia to include 80 chemical products which could be used in the development and manufacture of chemical weapons.

Additional persons and entities associated with Russias and Belaruss military and defence industry also have been added to the list of persons encompassed by export restrictions of dual-use goods and technology.

Discretionary authorisations may not be granted by the EU to export dual-use goods and technology to persons on this list.

These additions align the EU measures with the US Export Administration Regulations.

Financial measures The EU has extended the prohibition on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging system to include Sberbank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Russian Agricultural Bank, and the Belarusian Bank for Development and Reconstruction.

Applicable from 14 June 2022, this effectively disconnects the banks from the international financial system by blocking access to instant SWIFT transactions.

Consulting services measures Similar to restrictions imposed by the US, the EU also has barred the direct or indirect provision of accounting, auditing, statutory audit, bookkeeping and tax consulting services, business and management consulting, and public relations services to the Russian government and Russian persons.

This broadly drafted restriction does not apply to: The provision of services that are strictly necessary for the termination by 5 July 2022 of contracts concluded before 4 June 2022.

The provision of services strictly necessary for the exercise of the right of defence in judicial proceedings and the right to an effective legal remedy."
Cooley,New EU and UK Sanctions Aimed at Russia and Belarus: What You Need to Know,"The provision of services strictly necessary for the exercise of the right of defence in judicial proceedings and the right to an effective legal remedy.

The provision of services to a legal person or entity established in Russia which is owned or controlled by a legal person or entity incorporated in an EU member state.

The EU may authorise the provision of these services if they are necessary for humanitarian purposes or civil society activities that promote democracy, human rights or the rule of law in Russia.

Individual listings: Travel ban and asset freeze The EU has sanctioned a further 77 Belarusian and Russian individuals and 26 Belarusian and Russian entities (see EU Regulation 269/2014 and EU Regulation 765/2006 ).

This brings the total number of individuals and entities listed to 1,370 and 136, respectively.

The individuals face a travel ban and an asset freeze in the EU.

Criminalisation for sanctions breaches The package includes a provision requiring EU member states to lay down criminal penalties for EU sanctions infringements if they have not yet done so.

UK sanctions The UK has announced similar measures to the EU but has not yet adopted relevant legislation.

These include: Ending all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of 2022, and all imports of gas as soon as possible thereafter.

Removing selected Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system.

Cutting off Russias access to the UKs management consulting, accounting and public relations services.

Implementing import tariffs covering 1.4 billion worth of Russian goods, including platinum and palladium.

Enacting export bans to hit more than 250 million worth of goods, targeting key materials such as chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery.

Prohibiting major Russian airlines (Aeroflot, Ural Airlines and Rossiya Airlines) from selling their unused landing slots at UK airports; these Russian airlines also have been added to the UK asset freeze list.

Banning all new outward investment to Russia.

Prohibiting the insurance of ships carrying Russian oil.

Next steps The sanctions regulatory landscape is constantly changing.

Building on the EU and UKs previous round of measures, these packages put in place new rules which will affect the business activities or entities of companies operating in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

Companies should look to monitor the situation closely and prepare to make adjustments to their operations to ensure compliance with the evolving rules.

If you have any questions, please reach out to any of the Cooley lawyers listed below, who can advise you on the applicable EU and UK sanctions  and how they affect you and your business.

Cooley,California DFPI Seeks Comments to Strengthen Consumer Protection Oversight of Digital Assets,"On June 1, 2022, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) released an invitation for public comments to inform its development of a comprehensive regulatory approach for digital (or crypto 1 ) assets.

The DFPIs invitation for comments is one of numerous actions ordered by California Gov. Gavin Newsoms recent blockchain executive order issued on May 4, 2022 , which delegated a central role to the DFPI in light of its dual mandate to protect consumers and foster responsible innovation.

As directed by the executive order, the DFPI is seeking comments on how it should approach regulation of crypto assets pursuant to its authority under the California Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL), the states consumer financial protection law that is modeled after provisions of the federal Dodd-Frank Act.

In particular, the invitation for comments asks if rulemaking is necessary to clarify how the CCFPL should apply to crypto assets (e.g., whether crypto meets the definition of a consumer financial product or service), as well as persons involved in offering or providing such crypto assets (i.e., covered persons or service providers under the CCFPL).

It also seeks specific input on how the DFPI can advance key regulatory priorities and how the DFPI should conduct a market-monitoring order, which was mandated by the executive order, to inform its future rulemaking.

Public comments are due by August 5, 2022.

DFPIs invitation for comments The invitation for comments includes 16 specific questions under three broad topics, as outlined below.

Regulatory priorities The invitation for comments requests input on how the DFPI can advance certain key regulatory priorities (including specific actions the DFPI should take) with respect to crypto asset-related financial products and services.

These priorities include: Better protecting consumers and investors.

Improving consumer education.

Ensuring financial stability in the market.

Addressing climate change.

Harmonizing the states regulatory approach with that of federal authorities.

Working with other state regulators to promote consumer protection and reduce unnecessary burdens.

Promoting inclusive innovation and equity.

Making California the most desirable state for responsible [crypto asset] companies.

CCFPL regulation and supervision The invitation for comments seeks feedback on whether rulemaking is required or should be adopted under the CCFPL to: Require registration of crypto asset-related financial products and services.

Specify which crypto asset-related financial products and services should be included in the CCFPLs definition of a financial product or service.

Identify any unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of crypto asset-related financial products and services.

Ensure full and accurate disclosure of features of crypto asset-related financial products and services.

Require the filing of annual or special reports for the DFPI to perform its monitoring and other responsibilities.

Market-monitoring order The invitation for comments requests input on how the DFPI should conduct the market-monitoring order directed by the executive order  such as the scope of the order (e.g., which companies and products/services should be included), and what information should be collected and made publicly available in aggregate form.

Parties are not limited to providing comments on the specific questions in the invitation for comments.

For example, the DFPI indicates that parties may comment on areas for potential rulemaking relating to crypto assets under other laws administered by the DFPI, including the California Money Transmission Act (the MTA) 2 and the California Financing Law."
Cooley,California DFPI Seeks Comments to Strengthen Consumer Protection Oversight of Digital Assets,"3 Comments and outlook Newsoms blockchain executive order states that California seeks to foster responsible innovation by blockchain (including cryptocurrency) companies in the state and harmonize Californias approach to the regulation of crypto assets with that of the federal government.

(For more information on President Joe Bidens executive order on digital assets, refer to this March 2022 Cooley alert: Biden Executive Order on Cryptocurrencies and Other Digital Assets Emphasizes Innovation and Regulation ).

A central objective of Newsoms executive order is to facilitate the development of a comprehensive regulatory approach for crypto assets that would better protect consumers.

Newsoms executive order and the DFPIs invitation for comments also indicate that new regulatory guidance and rulemaking regarding crypto assets are likely forthcoming.

The CCFPL, which went into effect last year, provides the DFPI with broad discretion to interpret and implement the law.

In particular, it gives the DFPI significant authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products, and nonexclusive oversight and enforcement authority, under California consumer financial laws and, to the extent permissible, nonexclusive oversight and enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws.

4 Among other things, it prohibits covered persons and service providers from engaging in unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.

To date, the DFPI has notably steered clear of regulating activities involving cryptocurrency under the California MTA.

In interpretative opinions, the DFPI has consistently stated that it is not currently requiring persons engaged in activities involving virtual currency  including buying, selling, exchanging and holding virtual currency  to be licensed as a money transmitter.

This approach has given the industry time to evolve and the DFPI time to evaluate an appropriate regulatory construct.

The executive order and invitation for comments, however, suggest that the state is now taking a different tack and may soon be ready to act.

So, while it is possible that the DFPI could still decide to regulate at least some digital asset activity under the MTA, persons operating in the digital asset space who are not exempt or do not become exempt (e.g., by obtaining a money transmission license) from regulation under the CCFPL can expect any DFPI rulemaking under the CCFPL to have a direct impact on their operations in California.

The invitation for comments and any resulting regulatory guidance or regulations also are likely to influence the DFPIs future enforcement activity, especially in light of the executive orders additional mandate to enforce violations of the CCFPL and other consumer financial laws.

However, while the DFPI has to date taken a wait-and-see approach with respect to licensing and supervisory oversight, this has not precluded enforcement activity in this space.

For example, the DFPI has shown no signs of delaying enforcement activity in connection with the offering and selling of products relating to digital assets that constituted securities in California but were not registered, qualified, or permitted for sale in the state as required by California Corporations Code section 25110, as seen in the BlockFi Lending consent order .

Given the precedents in other states, the breadth of the DFPIs questions in the invitation for comments, and its current enforcement activities  especially in light of recent instability, volatility and consumer losses  the DFPI could implement new safety and soundness, registration, and consumer disclosure requirements through regulatory guidance and rulemaking.

Thus, the invitation for comments should be closely evaluated by all interested parties, and those who may be impacted by new regulations should consider this a valuable opportunity to inform the scope of the DFPIs long-awaited regulation of digital asset activity."

Cooley,Investment Treaties Could Provide Remedy For Russia’s Unlawful Seizure of Foreign Assets,"As Reuters recently reported , Russia is preparing a new law that will allow it to seize the local businesses of Western companies that have left or suspended operations in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine.

Affected companies, who may see their investments in Russia expropriated without compensation, could have a remedy under international law through investment treaties.

These investment treaties allow covered foreign investors to bring claims for compensation against Russia directly in arbitrations before impartial and independent tribunals.

For many investors, international arbitration may offer a better (or the only) avenue to recover losses because of the hurdles in suing foreign sovereigns in courts, including sovereign immunity laws, service of process challenges and abstention doctrines.

What is international investment law and how could it protect foreign investors in Russia?

International investment law is a treaty-based regime that is independent of national legal systems.

It protects foreign investors and their investments from unfair interference by a host government through regulation or other governmental measures that are arbitrary or unfair, discriminate in favor of local players, or take the investment without full compensation.

Bilateral or multilateral investment treaties signed between a host state (the country where the investment is made, which in this case is Russia) and a home state (the country of the investors nationality) also grant foreign investors the right to bring claims against host states before international arbitration tribunals.

This means that investors may have a direct right of action against Russia for its unlawful measures, in a neutral forum, heard by independent arbitrators appointed by the disputing parties.

The resulting awards generally are enforceable against states as local court judgments.

This means awards could be enforced against Russian state assets outside of Russia, subject to questions of whether those assets are protected by sovereign immunity.

However, access to these legal protections and remedies depends on whether the foreign investor is from a home state that has concluded an investment treaty with Russia.

Protection also may be available for companies within a corporate holding structure that are from a home state that has concluded an investment treaty with Russia.

What investment treaties are available to foreign investors in Russia?

Russia has 62 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in force, including with European Union member states such as Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.

Russia also has BITs with Canada, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, the UK and Ukraine.

The United States has signed a BIT with Russia, but it has not entered into force.

Despite this, US-based companies might still avail themselves of investment treaty protections if their investments in Russia are structured via one of the countries with a BIT with Russia.

How do the investment treaties protect foreign investors?

The protections vary, depending on the treaty, but generally, most Russian BITs prohibit expropriation without compensation, and require Russia to accord investments fair and equitable treatment (FET).

International investment law requires host states to pay prompt and adequate compensation if they seize or nationalize investors assets.

Critically, the protection also covers indirect expropriation, which occurs when the state does not take the property directly, but rather takes measures that largely deprive the investor of the benefits or value of its investment.

This means that if Russia directly seizes a foreign investment or adopts measures that destroy its value, Russia could be liable for breaching the prohibition against expropriation in BITs.

Additionally, Russia is required to treat investors fairly and equitably."
Cooley,Investment Treaties Could Provide Remedy For Russia’s Unlawful Seizure of Foreign Assets,"Additionally, Russia is required to treat investors fairly and equitably.

Under this standard, Russia must not treat investors arbitrarily or unreasonably, frustrate their legitimate expectations, or abruptly change its regulatory framework.

Consequently, Russias proposed law of seizing the assets of Western investors could constitute an arbitrary retaliatory measure breaching the FET protection.

How can an investor claim compensation for the violation of its rights in Russia?

Investors who are covered by an investment treaty can bring an action directly against Russia before an international arbitration tribunal and claim damages for Russias unlawful measures.

However, each treaty will have certain conditions that need to be complied with before bringing a claim  for example, notifying Russia of a dispute and a cooling-off period before commencing arbitration.

Please reach out to any of the Cooley contacts below if you have questions on investment treaty claims or how to address the Russian governments retaliatory measures."
Cooley,UK Reporting for Share Plans With UK Participants Due July 6,"The deadline is approaching for the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) year-end reporting requirements for companies in the UK, US and elsewhere with share options and other share awards granted to, and share acquisitions by, UK employees between April 6, 2021, and April 5, 2022.Reporting may also be required in respect of non-UK resident employees who carry out work duties in the UK.

These annual returns must be submitted by midnight (UK) time on Wednesday, July 6, 2022, via the HMRC Employment Related Securities (ERS) online service.

By such date, companies must have: registered to use the service; registered each plan or arrangement; self-certified any UK tax-advantaged plans; and reported each share award grant and share acquisition related to a share award that occurred during the relevant reporting period.

If you have not yet registered to use the ERS online service, you should do so as soon as possible and no later than June 29, 2022, as registration may take several days.

Nil returns are required for all inactive plans covering UK employees until you have notified HMRC that the plan has ceased through the ERS online service.

Online filing of annual returns in relation to UK tax-advantaged and non-tax-advantaged plans or arrangements The requirements catch all share options and share awards granted to, and shares acquired by, UK employees by reason of their employment, including participation in non-UK arrangements such as US employee stock purchase plans known as ESPPs.

They also catch the cancellation of existing share awards and certain other events such as variations, lapses and sales of shares for more than market value.

A separate online return must be filed to report transactions under each registered UK tax-advantaged plan (EMI, CSOP, SAYE or SIP) by the July 6, 2022, deadline.

Non-tax-advantaged plans or arrangements These are referred to on the HMRC website as other plans.

You can choose whether to file separate returns for each arrangement or a single return covering transactions occurring under all non-tax-advantaged plans and arrangements.

The returns are required to contain details of any share options that have been granted or exercised, as well as any other reportable events in relation to employment-related securities (including cancellations, variations, lapses and sales of shares for more than market value).

View ERS annual return templates and associated HMRC guidance.

Penalties for non-compliance Failure to file these annual returns on time will result in an automatic penalty of 100 per plan/arrangement, and any benefits from tax-advantaged plans may be lost.

Additional penalties will arise where submissions remain outstanding by October 6, 2022 (an additional 300), January 6, 2023 (a further 300), and HMRC has discretion to impose further penalties in relation to any returns that remain outstanding after April 6, 2023.

In addition to penalties for failing to file these annual returns, a failure to register a tax-advantaged plan will affect the tax treatment of future participants (and additionally, in the case of CSOPs, current participants)."
Cooley,"Liquid Biopsy Technology: FDA’s Latest Guidance Supports Several Uses of ctDNA in Clinical Trials, but Not (yet) as Surrogate Clinical Endpoint","On May 3, 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a draft guidance document on the Use of Circulating Tumor DNA for Early-Stage Solid Tumor Drug Development .

The guidance is aimed at helping developers use circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker in early-stage solid tumor clinical trials and in seeking market approval for in vitro diagnostic assays.

What you need to know about ctDNA As a tumor-derived fragmented DNA circulating in a patients bloodstream that is not associated with cells, ctDNA originates directly from the tumor or circulating tumor cells, and can reflect part or all of the tumor genome.

Its quantity depends on the type of tumor, location, stage, tumor burden and response to therapy.

Due to these features, ctDNA is used in liquid biopsies to detect tumors, monitor tumor progression and detect molecular residual disease (MRD), which refers to tumor cells that remain in patients in remission during or after treatment (a major cause of cancer relapse).

For the same reason, ctDNA also can serve as a valuable biomarker in clinical trials of early-stage solid tumor drugs.

The approaches and technologies used for ctDNA assessment vary among clinical laboratories, and can produce inconsistent results, which can affect the reliability of ctDNAs regulatory uses.

Regulatory uses of ctDNA as a biomarker In the draft guidance, the FDA has put forward four main uses for ctDNA as a biomarker in early-stage solid tumor clinical trials, involving patient selection, patient enrichment, measure of response and early endpoint.

Sponsors are encouraged to consult the FDA if they plan to incorporate ctDNA for patient selection or as an endpoint.

For patient selection based on molecular alteration  ctDNA can be used to set eligibility criteria for clinical trials to target certain genetic or epigenetic alterations in patients, and as a stratification factor to specify patient subgroups.

For these uses, the FDA recommends evaluation of the sensitivity of ctDNA assay for detecting all variants of clinical interest contained within tumor tissue, and confirmatory tumor testing if no variants are detected.

As a marker of MRD for patient enrichment  ctDNA can be used as a marker of MRD after treatment to enrich a trial with patients who have a higher-risk disease and increased incidents of disease recurrence or death.

For such a trial, the primary endpoint should be disease-free survival if only adjuvant therapy is given, event-free survival if neoadjuvant therapy is given, or overall survival, and there should not be any early interim analyses of the primary endpoint due to limited events.

As a measure of response  ctDNA can be used in early-phase clinical trials to signal drug activity.

The FDA encourages sponsors to develop evidence regarding the usefulness of ctDNA response after neoadjuvant therapy.

As an early endpoint in clinical trials  The FDA recognizes that changes in ctDNA in response to a drug may have the potential to be used as an early endpoint to support drug approval.

The agency gives specific guidelines on what type of evidence could be used to validate this use, and requests that sponsors discuss their validation plans with the FDA.

Trials should collect ctDNA before and after drug treatment, as well as long-term data.

Assay and investigational device considerations For assays, the FDA puts forward considerations for types of MRD panels, sampling and assay analytical validation for marketing applications.

The draft guidance lists strengths and limitations of MRD panels utilizing tumor-informed methods, tumor-naive methods and a smaller panel of candidate genes.

It encourages sponsors to discuss with the FDA the timing of ctDNA testing, which should be supported by performance characteristics of the test, disease characteristics and tumor biology.

It also includes detailed instructions for conducting analytical validation to establish the performance characteristics of ctDNA assay."
Cooley,"Liquid Biopsy Technology: FDA’s Latest Guidance Supports Several Uses of ctDNA in Clinical Trials, but Not (yet) as Surrogate Clinical Endpoint","It also includes detailed instructions for conducting analytical validation to establish the performance characteristics of ctDNA assay.

Sponsors using ctDNA technology for in vitro diagnostic devices that may be used in clinical trials for oncology therapeutics also are invited to take advantage of the FDAs streamlined submission process for investigational devices in oncology trials.

This process enables sponsors to submit information about the investigational device in an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission.

As part of the IND review, CBER or CDER will consult with CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, to determine the investigational devices risk level and the corresponding requirements applicable for such devices under the FDAs investigational device exemption regulations.

Our recommendations Manufacturers developing early-stage solid tumor drugs or considering the use of ctDNA in drug development should review the draft guidance closely.

The agency is accepting public comments on this guidance through July 5, 2022.

If you are contemplating any uses for ctDNA that are not covered by this guidance, consider working with your Cooley team to submit a comment asking the FDA to include your use case, which may potentially reduce your regulatory burden in the future.

Cooley,Arizona Embraces CSBS Model Money Transmission Law; West Virginia Incorporates Some Key Provisions,"On May 20, 2022, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed Senate Bill 1580 , which effectively replaces Arizonas current money transmission law 1 with the Model Money Transmission Modernization Act (the Model Act) announced by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) last fall.

Arizonas law will become effective on August 28.

2

In addition to incorporating almost all of the Model Act, SB 1580 eliminates Arizonas unique identification requirements for transactions of $1,000 or more.

While Arizona establishes a precedent for wholesale adoption of the Model Act, the first state to incorporate significant substantive elements of the Model Act was West Virginia, through Senate Bill 505 , earlier this year.

Arizona and West Virginia money transmission laws As a result of these new laws, money transmitters and other payments services providers should be aware of several significant developments that will have a direct impact on persons operating in these states, but also could become trends if more states embrace the Model Act.

Exemptions Arizona statutes and regulations did not explicitly recognize an agent-of-the-payee exemption or a bank agent/service provider exemption.

SB 1580, however, includes an express exemption for an agent of the payee and a bank service provider, provided that certain criteria are met.

(West Virginias money transmission law already has a functionally similar exemption in place for an agent of a payee.)

Expanded definitions While Arizonas existing money transmission law generally covers standard activities such as transmitting money and selling/issuing stored value

, the Model Act definitions now incorporated into Arizona law are more detailed and specific.

For example, stored value is defined under the new law (and under the West Virginia law, as amended) as monetary value representing a claim against the issuer evidenced by an electronic or digital record and that is intended and accepted for use as a means of redemption for money or monetary value or payment for goods or services.

The term also includes prepaid access as defined under the federal Bank Secrecy Act.

Relatedly, both laws exclude from regulation closed loop stored value that meets certain criteria.

Additionally, Arizona SB 1580, using the Model Act language, clarifies that covered money transmission involves a transaction with a person in the state  e.g., selling stored value to, or receiving money from, a person in the state  regardless of the location of the licensee.

What is money?

(And is virtual currency money?)

Arizona currently defines money as a medium of exchange that is authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.

3

However, Arizona has also embraced the Model Act definition of money transmission to include the transmission of monetary value.

This term, which is broader than money, means a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money.

West Virginias law similarly defines regulated money transmission to include transmitting money or other value that substitutes for money.

Other regulators have interpreted similar language to encompass activities such as receiving, custodying, transmitting or exchanging virtual currencies, therefore requiring a money transmission license to engage in such activities, and it is possible that West Virginia or Arizona could take a similar approach.

Payroll processing West Virginia SB 505 expressly states that money transmission includes payroll processing services.

This provision is in the Model Act, but Arizona has not included it in its definition of regulated money transmission.

Receipt requirements and customer service phone number Arizonas current money transmission law does not impose express receipt requirements, and West Virginias SB 505 does not include the receipt requirements from the Model Act, but the new Arizona law incorporates these provisions."
Cooley,Arizona Embraces CSBS Model Money Transmission Law; West Virginia Incorporates Some Key Provisions,"As a result, for certain transactions involving money received for transmission from consumers for personal, family or household purposes, Arizona licensees will be required to provide a receipt that includes transaction-related disclosures similar to current receipt requirements in other jurisdictions, such as California.

However, in line with the expanded Model Act requirements, Arizona licensees will be required to include on such receipts the name of the licensee, the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) unique identifier, the licensees business address and a customer service telephone number.

Right to refund The Model Act includes right to refund provisions based on existing state precedents such as California and Washingtons money transmission laws.

West Virginia did not include such a provision in SB 505, but Arizonas SB 1580 did.

4 As a result, licensees in Arizona will be required to provide a refund if requested by a consumer, unless certain conditions are met.

There are also carve outs to this requirement that may apply in the context of money transmission services provided to commercial customers.

Permissible investments Arizona and West Virginia both amended the definition of permissible investments, which now include, among other things, the full drawable amount of an irrevocable standby letter of credit, provided certain criteria are met.

Additionally, Arizonas SB 1580 includes automated clearing house (ACH) payments in transit to the licensee and ACH and wire payments in transit to a payee as a permissible investment.

(The West Virginia legislation expressly authorizes the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions to identify additional permissible investments.)

The widespread adoption of these new types of permissible investments has the potential to significantly ease the permissible investments burden of licensees.

Net worth requirements As part of a package with the changes to permissible investments, the prudential standards provisions of the Model Act also establish a new sliding scale minimum tangible net worth requirement as a percentage of the licensees total assets.

Arizona and West Virginia have adopted this new standard (as has South Dakota), which effectively creates a new national standard for minimum net worth for any licensee in one or all of these three states.

What does this mean for payments companies?

A number of provisions in the Model Act, as adopted by West Virginia and in particular by Arizona, can be the start of a regulatory regime that is less burdensome and clearer for licensed money transmitters and other payments companies.

Additionally, the elimination in Arizona of unique requirements to collect information such as occupation, signature and taxpayer identification for transactions of $1,000 is likely to be welcome news for industry participants.

Nevertheless, until the Model Act is more broadly adopted by other states, these initial adoption efforts likely will not have a significant impact on payments companies operating on a national basis in terms of easing the burden of managing compliance with disparate laws and regulations.

In the interim, industry participants should closely review the changes to the laws in these states, and track developments nationally with respect to implementation of the Model Act.

Unless a critical mass of states embraces the Model Act, it risks creating a new and different legal regime that money transmitters will need to manage on top of existing state-by-state variations.

Cooley,CFPB Warns Complex Consumer Credit Decision Models May Violate ECOA,"On May 26, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warned via Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-03 that creditors using complex algorithmic credit evaluation models are not shielded from complying with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) requirement that consumers receive notice of the reasons why a lender took adverse action on an application or existing credit account.

If a model is complex to the point that the creditor cannot articulate the reason a consumer was denied credit, use of the model may violate ECOA.

Circular 2022-03 ECOA has long required that creditors who take adverse action on a consumers application for credit, such as denying an application for credit or terminating an existing account, provide to consumers a notice of that action.

Where the adverse action notice contains a statement of reasons for the adverse action taken, the statement must be specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action.

1

When the adverse action is based on a credit scoring system, no factor that was the principal reason for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure.

2 General statements that the adverse action was based on the creditors internal standards or policies, or that the applicant failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditors credit scoring system, are insufficient to comply with ECOA and

Regulation B.

The circular does not provide creditors with guidance regarding how to comply with the requirements of ECOA and Regulation B. Rather, the circular explains that the use of algorithmic models in credit decisioning violates ECOA and Regulation B if creditors are unable to articulate a specific reason for taking adverse action.

The CFPB also warns that a creditor cannot justify noncompliance with these requirements based on the mere fact that the technology it employs to evaluate applications is too complicated or opaque to understand.

All creditors, even those using algorithmic credit decision systems, must provide clear statements to consumers when taking adverse action, either in the notice itself or when the consumer requests information regarding the reasons for the adverse action.

These statements must identify the principal reason(s) the consumer was denied credit and must be drafted clearly so that consumers understand why they received an adverse action.

Thus, a creditors lack of understanding of its own methods is not a defense against liability for violating ECOA and Regulation Bs requirements.

What does this mean for you?

When the CFPB released its annual fair lending report on May 6, 2022 , Director Rohit Chopra said the CFPB will be sharpening its focus on digital redlining and algorithmic bias.

As more technology platforms, including Big Tech firms, influence the financial services marketplace, the CFPB will be working to identify emerging risks and to develop appropriate policy responses.

Circular 2022-03 is the latest concrete example of how the CFPB will scrutinize creditors utilizing advanced credit evaluation techniques.

Creditors that leverage their own complex algorithmic systems in credit decisioning should ensure that they sufficiently understand how these models operate so they can provide consumers with clear and accurate reasons for taking an adverse action.

Creditors utilizing third-party models are not absolved from compliance with ECOA, and they should engage with their vendors to ensure they understand the factors driving the credit decision  and can communicate those factors to consumers in a clear and effective manner.

Cooley,CFPB Targets Credit Card Issuers’ Payment Furnishing Practices,"On May 25, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced on its blog that it had sent letters to the chief executive officers of six major credit card issuers seeking information on their practice of withholding actual monthly payment amounts made by their customers from reporting to the national consumer reporting agencies (CRAs).

The bureaus latest inquiry comes against the backdrop of a 2020 quarterly consumer trends report , which examined how often lenders furnish actual payment information to CRAs and highlighted a significant decline in actual payment history reporting for credit card companies.

CFPBs 2020 report on payment amount furnishing In 2020, the CFPB conducted a study on the prevalence of actual payment amount information reported to CRAs over the course of an eight-year period.

The research showed a significant decline in actual payment furnishing for credit card accounts between 2012 and 2020  with only 40% of credit card tradelines containing actual payment data in 2020.

By contrast, the study found a steady increase in actual payment furnishing for installment loan products (including mortgages, auto and student loans) during the same period.

According to the CFPB, half of the largest credit card issuers chose to stop furnishing actual payment amount data to prevent competitors from using tradeline data to identify and poach their most profitable customers.

The CFPB also observed that major issuers suspended actual payment amount furnishing during the same quarter in 2014.

The report concluded that issuers decision to withhold actual payment data could have implications on consumer access to credit.

CFPBs latest inquiry Letters sent to the six major credit card issuers pose the following questions: If the issuer had regularly and consistently furnished actual payment data since 2012 but no longer does, or, if the issuer never regularly or consistently furnished actual payment data, what is the rationale for that change or practice?

If the issuer regularly and consistently furnishes actual payment data for some but not all card account products, what is the rationale for that practice?

Are there material barriers that would prevent credit card issuers from reporting actual payment amounts to CRAs?

Does the issuer intend to start furnishing actual payment amount data, and if so, how quickly, consistently and accurately could it furnish that data?

The letters and blog post cite the bureaus 2020 study and warn that suppressing actual payment amount information  which the CFPB says issuers maintain internally for account management and marketing purposes  can leave consumers with thinner credit reports, which in turn may hinder their ability to access credit at competitive rates.

Insights This latest probe is yet another example of the bureaus focus on credit reporting issues as well as industry practices that may hinder competition in the marketplace  which have been under close scrutiny since Director Rohit Chopra assumed leadership of the bureau.

Most recently, the CFPB announced the opening of a new Office of Competition and Innovation to promote fair competition and reduce barriers for consumers to switch accounts and providers, among other mandates.

The CFPBs inquiry into credit card issuers furnishing practices is neither an official probe nor a supervisory request, and response to its letters is voluntary.

Responses received by the bureau could also inform a future rulemaking to require credit card issuers, and furnishers more broadly, to report actual payments made by borrowers to their credit accounts.

This latest initiative could also presage future efforts by the CFPB to identify and attempt to address inconsistencies in credit reporting practices across industries.

We expect the CFPB to continue to pay close attention to credit card companies practices more broadly and their impact on competition and consumers."
Cooley,CFPB Targets Credit Card Issuers’ Payment Furnishing Practices,"We expect the CFPB to continue to pay close attention to credit card companies practices more broadly and their impact on competition and consumers.

In March, the CFPB released a study criticizing late fees charged by credit card issuers .

The study was accompanied by a press release suggesting that the bureau may revisit Regulation Zs safe harbor amounts for imposing late fees.

1

The bureaus most recent Supervisory Highlights also focused heavily on issuers practices involving account management and credit reporting, with an emphasis on consumer reporting dispute investigation and notification issues.

In addition  and just one day after announcing its inquiry into credit card issuers withholding of payment information when reporting  the CFPB published a blog post advising consumers of their right, after submitting a credit reporting dispute with a furnisher, to receive a clear statement of results.

The blog post reminds all furnishers of the information that such notices must include and specifically calls out credit card furnishers for sending unclear notices to consumers at the end of dispute investigations.

Cooley,City of Chicago Expands Sexual Harassment Prevention Obligations for Employers,"On April 27, 2022, the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor announced the approval of several enhancements to the citys sexual harassment laws in the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance.

These enhancements are part of Mayor Lori Lightfoots Citywide Strategic Plan to address gender-based violence and human trafficking.

Expanding the definition of sexual harassment to include sexual misconduct The definition of sexual harassment in the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance is now expanded to explicitly include sexual misconduct, which is defined as any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of authority, or misuse of an individuals employment position.

This definition change takes effect June 4, 2022.

The full definition of sexual harassment now means any (i) unwelcome sexual advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individuals employment, or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individuals work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of authority, or misuse of an individuals employment position.

Written policy and written notice requirements for Chicago employers As of July 1, 2022, Chicago employers must have a written policy on sexual harassment.

Additionally, employers must display a poster providing notice and advising of the prohibition on sexual harassment where employees can see it.

The written policy must include at least the following: A statement that sexual harassment is illegal in Chicago.

The new definition of sexual harassment in Section 6-010-020, as explained above.

Cooley,Medical Debt Info Furnishers Must Beware Increased Scrutiny,"Editor's note: Co-authored by Jessica Pollet and Margaux Curie, this article was originally published by Law360 .

The COVID-19 pandemic put individuals at heightened risk for incurring medical debt.

Medical debt, which is often unforeseeable, unavoidable and rife with errors due to provider and insurer adjustments, can have an outsized impact on consumers' credit reports and, thus, consumers' ability to access future credit or receive credit on favorable terms.

It is therefore unsurprising that in focusing on post-pandemic relief for consumers, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has reprioritized concerns around inclusion of medical debt on credit reports.

Three separate guidance documents published by the bureau since the beginning of the year underscore its belief that there are enhanced consumer risks in collections and reporting of medical debt.

First, on Jan. 13, the bureau published a compliance bulletin reminding debt collectors, who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies, as well as the consumer reporting agencies themselves, of their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act when dealing with medical debts covered by the newly effective No Surprises Act  which protects individuals from surprise medical bills, including by capping amounts consumers are required to pay for certain types of medical bills.

Namely, the report warns debt collectors that collecting or reporting medical debt charges in excess of those permitted under the No Surprises Act could amount to violations of the FDCPA or the FCRA.

In view of this, the bureau asserts that maintaining reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy of information reported, including medical debt, is of the utmost importance.

Second, in February, the bureau issued a detailed report outlining, among other things, its concern regarding the adverse impact of including medical debt on consumer reports.

The report reflects that while ""$88 billion in medical debt [appears] on consumer credit records,"" accounting for 58% of all uncollected debt tradelines reported to consumer reporting agencies, the bureau found that ""many individuals who ha[ve] medical debts in collections showed no other signs of financial distress and [] usually paid their obligations in a timely manner.""[1]

Given this, as well as its finding that medical debt is susceptible to inaccuracies that are often difficult for consumers  including the most vulnerable consumers  to detect or resolve, the bureau asserts that ""inclusion of [medical debt information] in consumers' credit reports threatens the integrity and accuracy of the credit reporting system as a whole, creating inefficiencies for creditors as well as patients.""

Lastly, in April, the bureau released a third report, which considers medical billing and collection complaints submitted to the CFPB.

From these, the bureau draws the conclusion that, among other things, Americans experience ""their credit reports being used as weapons to force payment""[2] even in situations in which they do not recognize or owe the medical bill at issue.

The bureau also found that medical debt has a lower predictive value than other forms of debt and, thus, its inclusion on consumers reports may provide little actual insight to the industry.

The bureau's guidance on medical debt landed hard with consumer reporting agencies.

Defaulted medical debt placed for collections and which has subsequently been paid will no longer be included on a consumer credit report issued by any of the three consumer reporting agencies, notwithstanding that the FCRA allows reporting for up to seven years, whether paid or not.[4] Consumer reporting agencies will extend the period before an unpaid medical debt can be reported from six months to one year to give ""consumers more time to work with insurance and/or healthcare providers to address their debt before it is reported on their credit file.""

In the first half of 2023, the three consumer reporting agencies will also stop including medical debt on consumer credit reports where the amount of the debt furnished is below $500, which the CFPB coincidentally found to represent the majority of medical debts reflected on credit reports.

Although these changes are intended to eliminate nearly 70% of medical collection debt tradelines from consumer credit reports,[5] it remains to be seen whether that will be enough for the CFPB and, also, the White House,[6] which recently published a fact sheet calling on federal agencies to eliminate medical debt as a factor for credit underwriting  and, by extension, in credit reports.

While the CFPB had previously focused on medical debt, the level of scrutiny shown by the bureau in the last several months is unprecedented.

In 2014, the CFPB had released a study[7] on medical debt collections, where it noted that ""medical debt collections trade lines affect the credit reports of nearly one-fifth of all consumers in the credit reporting system.

""In 2017, the bureau took action against two medical debt collection law firms that furnished consumer information without maintaining written policies and procedures regarding their furnishing practices or protocols to ensure the accuracy and integrity of information reported to the consumer reporting agency, among other things.

The CFPB's renewed attention to the topic, heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting medical expenses incurred by consumers, signals that the bureau will double down on medical debt reporting practices and that enforcement may be forthcoming.

To that end, debt collectors and others that furnish medical debt information to consumer reporting agencies should consider the following actions.

Review policies and procedures to adjust for changes in medical debt reporting based on the No Surprises Act and guidance by the major consumer reporting agencies.

Furnishers should consider revising their policies and procedures regarding how medical debt information covered by the No Surprises Act is furnished to prevent reporting charges in excess of those permitted under the No Surprises Act.

Furnishers should also consider reviewing their medical debt furnishing practices to be consistent with the consumer reporting agencies' new directives, outlined above.

While the consumer reporting agencies have rolled out guidance to help furnishers implement these new directives, furnishers may consider directly engaging with the consumer reporting agencies for proper implementation.

Double down on the accuracy of medical debt data reported to consumer reporting agencies.

The FCRA requires furnishers, of medical debt or otherwise, to maintain written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy of the consumer credit information provided to consumer reporting agencies The latest issue of the CFPB's supervisory highlights[8] once again reminds furnishers of this requirement, which is further exemplified by a long line of consent orders between the bureau and industry participants dealing with accuracy issues."
Cooley,Medical Debt Info Furnishers Must Beware Increased Scrutiny,"Importantly, the CFPB is now also putting the onus on consumer reporting agencies to directly police furnishers that fail to provide accurate medical debt information.

The CFPB expects consumer reporting agencies to cut off access to the credit reporting system for furnishers that report inaccurate medical debt information, and will hold CRAs that do not accountable.

As such, it is more important than ever for furnishers to establish and maintain reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of medical debt information reported.

In doing so, furnishers may consider whether  due to the complexity of medical billing  any type of prefurnishing account analysis is warranted.

Furnishers should maintain records to substantiate the accuracy of medical information furnished should also be kept for a reasonable period of time.

Review consumer complaints and dispute practices to mitigate regulatory scrutiny.

Furnishing inaccurate medical debt data or data inconsistent with the consumer reporting agencies directives also expose furnishers to an increase in consumer disputes.

The FCRA and Regulation V require that furnishers conduct a reasonable investigation of consumer disputes, whether received directly from the consumer or from the consumer reporting agency.

This generally includes reviewing all relevant information, reporting the results to the consumer or to the consumer reporting agency, whichever applies, and, if the furnisher finds that the information reported was indeed inaccurate or incomplete, promptly correcting or updating that information.

The CFPB reiterated the importance of maintaining robust consumer dispute policies and procedures in its most recent supervisory highlights and confirms that furnishers should not simply delete a disputed tradeline in lieu of conducting a reasonable investigation.

Similarly, furnishers should ensure that they maintain adequate policies and procedures for the handling of formal and informal consumer complaints, including complaints submitted through the CFPB complaint database.

Timely and comprehensive investigation and resolution of consumer complaints prevents recurrence of issues and resubmission of complaints, and, thus, mitigates potential regulatory scrutiny.

Stay current with ongoing developments affecting the medical reporting space.

This is a fast-paced, evolving regulatory environment and furnishers should stay abreast of ongoing developments.

Furnishers should also monitor legislative developments affecting the medical debt reporting space.

In addition to the bureau's initiatives, several bills are currently pending in Congress that if enacted would affect the medical debt and credit reporting landscape.

For instance, the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, H.R. 2547,[9] sponsored by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif, would amend the FCRA to prohibit the reporting of medical debt arising from any medically necessary procedures and impose additional notice requirements on furnishers with respect to those medical debts.

Cooley,FTC to Focus on Edtech Providers in COPPA Enforcement Push,"On Thursday, May 19, 2022, the five Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners unanimously approved a Policy Statement on the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

1 President Joe Biden issued a statement of support of the FTC decision the same day, highlighting the Policy Statement as a significant step forward on a pledge to protect childrens privacy the President made during the State of the Union Address earlier this year.

While COPPA applies generally to operators of a commercial website or online service that collects personal information online from children under the age of 13, the focus of the Policy Statement is primarily on edtech companies operating under agreements with K-12 schools.

Importantly, the Policy Statement does not change existing requirements; however, it signals a clear FTC intent to enforce those existing requirements more broadly with a focus on edtech.

What is COPPA, and how does it apply to edtech?

COPPA (the statute) and the COPPA Rule (FTC regulation) apply broadly to the collection of personal information 2 by online services directed at children under the age of 13 and by general audience online services when they have actual knowledge that a user is a child under the age of 13.

The most well-known requirement of COPPA is that operators subject to its requirements generally must obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children.

Longstanding FTC staff guidance recognizes an exception to this requirement for services operating in schools  essentially, the schools decision to use the online service obviates the need for the operator to get individual parental consent for school use, provided various requirements are met.

For example, as further explained below, the edtech service operator must provide the same notice of its information practices to the school that it otherwise would be required to provide directly to a parent, and it must use information collected from child users only to provide the service requested by the school and not for advertising, marketing or any other commercial purpose.

However, this exception extends only to COPPAs notice and consent requirements and not to other operator obligations under COPPA.

These other obligations  centering on data minimization and data security  are the primary focus of the FTC Policy Statement (and likely future enforcement efforts).

Does the Policy Statement change the School Exception to obtaining individual parental consent?

No.

While some privacy and parental rights advocates have targeted the School Exception for significant changes (either through a legislative amendment or FTC rulemaking) it was not changed by this Policy Statement.

The standards set out in the FTC FAQ ( SectionN ) remain unchanged.

3

But the Policy Statement makes clear that the FTC intends to aggressively enforce the boundaries of the School Exception.

The exception applies only to the extent that the data collected is directly related to performing a school function and only to the individual parental consent requirement and not to other COPPA requirements regarding data minimization and data security.

What are these other COPPA requirements?

Are they new?

The other COPPA requirements are not new but have not historically been the FTCs enforcement focus to the same extent as the consent requirement.

The other requirements are: Limitations on data collection Limitations on data use Limitations on data retention Data security requirements What are COPPAs data collection limitations?

The School Exception to obtaining individual parental consent is narrowly interpreted.

It applies only to the collection of personal information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in that [educational] activity.

4"
Cooley,FTC to Focus on Edtech Providers in COPPA Enforcement Push,"It applies only to the collection of personal information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in that [educational] activity.

4

If an operator intends to collect personal information that goes beyond that direct purpose, it must still obtain verifiable parental consent before doing so and it may not condition use of the service for the educational activity on obtaining that consent.

In other words, companies cannot provide parents with a choice only between not permitting their child to participate in the educational activity or consenting to the additional information collection.

A parent must have the option to decline consent to the additional information collection without impacting the childs ability to participate in the educational activity.

Note that COPPAs restrictions on mandatory data collection extend to all COPPA-covered operators and not just to edtech providers.

The Policy Statement underscores that all COPPA-covered companies must refrain from conditioning participation in any activity on a child disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in that activity.

What are the data use prohibitions?

Data collected from children in a school activity cannot be used for any commercial purpose unrelated to the provision of the school-requested online service, including marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes.

To a large extent, this prohibition mirrors other limitations placed on data collected in schools (regardless of the age of the student) under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and applicable state student privacy laws (such as Californias Student Online Personal Information Protection Act and New Yorks Education Law  2-d).

The key difference is enforcement capability  the FTC, under COPPA, has significantly more enforcement leverage (including harsher penalties) and resources.

So, same requirement  but greater likelihood of more severe consequences for noncompliance.

What are the data retention prohibitions?

COPPA strictly prohibits operators from retaining childrens personal information for longer than is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it is collected.

Notably, operators cannot retain data for speculative future potential uses.

5

Therefore, operators should have clear and robust data minimization policies that assess direct uses of data and establish timelines for deletion when the direct purpose is fulfilled.

This is notably a bit at odds with FERPA obligations, which gives schools control over personal information from student education records (including, at the schools discretion, the ability to retain that data beyond the initial use).

From an operators perspective, this is where clarity in your school agreement is important.

To the extent you are retaining data at the direction of a school client, the COPPA risk would appear low  but this should be clear in your agreement.

Ensuring robust data deletion requirements are in your school agreement would be beneficial to establish clear destruction protocols.

What are the data security requirements?

COPPA requires that operators establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information.

6

While the regulations are not granular about the necessary security requirements, the FTC is clear that it interprets these standards as a high bar and has taken this approach in its enforcement history.

As with the other requirements, much of this is duplicative of what is required to contract with schools in most states as new state student privacy laws have been incorporated into those contracts.

Most districts now require operators to agree to data privacy agreements that contain robust data security requirements."
Cooley,FTC to Focus on Edtech Providers in COPPA Enforcement Push,"Most districts now require operators to agree to data privacy agreements that contain robust data security requirements.

What is notable is that the FTC is emphasizing that it intends to aggressively enforce these requirements  and that it intends to do so proactively even absent a breach.

7

As an edtech company, what should I prioritize?

Again, broadly speaking, nothing has changed regarding edtech provider privacy requirements for operating in K-12 schools.

What has changed is the risk of enforcement, particularly by the FTC.

The Policy Statement highlights the importance of taking steps that were already good practice: Review your K-12 district contracts.

Make sure you comply with the data requirements (collection, use and retention limitations as well as security requirements).

Review your Privacy Policy to make sure it is up to date and sufficiently detailed.

Review your information security policies and practices to ensure they meet common industry standards and/or identify gaps for remediation as soon as practicable.

Implement or review your data minimization policy.

Do you collect only data necessary to provide your services?

If you collect more, do you provide parents the ability to decline any additional collection?

Do you have a data retention policy that is aligned with your contractual obligations and minimizing the time data is retained?

Who do you share data with?

Do you have commitments from your subcontractors that align with your COPPA obligations?

Remember, you may be on the hook contractually or otherwise for the acts of your subcontractors.

Are any Significant COPPA changes expected in the near future?

Good question.

The that would seek to modify (or update) the COPPA Rule.

That process could have more of an impact on issues like the scope of the School Exception.

At the meeting, multiple Commissioners voiced an interest in seeing that process through.

There are also multiple bills pending in Congress that would update the COPPA statute.

It isnt likely that Congress will pass these bills prior to the midterm election, but they do enjoy bipartisan support.

Cooley,"Bedoya Confirmation Puts Democrats Back in Control of Privacy, Antitrust Enforcement at FTC","On May 16, 2022, eight months after President Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Alvaro Bedoya to serve as a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, Bedoya was sworn in.

The FTC includes five commissioners  only three of which can be from the same political party  and had been split 2-2 since October 2021.

During that time, FTC Chair Lina Khan had been limited in her ability to move her competition and consumer protection agendas, as she needed a third Republican commissioner to bring enforcement actions, issue new regulations and even commence studies.

Bedoyas arrival brings a likely reliable third vote to support Khan and could be a harbinger of a more aggressive FTC.

Bedoya brings extensive experience in privacy issues at a time when the Democratic commissioners have signaled a deep interest in expanding the FTCs privacy enforcement and rulemaking .

On the competition docket, Bedoyas vote could allow the majority to bring more aggressive cases based on novel theories of harm and potentially issue competition rules.

Bedoya primed to lead on privacy issues Bedoya is an expert on digital privacy.

Prior to his nomination, he served as the founding director of the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology, focusing on digital privacy issues, including facial recognition, disparate impact, and government surveillance.

Bedoya also has considerable government experience, having served as chief counsel of the US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law.

As a privacy, cybersecurity and civil rights expert, Bedoya is set to leverage his long history crafting policy and researching these topics to help dictate the FTCs consumer protection agenda and enforcement priorities.

He has made clear that he believes privacy is a civil right .

As Biden noted in his nomination statement , Bedoyas research and advocacy focus on the idea that privacy is for everyone.

Bedoya echoed this sentiment in his opening remarks before the Senate Commerce Committee , explaining that he sees privacy not in terms of data, but in terms of people who may be helped or harmed by companies decisions around privacy.

He brings a unique perspective to the FTC through his research on surveillance technology and algorithmic discrimination, including facial recognition, and may push the commission to expand enforcement in these arenas.

Khan recently provided a high-level road map for the FTCs approach to privacy issues, and Bedoya is likely to be tasked with implementing this road map.

John Davisson, counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, analogized that  what Chairman Khan is to antitrust, Alvaro Bedoya is to privacy, data protection, and civil rights .

Bedoyas impact on the FTCs privacy agenda To date, the Biden administrations FTC has lacked a commissioner with Bedoyas privacy expertise, and that may have impacted the extent of privacy-related enforcement.

There are signs that this could now shift.

In just the first week after Bedoyas confirmation, the FTC issued a Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Rule Policy Statement , which made clear that education technology providers are under scrutiny .

The Biden administration also issued an executive order in July 2021 pushing for rulemaking around private surveillance practices , a topic Bedoya has focused on in the past and could lead on at the FTC.

Perhaps most significantly, the reconstituted commission may soon embark on a project that would further strengthen the FTCs role as one of the nations most active privacy and cybersecurity regulators.

In December 2021, the commission signaled official interest for the first time in writing data privacy rules under Section 18 of the FTC Act.

This would memorialize the commissions authority to enforce privacy and cybersecurity issues before Congress enacts a privacy law, and could add to the penalties available to the FTC for privacy infractions."
Cooley,"Bedoya Confirmation Puts Democrats Back in Control of Privacy, Antitrust Enforcement at FTC","While noteworthy, rulemaking attempts are not surprising, given public advocacy by Khan and former Commissioner Rohit Chopra to advance long-dormant FTC rulemaking processes.

These efforts have redoubled since last year when the commission was stripped of its ability to obtain equitable monetary relief under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act.

The privacy rulemaking notice cited the need to curb lax security practices, limit privacy abuses, and ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.

These are all issues where Bedoya has deep experience, and his confirmation makes it more likely that FTC privacy rules will move forward.

While Bedoya comes with a depth of experience on privacy law, his record is less established in other areas of the commissions consumer protection purview, such as credit and financial protection issues.

Given his predecessors progressive stance on most issues, Bedoyas vote may provide balance to the FTCs position on these issues.

Indeed, Bedoya has been praised on Capitol Hill for his bipartisan approach , with former Hill colleague and current Republican-appointed FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips supporting Bedoyas appointment, describing him as bright and thoughtful.

Bedoyas extensive Beltway experience and connections could prove useful as the FTC determines a path forward.

Bedoya anticipated to support Khans aggressive antitrust agenda Bedoyas antitrust record is even less established, but early signals point to his support for Khans robust antitrust enforcement agenda.

He has already named veteran antitrust lawyers as attorney advisers who have been active in the FTCs merger challenges and in state attorneys general technology investigations, another sign that he agrees with broader enforcement.

A third vote with Khan and Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter would break the deadlock of the past seven months.

Under the last Democratic majority on the FTC, a number of policy initiatives moved forward over the dissents of the Republican commissioners.

By contrast, in recent months, few votes appear to have occurred on major policy initiatives, and an effort to move forward with a study of contracting practices by pharmacy benefit managers failed.

Merger challenges, which would have required at least three votes, have largely proceeded on 4-0 votes, signaling that close decisions did not proceed.

Perhaps the most significant action undertaken in this period has been the launch of merger guideline revisions.

A Democratic majority will control the content and ultimate approval of these revisions, and could expand the FTCs antitrust enforcement efforts in a number of ways, including: Increased merger and conduct challenges under novel theories of harm.

Increased post-closing challenges.

Section 5 rulemaking.

Both Khan and Slaughter have expressed more concern with preventing Type 2 errors at the commission  i.e., failing to block transactions that might harm competition  than blocking transactions that may not ultimately harm competition.

The majority likely will approve more aggressive challenges to deals, and consider impacts on labor markets and privacy, as well as nascent and potential competition.

As a result, the FTC staff is likely to find itself in court more often, particularly since Khan has said she is not afraid to lose some cases.

While the commission has issued pre-closing warning letters since soon after Khan became chair, actual post-closing challenges to deals have been limited to a select few firms.

With a new majority, additional post-closing challenges may follow, including mergers that the Republican commissioners reportedly would not support challenging.

With Bedoya giving the Democrats a majority, they may also use rulemaking to classify certain conduct as an unfair method of competition."
Cooley,"Bedoya Confirmation Puts Democrats Back in Control of Privacy, Antitrust Enforcement at FTC","With Bedoya giving the Democrats a majority, they may also use rulemaking to classify certain conduct as an unfair method of competition.

Under the last Democratic majority, the FTC withdrew its 2015 Section 5 Enforcement Principles , stating that the principles abrogate[] the Commissions congressionally mandated duty to use its expertise to identify and combat unfair methods of competition even if they do not violate a separate antitrust statute.

Bedoyas vote will be critical if the agency decides to issue competition-based regulations using the agencys Section 18 rulemaking.

For example, Bedoyas vote may allow the commission to answer the call from Bidens July 2021 executive order directing the agency to use its rulemaking authority to declare unlawful noncompete and other agreements that may limit worker mobility, corporate data collection and surveillance practices, and other industry-specific practices that some believe inhibit competition.

While the exact impact Bedoya will have on consumer protection and antitrust enforcement remains to be seen, one thing is clear: Bedoyas arrival positions the FTC to start making good on several policy promises and bring more aggressive enforcement actions across the board.

Cooley law clerk Kira Hessekiel and paralegal Nick Girard also contributed to this alert.

Cooley,Major Reforms Proposed for UK Merger Control: What Dealmakers Need to Know,"On April 20, 2022, the UK government announced wide-ranging reforms to UK competition and consumer law policy , including significant threshold changes to the UK merger control regime.

In particular, while the government aims to retain the UKs voluntary and non-suspensory merger regime, the proposed reforms plan to expand the already extensive ability of the UKs Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to scrutinize mergers.

Helpfully for merging parties, however, the reforms introduce an objective, turnover-based safe harbor for small mergers by exempting those below specified turnover thresholds from review.

The planned reforms were included in the Queens most recent speech, although the timing of their entry into force is still unclear.

In this alert, we will explain the main merger control reforms proposed and provide some early details for dealmakers.

Key reforms proposed Under the proposed reforms, the existing thresholds used to establish the CMAs jurisdiction over mergers will be amended as follows: Increased turnover threshold:

The UK target turnover threshold will be increased in line with inflation from 70 million (approximately $87 million) to 100 million (approximately $124 million).

Target companies whose annual UK revenue is less than 100 million will fall outside this increased threshold, unless the share of supply threshold is met.

1 New no-increment share of supply threshold:

The existing share of supply threshold, which gives the CMA jurisdiction where a merger leads to an increment on a combined share of supply of 25% or more, will be retained, and a new share of supply threshold will be introduced.

This is to enable review of so-called killer acquisition and other mergers which do not involve direct competitors.

Under this new threshold, an acquirer must have an existing share of supply of goods or services of 33% or more in the UK or a substantial part of the UK, and a UK turnover of at least 350 million (approximately $433 million).

No increment is required.

This new threshold also will include some form of UK nexus to capture only mergers with an appropriate link to the UK, although no further details on what this would entail have been published.

Safe harbor for small mergers: To reduce the burden on small and micro businesses, the UK government is planning to introduce a safe harbor to exempt mergers from review where each partys UK turnover is less than 10 million (approximately $12 million).

2

Some changes to the merger review procedure have been proposed to enable the CMA to deliver more effective and efficient merger investigations, including by: Allowing the CMA to accept binding commitments from businesses earlier during a Phase 2 review.

Enhancing the fast-track procedure that allows a case to be referred to Phase 2 at any stage of pre-notification or the Phase 1 review if requested by the merging parties.

Importantly, under this new procedure, parties wont have to accept that the merger may create a substantial lessening of competition.

The UK government also has proposed including the new competition regime for digital markets within the reform package.

While these reforms initially proposed new merger control rules for large digital firms, including mandatory reviews and a lower standard of proof at Phase 2, the merger-related proposals have been pared back significantly.

Firms that are designated as having strategic market status (SMS) will have to give advance notice to the CMA of some of their transactions, but they will not be obliged to make full notifications.

What dealmakers need to know Although the UK will retain a voluntary regime and dealmakers will retain discretion as to their UK merger control filing strategy under the proposed reforms, dealmakers should be aware that the expanded flexibility brought about by these proposals is likely to increase the risk that the CMA could intervene if transactions are not notified."
Cooley,Major Reforms Proposed for UK Merger Control: What Dealmakers Need to Know,"The effect of the proposals is to significantly expand the CMAs jurisdiction through the introduction of a no-increment share of supply threshold.

Mergers involving significant market players with a UK turnover of more than 350 million (approximately $433 million) will have to consider whether the new thresholds apply to their transactions, even where the target has a very small presence in the UK or where it has no competitive overlaps with the acquirer.

Although the new share of supply threshold is meant to make it easier for the CMA to establish jurisdiction, dont expect that the same will be true for dealmakers.

As the new test does not specify that the market in which a merging party has a 33% share must be connected to the merger, the application of the new threshold likely will require a careful case-by-case assessment that takes into account all business activities.

As with the current share of supply test, it may not be enough to rely on the familiar metrics of volume or value to assess jurisdiction.

The CMA has broad discretion in choosing how to measure shares of supply  and in the past has used the number of employees, patents filed and conversations in business-to-consumer messaging as suitable metrics.

Although SMS firms will not have to get approval for their deals under a distinct mandatory merger control regime for transactions in the digital sector as previously anticipated, these companies will be subject to the new no-increment share of supply test, which may to some extent plug the gap left from the UK governments pared-back digital proposals.

The threshold for intervention in media mergers on public interest grounds will continue to be 70million.

Public interest interventions in media mergers will be exempted from the small-merger safe harbor."
Cooley,"CFPB’s First Substantive Consumer Financial Protection Circular Warns of Liability for Misusing FDIC’s Name or Logo, Misrepresenting Deposit Insurance","On May 17, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released its first substantive Consumer Financial Protection Circular  Circular 2022-02  a day after announcing its new circular system.

The circulars key message is that misuse of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations name or logo, and misrepresentations about deposit insurance coverage, may violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) prohibition on deceptive practices.

The circulars publication was accompanied by a statement from CFPB Director Rohit Chopra emphasizing the illegality of the practice and anti-competitive harm it causes, with rhetoric similar to what we have seen in recent announcements.

At the same time, the FDIC issued a final rule prohibiting misleading use of the FDICs logo or name, or misrepresenting deposit insurance coverage.

The FDICs final rule also focuses on nonbanks, such as fintech and cryptocurrency companies, noting in the commentary that it will primarily affect non-bank entities and individuals who are potentially misusing the FDICs name or logo or are making misrepresentations about deposit insurance.

As a member of the FDIC Board of Directors, Chopra, unsurprisingly, confirmed that he voted in favor of the final rule.

Circular 2022-02 In Circular 2022-02, the CFPB puts entities  especially those involving new technologies such as digital assets, including crypto-assets  on notice that misrepresentations about deposit insurance and misuse of the FDIC logo or name can violate the CFPA.

It underscores federal regulators commitment to addressing practices involving fintech and cryptocurrency products and services using existing authorities.

It also aligns with Chopras focus on those companies, as captured in his statement addressing the FDIC rule.

In that statement, he expressed concern about potential misconduct involving novel technologies, including so-called stablecoins and other crypto-assets, and cautioned that they pose risks to consumers who may be baited by misrepresentations or false advertisements about deposit insurance.

The circular explains that misrepresentations about deposit insurance, misuse of the FDICs name or logo, or false advertising by companies could violate the CFPAs prohibition against deceptive acts or practices.

The CFPB has authority to enforce violations of the CFPA and has chosen to do so with some frequency since its inception.

The CFPB provided the following examples of deceptive conduct: Engaging in, or purporting to engage in, deposit-taking activity by accepting, or offering to accept, funds for use by consumers and misrepresenting that those funds are FDIC-insured when they are not.

Claiming that consumer financial products or services are regulated by the FDIC or insured or eligible for FDIC insurance, if those claims expressly or implicitly indicate that the product is FDIC-insured when that is not the case.

The circular underscored that disclaimers may not cure otherwise deceptive messages or practices.

It also emphasized that misrepresentations may violate the CFPA regardless of whether the covered person or service provider engage in the conduct knowingly.

The CFPB specifically expressed concern that firms offering or providing digital assets, including crypto-assets, may be particularly prone to making  deceptive claims to consumers about FDIC deposit insurance coverage.

It is clear from this messaging that the CFPB is concerned that deceptive statements about deposit insurance coverage will harm consumers and may disadvantage institutions that truthfully market FDIC-insured accounts.

The new circular system On May 16, 2022, in Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-01 , the CFPB first announced that it would be issuing such circulars to other state and federal government agencies with authority to enforce federal consumer financial laws."
Cooley,"CFPB’s First Substantive Consumer Financial Protection Circular Warns of Liability for Misusing FDIC’s Name or Logo, Misrepresenting Deposit Insurance","According to the CFPB, the circulars will provide background information about applicable law, articulate considerations relevant to the CFPBs exercise of its authorities, and advise other parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law.

Although these circulars will be issued to other government agencies, they also serve as important announcements of the CFPBs enforcement priorities and interpretation of federal consumer financial law.

What does this mean for you?

The CFPBs release of Circular 2022-02 and the FDICs final rule are yet another example of coordination between the CFPB and other federal agencies with authority over consumer financial laws.

While critics have argued that federal regulation, and enforcement in particular, have been slow to catch up to the explosion of digital assets and cryptocurrency products in recent years, the circular shows that the CFPB continues to look for angles to exert jurisdiction over digital asset and cryptocurrency entities.

Companies engaged in offering products involving custodying or otherwise handling cryptocurrencies or digital assets should review their marketing materials and other statements, including website or mobile application disclaimers, to assess any explicit or implicit representations that a product or service is regulated, insured, or eligible for FDIC insurance.

More generally, companies subject to the CFPBs jurisdiction also should monitor the CFPBs circular system, as it is another channel it will utilize to announce industry guidance.

Awareness of this guidance is of paramount importance in understanding the CFPBs stance while it enforces consumer financial laws."

Cooley,CFPB Encourages States to Enforce Federal Consumer Financial Protection Laws,"On May 19, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an interpretive rule clarifying the scope of states ability to bring enforcement actions under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) against companies and individuals.

The interpretive rule lays out the bureaus rationale for concluding that state attorneys general and state regulators enjoy broad authority to enforce the CFPAs consumer protection provisions  and are encouraged to do so even if the CFPB has already brought its own action against the same entity.

The interpretative rule highlights the CFPBs position that state attorneys general and state regulators have broader jurisdictional authority than the CFPB, and can enforce federal consumer financial laws against persons otherwise carved out from CFPB oversight by the CFPA.

States authority under the CFPA

The CFPBs interpretive rule states the following: Section 1042 of the CFPA preserves the right of states to bring their own civil actions against entities under the CFPA, which notably codifies the CFPBs unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) authority.

The interpretive rule highlights that states can not only bring enforcement actions for UDAAP violations (which the rule notes that states have done), but also can enforce violations of any federal consumer financial law against persons and service providers covered by the CFPA under Section 1036(a)(1)(A).

This provision mainly permits states to enforce the 18 consumer laws enumerated by the CFPA, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Truth in Lending Act, as well as the CFPBs implementing regulations and orders issued thereunder.

The interpretive opinion also stresses that states ability to enforce the CFPA is supplemental to the authority they may otherwise have under each enumerated consumer law.

If the CFPA restricts states ability to rely on Section 1036(a)(1)(A) to pursue claims against specific entities, such as national banks and federal savings associations, states can instead leverage their own authority under these consumer laws  to the extent authorized  to bring actions against such entities.

States are not subject to some of the CFPAs limitations on the bureaus enforcement authority against specific entities, including merchants, regulated insurance companies, tax preparers or certain motor vehicle dealers.

The interpretive rule concludes that Congress applied these limitations in Sections 1027 and 1029 of the CFPA only to the bureau.

As a result, states can exercise their authority under the CFPA against a broader cross-section of companies and individuals not otherwise subject to CFPB enforcement.

In addition, states can independently pursue claims under the CFPA against an entity even if the CFPB is already engaged in its own action against the same entity.

The interpretive rule also concludes that the CFPA does not limit concurrent statutory enforcement activity by state attorneys general and state regulators, in contrast to the CFPAs limitations on concurrent enforcement by the CFPB and other federal regulators.

There already has been an uptick in state enforcement in conjunction with the CFPB.

In April, the CFPB and the New York attorney general jointly filed a complaint against a remittance provider for alleged violations of Regulation E and the CFPA.

Upon announcing the lawsuit, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra indicated that the bureau was already expanding its efforts to ensure states can prosecute consumer financial protection abuses, as well as deepening [its] law enforcement cooperation with state attorneys general and state financial regulators.

In mid-May, the bureau reminded states and other federal agencies of their responsibility to enforce federal consumer financial laws, and launched a new system to provide guidance by way of circulars on how it intends to enforce these laws.

What to expect?"
Cooley,CFPB Encourages States to Enforce Federal Consumer Financial Protection Laws,"What to expect?

For entities not already under the CFPBs jurisdiction, the interpretive rule is a stark warning that state attorneys general and state regulators have the green light from the bureau to enforce federal consumer financial laws at the state level, even if the CFPB does not have jurisdiction over certain companies and individuals.

Although the CFPA requires states to consult with the bureau prior to bringing an action to enforce the statute, the interpretive rule makes little reference to this provision.

The lack of discussion in the interpretive rule regarding this requirement could be interpreted as further encouragement by the bureau for states to bring independent or concurrent actions against industry participants.

Because the interpretive rule is exempt from the notice and comment rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, industry participants should anticipate broader investigations involving a greater number and types of entities, as well as increased coordination between federal and state agencies to begin imminently.

Zealous state attorneys general and state regulators will look at the bureaus new circulars for guidance in their own enforcement actions, including states that have formed their own mini-CFPBs.

We also expect to see renewed and close coordination between the CFPB, states attorneys general, and state regulators moving forward."
Cooley,Update on Protecting Intellectual Property in Russia,"As noted in our client alert on April 20, 2022 , Cooley continues to monitor the ever-changing situation in Russia and Ukraine following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Provided below is an update regarding recent developments related to intellectual property (IP) protection in Russia.

On May 5, 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) at the US Department of the Treasury issued General License 31 (GL31) , which authorizes certain transactions related to patents, trademarks and copyrights.

Paragraph (a) of GL31 provides a broad authorization to engage in these specifically enumerated activities: Filing and prosecution of applications for patent, trademark, copyright, or other form of IP protection.

Receipt of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other forms of IP protection.

Renewal or maintenance of patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other forms of IP protection.

Filing or maintenance of any opposition or infringement proceeding related to patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other forms of IP protection, or defending against any such proceedings.

Although the term payment is not explicitly stated in paragraph (a) of GL31, activities that are ordinarily incident and necessary to give effect to authorized transactions are generally authorized under the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, subject to limitations involving certain sanctioned blocked persons, debits to blocked accounts or transfers of blocked property(31 CFR587.404).As such, payments incident and necessary to effectuate the IP-related transactions authorized by an OFAC general license are arguably permitted under the general license, subject to the limitations noted above.

GL31 also should be viewed as authorizing payments to Rospatent  even though those payments will be processed by a sanctioned Russian financial institution, specifically the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

In any event, payments related to taxes, fees, duties, permits, licenses, registrations or certifications (such as renewal and maintenance of IP protection) processed through the Central Bank of the Russian Federation continue to be authorized under OFAC GL13 , which will remain in effect until at least June 23, 2022.

In addition, paragraph (b) of GL31 describes certain limitations to the authorizations permitted under this general license.

However, these limitations appear to be very specific and unlikely to be implicated by the IP-relatedtransactions permitted under paragraph (a) of GL31.

We will continue to monitor developments in these jurisdictions, and we will provide additional information and guidance if necessary.

In the meantime, please reach out to a member of your Cooley team with any specific questions or if you need more information regarding this issue."
Cooley,CFPB Shores Up Legal Basis for Monitoring Loan Servicing Discrimination,"On May 9, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an advisory opinion declaring that the Equal Credit Opportunity Acts prohibitions against discrimination protect borrowers in all aspects of a credit transaction, including in connection with account servicing.

Echoing positions taken in previous amicus briefs , the CFPBs opinion highlights that the ECOA defines an applicant to mean any person who applies to a creditor directly for an extension, renewal, or continuation of credit, or applies to a creditor indirectly by use of an existing credit plan for an amount exceeding a previously established credit limit (15 US Code 1691a(b)).

As defined by Regulation B, an applicant includes any person who requests or who has received an extension of credit from a creditor.

According to the CFPB, the best interpretation is therefore that an applicant subject to the protections in the ECOA and Regulation B includes an existing borrower.

By clarifying the scope of the ECOA and Regulation B, the CFPB is enhancing its legal basis for applying the ECOAs anti-discrimination provisions to post-origination interactions with borrowers.

In a key footnote, the CFPB states that it interprets aspects of the credit transactions enumerated in Regulation B as including and encompassing the servicing of that credit, debt collection, loss mitigation, payment plans, settlements, co-signer release, and certain other services provided to existing accountholders.

The opinion also highlights prior CFPB enforcement actions, such as its action against a large bank that allegedly discriminated against certain borrowers by engaging in aggressive collections practices.

The announcement is part of a broader CFPB initiative to expand the boundaries of anti-discrimination protections, such as in its March16 announcement that it would leverage its unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) authority to prohibit discrimination in noncredit financial products and services .

What does this mean for you?

In light of the CFPBs announcement, financial services providers may want to consider taking action to enhance their fair servicing practices, including by: Expanding fair lending training to employees engaged in account servicing, debt collection and loss mitigation.

Expanding fair lending policies to clearly incorporate fair servicing principles in all aspects of account servicing.

Revisiting servicing practices to assess whether borrowers with existing credit are receiving adverse action notices, as appropriate.

Adopting a testing program to assess whether servicing practices risk noncompliance with the ECOAs anti-discrimination protections."
Cooley,"Q1 2022 Venture Financing Report – Deal Volume Remains High, Varies by Industry","Cooley continued to represent a near-record number of emerging companies and venture investors in disclosable VC financings during the first quarter of 2022.

In Q1 2022, Cooley handled 391 disclosable deals, representing $24.2 billion of invested capital, which was the firms third-highest deal volume in history, exceeded only by Q2 and Q4 2021, which had deal counts of 399 and 392, respectively.

Only Q4 2021 had a higher total for invested capital, at more than $25 billion.

The strong Q1 2022 invested capital amount was boosted by deals from January 2022, where invested capital totaled $12.1 billion, the highest amount for any month in the history of this report.

As revealed below in our industry sector spotlights, while the quarterly totals are very high, those large numbers/dollar volumes are supported by record numbers of deals and invested capital in technology companies (versus other industries), with deal volumes and invested capital decreasing during Q1 2022 for companies in the life sciences and other industry sectors.

Deal volume in life sciences sector companies decreased by approximately 21% during the quarter, with a decrease in invested capital of approximately 56%.

For companies in other sectors, the decrease in deal volume during the quarter was approximately 32%, with a decrease in invested capital of approximately 46%.

These compare to an 8% increase in the deal volume for technology companies over the quarter, with an increase of almost 60% in invested capital for technology companies for the quarter.

For deals that closed in March 2022, median pre-money valuations increased for early to mid-stage deals, after the slight decrease seen in deals that closed in the month of December 2021 (as noted in our Q4 2021 report ).

The median pre-money valuations for disclosable Series Seed, Series A and Series B deals closing in the month of March 2022 were $21 million, $78 million and $285.2 million, respectively, up from $18.7 million, $51.8 million and $171.5 million, respectively, for those closing in the month of December 2021.

However, compared to December 2021, median pre-money valuations for later-stage disclosable deals declined as of March 2022.

The median pre-money valuation for Series C disclosable deals was $528.7 million for transactions closing in March 2022, as compared to $567 million for those closing in December 2021, and the median pre-money valuation for Series D+ disclosable deals was $1.3 billion for transactions closing in March 2022, down from $1.9 billion for those closing in December 2021.

Overall, the number of deals with large pre-money valuations remained high during the first quarter of 2022, and Cooley handled 175 disclosable deals with pre-money valuations greater than or equal to $100 million during Q1 2022  nearly matching the record high of 177 such deals handled by Cooley during Q4 2021.

Deal terms in Q1 2022 continued to be favorable for companies.

Nearly 98% of disclosable deals for the quarter had non-participating preferred, which was a record high.

The percentage of up rounds remained high in Q1 2022 at 97% of disclosable deals, though this represents a slight dip from the 99% record high set in Q4 2021.

The percentage of deals with a pay-to-play provision remained extremely low, at just 3% of disclosable deals, as did the percentage of deals with a recapitalization, which made up less than 1% of disclosable deals.

In PitchBooks 2021 Annual Global League Tables , Cooley achieved the top spot globally and in the US for representation of companies in venture capital transactions.

The firm also was credited as the second-most active law firm in the US and globally for our representation of investors in VC deals and in overall venture deal count."

Spotlight on life sciences In Q1 2022, Cooley handled 68 disclosable financings of life sciences companies, representing more than $2.4 billion of invested capital, a notable drop from 82 disclosable deals with more than $5.2 billion in invested capital in the prior quarter.

Disclosable deal sizes also declined, with an average deal size of $35.8 million in the quarter, versus $63.8 million in Q4 2021.

The percentage of life sciences financings structured in tranches decreased to just over 16% of disclosable deals (from nearly 18% in Q4 2021).

These percentages are high compared to percentages of tranched deals for earlier quarters in 2021, but low compared to Q3 and Q4 2020, where life science deals structured in tranches exceeded 20% of deals.

Spotlight on technology Deal volume and amount raised in Q1 2022 reached record numbers for technology company deals.

During the quarter, Cooley handled 250 disclosable financings of technology companies, representing more than $18 billion of invested capital, far exceeding prior records (211 disclosable deals in Q4 2021 and $11.9 billion of invested capital in Q2 2021).

Average disclosable deal size during the quarter increased to more than $73 million, compared to more than $66 million in Q4 2021.

We believe there is a tremendous opportunity to be a capital provider to the early-stage innovation ecosystem in the Midwest and help this market develop.

On disruptive technology trends in the Midwest:

[W]e find that the Midwest ecosystem generates a significant number of exciting startups attempting to disrupt categories like steel manufacturing and commodities trading.

On the growth of Chicagos VC market: To truly achieve scale, a startup ecosystem needs to nurture an appetite for risk and acceptance of failure, have great research institutions and strong engineering talent pools, have a series of successful prior-generation companies that created significant value for those involved, and importantly, have enough early-stage capital providers willing to embrace risk.

Cooley,Illinois Publishes Additional Guidance on Equal Pay Registration Certificate Requirement,"In a December 2021 client alert, we explained the updated equal pay reporting and compliance requirements in Illinois .

The Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) recently published additional guidance on the requirement for certain Illinois employers to obtain an equal pay registration certificate (EPRC).

This alert reviews the main EPRC requirements and highlights key points from the recently published guidance.

Covered businesses Illinois law requires private businesses that have 100 employees in the state  and are required to file an Employer Information Report EEO-1 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  to apply to obtain an EPRC using IDOLs EPRC portal.

(Instructions to access the portal are available on IDOLs EPRC page .)

To determine if it meets the employee threshold to be covered by the EPRC requirement, a business should count the total number of employees who worked in or were based out of Illinois on December 31 of the 12-month calendar year immediately prior to the year the business is required to submit an EPRC application.

All employees of a business based in Illinois should be included in the total employee count, even if the employees are working remotely outside Illinois.

A business with multiple locations should include only the employees whose base location is in Illinois.

EPRC application due date Covered businesses are required to submit the initial EPRC application between March 24, 2022, and March 23, 2024.IDOL will assign an application due date that is within this timeframeand will notify businesses of this due date at least 120 days before the application will be due.

Businesses can visit IDOLs EPRC registration page to confirm their contact information.

New businesses must apply to obtain an EPRC within three years of commencing business operations, but not before January 1, 2024.

New businesses can visit IDOLs EPRC registration page to submit their contact information to IDOL, which then will provide the business with an EPRC application due date at least 180 calendar days before the application will be due.

After their first EPRC application, businesses will be required to recertify every two years by submitting an updated application.

IDOL will provide notice of the recertification due date at least 180 calendar days before the recertification will be due.

If a business receives notice from IDOL to recertify, but is exempt because its total employee count is below 100, the business must notify IDOL and certify in writing to IDOL that it is exempt from the EPRC requirement.

This certification must be on company letterhead, signed by a senior executive of the company and sent to IDOL via email to DOL.EPRC@illinois.gov , or by US mail addressed to Illinois Department of Labor: ATTN: Con/Med Division, 160 North LaSalle Street, Suite C-1300, Chicago, IL 60601.

EPRC application When filing an EPRC application, businesses must submit to IDOL:

A $150 filing fee.

Wage records, including a copy of their most recently filed EEO-1.

An equal pay compliance statement.

For reporting purposes, wages means any compensation paid to an employee by an employer pursuant to an employment contract or agreement between the two parties, including wages, salaries, earned commissions, earned bonuses, stocks and ownership shares.

Wages does not include the value of retirement benefits, health insurance benefits or other fringe benefits.

W-2 Box 5 should have the most complete information for the purposes of EPRC data reporting.

A business may provide any other information it believes is relevant to explain any pay disparities among its employees.

IDOL has provided an Excel spreadsheet template to submit employee information .

If employees are promoted one or more times in the course of their employment, the business should list the start and end dates for their time in each position, with the corresponding job titles and pay rates."
Cooley,Illinois Publishes Additional Guidance on Equal Pay Registration Certificate Requirement,"The equal pay compliance statement must be submitted in writing, and must be signed by a corporate officer, legal counsel or authorized agent of the business submitting the application.

IDOL also has made available an equal pay compliance statement Word template .

Noncompliance A business that fails to file an initial application or recertification will be fined up to $10,000.

Before any such fines are imposed, IDOL will provide notice and 30 days to submit the application or recertification.

For falsification or misrepresentation of information on an EPRC application, IDOL may seek to suspend or revoke an EPRC, or impose civil penalties of up to $10,000.

If you have any questions about or related to an Illinois EPRC, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,CFPB Publishes Spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights,"On May 2, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) published its spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights report .

As discussed in more detail below, the report addresses observations made in examinations completed by the CFPB between July 2021 and December 2021 (the relevant period) in the areas of auto servicing, consumer reporting, credit card account management, debt collection, deposits, mortgage origination, prepaid accounts, remittances and student loan servicing.

The Supervisory Highlights report also touches on recent supervisory program developments, including announcements, examination manual updates and bulletins, and summarizes enforcement actions arising from supervisory activities.

Key findings by the CFPB Auto servicing Earlier this year, the CFPB announced that it intended to focus on ensuring a fair, transparent, and competitive auto lending market by monitoring auto loan servicing and collection practices , and heading off risks of wrongful repossessions .

It is therefore unsurprising that auto servicing issues are featured in the press release published with the Supervisory Highlights and at the top of the actual report.

To that end, examiners found that auto loan servicers engaged in unfair acts or practices by: Repossessing vehicles after consumers took action that should have prevented the repossession.

Failing to request refunds from third-party administrators for unearned fees related to guaranteed asset protection (GAP) products.

Failing to apply GAP refunds to consumer accounts after repossession and cancellation of the contract, resulting in higher deficiency balances reported to third-party debt buyers for collection.

Additionally, examiners found that auto loan servicers engaged in deceptive acts or practices by sending consumers notices about the amount of their final loan payment after a deferral that used imprecise conditional statements  such as saying the final payment after a deferral may be larger  rather than language that clearly reflected a material increase in the final payment amount.

Consumer reporting The Supervisory Highlights report is heavily focused on consumer reporting dispute investigation and notification issues identified in examinations of consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) and furnishers of information to CRAs, which also were called out in the accompanying press release.

Examiners found that CRAs failed to satisfy their Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) obligations to conduct reasonable dispute investigations by: Deleting tradelines, rather than correcting information, where a dispute investigation revealed the information was reported incorrectly.

Failing to review and consider all relevant information submitted by the consumer in connection with a dispute.

CRAs also failed to timely notify furnishers after receipt of a consumer or reseller dispute, and to timely and accurately notify consumers of the results of a dispute reinvestigation.

Likewise, furnishers failed to comply with applicable dispute investigation and notification requirements by: Erroneously applying Regulation Vs frivolous designation to indirect disputes, notwithstanding that the FCRA does not allow furnishers to deem indirect disputes as frivolous.

Sending incorrect indirect dispute investigation results to CRAs.

Failing to conduct any investigation of disputes received from specialty CRAs.

Using ambiguous template letters to communicate the results of direct dispute investigations to consumers.

The Bureau made two additional observations with respect to furnishers.

First, it highlighted furnishers failure to correct and update information reported to CRAs after determining that it was either not complete or not accurate  for example, failing to update account status following a determination that the account status reported differed from those in the furnishers system of record."
Cooley,CFPB Publishes Spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights,"Second, it identified violations of Regulation Vs requirement that all furnishers establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to CRAs that consider and incorporate, as appropriate, the guidelines listed in Appendix E to Regulation V.

In doing so, the CFPB reminded the industry that [i]n previous issues of Supervisory Highlights, we described supervisory findings of furnishers that violated these requirements.

The upshot of this statement is likely that the Bureau is continuing to take a hard look at furnishers policies and procedures and expects compliance.

Credit card account management

In its review of institutions credit card management operations, the CFPB identified Regulation Z issues, as well as certain deceptive acts or practices.

Specifically, the Bureau found that institutions failed to comply with Regulation Zs billing error provisions, as well as its requirement that, after increasing the annual percentage rate (APR) on an account, a credit card issuer must periodically assess whether it is appropriate to reduce the accounts APR(s) by reviewing either the factors on which the rate increase originally was based or the factors the issuer presently considers when determining the APR applicable to a similar new card account.

On the latter issue, the Bureau highlighted that institutions: Failed to collect data that would allow them to perform compliant APR assessments as part of the acquisition of pre-existing card accounts.

Failed to record dates within their systems of record that would flag accounts for periodic evaluation.

Relied on factors formerly considered when determining the APR applicable to similar accounts, rather than those currently used.

The CFPB also uncovered deceptive acts or practices in credit card management, where institutions: Failed to disclose preconditions for obtaining interest-free financing, with the Bureau concluding that the net impression of advertisements misled consumers about those preconditions.

Applied refunds to monthly installment balances that were interest-free for their duration, where there was a negative revolving balance with respect to the credit card account, given that under the account agreement, refunds and credits were to be applied to the revolving balance and alternate application would result in the interest-free installment balances being paid prematurely.

Debt collection Given the financial challenges and vulnerabilities created by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is no surprise that the CFPBs examination activities continue to include Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) compliance.

During the relevant period, examiners identified violations of the FDCPA based on debt collectors continued attempts to collect debts after they were informed  and provided with evidence  that the debts were the result of fraudulent activity.

Further, examiners found that debt collectors committed unfair acts or practices by failing to timely refund overpayments and credit balances to consumers.

Deposits Examiners primarily focused on observations concerning Regulation E with respect to entities deposit account practices.

In particular, the Bureau highlighted that institutions failed to: Honor stop payment requests.

Investigate an error when the consumer did not submit an affidavit, which cannot be required as a condition of initiating or completing an error investigation.

Provide consumers with proper notices of revocation of credit explaining that the entity would be debiting excess amounts provided as provision credit from consumers accounts, the dates those debits would occur and that the entity would honor transactions for five days after the notification."
Cooley,CFPB Publishes Spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights,"The CFPB also noted that technical limitations caused institutions involved in deposit activities to commit an unfair practice by placing multiple mobile check deposit holds on accounts, rather than a single hold as intended, thereby causing consumers to unfairly incur fees.

Mortgage origination The CFPB identified Regulation Z issues in its examination of supervised entities with mortgage origination operations.

For example, the Bureau concluded that lenders violated Regulation Zs loan originator compensation rule by basing originator compensation on credit product type, a finding that was included in the summer 2021 edition of the Supervisory Highlights .

The Bureau also found that institutions failed to retain sufficient documentation to support valid changed circumstances, under Regulation Z, after providing a loan estimate to the consumer.

also Institutions also provided closing disclosures to consumers that failed to reflect the fully indexed rate and, thus, the legal obligation between parties, due to a software miscalculation of rates.

Prepaid accounts As with deposits, examiners focused on Regulation E compliance in discussing their recent experiences examining institutions that issue prepaid accounts and prepaid account service providers.

Examiners found that certain institutions failed, as required by Regulation E, to: Timely submit prepaid account agreements to the CFPB.

Provide the Bureau with the name of the program manager, if any, and the list of names of other relevant parties in connection with any submission of such agreements.

Disclose the consumers right to request documentation that the institution relied on in completing its Regulation E error investigation, and fulfill requests for documentation relied on in determining that no error occurred.

Remittance The CFPB identified a deceptive act or practice related to remittance transfers where providers represented to consumers that they offered instant or 30 second transfers, even though the transfers may not have been completed in the articulated timeframe and could have been otherwise delayed.

Additionally, examiners found that remittance transfer agreements violated the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) prohibition on waiver of rights conferred or causes of action created by the EFTA by including provisions waiving rights conferred by the EFTA, attempting to limit consumers right to recover costs and attorneys fees, and stating that the entities make no representations or warranties regarding the time required to complete processing because the Service is dependent on many factors beyond our control.

The Bureau also noted that institutions failed to include the date funds are available to designated recipients on receipts for remittance transfers, provide that receipt in a timely fashion, and maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers as required under Regulation E.

According to the Bureau, absence of adequate policies and procedures resulted in further issues, such as failure to provide notice of the results of error investigations, and to refund fees, and do so in a timely manner consistent with the requirements of Regulation E. Student loan servicing Examiners identified unfair acts or practices in examinations of student loan servicers, including private student loan services, where entities failed to: Make incentive payments that were offered in advertisements, and agreed to in contracts with consumers, because of system errors or policies that conditioned such payments on maintaining a deposit account with the institution, even though such condition was not disclosed in the consumer contract.

Issue timely refunds where consumers made payments that were not yet due under the repayment schedule set forth as part of a modification agreement."

Directors guide to ESG oversight In March, PwCs Governance Insights Center published its ESG Oversight:

The Corporate Directors Guide , which highlights practices that have emerged  and questions that boards should consider  when overseeing environmental, social and governance matters given a companys industry, size, growth trajectory and strategy.

The guide is broken down into three parts: understanding the ESG landscape; understanding the boards role in overseeing ESG (including an overview of ESG standards and frameworks); and mapping ESG to oversight (including summaries on allocating and integrating responsibility among the board and its committees).

Proposed SPAC rules On March 30, the SEC announced that it had approved proposed disclosure and other requirements regarding SPACs, shell companies and projections.

The proposed rules would add a new Subpart 1600 to Regulation S-K, which would require, among other things, disclosures about the SPAC sponsor, conflicts of interest and dilution, as well as a statement from the SPAC as to whether it reasonably believes that the deSPAC transaction and any related financing are fair or unfair to unaffiliated security holders (including, if applicable, disclosure of any outside report, opinion or appraisal relating to the fairness of the transaction).

In addition, under the proposal, the private operating company that is the target of the SPAC would be deemed a co-registrant when the SPAC files the registration statement on Form S-4 or F-4 for the deSPAC transaction, which would subject the private company and its signatories to liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

The proposal also would: Require enhanced disclosure regarding projections presented in filings relating to deSPAC transactions and make the safe harbor in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 a safe harbor for the use of projections unavailable in filings by SPACs.

Deem a SPAC IPO underwriter that takes steps to facilitate or otherwise participates (directly or indirectly) in a subsequent deSPAC transaction or any related financing transaction to be a statutory underwriter for purposes of the deSPAC transaction.

Require that the registration statement filed in connection with the deSPAC transaction register not just the offering of shares to the target companys shareholders but also register an offering to the existing SPAC shareholders.

Include a safeharbor for SPACs that would deem a SPAC to not be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, if certain conditions are met.

Include technical changes to disclosure requirements for SPAC IPOs and deSPAC transactions, and technical reporting requirements for post-deSPAC companies.

The comment period will remain open until at least May31, 2022.

Cooley,CFPB Revives Its Dormant Nonbank Authority to Supervise High-Risk Institutions,"On April 25, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it will invoke its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to supervise nonbanks whose activities the CFPB has reasonable cause to determine pose risks to consumers.

As we explained in a March 2022 alert, the CFPB continues to expand its focus and reach , including through its commitments to use its unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) authority to address unfair discrimination in activities not tied to traditional lending.

In keeping with its recent law enforcement and fair competition themes, the CFPB references in this latest announcement its authority to investigate conduct involving the entities it now seeks to supervise, but suggests that including such companies in the supervisory process will allow it to monitor fast-moving markets in a less adversarial way.

At the same time, the CFPB claims that the initiative is intended to level the playing field to hold such new market entrants to the same standards as bank entities.

CFPB authority over nonbanks The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB the authority to supervise and enforce federal consumer financial laws against certain nonbank entities, including: Nonbanks engaged in mortgage, private student loan and payday loan activities, regardless of the size of the entity.

Larger participants in other nonbank markets for consumer financial services and products.

Nonbanks whose activities the CFPB has reasonable cause to determine pose risks to consumers.

1

The CFPB implemented its authority over this third category of nonbanks through a 2013 procedural rule.

However, the CFPB noted that only now has it begun to invoke its authority under this rule.

In issuing the 2013 rule, the CFPB declined to adopt definitions of what the CFPB considers to be a reasonable cause to determine that a nonbank posed a risk to consumers, and further declined to adopt a definition or standard of what is considered a risk to consumers.

The latest announcement provides insight into how a nonbank may end up in the CFPBs supervisory crosshairs and what conduct the CFPB may consider a risk to consumers.

The CFPB indicates that it will base reasonable cause determinations on a number of inputs, including, among others, complaints, judicial opinions and administrative decisions, as well as through whistleblower complaints, state and federal partners, and news reports.

The CFPBs recent focus on repeat offenders also suggests that these considerations will include resolutions with other government agencies.

And, given the pronouncements by the CFPB in the press releases accompanying its two recently filed lawsuits, we know that the CFPB is already working to expand coordination between federal and state agencies; those efforts will no doubt align with this latest initiative.

The announcement made particular reference to focusing on conduct that may pose a risk to consumers, which includes UDAAPs, or other acts or practices that potentially violate federal consumer financial law.

In light of recent activity, fintechs and other potential targets should be mindful of potential unfair discrimination claims, but should not lose sight of strict regulatory compliance issues.

For example, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra recently stated that he believes there are broader problems in payments and international money transfer markets and significant noncompliance of the Remittance Rule by nonbanks in particular.

Entities engaged in these markets, but not traditionally subject to supervision by the CFPB, should take note.

Amendment to 2013 procedural rule The CFPB also amended its 2013 procedural rule that facilitates its supervisory authority over nonbanks, and the amendment permits the CFPB to publicize final orders and decisions involving nonbanks deemed to be engaged in conduct that poses risks to consumers."
Cooley,CFPB Revives Its Dormant Nonbank Authority to Supervise High-Risk Institutions,"Under the 2013 rule, 2 when the CFPB determines that it has reasonable cause to investigate nonbank entities that pose a risk to consumers with regard to the offering of consumer financial products or services, the CFPB must provide notice to the nonbank regulated entity, including a description of the basis for the bureaus determination to investigate the entity.

As originally adopted, the procedural rule made all aspects of a proceeding confidential, including materials submitted by a nonbank, documents prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the CFPBs use, and any communications between the CFPB and the nonbank.

3

The CFPBs amendment to the procedural rule creates an exception to the confidentiality of such materials, and establishes a procedural mechanism to determine whether part or all of a decision should be released to the public on the CFPBs website.

The bureaus amended procedural rule allows entities to petition the CFPB not to release a final order within seven days, leaving the final determination regarding whether the order will be released, in whole or in part, to the bureaus director, whose decisions on those requests also may be released to the public.

The amendment notice cites two Freedom of Information Act exemptions that the CFPB expects to apply  those applicable to trade secrets and confidential financial information (exemption 4), and those applicable to personnel and medical files whose publication would be an invasion of privacy (exemption 6)  but states that the CFPB will consider others.

The notice does not, however, address potential industry concerns around the publication of a report premised on potentially unsubstantiated complaints or in-progress litigation, for example, noting only that costs to companies will be minimal and only if they choose to prepare requests that such reports not be published.

Rather, it notes that the publication of orders will benefit consumers and the public by making risk issues known and providing greater insight into the bureaus decision-making.

What does this mean for you?

This latest development is just another example of the CFPBs continued expansion of its authority.

Fintechs and nonbank entities affected by this supervisory development should be thoughtful about: How they can avoid becoming a target for supervisory oversight.

How they can be prepared for an examination if they are chosen.

To the first, ensuring that entities have a robust complaint management process to detect, prevent and correct compliance issues will be critical.

If the CFPB is going to be looking at complaints, after all, managing complaint volume is extremely helpful.

To the second, the bureau indicates that it intends to use this process to level the playing field and hold nonbanks to the same standard that banks are held to.

However, banks have had decades to develop and refine enterprise and compliance risk management frameworks, and it remains to be seen just how the CFPB intends to compare the two.

In the meantime, nonbanks should take a hard look at their existing compliance management systems  policies and procedures, training, compliance programs, and management oversight  to ensure that they are appropriately managing risk associated with their product or offering.

Entities also should ensure they have an appropriate escalation process to consider any potential order within the seven-day appeal period cited by the bureau.

It can take seven days just for things to bounce around a mailroom, and the last thing a company wants is to find itself identified as high risk on the CFPBs website.

Cooley,DOJ Loses First Wage-Fixing and No-Poach Cases as Juries Acquit,"The Department of Justices first criminal wage-fixing and no-poach cases ended in acquittals, but we dont expect this will lessen the DOJs scrutiny on competition in labor markets.

Over the past year, the DOJ has filed a number of indictments based on alleged agreements between or among employers of different companies to not recruit or solicit employees of the other, often called no-poach agreements, as well as on wage-fixing agreements, which are price-fixing agreements and include agreements to fix salaries at a certain level.

In two recent cases involving no-poach and wage-fixing agreements, the juries acquitted all defendants for their alleged conduct around hiring.

While these losses by no means put an end to the DOJs  commitment to prosecuting labor market collusion , they are a serious blow to the DOJs intent to criminally prosecute such agreements.

The US antitrust agencies, the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), first took the position that the DOJ would criminally prosecute no-poach agreements in 2016, when the agencies issued their joint Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals regarding the application of federal antitrust laws to hiring practices and certain employment agreements.

The agencies warned the business community: Going forward, the DOJ intends to proceed criminally against naked wage-fixing or no-poaching agreements.

More than a year has passed since the DOJ made true on its promise, as the DOJ announced its first criminal indictment for wage-fixing agreements in December 2020 , which was followed shortly by the DOJs first criminal indictment for no-poach agreements in January 2021 .

Since then, there has been a significant increase in the number of investigations, criminal indictments, and private lawsuits based on alleged no-poach or wage-fixing agreements.

President Joe Biden also has signaled that competition in the labor market would be a priority for his administration, issuing in July 2021 an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy , which includes 72 initiatives by more than a dozen federal agencies in an aim to address competition issues across the economy.

Attorney General Merrick Garland recently said , We continue to aggressively prosecute antitrust violations that undermine competition in labor markets or otherwise harm workers  no matter the industry, no matter the company, no matter the individual.

The momentum seemed to be in the DOJs favor, as the DOJ secured a significant win in January 2022 in United States v. DaVita Inc. , in which the district court judge denied the defendants motion to dismiss , holding that naked horizontal non-solicitation agreements that allocate the market  i.e., those that are not ancillary to a legitimate procompetitive business purpose and have no purpose except stifling competition  are per se violations of the Sherman Act.

However, this momentum hit a major roadblock when juries in Texas and Colorado acquitted defendants charged with violating the antitrust laws by fixing wages and conspiring to suppress competition through no-poach agreements.

United States v. Neeraj Jindal and John Rodger No. 4:20-cr-00358-ALM-KPJ (E.D. Tex.)

In December 2020, the DOJ charged two former employees of a therapist staffing company for conspiring with competing companies to lower wages for physical therapists and physical therapist assistants.

The DOJs allegations include communications between Neeraj Jindal, John Rodgers and other unnamed co-conspirators about exchanging non-public wage information for physical therapists and physical therapist assistants, and agreeing to and implementing wage decreases.

In response, the defense argued there was no agreement among any of the competitors, citing as evidence that a co-conspirator initially agreed to the arrangement but later stated that she never planned to go through with it."
Cooley,DOJ Loses First Wage-Fixing and No-Poach Cases as Juries Acquit,"The defense also attacked the credibility of the co-conspirator, whose testimony differed from statements given to the FTC as part of the FTCs earlier investigation.

On April 14, 2022, after a six-day trial and less than a day of deliberation, the jury found both defendants not guilty on the conspiracy charges.

(Jindal was found guilty on a single count of obstruction of the FTCs prior proceedings.)

United States v. DaVita Inc. and Kent Thiry No. 1:21-cr-00229 (D. Colo.)

In November 2021, the DOJ alleged that DaVita Inc. and its former CEO, Kent Thiry, engaged in a per se unlawful conspiracy with three other healthcare companies, all owners of outpatient medical facilities, by agreeing not to solicit each others employees.

At trial, the DOJ alleged that Thiry orchestrated the scheme with DaVitas competitors, which stifled competition and hindered the employees opportunities for advancement in their careers.

In response, the defense argued there was no evidence that the agreements were made to harm competition and that the executives at competing companies acquiesced in order to maintain their relationships with Thiry.

On April 15, 2022, after a two-day deliberation, the jury voted to acquit DaVita and Thiry on all counts.

Going forward, companies should not expect the DOJs interest in criminally prosecuting no-poach and wage-fixing agreements to substantially diminish.

After the Jindal verdict, a DOJ official said : In no way should the verdict today be taken as a referendum on the Antitrust Divisions commitment to prosecuting labor market collusion, or on our ability to prove these crimes at trial.

Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, head of the Antitrust Division, echoed that sentiment : Were going to continue to bring the cases  were not backing down.

Moreover, there are other cases pending, including one case set for trial in July and another in January 2023.

It is possible these setbacks may push the DOJ to rely more heavily on civil prosecutions, rather than criminal, but for now companies and employees should continue to avoid conduct that may raise red flags and should consider implementing a robust antitrust compliance policy , including antitrust training for employees, and engaging antitrust counsel to review their current non-solicitation provisions and non-compete clauses."
Cooley,Employers With 5 to 50 California Employees Must Register in CalSavers Retirement Program by June 30,"California law requires small employers with 5 to 50 California-based employees to offer a retirement savings program or enroll as a participating employer in the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program by June 30, 2022.

The requirement is based on a companys having California-based employees, regardless of the companys state of incorporation or headquarters location.

Small employers that sponsor their own retirement savings program are required to register as exempt from the CalSavers program by the June 30 deadline.

Information about the CalSavers program and employer registration may be found on the CalSavers programs employer website .

CalSavers program structure Generally, the CalSavers program permits eligible employees to make after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA, and employer contributions are not required or permitted.

Eligible employees are automatically enrolled at a 5% deferral rate if they do not make a deferral election.

As the savings vehicle is a Roth IRA, employees with higher modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) are phased out of eligibility completely at $144,000 for a single filer and $214,000 for a married/joint filer.

The maximum annual contribution is $6,000 ($7,000 if age 50+), subject to reduction for higher MAGIs.

Employer size determination Employer size is based on the employers average number of employees throughout the prior calendar year, determined by averaging the number of employees reported to the California Employment Development Department on the four Form DE9C filings for that prior calendar year.

Noncompliance penalties A small employer that does not currently sponsor its own retirement savings program or implement such a program by June 30, is required to participate in the CalSavers program.

Failure to register as a participating employer may result in a penalty of $250 per employee for noncompliance within 90 days after receipt of a notice of failure to comply.

The penalty increases to $500 per employee if noncompliance continues for more than 180 days after notice.

Exempt employers Employers that currently sponsor their own retirement savings program are exempt but should nevertheless timely register as exempt .

The various types of plans that satisfy the retirement savings plan requirement include: 401(k) plano Profit sharing plano Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) or Simplified Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA Larger employers As a reminder, the CalSavers program applies to all employers with at least 5 California employees.

Larger employers (more than 50 California employees) were required to register as participating or exempt (by September 30, 2020, if more than 100 California employees, and by June 30, 2021, if more than 50 California employees).

If you are a larger employer, you should have already received a notice of noncompliance if you did not timely register.

The $500 penalty described above may apply if you were required to participate in the CalSavers program and did not timely register.

Please contact us if you have questions about the CalSavers program, implementing your own retirement savings program, or whether your company is exempt."
Cooley,Ukraine Intellectual Property Deadlines and Russia Patent Protections,"As noted in our client alert on March 17, 2022 , Cooley continues to monitor the ever-changing situation in Russia and Ukraine following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Provided below is updated information regarding recent intellectual property (IP) developments in Russia and Ukraine.(You can find additional information about financial sanctions and export control restrictions imposed on Russia and Belarus by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union in our March 4 client alert .)

Recent developments Martial law in Ukraine Martial law in Ukraine has been extended until at least April 25, 2022.The Ukrainian Intellectual Property Office recently issued a notice confirming that any deadlines missed by applicants residing or domiciled in Ukraine during this period of martial law can be reinstated once martial law is lifted.

However, because the Ukrainian Intellectual Property Office remains operational, all foreign IP owners should continue to timely satisfy all deadlines.

Accordingly, in the absence of your instructions to the contrary, your Cooley team will work to satisfy all Ukrainian IP deadlines as quickly as possible.

Please let your Cooley team know if you decide that you are no longer interested in maintaining any existing IP filings in Ukraine.

Russian patents While our previous client alert referred to a Russian decree that removed protections for patent holders registered in unfriendly countries, we have been informed by local counsel in Russia that this decree may be more limited in scope than has previously been reported.

Specifically, this decree related to the implementation of Article 1360 of the Russian Civil Code, which provides for compulsory licenses of IP rights when necessary to ensure the defense and security of the state, and to protect the life and health of citizens, and requires the payment of appropriate compensation to the owner of the IP.Thus far, only three compulsory licenses have been issued in Russia  all for inventions related to COVID-19 treatments  and, until recently, the compensation amount for such compulsory licenses was set at 0.5% of the sales.

On March 6, 2022, however, the Russian government issued its decree setting this compensation rate at 0% for IP owners from unfriendly countries.

Therefore, according to our Russian contacts, rather than establishing a 0% compensation scheme for all patents registered to holders in unfriendly countries, this decree relates to compensation for compulsory licenses issued in accordance with Article 1360 and was issued in response to the sanctions imposed on Russia.

If you are concerned regarding the impacts of these developments on your business, we recommend seeking the advice of local counsel.

Your Cooley team will continue to monitor developments regarding IP protections in Russia."
Cooley,Massachusetts High Court: Employees Can’t Reap Commonwealth’s Wage Act Protections Solely for FLSA Violations,"Untitled Document

On April 14, 2022, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that employees seeking to recover damages solely for violations of the federal overtime law are precluded from alternatively pursuing remedies under the notoriously strict Massachusetts Wage Act.

The holding brings clarity to the interplay between the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Massachusetts Wage Act.

In Devaney v. Zucchini Gold, LLC , three plaintiffs who worked at a restaurant alleged violations of the FLSA for failure to pay overtime wages, violations of the Massachusetts Wage Act for failure to pay the FLSA overtime wages in a timely manner, and violations of the federal and state minimum wage laws.

The plaintiffs did not assert violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act for failure to pay overtime because, unlike the FLSA, the Massachusetts Wage Act exempts restaurant workers from its purview.

Thus, the plaintiffs sought to hold their employer liable under the Massachusetts Wage Act for late payment of overtime wages required only by the FLSA.

At the trial court, the plaintiffs recovered treble damages and attorneys fees and costs under the Massachusetts Wage Act for the FLSA overtime claims.

On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court remanded for recalculation of damages, despite the host of case law under which plaintiffs have brought state law and FLSA claims for the same wage violations.

Associate Justice Dalila A. Wendlandt reasoned that the remedial scheme of the FLSA, which provides for the possibility of double damages, conflicts with the remedial scheme of the Massachusetts Wage Act, which mandates treble damages and reasonable attorneys fees.

The federal and state laws further conflict with respect to the statute of limitations: Under the FLSA, employees generally can bring claims for two years after a wage claim arises, while under the Massachusetts Wage Act, employees can generally bring claims for three years after the belated payment.

Thus, to avoid preemption, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that a plaintiff seeking to recover payment for overtime solely based on the FLSA is not also privy to the more severe remedial scheme of the Massachusetts Wage Act.

The Supreme Judicial Court also took issue with the trial courts calculation of damages for the FLSA claim.

The FLSA provides for overtime at the rate of one and one-half times the regular rate of pay.

The trial court, however, calculated damages by multiplying the regular rate of pay by one and one-half without accounting for the regular rate of pay already received by the plaintiffs.

The Supreme Judicial Court confirmed that the FLSAs multiplier should only be applied after accounting for amounts already paid in connection with the regular rate of pay.

This decision brings clarity to the relationship between the Massachusetts Wage Act and the FLSA.

The Supreme Judicial Courts holding also takes treble damages off the table for employers whose employees are otherwise exempt from the commonwealths strict overtime laws.

Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"On March 21, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a long-awaited proposal that would require public companies to disclose extensive climate-related information in their registration statements and periodic reports.

Among other requirements, the proposed rules would require a company to disclose information about climate-related risks and their impact on the company, as well as information on the companys climate-related governance and risk management processes.

The proposed rules also would require disclosure of specified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a phased-in attestation requirement with respect to some emissions for certain categories of filers, and of climate-related financial statement metrics in the notes to the audited financial statements.

Liability safe harbors would be available in some circumstances.

The proposal seeks to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable  and therefore decision-useful  information to investors to enable them to make informed judgments about the impact of climate-related risks on current and potential investments.

The proposed rules were not without opposition, with a dissent from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, contending that the proposed rules would undermine the existing regulatory framework that for many decades has undergirded consistent, comparable, and reliable company disclosures.

(For more information on Peirces dissent and other commissioner statements, refer to our Cooley PubCo blog post .)

The SEC is soliciting comments on the proposed rules.

The comment period will be open until the later of 30 days after the proposing release is published in the Federal Register or May 20, 2022 (60 days from the date that the rules were proposed).

Interested parties can submit comments here .

The proposing release also provides the compliance dates described below, assuming an effective date of December 2022 for the new rule, which is an optimistic but possible timeline.

Background While environmental-related issues have been addressed by the SEC since the early 1970s, the SEC did not weigh in on climate-change disclosures until it issued interpretive guidance in 2010 indicating that climate change disclosure might be required as part of a companys description of its business, risk factors, legal proceedings, and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

The 2010 guidance also identified certain climate-related issues that might necessitate disclosure, including the impact on a company of climate-change related legislation, regulations and international accords, as well as the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends, and the physical impacts of climate change.

Since the publication of the 2010 guidance, investor demand for climate-related information has grown dramatically.

As SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated in his statement about the March 2022 proposal , investors with $130 trillion in assets under management have requested that companies disclose their climate risks.

Consistent with the rising investor interest, in February 2021, then-acting SEC Chair Allison Herren Lee directed the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings, starting with the extent to which public companies addressed the topics identified in the2010 guidance.

In September 2021, the Division of Corporation Finance posted a sample letter containing illustrative comments regarding climate change disclosures, and began to issue more climate-related comments as part of its ongoing disclosure review process."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"The recent focus on sustainability by companies, investors and regulators is further demonstrated by the increasing trend of companies publishing stand-alone reports with climate-related information and data that is relevant to them, and by the significant increase in the past few years in shareholder proposals for annual meetings relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) more generally, and the environment in particular.

According to the SEC, while the 2010 guidance may have elicited some valuable climate-related disclosure, these provisions have not resulted in the consistent and comparable information about climate-related risks that many investors have stated that they need in order to make informed investment or voting decisions.

Given the perceived shortcomings of the current regulatory regime and increased investor interest, the SEC has proposed these new rules to include climate-related disclosure items and metrics to elicit investment decision-useful information that is necessary or appropriate to protect investors and to increase the consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate-related information for investors.

Proposed disclosures The SECs proposal is modeled in part on the framework recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which evaluates material climate-related risks and opportunities through an assessment of their projected short-, medium-, and long-term financial impacts on a registrant.

The widely accepted TCFD framework establishes four core elements that provide a structure for disclosure: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.

Based largely on these core elements, the proposed rules would add new Subpart 1500 to Regulation S-K that would require a company to disclose certain climate-related information, including: Information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the companys business or consolidated financial statements, and the impact of these risks on the companys strategy, business model and outlook.

The companys climate-related governance and risk management processes.

Certain data regarding the companys GHG emissions, including a phased-in third-party attestation requirement with respect to Scopes 1 and 2 emissions data for accelerated and large accelerated filers.

The companys climate-related targets and goals, if any.

When responding to any of the proposed rules provisions concerning governance, strategy and risk management, a company also may disclose information concerning any identified climate-related opportunities.

The information provided pursuant to this new Subpart would be required to be included or incorporated by reference in a separately captioned section of registration statements and annual reports titled Climate-Related Disclosure.

The proposed rules also would add a new Article 14 to Regulation S-X that would require a company to include certain climate-related financial statement metrics, consisting of disaggregated climate-related impacts on existing financial statement line items and related disclosure, in a note to the companys audited financial statements.

As part of a companys financial statements, these metrics would be subject to audit by an independent auditor and would be within the scope of the companys internal control over financial reporting.

The climate-related disclosures detailed in the proposed rules would be required to be filed with the SEC for purposes of potential liability under the federal securities laws, as opposed to furnished , subject to an exception for information provided by a foreign private issuer on Form 6-K. Further, to the extent that climate-related disclosures constitute forward-looking statements, the SEC has noted that these statements may be covered by existing forward-looking safe harbors under the federal securities laws."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"However, forward-looking statements made in connection with an initial public offering are excluded from the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) safe harbor, although the SEC has requested comments as to whether an exception to the PSLRA safe harbor should be adopted that would extend the safe harbor to forward-looking climate-related disclosures in connection with IPOs.

Finally, similar to the treatment of other important business, risk and financial disclosures included in a registration statement or annual report, the proposed rules would require a company to disclose any material change to its previously provided climate-related disclosure in its Form 10-Q (or Form 6-K for a foreign private issuer, if required).

1. Disclosure of climate-related risks and their impacts on strategy, business model and outlook The proposed rules would require a company to disclose any climate-related risks that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business and financial statements, whether over the short, medium or long term, and how those risks have affected or are likely to affect its strategy, business model and outlook.

The SEC based the definitions in the proposed rules on definitions provided by the TCFD in an effort to provide a common terminology for disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities in a consistent and comparable way, using definitions that are already widely accepted.

As proposed, the rules do not include a specific definition of short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and instead require the company to describe how it defines each of these time horizons, including how it addresses the expected useful life of the companys assets and the time horizons for the companys climate-related planning processes and goals.

However, the SEC has requested comment on whether these periods should be defined in the rules.

Climate-related risks As proposed, climate-related risks means the actual or potential negative impacts of climate-related conditions and events on a companys consolidated financial statements, business operations or value chains, as a whole.

The SEC included the concept of value chains (that is, the upstream and downstream activities related to a companys operations) as part of a companys climate-related risks to capture the full extent of its potential risk exposure, which can extend beyond its own operations to those of its suppliers, distributors, and others engaged in upstream or downstream activities.

When disclosing these climate-related risks, the proposed rules would require a company to specify whether the risk is a physical or transition risk.

Physical risks are related to the physical impacts of the climate, including acute risks such as tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, and chronic risks such as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, drought, increased wildfires and decreased arability of farmland, habitability of land, and availability of fresh water.

Transition risks are related to the transition to a lower carbon economy, such as increased costs resulting from the adoption or potential adoption of new governmental regulations or policies, technologies to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks or climate-related litigation, or changing consumer or investor preferences.

For a physical risk, the proposed rules would require a company to describe the nature of the risk, including whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk, and to include in the description of the risk the ZIP code (or a similar subnational postal zone or geographic location, if the location is in a jurisdiction that does not have ZIP codes for the location) of the properties, processes or operations subject to the physical risk.

Additional disclosures would be required if the risk relates to flooding, or if the location of assets is subject to water-related acute or chronic physical risks, such as flooding or high-water stress."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"Disclosure with respect to the companys actions or plans to mitigate or adapt to the risk also would be required.

For a transition risk, the proposed rules would require a company to describe the nature of the risk, including whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market, liability, reputational or other transition-related factors, and how the risk impacts the company.

For example, a company that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has made a GHG emissions-reduction commitment may be exposed to transition risks related to the implementation of the commitment, such as increased capital expenditures.

Companies also may voluntarily disclose any climate-related opportunities when responding to the proposed disclosure requirements concerning governance, strategy and risk management in connection with climate-related risks.

Climate-related opportunities may include actual or potential positive impacts of climate-related conditions and events on the companys consolidated financial statements, business operations or value chains, as a whole, such as cost savings related to the use of renewable energy, increased resource efficiency, the development of new products, services and methods, access to new markets or investors, and increased resilience of supply or distribution chains.

The materiality determination for climate-related risks would remain consistent with existing case law  i.e., information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider this information important in making an investment decision, or if the information would have significantly altered the total mix of information made available.

Per the proposing release, the materiality analysis should take into consideration quantitative and qualitative factors and, given that companies would be required to assess future impacts at different time horizons, the materiality analysis also would require an assessment of the probability of the event occurring and its potential magnitude, or significance, to the company.

Material impacts of climate-related risks on the companys strategy, business model and outlook As proposed, a company would be required to disclose material impacts of any identified climate-related risks on its strategy, business model, and outlook in the short, medium or long term.

This disclosure may include material impacts on the companys business operations, products or services, suppliers and other parties in its value chain, activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, expenditures for research and development, and other significant changes or effects.

Disclosures would need to be current and forward-looking  and include how the company has considered the identified impacts as part of its business strategy, financial planning and capital allocation  in order to convey whether the climate-related risks have been integrated into the companys business model or strategy.

In addition, disclosures with respect to any metrics or targets utilized by the company, and how they relate to the companys business model and strategy, would be required.

The proposed rules would require an in-depth narrative discussion, similar to MD&A, of the likely impacts on the companys consolidated financial statements.

Under the proposal, the company would need to discuss whether and how any of the identified impacts are considered as part of the companys business strategy, financial planning and capital allocation, including current and forward-looking disclosures.

Additional disclosures also would be required if a company uses carbon offsets or renewable energy credits or certificates (RECs) as part of its net emissions reduction strategy, or if a company uses an internal carbon price (that is, an estimated cost of carbon emissions used internally as, for example, a planning tool or incentive) to evaluate and manage climate-related risks."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"In addition, the proposal requires a company to describe any analytical tools, such as scenario analyses, that it uses to assess the impact of climate-related risks on its business and consolidated financial statements, or to support the resilience of its strategy and business model in light of foreseeable climate-related risks.

If a company uses scenario analysis for this latter purpose, the proposed amendments would require quantitative and qualitative disclosure regarding the scenarios considered, including the parameters, assumptions, analytical choices and projected financial impacts under each scenario considered.

The proposed rules do not mandate the use of an internal carbon price, analytical tools or scenario analyses; rather, these disclosures are required only if a company actually uses these tools.

2. Disclosure of climate-related governance The proposed rules would require a company to disclose information concerning the board of directors oversight of climate-related risks, and managements role in assessing and managing those risks.

For example, the company would be required to disclose the identity of directors or board committees responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks, the nature of their expertise, processes for keeping the board informed about climate risks, how the directors consider climate risks as part of the boards financial, strategic and risk oversight, and how the directors set and oversee climate goals.

Similarly, the company also would need to identify any management positions or committees responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risks, and describe the nature of the individuals expertise, their processes for keeping informed and monitoring climate risks, and the frequency of their reporting to the board about climate risks.

3. Disclosure of climate-related risk management Disclosure of processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks Under the proposed rules, a company would be required to describe any processes used for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks.

When describing any processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, a company would be required to disclose, as applicable, how it: Determines the relative significance of climate-related risks compared to other risks.

Considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG emissions limits, when identifying climate-related risks.

Considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes or changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks.

Determines the materiality of climate-related risks, including how it assesses the potential size and scope of any identified climate-related risk.

When describing any processes for managing climate-related risks, a company would be required to disclose, as applicable, how it: Decides whether to mitigate, accept or adapt to a particular risk.

Prioritizes addressing climate-related risks.

Determines how to mitigate a high-priority risk.

The proposed rules also would require a company to disclose whether and how any of these identified processes is integrated into its overall risk management system or processes.

If a separate board or management committee is responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risks, a company would be required to disclose how that committee interacts with its board or management committee governing risks.

Disclosure of a transition plan Adoption of a transition plan to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks may be an important part of a companys climate-related risk management strategy, particularly if it operates in a jurisdiction that has made commitments to reduce its GHG emissions.

If a company has adopted a transition plan, the proposed rules would require it to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage physical and transition risks."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"A company also would be required to update the disclosure about its transition plan each year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve the plans targets or goals.

The proposed rules would require a company that has adopted a transition plan to discuss how it plans to mitigate or adapt to any physical risks identified in the filing, including risks concerning exposure to sea level rise, extreme weather events, wildfires, drought and severe heat.

In addition, the proposed rules would require a company that has adopted a transition plan to discuss how it plans to mitigate or adapt to any identified transition risks.

A company that has adopted a transition plan may voluntarily describe how it plans to achieve any identified climate-related opportunities.

4. Climate-related financial statement metrics As noted above, a new article to be added to Regulation S-X would require certain climate-related financial statement metrics and related disclosure to be included in a note to a companys audited financial statements.

The required disclosure would fall under the following three categories of information: Financial impact metrics , which would show, on a disaggregated basis, the impact on any relevant line item in the companys consolidated financial statements of physical risks identified by the company, and any other severe weather events and natural conditions, such as floods, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures and sea level rise, as well as any transition risks, unless the sum of the absolute values of all the impacts on a line item is less than 1% of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year.

Disclosure of these impacts would, at a minimum, be required on an aggregated, line-by-line basis for all negative impacts and, separately, all positive impacts.

Expenditure metrics ,which would show expenditures expensed and capitalized costs incurred to mitigate the same climate-related events and identified risks, as well as transition activities, unless the amount is less than 1% of the total expenditures expensed or total capitalized costs incurred, respectively, for the relevant fiscal year.

The proposed rules would require separate disclosure of the positive and negative impacts associated with each of these items.

Financial estimates and assumptions , which would disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, climate-related events and transition activities.

If applicable, a company would need to provide a qualitative description of how the development of these estimates and assumptions was impacted by these events and transition activities.

As part of a companys financial statements, the proposed financial statement metrics would be subject to audit by an independent auditor and within the scope of a companys internal control over financial reporting.

The proposed rules would require disclosure for the companys most recently completed fiscal year and the historical fiscal year(s) included in the companys consolidated financial statements in the applicable filing (with some exceptions).

When calculating these metrics, a company would be required use financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing, and, whenever applicable, apply the same accounting principles  for example, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS)  that are used in preparing the rest of its consolidated financial statements.

Accordingly, the calculations of these metrics must include financial information from a companys consolidated subsidiaries."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"Accordingly, the calculations of these metrics must include financial information from a companys consolidated subsidiaries.

Similar to other financial statement disclosures, the proposed financial statement metrics disclosures would involve estimations and uncertainties driven by the application of judgments and assumptions.

Therefore, a company would need to disclose contextual information for each type of metric to enable a reader to understand how it derived each metric, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used and, if applicable, policy decisions made by the company to calculate the specified metrics.

5.

GHG emissions Disclosure requirements Overview The proposed rules would require a company to disclose, under the separate section captioned Climate-Related Disclosure, its direct and indirect GHG emissions based primarily on concepts and definitions provided by the GHG Protocol, a widely used global GHG accounting and reporting standard.

GHG emissions would be categorized based on the well-accepted concept of scopes, as follows:

Scope 1 emissions : Direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by a company.

Scope 2 emissions : Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or controlled by a company.

Scope 3 emissions : All indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a companys Scope 2 emissions, which occur in the upstream and downstream activities of the companys value chain.

Consistent with the GHG Protocol, the proposed rules define greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); nitrogen trifluoride (NF3); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

For each of the Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, a company would need to disclose the emissions disaggregated by each constituent greenhouse gas and in the aggregate.

The GHG emissions disclosure would be made in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e, which is the common unit of measurement used to indicate the global warming potential of each GHG, expressed in terms of the global warming potential of one unit of CO2.

Further, a company would be required to disclose its GHG emissions data in gross terms, excluding any use of purchased or generated offsets.

The GHG emissions disclosure would need to be provided for the companys most recently completed fiscal year and, if reasonably available, for the historical fiscal years included in the companys consolidated financial statements in the applicable filing.

With respect to all required GHG emissions disclosure for the most recent fiscal year, the proposed rules would allow a company to use a reasonable estimate of its GHG emissions for its fourth fiscal quarter, if actual reported data is not reasonably available, together with actual, determined GHG emissions data for the first three fiscal quarters.

If a company avails itself of this accommodation, it would be required to promptly disclose in a subsequent filing any material difference between the estimate used and the actual, determined GHG emissions data for the fourth fiscal quarter, when it becomes available.

Scopes 1 and 2 disclosure requirements The proposed rules would require all companies to separately disclose their total Scope 1 emissions and total Scope 2 emissions from all sources that are included in their organizational and operational boundaries.

Scope 3 disclosure requirements A company also would be required to disclose separately its total Scope 3 emissions if those emissions were material, or if the company had set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that included its Scope 3 emissions."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"A smaller reporting company (SRC) would be exempt from this requirement, and disclosures made pursuant to the proposed rules would be afforded a safe harbor unless made or reaffirmed by the company without a reasonable basis, or disclosed by the company other than in good faith.

A companys Scope 3 emissions would be considered material if theres a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the companys Scope 3 emissions important in making an investment or voting decision.

When conducting this materiality assessment, companies should consider whether Scope 3 emissions constitute a relatively significant portion of their overall GHG emissions, although a quantitative analysis alone would not be dispositive as to whether Scope 3 emissions are material and required to be disclosed.

If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a company would need to identify the categories of upstream and downstream activities in the calculation of its Scope 3 emissions.

Furthermore, if any of these categories were significant to the company, the proposed rules would require the company to identify these categories and separately disclose Scope 3 emissions data for each category.

For example, Scope 3 emissions might result from upstream activities, such as a companys purchased goods and services, a companys capital goods, waste generated by a companys operations, and business travel by a companys employees, among others.

Similarly, Scope 3 emissions might be generated from downstream activities, such as transportation and distribution of a companys sold products, goods or other outputs, processing by a third party of a companys sold products, investments by a company (which would capture emissions from third parties that the company provides debt or equity financing to, commonly referred to as financed emissions), and use by a third party of a companys sold products, among others.

If required to disclose Scope 3 emissions, a company also would be required to describe the data sources used to calculate its Scope 3 emissions.

GHG intensity In addition to requiring the disclosure of its GHG emissions in gross terms, the proposed rules also would require a company to separately disclose the sum of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and separately disclose its Scope 3 emissions (if applicable) in terms of GHG intensity.

GHG intensity disclosure is intended to provide context to a companys emissions in relation to its business scale, demonstrating the level of emissions efficiency.

The proposed rules would define GHG intensity as a ratio that expresses the impact of GHG emissions per unit of economic value ( e.g ., metric tons of CO2e per unit of total revenues, using the registrants reporting currency) or per unit of production ( e.g., metric tons of CO2e per unit of product produced).

The proposal would require the disclosure of GHG intensity in terms of metric tons of CO2e per unit of total revenue and per unit of production for the applicable fiscal year.

GHG emissions methodology

In addition, the proposed rules would require a company to describe the methodology, significant inputs and significant assumptions used to calculate its GHG emissions metrics.

The description of a companys methodology would need to include the companys organizational boundaries, operational boundaries, calculation approach and any calculation tools used to calculate its GHG emissions.

Organizational boundaries refer to the companys determination, based upon the same set of accounting principles applicable to its consolidated financial statements, of the operations that it owns or controls, for purposes of calculating its GHG emissions, which must be the same for Scopes 1, 2 and 3.

The proposal would therefore require a company to include all the GHG emissions from an entity that it consolidated for purposes of its financial statements."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"The proposal would therefore require a company to include all the GHG emissions from an entity that it consolidated for purposes of its financial statements.

Because the same set of accounting principles apply to GHG emissions disclosure, domestic companies will generally set their organizational boundaries by applying GAAP.

A company also would be required to include its share of emissions based on its percentage ownership of an equity method investee or an operation that is proportionally consolidated into its financial statements.

The proposal would, however, allow a company to exclude emissions from investments that are not fully or proportionally consolidated, or that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting in its financial statements.

A company required to disclose Scope 3 emissions would apply the same organizational boundariesin identifying the sources of indirect emissions from its value chain over which it lacks ownership and control.

Operational boundaries refer to the boundaries that determine the direct and indirect emissions associated with the business operations owned or controlled by a registrant.

In order to set its operational boundaries, a company would identify emissions sources from its operational facilities that fall within its organizational boundaries and then categorize the emissions as either direct or indirect emissions.

As part of describing the methodology for setting its operational boundary, a company would be required to disclose its approach to categorizing its emissions and emissions sources.

This description must detail how the company determines the emissions to include as direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2 and Scope 3, if applicable).

For most companies, purchased electricity would likely constitute a large percentage of their Scope 2 emissions.

Once a company has determined its organizational and operational boundaries, it must consistently use those boundaries when calculating its GHG emissions.

In addition to setting its organizational and operational boundaries, a company would need to select and disclose a GHG emissions calculation approach.

The proposal does not prescribe a specific method of calculation and instead allows companies to make this determination and disclose the methods used.

The proposal suggests that an acceptable and common method for calculating emissions involves the application of published emission factors.

An emission factor is a multiplication factor that allows actual GHG emissions to be calculated from available activity or economic data.

For example, to calculate GHG emissions, the company might multiply a level of activity data (e.g., kWh of electricity consumed facility) by an emission factor (e.g., grams of CO2 per kWh).

Examples of activity data might include kilowatt-hours of electricity used, quantity of fuel used, output of a process, hours of operation of equipment, distance travelled, and floor area of a building.

In the absence of activity data, a company may use an emission factor based on economic data  for example, the economic value of purchased goods or services.

The proposal also includes additional rules related to the calculation and disclosure of GHG emissions, including rules relating to the use of estimates, third-party data, changes in assumptions or methodology, gaps in data, emissions from certain outsourced activities, and overlapping Scope 3 emissions.

Attestation requirements Overview The proposed rules would require accelerated filers and large accelerated filers to obtain and attach to their filings an attestation report regarding Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, and to provide certain related disclosures about the attestation provider."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"Although the attestation provider need not be a registered public accounting firm, the proposal imposes minimum attestation report requirements, minimum standards for acceptable attestation frameworks, and would require an attestation service provider to meet certain minimum qualifications.

Additional disclosure and requirements with respect to the provider of the attestation, and the attestation report itself, would be required and are discussed below.

Initially, a company would be required to provide only limited assurance comparable to a review of interim financial statements included in a Form 10-Q, where the conclusion is expressed in the form of negative assurance regarding whether any material misstatements have been identified.

In contrast, reasonable assurance is the same level of assurance provided in an audit of a companys consolidated financial statements, where the conclusion provides positive assurance that the subject matter is free from material misstatement.

The minimum level of assurance required from the third-party attestor would be phased in, with limited assurance required for the second and third fiscal years after the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure compliance date, and reasonable assurance required for the fourth fiscal year and beyond.

Attestation provider requirements The attestation report required under the proposed rules would need to be signed by a GHG emissions attestation provider.

Under the proposed rules, a GHG emissions attestation provider would be defined as a person or firm that is an expert in GHG emissions with significant experience, as defined, in measuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions, and is independent with respect to the company and its affiliates during the attestation and professional engagement period.

The independence requirement for the GHG emissions attestation provider is modeled after the independence requirements for a companys independent registered public accounting firm.

Specifically, the proposed rules would provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if during the attestation and professional engagement period such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation providers engagement.

The SEC notes that, if a companys independent auditor also would serve as its GHG emissions attestation provider, then the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered Audit-Related Fees for purposes of the applicable disclosure requirements in a companys proxy statement or annual report.

As with the consent of the auditors of the financial statements, a company would be required to obtain and file a written consent from the GHG emissions attestation provider with any registration statement or report filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that includes or incorporates by reference the attestation report.

Given its status as an expert, the GHG emissions attestation provider also would be subject to liability under the federal securities laws for the assurance provided.

Attestation report requirements Under the proposed rule, the attestation report would be required to be included in the separately captioned Climate-Related Disclosure section in the applicable filing.

Moreover, the proposed rules would require the attestation report to be provided pursuant to standards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"As nonexclusive examples of standards that meet the due process requirement, the proposal lists the attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and theInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.

While not prescribing a standard to use, the proposed rules would require a GHG emissions attestation provider to follow the specific requirements regarding form and content of the reports of the attestation standard (or standards) used.

The proposed rules also prescribe certain additional requirements relating to the contents of the attestation report.

Company attestation-related disclosures In addition to these minimum requirements for the attestation provider and report, the proposal would require disclosure by the company of certain additional matters related to the attestation to be included in the separately titled Climate-Related Disclosure section of the applicable filing but not in the attestation report itself.

These disclosures would include information about the attestation providers license, if any,any oversight inspection program to which the engagement is subject and any record-keeping requirements applicable to the attestation provider.

6. Disclosure of climate-related targets or goals Under the proposed rules, if a company has set any climate-related targets or goals, whether on its own initiative or to meet actual or anticipated regulatory requirements, market constraints, or other goals established by a climate-related treaty, law, regulation, policy or organization, then certain information about those targets or goals would be required to be disclosed.

Common examples of climate-related goals or targets a company may set include reduction of GHG emissions, energy usage, water usage, conservation or ecosystem restoration, and revenue goals from low-carbon products, among many others.

The proposed rules would require a company that has set targets or goals to include a description of: The scope of activities and emissions included in the target.

The unit of measurement, including whether the target is absolute or intensity based.

The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the time horizon is consistent with one or more goals established by a climate-related treaty, law, regulation policy or organization.

The defined baseline time period and baseline emissions against which progress will be tracked, with a consistent base year set for multiple targets.

Any interim targets set by the company.

How the company intends to meet its climate-related targets or goals.

The proposed rules also would require disclosure of relevant data to indicate whether the company is making progress toward achieving the target or goal, and how this progress has been achieved, which would have to be updated each year with a description of the actions taken during the year to achieve the target or goal.

In addition, if a company has used carbon offsets or RECs as part of its strategy to achieve targets or goals, the company would be required to disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by the offsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the RECS, the source of the offsets or RECs, a description and location of the underlying projects, any registries or other authentication of the offsets or RECs, and the cost of the offsets or RECs.

Compliance dates The proposed rules include phased-in dates for compliance.

The initial compliance phase-in would be based on filer status, with additional phase-ins for disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, as well as for the attestation requirement and the level of assurance required in the attestation report."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"The tables below summarize the proposed phase-ins for compliance, assuming that the proposed rules would be adopted with an effective date of December 2022, an optimistic but possible timeline, and that the company has a December 31 fiscal year-end.

If the final rule is instead adopted in 2023, each of the dates in the table would be moved back by one year.

A company with a different fiscal year-end date that results in its fiscal year 2023 commencing before the effective date of the rules would not be required to comply with the disclosure requirements until the following fiscal year.

Disclosure compliance dates Registrant type Disclosure compliance date All proposed disclosures, including GHG emissions metrics: Scope 1, Scope 2, and associated intensity metric, but excluding Scope 3 GHG emissions metrics: Scope 3 and associated intensity metric Large accelerated filer Fiscal year 2023 (filed in 2024)

Fiscal year 2024 (filed in 2025) Accelerated filer and non-accelerated filer Fiscal year 2024 (filed in 2025) Fiscal year 2025 (filed in 2026)

SRC Fiscal year   2025 (filed in 2026)

Exempted Attestation compliance dates Filer type Scopes 1   and 2 GHG Limited assurance Reasonable assurance Large accelerated   filer Fiscal year 2023 (filed in 2024)

Fiscal year 2024 (filed in   2025) Fiscal year 2026 (filed in 2027)

Accelerated filer Fiscal year 2024 (filed in 2025) Fiscal year 2025 (filed in   2026)

Fiscal year 2027 (filed in 2028)

Foreign private issuers The proposed rules would apply similarly to foreign private issuers (other than Canadian issuers using Form 40-F), with some modifications to address differences in accounting standards used.

If a foreign private issuer files consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, then the company would apply IFRS as the basis for calculating and disclosing the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics, and setting its organizational boundaries for the purpose of providing the proposed GHG emissions disclosure.

By contrast, foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under home country GAAP and reconcile to US GAAP would be required to use US GAAP as the basis for calculating and disclosing the proposed climate-related financial statement metrics, and setting its organizational boundaries for the purpose of providing the proposed GHG emissions disclosure.

Separately, when determining whether information is required to be provided on a Form 6-K, the instructions to Form 6-K that dictate when information is required to be furnished on a Form 6-K would apply.

In addition, while the proposal generally requires that all information be filed and not furnished, any information provided on Form 6-K may be furnished, per the terms of the form itself, which would exclude it from certain liability provisions under the Exchange Act.

Observations and commentary Prepare to spend time and capital on climate-related disclosures.

It is difficult to overstate the potential effect of the proposed rules on a companys personnel who are responsible for SEC reporting, particularly for smaller companies with limited numbers of employees.

In some cases, companies may find that they will need to hire new personnel with expertise in climate risk identification and analysis.

Among others, anticipated impacts include that: Legal teams will have to be involved to ensure compliance with the disclosure requirements within the body of relevant filings.

Finance teams will have to calculate the financial statement metrics and help prepare the required narrative disclosures.

Auditors will require company employees to provide visibility into the climate-related financial metrics as they would any other metrics within the financial statements."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"Auditors will require company employees to provide visibility into the climate-related financial metrics as they would any other metrics within the financial statements.

GHG emissions will have to be calculated and, for accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, third-party attestation providers will need access to company employees, data, and records to be able to provide the required assurance.

In addition to potentially driving compliance costs through increased human resource requirements, the rule may also increase costs directly, such as through increased outside legal, auditor, attestation and other third-party service provider fees.

Companies may decide to engage outside consultants with climate expertise to assist with the calculation of GHG emissions, or they may use a publicly available tool to help calculate GHG emissions.

For accelerated filers and large accelerated filers, the retention of a third party to attest to the GHG emissions disclosure will add to the costs, in some cases, significantly.

In sum, companies should begin to plan for and think about how to allocate the significant resources that these proposed rules would require.

Given the scope and complexity of the proposed rules, and the potentially short time horizon before the proposed effective date, companies should analyze their particular circumstances and consider what steps they would need to take if the rules were adopted largely as proposed.

Keep in mind that the final rules could differ substantially from the proposal.

The SEC likely will receive a huge volume of comments conveying strongly held views on both sides.

Moreover, reportedly, several aspects of the proposal, including disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions and the attestation requirements, were hotly debated among the commissioners  even among the three Democratic commissioners  and two new SEC commissioners are expected to join the SEC before the final rules come up for a vote, all of which could make a difference in the ultimate outcome.

Assess disclosure controls and procedures as they may apply to climate-related disclosures.

Companies should plan to review their existing disclosure controls and procedures to verify that the appropriate communication channels will be in place to ensure that the climate-related information contemplated by the proposal will be accumulated, processed and reported to appropriate personnel responsible for disclosures.

Because of the scope of the proposed rules, the changes to disclosure controls and procedures may be significant and should involve financial and non-financial personnel.

Companies with a disclosure committee should include the committee in this review and in implementing a control structure for the disclosure of climate-related information.

Companies should also review any disclosure committee charter for necessary changes.

In addition, companies should consider putting in place procedures for the identification, gathering and verification of climate-related data, including the responsible parties for each step.

Companies may want to begin identifying third parties that would need to be engaged.

For instance, companies that do not have climate expertise on staff may need to engage outside consultants who can provide the expertise necessary to help companies collect, calculate and analyze climate-related data in preparation for disclosure.

Organizing, identifying, and engaging various third parties in order to support appropriate disclosure controls and procedures in addition to the required attestation report will take time.

Late-stage private companies should plan accordingly.

The proposed rules would require climate-related disclosures in IPO registration statements.

As a result, should the rules be adopted as proposed, late-stage private companies will need to plan accordingly to ensure they have the internal and external resources in place to enable compliance."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"As a result, should the rules be adopted as proposed, late-stage private companies will need to plan accordingly to ensure they have the internal and external resources in place to enable compliance.

Failure to build in appropriate lead time could delay a proposed IPO or cause a company to miss a window for an IPO entirely.

In addition, private companies with registered debt securities would fall within the scope of the proposed rules.

Evaluate and enhance climate-related policies and procedures and governance structure.

Given the requirements to disclose climate-related governance and risk management processes, companies should plan to adopt and/or build out existing processes and procedures in the future.

Companies will have to ensure that board and management oversight and governance processes are put in place, including the allocation of oversight of climate-related matters to the board or an appropriate board committee.

Companies should also ensure that management and the board are educated about climate risk and have the ability to respond to it.

Companies will have to review their existing risk management frameworks to incorporate climate-related risks into their policies and procedures, keeping in mind that climate-related risks must be addressed for a longer time horizon than traditional risks companies face.

If a company sets a climate target or goal, the board should also oversee progress towards meeting that goal or target.

In addition, management should put in place a structure for managing climate-related matters and for reporting climate-related risks to the board.

While the race to report on climate and other ESG issues had already begun prior to the proposed rules, and will continue on the disclosure side, the proposed rules can be expected to accelerate the establishment and enhancement of internal governance functions as they relate to climate and other ESG-related risks.

Evaluate and enhance board and management expertise.

Similar to the SECs recent proposed rules regarding cybersecurity risks , the climate-related proposed rules do not mandate specific board expertise; however, we expect that the disclosure requirements to discuss climate-related board expertise potentially will have the effect of companies seeking to add board seats to expand climate-related board expertise.

Companies that do not have climate-related expertise on their boards may want to consider prioritizing this expertise in searches for new director candidates, as the proposes rules may create competition for directors with climate-related expertise.

Management also should consider whether employees with climate-related expertise would be needed to manage climate-related matters and to position the company to comply with any adopted rules.

Companies may be wary of pursuing certain climate-related actions.

Ironically, some provisions of the rules might actually discourage some companies from pursuing actions that might otherwise be promoted by climate advocates.

For example, if companies adopt transition plans or use scenario analyses, the proposed rules require extensive disclosure about them.

Similarly, a company that adopts climate-related targets or goals would be required to provide extensive disclosure about them and periodically update with relevant data to demonstrate its progress toward these goals, potentially exposing the company to liability.

In the absence of institutional investors and market forces that advocate for these practices, these rules might actually dampen some companies enthusiasm for adopting these plans and processes, but investors and markets have already made their voices heard in many cases, and those calls are expected to continue.

For companies that have already publicly disclosed targets or goals, they would now be required to make additional, perhaps unexpected, disclosures, requiring them to take a hard look at those targets and goals, and how they actually plan to achieve them."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Watershed Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements,"Importantly, companies should note the proposal does not appear to limit the requirement to targets or goals that have been publicly disclosed and, as a result, its possible that even targets used only internally to measure progress could ultimately be implicated by this requirement.

Note the proposals treatment of carbon offsets.

Interestingly, the proposal puts a minor spotlight on carbon offsets, the use of which has been somewhat controversial.

The proposed rules would require a company to disclose GHG emissions data in gross terms, excluding any use of purchased or generated offsets.

In addition, a company that uses carbon offsets as part its plan to meet GHG reduction goals must disclose the amount of carbon reduction represented by the offsets, the source of the offsets, their cost and any authentication.

In some cases, the SEC notes, companies might plan to use carbon offsets

[] as their primary means of meeting their GHG reduction goals, including those formulated in response to government law or policy or customer or investor demands.

The SEC observes that a reasonable investor could well assess differently the effectiveness and value to a registrant of the use of carbon offsets where the underlying projects resulted in authenticated reductions in GHG emissions compared to the use of offsets where the underlying projects resulted in the avoidance, but not the reduction, in GHG emissions or otherwise lacked verification.

As some commenters have indicated, mandated detailed disclosure about the nature of a purchased carbon offset could also help to mitigate instances of greenwashing.

Expect legal challenges to the proposed rule.

We can expect there to be legal challenges to the proposed rules, particularly given the expected compliance costs.

Peirces dissent may elucidate some of the arguments that challengers could make, including reservations as to whether the SEC has the authority to propose these rules, and whether the proposed rules may be overbroad, particularly with respect to Scope 3 emissions.

Some also contend that the proposed rules violate the First Amendment by impermissibly compelling speech.

The effects of anticipated legal challenges on the rules or their adoption remain to be seen."
Cooley,FDA Releases Draft Guidance on Development of Genome Editing and CAR T Therapies,"On March 15, 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a pair of draft guidance documents in the gene therapy space.

The first, which is specific to gene therapies incorporating genome editing (GE) , was aimed at helping developers of these novel therapies better understand what the FDA is looking for in Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions to control for the risks that the agency is most concerned with for these therapies.

The second focused on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapies , and aimed to provide comprehensive guidance for sponsors on pre-clinical development, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC), manufacturing at single versus multiple sites, and clinical study design.

What you need to know about GE and CAR T therapies GE and CAR T therapies are regulated by the FDA as biological products.

They have become the darling of biotech companies in recent years because of their unprecedented potential to address unmet medical needs.

GE therapies modify DNA sequences at specified locations in the genome of human somatic cells, including correction or inactivation of deleterious mutations, introduction of therapeutic transgenes, and disruption of viral DNA.

CAR T therapies can genetically modify the receptors on the T cells in the body to enable the cells to recognize specific antigens.

This application of genetic modification allows sponsors to target specific diseases with known antigens.

With many clinical trials ongoing for these two types of gene therapies, and a series of recent safety-related clinical holds imposed in this space, the agencys decision to issue its first guidance documents specific to GE and CAR T therapies is not surprising.

FDAs approach to regulating GE and CAR T therapy development As with all therapeutic products, the FDA weighs each GE products benefits and risks, considering factors such as the proposed indication and patient population, the extent and duration of therapeutic benefit achieved, and the availability of alternative therapeutic options.

Specifically for GE products, the agency is concerned with off-target editing, as well as the unintended consequences and unknown long-term effects of on- and off-target editing.

The FDA also recognizes the idiosyncratic challenges for CAR T cell development, manufacturing, testing and clinical assessment.

For example, the CAR T draft guidance points out that CAR T cell manufacturing involves multiple biological materials and complex multi-step procedures, which are potential sources of variability among product lots.

To address these risks and challenges, the draft guidances provide detailed recommendations, such as: Establish case-by-case preclinical testing strategies, taking into consideration data from related products.

Design long-term follow-ups for products with integrating vectors in preparation for the risk of delayed adverse events associated with the vectors.

Discuss considerations for product characterization, testing, dosing and clinical study design in pre-IND meetings.

Use cryopreservation when manufacturing CAR T therapies at a central location and shipping to different clinical sites.

Follow a life cycle approach to CMC, taking into consideration information gathered over the course of product development.

CAR T therapies and vectors should be manufactured under good manufacturing practice conditions appropriate for the stage of development.

Include microbiological testing in vector safety testing to ensure that the final product is not compromised.

Qualify suitability of manufacturing equipment by assessing the critical quality attributes of the product.

Qualify and validate each assay.

When changing an assay, perform a risk assessment.

Cooley,FDA Releases Draft Guidance on Development of Genome Editing and CAR T Therapies,"Use the same standard operating procedures, training, reagents and equipment across manufacturing facilities.

For certain topics, the FDA distinguishes between different types of products.

For example: Ex vivo versus in vivo genomic modification: For ex vivo genome modification, sponsors should choose the method of delivery based on the ability of the cell type of interest to be efficiently electroporated or transduced by a vector.

For in vivo genome modification, sponsors should consider the ability of the delivery vector to target the cells/tissue of interest and minimize distribution to non-targeted tissue.

Autologous versus allogeneic CAR T cell products: For autologous CAR T cells, sponsors should consider using bridging therapies while subjects wait for the CAR T treatment.

For allogeneic CAR T cells, sponsors should use early-phase studies to assess the risks of graft versus host disease.

As pointed out by the FDA, certain recommendations in the CAR T draft guidance may apply to other genetically modified lymphocyte products, such as CAR natural killer cells or T cell receptor-modified T cells.

The draft guidances recommend that, before submitting INDs, GE and CAR T therapy manufacturers communicate with the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to discuss the product-specific considerations for transitioning the products to clinical studies.

The meeting types include pre-IND and INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs (INTERACT) meetings, which can be used in early development to obtain non-binding regulatory advice from the agency.

What to include in your IND The FDA recommends including the following in GE product IND submissions: A description of, and rationale for, the design and screening processes of the GE components, 1 and the sequences of the GE components.

The GE component optimization strategy to reduce the potential for off-target genome modification.

A detailed description of how each GE component is manufactured, purified and tested, including: Flow diagrams and a detailed narrative of the manufacturing process and any in-process controls.

Lists of the reagents used during manufacturing processes and certificates of analysis.

The quality control and quality assurance programs in place at each manufacturing site.

Procedures in place at each manufacturing site to ensure product tracking and segregation.

Procedures in place at each manufacturing site to prevent, detect and correct deficiencies in the manufacturing process.

Procedures for shipping the GE component from the component manufacturing site to the final product manufacturing site.

Descriptions of the analytical procedures utilized for GE component testing, including the sensitivity and specificity of the procedures, as well as an outline of any in-process testing performed.

Outlines of stability study protocols and any available stability data.

A detailed description of how the drug product is manufactured, with details about any in-process controls, including: Flow diagrams and a detailed narrative of the manufacturing process and any in-process controls.

Lists of the reagents used during manufacture and certificates of analysis.

Details on measures taken to ensure aseptic processing, if applicable.

A detailed description of the testing plan for the drug product.

Detailed descriptions of the overall clinical study design, assessment of adverse events, and subject follow-up plans.

For CAR T therapies, the agency recommends including the following in IND submissions: Descriptions of approaches to reduce immunogenicity (e.g., humanization by complementarity-determining region grafting), if applicable, and their impact on target binding and biological activity.

A description of procedures to ensure adequate control of the CAR T cells during shipping to the clinical site."
Cooley,FDA Releases Draft Guidance on Development of Genome Editing and CAR T Therapies,"A description of procedures to ensure adequate control of the CAR T cells during shipping to the clinical site.

Information demonstrating the manufacturers ability to produce CAR T cells according to the proposed manufacturing process through the production of developmental or engineering batches.

Information to demonstrate appropriate control of test methods.

For flow cytometry: A description of the assay, including the flow cytometry antibody panel and the gating strategy used to define each cell population detected.

Information regarding instrument calibration and quality control to ensure accuracy of the results.

A list of assay controls.

A copy of all labels and labeling to be provided to each investigator in the clinical study.

CMC information, depending on the phase and scope of the clinical studies proposed.

For multisite manufacturing, a description of any differences in the manufacturing process across the manufacturing sites.

Rationale and justification for the proposed clinical study population.

Rationale for the proposed clinical study design and analysis.

Our recommendations The comprehensiveness and level of detail included in these draft guidances reflect that the FDA has put significant effort into designing the regulatory approach to GE and CAR T therapy development.

Manufacturers should consult the draft guidances if they are developing GE and CAR T therapies, or plan to in the near future.

Sponsors would be well served to verify that they have considered all applicable factors mentioned in the draft guidances.

To ensure a smooth transition of product candidates to clinical studies, GE and CAR T therapy manufacturers preparing IND submissions should check that all content recommended in the draft guidances is included in their INDs.

Upon review, if an interested party finds that any of the FDAs recommendations or considerations contained in these guidances lack scientific justification, or impose an unreasonable burden, the public comment submission process for GE therapies and CAR T therapies can be used to raise concerns or suggest alternative approaches to help the FDA effectively assess these products.

Your Cooley team stands ready to assist with any comments to the docket, which are due by June 15, 2022.

Cooley,San Francisco Amends Family Friendly Workplace Ordinance to Require Employer Action,"Untitled Document On March 14, 2022, San Francisco Mayor London Breed approved a significant amendment to the citys Family Friendly Workplace Ordinance (FFWO) .

Currently, the FFWO grants covered employees the right to request a flexible or predictable working arrangement to assist with caring for: A child or children under the age of 18.

A family member with a serious health condition.

A parent age 65 or older.

Employers must meet with any employee who requests a flexible or predictable arrangement and respond to the request within 21 days of that meeting.

An employer who denies a request must respond in writing with a bona fide business reason for the denial and provide the employee with notice of the right to request reconsideration.

With the new amendment, which is effective July 12, 2022, employers now will be required to grant a requested flexible or predictable working arrangement, absent undue hardship.

The new amendment also will broaden the scope of covered employees under the FFWO.

What is a flexible or predictable working arrangement?

Under the amendment, the definition of a flexible or predictable working arrangement will be amended to: A change in an employees terms and conditions of employment as they relate to the number of hours an employee is required to work, which may include (but is not limited to) part-time work, part-year employment or job-sharing arrangements.

An employees work schedule, which may include modified hours, variable hours, predictable hours, or other schedule changes or flexibilities.

An employees work location, which may include (but is not limited) to telework.

Modifying the employees work assignments or duties.

Who is a covered employee?

The amended FFWO will apply to all employees who: Work in San Francisco at least eight hours per week, including those who telework from a place of residence, an office or a worksite within San Francisco that is not maintained by their employer Have been employed by their employer for at least six months.

Are caregivers for: A child or children for whom the employee has assumed parental responsibility.

A family member with a serious health condition.

A family member age 65 or older.

Who is a covered employer?

Any entity that employs at least 20 employees, regardless of whether the employees are located in San Francisco, is considered a covered employer.

For the purposes of counting the total number of employees under the FFWO, employers must include workers who are staffed through a temporary staffing agency where the entity employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of those workers.

What are an employers obligations?

Under the amended FFWO, once an employer receives a request for a flexible or predictable working arrangement, the employer may choose to meet with the employee regarding the request within 14 days of receipt of the request.

This is a departure from the FFWOs current requirement, which obligates employers to meet with employees within 21 days of any such request.

With the amendment, after this meeting, employers must respond to the request in writing within 21 days.

If a flexible or predictable working arrangement is agreeable, employers may simply confirm their agreement in writing.

If, however, the requested arrangement is denied, employers now must engage in an interactive process with employees to devise an alternative arrangement that satisfies both parties.

Employers may only deny a requested flexible or predictable working arrangement if it would cause undue hardship, the bases of which may include, but are not limited to: The identifiable costs directly caused by the requested arrangement, including the cost of productivity loss, retraining or hiring employees, or transferring employees between facilities.

Detrimental effect on ability to meet customer or client demands.

Inability to organize work among other employees."
Cooley,San Francisco Amends Family Friendly Workplace Ordinance to Require Employer Action,"Detrimental effect on ability to meet customer or client demands.

Inability to organize work among other employees.

Insufficiency of work to be performed during the time or at the location the employee proposes to work.

If an employer denies a request for a flexible or predictable working arrangement, the reasons for the denial must be detailed in writing, along with a notice to the employee of the right to request reconsideration and to file a complaint with the San Francisco Office of Labor Standards Enforcement (OLSE).

If an employee requests reconsideration within 30 days of the notice of denial, the employer must meet with the employee within 21 days of the reconsideration request and inform the employee of the employers final decision within 14 days of that meeting.

This notice of final decision must be in writing and, if a denial, must explain the employers basis for undue hardship and inform the employee of the right to file a complaint.

What are the penalties for violations?

If OLSE determines that a violation took place, the agency may impose a penalty of $50 per day that the violation occurred, per aggrieved employee, to be paid to the employee.

Alternatively, OLSE may impose a penalty up to the cost of care incurred by the employee or person whose rights were violated.

OLSE also may impose a penalty of $50 per day that the violation occurred, per aggrieved employee, or an amount up to the city of San Franciscos costs for the investigation and remedying of the violation, if greater, to be paid to the city.

Following a final administrative decision, if an employer fails to comply within the timeframe delineated within the decision, OLSE may seek compliance by referring the matter to the city attorney to seek enforcement in a court of law or equity.

OLSE also may request, except where prohibited by state or federal law, that an employers registration certificates, permits, or licenses held be revoked or suspended pending remediation of the violation.

Cooley,Complying With New York City’s Pay Transparency&nbsp;Law,"On March 22, 2022, the New York City Commission on Human Rights released its long-anticipated guidance related to a January 2022 NYC law calling for pay transparency in job listings that is set to take effect on May 15, 2022.

Although a recently introduced bill proposes to amend the pay transparency law to, among other things, push back its effective date, NYC employers should start preparing to comply with the pay transparency laws requirements.

We have listed below practical considerations employers should take into account in preparing job postings.

Step 1: Determine whether the pay transparency law applies to your joblisting If you have four or more employees and at least one works in New York City, the pay transparency law applies to any job listing you publicize to a pool of potential applicants for a job, promotion or transfer opportunity that could be performed (in whole or in part) in NYC  whether from an office, in the field or remotely from the employees home.

We expect the New York City Commission on Human Rights to take an expansive view of whether a position is capable of performance in NYC.

Job listings are covered by the pay transparency law regardless of the medium in which they are disseminated, including postings on internal bulletin boards, internet advertisements, printed flyers distributed at job fairs and newspaper advertisements.

The law, however, does not require employers to create an advertisement in order to hire, promote, or transfer an employee or potential employee.

Step 2: Confirm that your job listing complies with the pay transparency laws requirements If your job listing is covered by the pay transparency law, confirm that the listing complies with the following requirements: The job listing must provide the minimum and maximum wage rate that your business, at the time of the posting, believes in good faith it is willing to pay for the position.

Good faith is based on your businesss honest belief.

You must have a legitimate basis for the wage range, and the wider the range, the more scrutiny you should expect.

Because the wage range must include a minimum and maximum, the following examples are insufficient: $15 per hour and up and maximum $50,000 per year.

If you believe in good faith that there is no flexibility in the wage being offered, the minimum and maximum wage may be identical.

To demonstrate intentionality, employers likely would benefit from using a redundant wage range (e.g., $20 per hour to $20 per hour), rather than simply listing the rate once.

The wage range does not need to include anything but wages .

For example, employee benefits, bonuses and equity compensation can be excluded.

However, if such benefits could potentially alter the wage range, this would provide a good faith basis to expand the job listings wage range.

Step 3: Consider additional best practices Employers should consider incorporating the following additional best practices: Immediately audit all job postings that are publicly available and update them as necessary.

Expect individuals to comb online job boards for noncompliant job postings.

Train your recruiting and management teams on these new requirements, and build in a requirement that managers provide a wage range when submitting a job requisition.

Document how your business determined each posted wage range to demonstrate that it was reached in good faith.

Determine whether job postings must also comply with requirements in other jurisdictions, such as Colorado.

If you have questions about the NYC pay transparency law, please contact the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,CFPB Continues Criticism of Industry Fees With Credit Card Late Fee Report,"Overview On March 29, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a report raising concerns about the late fee practices of credit card issuers .

Although the report provides a general assessment of credit card late fee trends, it was accompanied by a press release criticizing late fee penalties as a core part of the issuer profit model that obscures the true cost of credit .

The report follows the CFPBs January initiative to gather information more generally regarding back-end fees and junk fees associated with a range of financial products and services , including deposit accounts, remittance and payment products, prepaid accounts, and other types of loans.

Pursuant to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act and its accompanying implementation regulation, Regulation Z, the CFPB is responsible for oversight of late fee policies to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional.

In implementing this regulation, the CFPB sets a safe harbor for specific fee amounts, which are subject to adjustment for changes in inflation.

As of 2022, the safe harbor fee limit is $30 for first-time late fees and $41 for subsequent violations resulting in recurring fees.

The CFPB calls into question whether it is considering the removal of the penalty fee safe harbor, as the report frequently draws attention to the common practice of the largest issuers in the marketplace, who set their penalty fees at or near the limits set out by Regulation Z and adjust them upward in accordance with yearly limit changes.

Continued CFPB focus on vulnerable and minority populations The CFPBs report finds that late fee assessments disproportionately fall upon credit card users in low credit score tiers, as well as low-income consumers and consumers in majority-Black neighborhoods.

For example, the CFPB found that in 2019 nearly 60% of credit card accounts were held by super-prime consumers, but those accounts incurred  perhaps unsurprisingly  20% of the total late fee volume.

In an attempt to understand links between consumer race and late fee burden, the CFPB found that the average late fees per account increased with the share of the census tract population identifying as Black.

The CFPB also found that credit card fee volumes dropped significantly during the pandemic, and corresponded to the increase in federal government assistance.

The CFPB characterized this finding as evidence that late fees serve as a penalty on households living paycheck to paycheck, and not as an incentive for consumers to make on-time payments.

Insight There is a distinct disconnect between the CFPBs press release, which highlights concerns regarding the impact of market competition on late fee assessment practices, and the report itself, which focuses on the incidence of late fee assessment on low-income borrowers and in minority communities.

While the CFPB criticizes issuer reliance on late fees, it notes that issuers are complying with the CARD Act  the law enacted to protect cardholders  and does not specifically identify anti-competitive practices or demonstrate that late fee levels are inappropriate considering the cost of offering and administering credit cards.

The CFPBs analysis of late fee assessment in minority areas is also noteworthy in light of its March 16 announcement tying together theories of unfairness with discrimination .

In that announcement, the CFPB indicated it will seek information during examinations to assess whether institutions understand demographic usage of financial products, as well as the fees and revenues associated with those products."
Cooley,District of Columbia’s Ban on Non-Competes Delayed Until October 2022,"On March 28, 2022, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the Ban on Non-Compete Agreements Applicability Emergency Amendment Act of 2022 , which postpones the effective date of DCs near-total ban on non-compete agreements until October 1, 2022.

The DC Council had initially deferred the bans applicability to April 1, 2022, in order to consider legislative amendments and incorporate comments from a July 2021 public hearing.

In March, the DC Council requested a postponement to October 2022 so it could continue to consult DCs business community regarding the impact of the ban and consider additional amendments.

As explained in a February 2021 Cooley alert , the Ban on Non-Compete Agreements Amendment Act of 2020 (DC Law 23-209) will have significant implications for all employers with employees working in DC.

The act prohibits the use and enforcement of non-compete agreements with virtually all DC employees outside of the sale of business context.

In addition, the act bans anti-moonlighting policies, and requires employers to provide written notice of the act to covered employees within 90 days of its effective date.

Though the act has not been modified since it was originally signed by Bowser in January 2021, we expect the DC Council to consider multiple amendments in advance of the new October 2022 effective date.

One proposed amendment clarifies that employers may prevent employees from using  not just disclosing  their employers confidential information during and after employment.

(The existing language of the act only uses the word disclosing, so this amendment would close that potential loophole.)

The DC Council also will consider an amendment modifying the anti-moonlighting ban to carve out provisions and policies prohibiting employees from working for another person or organization if it would create a bona fide conflict of interest and cause the employer to operate unethically or violate the law.

As a reminder, the act only restricts those agreements and policies entered into after its effective date.

Therefore, employers are permitted to continue to use non-compete agreements (and other policies and agreements prohibited by the act) with employees in DC until at least October 2022.

Next steps for employers We encourage employers with employees in DC to stay apprised of further developments as the act becomes applicable law.

We will continue to monitor the progress of the act, including proposed amendments and guidance on timing from the DC Council.

In the interim, before the act becomes effective, we recommend employers contact the Cooley employment team with any questions regarding how the act will impact their non-compete agreements, employment policies and onboarding practices."
Cooley,CFPB Follows FTC’s Lead on Consumer Online Reviews,"On March 22, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it has issued guidance designed to dissuade financial institutions from curbing consumers rights to post online reviews .

Specifically, the CFPB put the industry on notice that it intends to rely on the Consumer Financial Protection Acts prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, or UDAAPs, to prevent institutions from using contracts or other marketing practices to interfere with consumers ability to post and access online reviews, increasing risks associated with how institutions manage online reviews.

The announcement follows the Federal Trade Commissions warning last fall to 700+ companies that they could face fines for posting misleading online endorsements, and heavily cites to prior FTC actions as precedent for the policy statement.

Citing studies showing the importance of online reviews to increased company revenues, the CFPBs bulletin expresses concern about the incentives for dishonest market participants to manipulate the online review process, rather than compete on the value of their services, which frustrates the competitive marketplace.

To that end, the CFPB identified the following practices that may be unfair or deceptive: Utilizing contractual gag clauses to create the impression that consumers are restricted in their ability to publish an honest review.

The CFPB indicates that using such a provision is deceptive because it is unenforceable under the Consumer Review Fairness Act .

The CFPB also notes that a qualifier indicating the restriction is subject to applicable law will be insufficient to cure the misrepresentation.

Pressuring a consumer to remove an already posted negative review by invoking unenforceable contractual restrictions.

Manipulating which reviews are displayed online (e.g., displaying only positive reviews in a context that suggests they represent a comprehensive collection of all reviews about the company or its products) or posting fake reviews (e.g., by asking employees to post reviews without adequate disclosures of their relationships to the institution, or by paying third parties to post reviews that are materially misleading or that fail to disclose that the reviewer was compensated by the institution).

What does this mean for you?

In light of the CFPBs announcement, financial services providers may want to consider: Reviewing consumer agreements to identify language discouraging consumers from posting honest reviews.

Assessing the way company-owned and third-party websites display consumer reviews, along with any associated disclosures regarding those reviews.

Reviewing and updating existing marketing or social media policies to ensure they prohibit online review manipulation, and contain clear guidelines for making adequate disclosures when engaging in any sponsorship or other paid arrangements, or in any relationship whereby the company provides an incentive or special benefit to a reviewer or endorser that would not otherwise be obvious to the audience reading the review.

Although this most recent announcement was from the CFPB, the FTC and state attorneys general have their own authority to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices  and institutions should be mindful of the increased litigation and enforcement risks created by the announcement.

(For more information, refer to the FTCs principal guidance applicable to the collection and use of reviews, endorsements, and testimonials .)"
Cooley,Upcoming Affirmative Action Plan Certification Deadlines for Federal Contractors,"Federal contractors that are required to annually develop an affirmative action plan (AAP), meaning that they have 50 or more employees and a single federal contract or subcontract of $50,000 or more, must comply with two upcoming deadlines under a new requirement put in place by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).

On or before March 30, 2022: Contractors must register in the OFCCPs new contractor portal by creating a Login.gov account.

To complete the registration, contractors should be prepared with their Employer Identification Number (EIN) and EEO-1 Headquarter/Company Number and Establishment/Unit Number, and need to register each establishment for which they have an AAP.

The OFCCP has posted a user guide to troubleshoot problems with the registration process.

Between March 31 and June 30, 2022: Contractors must certify in the contractor portal that they are meeting the requirement to develop and maintain an AAP for each establishment.

The OFCCP has not revealed the exact content of the certification, but has suggested that it will be a yes or no election, with no requirement to upload an AAP.

To be able to comply with this certification requirement, contractors should ensure that they will have their current AAP in place on the date that they opt to complete their certification.

Contractors with an AAP cycle that starts in May or June should complete their certification before the beginning of their new AAP cycle, so that they are able to represent that their current AAP is active.

The OFCCP has added the certification requirement in recognition of the fact that it has limited insight into whether most contractors are complying with their AAP obligations.

Although this is the first year that the certification requirement is in place, the OFCCP has announced that certification will be required on an annualbasis.

It is critical that covered contractors comply with these new registration and certification requirements.

If you have questions about whether your company is required to register in the new portal and/or is covered by the AAP requirements, please contact one of our attorneys listed below."
Cooley,Bloomberg LP v. ZXC: Privacy Triumphs,"The UK Supreme Court has handed down its highly anticipated judgment in the matter of Bloomberg LP v. ZXC

[2022] UKSC 5 .

As we explained in our 16 February 2022 Cooley alert , the case highlighted the tension between the privacy interests of individuals under investigation who have not been charged with a crime and the rights of the press to publish information of public importance.

Bloomberg had published two reports about a US-based executive who was the subject of a criminal investigation in the UK.

One of the reports described a confidential letter of request for mutual legal assistance to foreign authorities, including details of the theory of suspected fraud.

The executive successfully sued Bloomberg for the misuse of private information.

Bloomberg appealed, arguing that individuals under investigation do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and that the general public is cognisant of the presumption of innocence.

Last month, the UK Supreme Court dismissed Bloombergs appeal, explaining:

[A]s a legitimate starting point, a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation and that in all the circumstances this is a case in which that applies and there is such an expectation (emphasis added)

The Supreme Court emphasised that while each individual case must be assessed according to the particular facts in play, it is a broad matter of public policy that individuals are not identified by enforcement authorities prior to charge because there is a significant risk to causing irreversible damage to an individuals reputation by publishing such a fact.

The Supreme Courts view was that there was scant justification to allow media organisations to bypass this principle.

What this means for businesses and individuals Media organisations in the UK must be cautious when reporting about individuals who are under criminal investigation but not yet charged.

Individuals can take some comfort in knowing that they will have recourse if their identity, or details relating to their involvement in a criminal investigation, are made public before a charging decision.

We note, however, that these cases generally turn on their facts.

We recommend that businesses and individuals under investigation take steps to prevent the identities of suspects under investigation prior to charge, and the facts under investigation, from being disclosed, particularly now that the Supreme Court has re-emphasised the right of suspects to privacy in the UK."
Cooley,UK Government Considers Case for New Online Sales Tax,"The UK government has launched a consultation on a potential new online sales tax (OST).

As a novel and potentially complex tax on the digital economy, an OST presents a number of challenges in terms of scoping and design, which may be difficult for the government to overcome.

Background The government raises significant revenue via business rates (a tax borne by UK businesses and set at levels linked to the value of a business premises).

It has been suggested that high-street retailers disproportionately bear the burden of these rates, as compared with their online competitors  a situation made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following a review, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting bricks and mortar high-street retailers, including through short-term cuts to their business rates bills.

To help fund any longer-term solutions and further to rebalance the taxation of the retail sector, the government is testing the case for an OST.

Scope and design An OST would be an entirely new tax on online sales for which the government acknowledges there is little existing precedent in other jurisdictions.

The consultation sets out several fundamental and potentially complex questions, which the government will need to address in order make an OST workable whilst raising sufficient revenue.

Key questions include the following: Definition of online sale.

Should this definition comprise all remote sales  including via email, telephone and mail-order  or should it instead focus on online, internet-mediated sales?

How do click and collect orders fit in?

Will a narrow scope give rise to opportunities for avoidance?

Just goods, or goods and services?

It seems clear that an OST should apply to online sales of goods  but what about services, and bundled goods and services like mobile phone contracts?

What about online purchases which do not fit easily within these categories, such as takeaway orders, or items that can be bought either physically or electronically, like e-books?

Exemptions.

Should certain goods like food and medicines be exempt for policy reasons?

Who will collect and account for OST?

Vendors are within scope, but what about online marketplaces?

The consultation suggests that an OST could borrow from VAT principles by making online marketplaces responsible for the tax where the vendor is outside the UK.

Calculation.

Two options are being weighed up: a revenue model (possibly 12% of revenue generated by online sales) and a flat-fee model based on the number of online sales made.

There are some options that the government seems already to have chosen or discounted.

First, as indicated above, an OST would be UK-wide and apply to all vendors (with no exemption for online sales by vendors outside the UK).

Second, it appears the government wants to exclude all B2B online sales from the scope of an OST, having discounted the alternative idea of a VAT-style input tax recovery system for businesses.

OST and international tax reform Tax authorities around the world have been grappling with finding new ways to tax the digital economy.

The government is keen to position an OST as a long-term, targeted intervention distinct from other, similar forms of taxation like the UKs own digital services tax (which taxes revenues generated by social media, search engines and online marketplaces).

Under an international agreement on tax reform the UK has committed to repeal its digital services tax (once the OECDs Pillar One solution has been implemented) and not to introduce any relevant similar measures.

It remains to be seen how an OST could be reconciled with this commitment.

Is an OST the right answer?

Jury still out.

The government will need to determine whether the revenue forecast to be raised through an OST (1 billion per annum, based on a 1% rate and a number of assumptions) will be enough to justify the introduction of a complex new form of taxation."
Cooley,UK Government Considers Case for New Online Sales Tax,"Economic theory suggests that an OST might not even achieve its objective if, for example, a reduction in business rates leads to increased rents.

Next steps Views are sought before 10am on 20 May 2022.

Further details (including the consultation document) can be found on the UK governments website ."
Cooley,CFPB Leverages UDAAP Authority to Prohibit Discrimination in Noncredit Financial Products and Services,"Untitled Document On March 16, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that it will consider whether institutions are engaging in the unfair practice of discriminating , expanding its anti-discrimination efforts to cover a wide range of noncredit consumer products.

Acknowledging that fair lending laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) may not apply to those products, the CFPB made clear that it intends to rely on the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, or UDAAPs, to reach all consumer finance markets, including collections, servicing, consumer reporting, payments, remittances and deposits.

This does not mean that the CFPB is singularly focused on noncredit products, however.

By referencing credit in the list, the announcement also suggests that the CFPB will apply this theory where fair lending laws do still apply, thus expanding risk for lenders.

With the announcement, the CFPB also updated its UDAAP exam manual , which adds detail on the CFPBs approach, including expectations for compliance management tied to this theory.

The ECOA, over which the CFPB has authority, prohibits discrimination on the basis of, among other things, race and ethnicity.

With this weeks announcement, the CFPB suggests that discrimination can be unfair, and a violation of the CFPA, because consumers are unable to avoid injury due to discriminatory practices  and may suffer substantial injury in the form of foregone monetary benefits or denial of products or services.

The CFPB also has added dignitary harm to the list of potential harms that do not result in actual injury but may, at least in the bureaus view, amount or contribute to a showing of substantial injury sufficient to support a legal claim of unfairness.

The CFPB offered examples of practices that may be unfair because they are discriminatory, including in connection with the offering of noncredit products and services, such as: Giving inferior terms to one customer demographic as compared to another demographic.

Offering or providing more products or services to one customer demographic as compared to other customer demographics.

Treating customers of certain demographics in a less favorable way, or providing extra assistance or exceptions to customers of a certain demographic in customer service interactions.

Engaging in targeted advertising or marketing in a discriminatory way.

The CFPB also indicates in the updated manual that examiners will be looking to regulated entities for: Documentation regarding the use of models, algorithms, and decision-making processes used in connection with offering consumer financial products and services.

Information an institution collects, retains or uses regarding customer demographics, including a breakdown of demographic usage of products, fees associated with those products, and revenue sources and costs associated with them.

Demographic research and analysis relating to marketing or advertising of consumer financial products or services.

Evidence of processes implemented to prevent discrimination throughout the product development and implementation life cycle, and periodic monitoring of decision-making processes for potential discrimination.

The CFPB does not tackle the question of how institutions are to assess this information where they do not collect demographic or other information concerning a consumers protected class status.

In many cases, this will require institutions to resort to testing proxies that, in recent years, have been increasingly questioned on their reliability, including Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) analysis.

What does this mean for you?

The CFPBs announcement is not a binding interpretation of the unfairness standard under the CFPA, but it certainly signals a significant shift in how the bureau intends to scrutinize financial products and services that are not subject to the ECOA."
Cooley,CFPB Leverages UDAAP Authority to Prohibit Discrimination in Noncredit Financial Products and Services,"To that end, financial services providers may want to consider: Reviewing noncredit offerings, such as deposit and payment products, and assessing whether there is a risk of discrimination in the way the products are offered or administered.

Creating a nondiscrimination policy and implementing procedures for noncredit products, or expanding existing fair lending policies to cover noncredit products.

Working with marketing partners to assess whether marketing strategies and practices exclude certain groups of consumers from product offerings.

Providing fair and responsible banking training to employees who offer noncredit products.

Piloting a testing program aimed at assessing risk of discrimination in offering or administering noncredit products.

Closely monitoring complaints for signs of potential unfair treatment or discrimination.

As the CFPB is not the only entity with authority to prohibit unfair practices  the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general also have their own such authority, and many states provide private rights of action to consumers for such practices  institutions should also be mindful of the increased litigation and enforcement risks created by the announcement."
Cooley,"Intellectual Property Update Regarding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine","Cooley has been closely monitoring the situation in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Although the situation is in flux and circumstances may change with little or no notice, weve provided a summary below of recent intellectual property (IP) developments in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Eurasian Patent Organization, along with a description of the actions that Cooley has taken in response to these developments and our current recommendations.

(You can find additional information about financial sanctions and export control restrictions imposed on Russia and Belarus by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union in our March 4 client alert .)

Recent developments Payments to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine While we are currently authorized to make payments to foreign associates in Russia and Belarus, we have been informed that sanctions are impacting banks inside and outside of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

In addition, several vendors have suspended the processing of payments to Russia and/or Belarus.

Consequently, it may be difficult to send funds to these jurisdictions, even for transactions that are permitted under applicable sanctions.

Martial law in Ukraine Martial law has been declared in Ukraine and will last at least until April 14, 2022.

It is expected that all Ukrainian IP deadlines will be suspended as long as martial law is in place.

Russian patents Russia recently issued a decree that removes protections for patent holders who are registered in unfriendly countries, do business in them or hold their nationality.

The list of unfriendly countries includes the United States and Great Britain, as well as other European Union member countries.

As a result of this decree, impacted patent holders will not be entitled to any compensation for infringing activities in Russia.

While IP protections for trademarks and copyrights are not subject to the same decree, at least one recent court decision has indicated that world-famous images can be used without punishment in Russia.

Russian officials also have raised the possibility of lifting restrictions on unauthorized use of some copyrighted works and trademarks not owned by Russian entities.

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) actions The USPTO has terminated its engagement with officials from intellectual property agencies in Russia (Rospatent) and Belarus, as well as with the Eurasian Patent Organization (a regional organization covering Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan).

In addition, effective March 11, 2022, the USPTO is no longer granting requests to participate in the Global Patent Prosecution Highway (GPPH) when the requests are based on work performed by Rospatent.

For any pending cases where the USPTO has granted special status under the GPPH based on work performed by Rospatent, the USPTO will remove that status, and return the application to the regular processing and examination queue.

Sanctions and export control restrictions As part of the sanctions levied against Russia and Belarus, the US government has significantly tightened export control restrictions to those jurisdictions, and it will be necessary to obtain a foreign filing license from the USPTO before filing any patent applications in Russia and/or Belarus.

Cooleys responses Your Cooley team will be reviewing all deadlines in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Eurasian Patent Organization through the end of 2022 and, absent your instructions to the contrary, will work to satisfy all deadlines in these jurisdictions as quickly as possible.

We are monitoring sanctions lists to confirm that we can continue to work with our current local counsel based in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine."
Cooley,"Intellectual Property Update Regarding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine","We are monitoring sanctions lists to confirm that we can continue to work with our current local counsel based in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

In addition, we have identified law firms located outside of these countries that are able to assist with prosecution in Ukraine and Eurasia, so please reach out to a member of your Cooley team if you are interested in making a change.

Cooleys recommendations Inform Cooley as soon as possible whether or not you are still interested in maintaining your existing IP filings in Russia, Belarus, Eurasia and/or Ukraine, so we can take the necessary actions and inform local counsel in these jurisdictions accordingly.

Let your Cooley team know in advance of any deadline(s) if you plan to make new filings in Russia, Belarus, Eurasia and/or Ukraine.

Cooley,Biden Executive Order on Cryptocurrencies and Other Digital Assets Emphasizes Innovation and Regulation,"On March 9, 2022, President Joe Biden issued an executive order outlining a whole-of-government approach to examining a broad range of potential risks associated with the dramatic growth in digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Importantly, the executive order states that the Biden administration is interested in promoting responsible financial innovation and US leadership globally, including in the development of global standards for digital assets.

The executive order lays the groundwork for increased US regulation of digital assets.

However, while it is a crucial first step to addressing currently fragmented regulation, the executive order stops short of establishing a single policy for digital assets.

To further demonstrate the necessity of the executive order, Congress remains sharply divided on a path forward on digital currency legislation.

The executive order also states that the Biden administration places the highest urgency on further research into a potential US central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The executive order requires coordination among, and actions to be taken by, numerous executive branch departments and agencies within specified timeframes.

These actions include the submission of certain reports and regulatory and legislative proposals.

It also encourages various US regulators to act within their respective jurisdictions.

To that end, shortly after the announcement of the executive order, several agencies issued statements echoing positions in the order.

The executive order comes on the heels of other initiatives focused on digital assets, including the Department of Justices focus on cryptocurrency in both civil and criminal initiatives (such as its appointment of its first National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team director), the Securities and Exchange Commission's(SEC) continued regulation by enforcement in this area, and recent commentary from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on the broader adoption of digital assets in consumer markets.

Key policy priorities The executive order outlines six key policy priorities.

Protecting US consumers, investors and businesses: The executive order expresses concern that the growing use of digital assets and firms providing digital asset services may present increased risks of crimes such as fraud and theft, other statutory and regulatory violations, privacy and data breaches, unfair and abusive acts or practices, and other cyber incidents.

It further states that such risks may be heightened for less informed market participants.

Protecting US and global financial stability and mitigating economywide financial risks: The executive order states that digital asset issuers, exchanges and trading platforms, service providers, and other industry participants may not be subject to or in compliance with appropriate regulations or supervision.

Industry participants that present risks to financial stability should be subject to and in compliance with  standards that govern traditional market infrastructures and financial firms, although evolutionary changes to the current regulatory approach may be required.

(In this regard, the executive order reinforces the Financial Stability Oversight Councils role in assessing financial stability risks and regulatory gaps, and preparing recommendations for addressing such risks.)

Mitigating money laundering, other illicit finance activity and national security risks: The executive order recognizes that digital assets are used in cybercrime, including ransomware, and may present heightened risks of money laundering, sanctions evasion, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption."
Cooley,Biden Executive Order on Cryptocurrencies and Other Digital Assets Emphasizes Innovation and Regulation,"Reinforcing US leadership in the global financial system, and technological and economic competitiveness: The executive order states that the US has an interest in ensuring the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets, including those that underpin international capital flows.

It furthers expresses the view that the US can play a role in the global governance of digital assets and should seek to preserve US global competitiveness.

Promoting equitable access to safe and affordable financial services: The executive order states that digital assets could be used to reach underserved populations and to provide more cost-efficient access to financial services.

Supporting technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets: The executive order states that innovation in digital assets and digital payments should support national goals by, for example, taking into account privacy and security interests, including controls to protect against illicit exploitation, and focusing on mitigating negative climate impacts.

Interagency coordination and international cooperation The executive order seeks to establish a coordinated, national approach for digital assets.

It directs and/or encourages key executive branch departments  including the departments of Justice, Treasury, State, Defense, Homeland Security and Commerce  and financial regulators (including the prudential bank regulators, the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission), among others, to take certain actions, such as preparing reports and regulatory and legislative proposals.

( Weve provided a high-level summary of these actions in the chart below .)

The interagency process assigns the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy coordinating responsibility for the executive branch actions mandated under the executive order.

The executive order also emphasizes the importance of fostering international cooperation.

Among other actions, the executive order directs the development of frameworks for strengthening international law enforcement of criminal activity involving digital assets, and engaging with international partners and in international forums  such as the G7, the G20, the Financial Action Task Force and the Financial Stability Board  on global principles and standards for digital assets and CBDC technologies.

US CBDC

The executive order directs additional efforts to evaluating the risks and benefits of issuing a CBDC, and for US participation and leadership in international CBDC discussions and projects.

Among other things, it orders the Secretary of the Treasury, with other stakeholders, to prepare a report on the future of money and payment systems.

The executive order also directs the Attorney General to lead an assessment of whether legislative change is necessary to issue a CBDC and encourages the Federal Reserve Board to continue its ongoing research into various aspects of a CBDC , including the optimal design for a CBDC and methods of implementation if a CBDC were to be introduced.

The executive order indicates that the Biden administration sees development of a CBDC as potentially important to supporting the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system and protecting the unique role that the [US] dollar plays in global finance.

Comments and outlook The Biden administrations efforts to study and address the potential risks posed by digital assets span a broad range of policy areas, including financial crime and national security, privacy and consumer protection, investor and market protection, and climate and energy policy, among others.

The executive order does not implement any regulatory changes or detail regulatory changes to come."
Cooley,Biden Executive Order on Cryptocurrencies and Other Digital Assets Emphasizes Innovation and Regulation,"The executive order does not implement any regulatory changes or detail regulatory changes to come.

However, the actions that the executive order calls for signal that further regulation of digital assets and industry participants is possible, if not likely.

The executive order also suggests that the Biden administration will continue to make it a priority to take action, through law enforcement and regulatory agencies, in response to violations of existing US law.

(See, for example, these previous Cooley alerts: US Justice Department Appoints First National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Director and OFAC Issues Sanctions Compliance Guidance for Virtual Currency Industry .)

The interagency process established under the executive order indicates that the Biden administration believes effective regulation of digital assets can be accomplished through coordinated action among existing US regulatory agencies.

In this respect, many of the actions ordered or encouraged in the executive order appear intended to reinforce initiatives already underway, such as the interim measures proposed in the report on stablecoins by the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

While overall positive for its approach to understand and address risks in concert, the executive order does not resolve regulatory uncertainty for industry participants where agency jurisdiction remains unclear.

In addition, the executive order is notable for its emphasis on supporting continued innovation, which the executive order suggests may be important to preserving US leadership in the global financial system and US global competitiveness.

The executive orders focus on international cooperation is also important to addressing some of the primary challenges that US regulators have faced with respect to digital assets, including anti-money laundering, sanctions evasion, cybercrime and ransomware.

The actions and statements in the executive order regarding a potential CBDC suggest that the Biden administration is accelerating US efforts to explore a CBDC amid a growing number of initiatives by foreign countries to explore or pilot their own CBDCs.

This is noteworthy because the Federal Reserve has previously stated that it would only pursue issuance of a CBDC with clear support from the executive branch and Congress.

Following the executive order, in the near term we expect: Federal financial regulators will continue to regulate by enforcement, and the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies will continue to prioritize enforcement in the digital assets space.

The Biden administration will increase its focus on US efforts to explore a CBDC.

The reporting required by the executive order may result in additional oversight from the congressional committees of jurisdiction.

The executive order is unlikely to result in significant legislation that can pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law.

Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"On March 9, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it proposed rules that would expressly mandate cybersecurity disclosures by public companies.

The rules would require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as disclosure regarding a companys cybersecurity risk management and strategy, and governance, and board of directors cybersecurity expertise.

In keeping with SEC Chair Gary Genslers oft-repeated refrain of the benefits of consistent, comparable, and decision-useful disclosure, the proposal seeks to provide investors with more uniform and timely disclosure about material cybersecurity incidents and disclosure that is comparable to the disclosure provided by other registrants.

The proposed rules were not without opposition, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce providing a dissenting statement and, among other things, stating that the proposal flirts with casting [the SEC] as the nations cybersecurity command center, a role Congress did not give us.

For more information on Peirces dissent and other commissioner statements, refer to our Cooley PubCo blog post .

The SEC is soliciting comments on the proposed rules.

The comment period will be open until the later of 30 days after the proposing release is published in the Federal Register or May 9, 2022 (60 days from the date that the rules were proposed).

Interested parties can submit comments here .

Background Under the existing public company reporting framework, there are no explicit disclosure requirements relating to cybersecurity matters.

However, there are several disclosure requirements under Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X that may encapsulate cybersecurity matters, such as risk factors, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, description of business, legal proceedings, financial statements, and disclosure controls and procedures.

In 2011, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance published interpretive guidance to provide direction to companies on how cybersecurity risks and incidents should be discussed under the existing disclosure rules, as well as examples of when disclosure may be required.

Recognizing the growth in cybersecurity incidents, the SEC published interpretive guidance in 2018 to reinforce and expand upon the earlier Staff guidance, and to discuss the importance of disclosure controls and procedures in addressing cybersecurity risks and incidents, as well as the application of insider trading prohibitions and Regulation FD in the context of cybersecurity incidents.

For more information on the 2018 interpretive guidance, refer to our March 2018 Cooley alert .

According to the SEC, while cybersecurity disclosures improved following the issuance of the interpretive guidance, the Staff had observed, among other things, that disclosures, in terms of content and timing, were inconsistent.

Accordingly, the SEC has proposed these new rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting by public companies.

Regardless of whether the proposed rules are adopted, the 2011 and 2018 interpretive guidance will remain in place.

Proposed rules Cybersecurity incident reporting Current reports The proposed rules would add new Item 1.05 to Form 8-K, which would require disclosure within four business days after a company has determined that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident, not discovery of such of incident.

While the SEC stated that, in some cases, the date of discovery and the date of the companys materiality determination may be the same date, in other cases, it expects companies to be diligent in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"To that end, it added an instruction to Item 1.05 that would provide that a company shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.

In many circumstances, a company may not be able to make such a determination until after a thorough investigation performed by a forensic firm on the companys systems.

In the proposing release, the SEC made clear that the materiality determination for cybersecurity incidents would remain consistent with existing case law  i.e., information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider this information important in making an investment decision, or if the information would have significantly altered the total mix of information made available.

1

The SEC also noted in the proposing release that a materiality analysis should take into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors surrounding the cybersecurity incident.

In reporting a material cybersecurity incident, a company would be required to disclose, to the extent known at the time of filing:

When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing.

A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident.

Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose.

The effect of the incident on the companys operations.

Whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.

While the SEC did not propose a definition for cybersecurity, 2 it did propose definitions for cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat and information systems, which would apply to disclosures required in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K and Item 106 of Regulation S-K. Cybersecurity incident would be defined as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.

Cybersecurity threat would be defined as any potential occurrence that may result in, an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.  

Information systems would be defined as information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations.

The SEC provided a non-exclusive list of examples of cybersecurity incidents that may, if determined by a company to be material, require disclosure under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K, including: An unauthorized incident  whether stemming from accidental exposure of data or from a deliberate attack to steal or alter data  that has compromised the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information asset (data, system or network), or violated the companys security policies or procedures.

An unauthorized incident that caused degradation, interruption, loss of control, damage to or loss of operational technology systems.

An incident in which an unauthorized party accessed, or a party exceeded authorized access, and altered or has stolen sensitive business information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property, or information that has resulted, or may result, in a loss or liability for the company.

An incident in which a malicious actor has offered to sell or has threatened to publicly disclose sensitive company data.

An incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company data that was stolen or altered."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"An incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company data that was stolen or altered.

In the proposing release, the SEC stated that it would not expect any company to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident.

Importantly, however, proposed Item 1.05 would not allow for a reporting delay when there is an ongoing internal or external investigation related to the cybersecurity incident, or where state laws would allow a company to delay providing public notice about a data breach incident or notifying certain constituencies of such an incident  even if law enforcement determines that notification would impede a civil or criminal investigation.

In addition, disclosure under Item 1.05 on Form 8-K would be required to be filed, rather than furnished, with the SEC, but an untimely filing would not impact a companys eligibility to use registration statements on Form S-3.

A failure to file an Item 1.05 disclosure on Form 8-K would be subject to the limited safe harbor from liability under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b5-1 in Rules 13a-11(c) and 15d-11(c) under of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Periodic reports The proposed rules would add new Item 106(d) to Regulation S-K, which would add material cybersecurity incident disclosure obligations in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. Material updates: Under the proposed rules, companies would be required to disclose in Form 10-Q and Form 10-K any material changes, additions or updates to the information disclosed under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K that had occurred within the applicable reporting period (which is the fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report).

Under this proposed rule, the SEC included the following non-exclusive examples of the types of disclosure that should be provided, if applicable: Any material effect of the incident on the companys operations and financial condition.

Any potential material future impacts on the companys operations and financial condition.

Whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.

Any changes in the companys policies and procedures as a result of the cybersecurity incident, and how the incident may have informed such changes.

Material in the aggregate: Companies also would be required to disclose when a series of individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate.

Accordingly, the SEC stated that companies would need to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality, both individually and in the aggregate.

Under this proposed rule, companies would be required to disclose, to the extent known to management: A general description of when the incidents were discovered and whether they are ongoing.

A brief description of the nature and scope of the incidents.

Whether any data was stolen or altered in connection with the incidents.

The effect of the incidents on the companys operations.

Whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incidents.

Risk management, strategy and governance reporting The proposed rules would add new Items 106(b) and (c) of Regulation S-K, which would require companies to disclose in an annual report on Form 10-K matters related to cybersecurity risk management and strategy, board oversight of cybersecurity risk, and managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk, and implementing the companys cybersecurity policies, procedures and strategies."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"Risk management and strategy With respect to risk management and strategy, companies would be required to describe their policies and procedures, if any, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats, including, but not limited to, operational risk, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers, violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk, and reputational risk.

The proposed rule provides that disclosure should include, as applicable, a discussion of whether: The company has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and, if so, a description of the program.

The company engages assessors, consultants, auditors or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program.

The company has policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with its use of any third-party service provider, including, but not limited to, those providers that have access to the companys customer and employee data.

If so, the company must describe these policies and procedures, including whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of these providers, and contractual and other mechanisms the company uses to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to these providers.

The company undertakes activities to prevent, detect and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents.

If so, the company must provide a description of the types of activities undertaken.

The company has business continuity, contingency and recovery plans in the event of a cybersecurity incident.

Previous cybersecurity incidents informed changes in the companys governance, policies and procedures, or technologies.

Cybersecurity-related risks and previous cybersecurity-related incidents have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the companys strategy, business model, results of operations, or financial condition and, if so, how.

Cybersecurity risks are considered as part of the companys business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation and, if so, how.

Governance Board oversight: Under the proposed rules, companies would be required to describe the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk, including, as applicable: Whether the entire board, specific board members or a board committee is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks.

The processes by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks, and the frequency of its discussions on this topic.

Whether and how the board or board committee considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, risk management and financial oversight.

Managements role: Companies also would be required to describe managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity-related risks, its relevant expertise, and its role in implementing the companys relevant policies, procedures and strategies, including, but not limited to, the following information: Whether certain management positions or committees are responsible for measuring and managing cybersecurity risk  specifically, the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents  and the relevant expertise of such persons or members in such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.

Whether the company has a designated chief information security officer or someone in a comparable position and, if so, to whom that individual reports within the companys organizational chart, and the relevant expertise of any such persons in such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.

The processes by which such persons or committees are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.

Whether and how frequently such persons or committees report to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors on cybersecurity risk."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"Whether and how frequently such persons or committees report to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors on cybersecurity risk.

In determining the relevant expertise of a person for purposes of the governance-related disclosures, the SEC has proposed to add an instruction Item 106(c) that would explain that this may include, for example, prior work experience in cybersecurity, any relevant degrees or certifications, or any knowledge, skills or other background in cybersecurity.

Board of directors cybersecurity expertise In addition to the cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity governance reporting discussed above, the proposed rules would add new paragraph (j) to Item 407 of Regulation S-K, which would require certain disclosures about the cybersecurity expertise (if any) of members of the companys board of directors.

This disclosure would be required in Part III, Item 10 of annual reports on Form 10-K, and pursuant to Item 7(b) of Schedule 14A when action is to be taken with respect to the election of directors in annual meeting proxy statements.

Under the proposed rules, the company would be required to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s) and provide detail as needed to fully describe the nature of the expertise.

In determining whether any director has expertise, the proposed rules provide that the company should consider, among other things: Whether the director has prior work experience in cybersecurity, including, for example, prior experience as an information security officer, security policy analyst, security auditor, security architect or engineer, security operations or incident response manager, or business continuity planner.

Whether the director has obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity.

Whether the director has knowledge, skills or other background in cybersecurity, including, for example, in the areas of security policy and governance, risk management, security assessment, control evaluation, security architecture and engineering, security operations, incident handling, or business continuity planning.

Similar to audit committee financial experts, directors designated as having cybersecurity expertise would be subject to a safe harbor pursuant to which they would not be deemed an expert for any purpose, including, without limitation, Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, nor would designating this person as having cybersecurity expertise impose any duties, obligations or liability greater than such as are imposed on that individual as a member of the board of directors, absent that designation.

Structured data Under the proposed rules, companies would be required to tag information specified in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S-K in Inline XBRL format, using block text tagging for narrative disclosures, and detail tagging for any quantitative amounts disclosed within the narrative disclosures.

(There are no explicit quantitative disclosure requirements in the proposed rules, but companies may nonetheless disclose quantitative amounts.)

Foreign private issuers The proposed rules would apply similarly to foreign private issuers, subject to certain differences as a result of different reporting requirements.

FPIs are not required to file current reports on Form 8-K; however, the SEC has proposed adding cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic under Form 6-K that may trigger the filing of a Form 6-K. In addition, the SEC has proposed adding new Item 16J to annual reports on Form 20-F, which would require cybersecurity disclosures that are consistent with the requirements in Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S-K discussed above, but did not propose to make these disclosures applicable to Form 40-F filings.

Observations and commentary Review existing cybersecurity-related policies and procedures."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"Observations and commentary Review existing cybersecurity-related policies and procedures.

Notwithstanding this early stage of rulemaking  and given the increased congressional and regulatory focus on cybersecurity matters  companies would be wise to get a head start on reviewing their existing cybersecurity-related policies, procedures, controls, and incident response measures in light of the proposed rules and each companys own threat environment.

The SEC is proposing a sweeping disclose-what-you-do framework that would require companies to disclose their cybersecurity policies and procedures.

With the increased scrutiny this disclosure may draw from the SEC and investors, public companies and companies looking to go public in the near term should assess or reassess, as the case may be, their policies and procedures relating to cybersecurity.

Companies that do not have cybersecurity policies and procedures may want to consider the impact of this new proposed reporting framework, and whether to work toward designing and implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures.

Companies that have cybersecurity policies and procedures may want to think about how they would disclose and describe these policies and procedures, and whether any updates to these policies and procedures may be desirable in response to any of the features highlighted in the proposed rules, such as oversight of cybersecurity risks relating to third-party service providers.

Review existing governance structure and risk management framework in relation to cybersecurity matters.

Companies may also want to review their current governance structure and risk management framework in relation to cybersecurity matters in light of their own threat environment.

This review may include assessing whether any updates may be desirable in relation to cybersecurity oversight at the board or committee level, and in relation to managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.

In addition, companies may elect to implement additional policies and procedures (1) to ensure that cybersecurity is receiving sufficient attention, including ensuring timely communications are made on material cybersecurity matters, and that adequate time is dedicated to such discussions at the board or committee level, and (2) that address the areas highlighted in the proposed rules, such as frequency of discussions at the board or committee level, and information related to management expertise and reporting structures.

For companies where cybersecurity matters are mission-critical risks, the company should consider tailoring its governance structure and risk management framework to appropriately reflect the heightened importance that is placed on these matters from a board oversight and fiduciary duties perspective.

Review existing disclosures and board expertise.

Companies may also want to review their existing disclosures relating to the boards role in risk oversight as required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S-K, as well as any board skills matrices or disclosures relating to board expertise or knowledge relating to cybersecurity matters.

If the rules are adopted as proposed, companies will want to ensure that any director who has previously been identified in a board skills matrix or otherwise as having cybersecurity knowledge is sufficiently qualified to be named as having cybersecurity expertise under the new rules.

As part of this review  and if the rules are adopted as proposed  companies could consider adding questions to their D&O questionnaires that are similar to the questions regarding the qualification of audit committee financial experts.

Companies that do not have cybersecurity expertise on their board or do not have cybersecurity expertise that would qualify under the proposed rules may feel pressure to prioritize this expertise in searches for new director candidates."
Cooley,SEC Proposes Sweeping Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework,"Consequently, director candidates with cybersecurity expertise may find themselves in higher demand.

Assess disclosure controls and procedures as they relate to cybersecurity incidents and disclosure.

While the 2018 interpretive guidance encouraged companies to assess the sufficiency of their disclosure controls and procedures as they relate to cybersecurity disclosure, companies may want to review their existing disclosure controls and policies with a view toward the proposed rules that would require mandatory reporting for material (whether individually or in the aggregate) cybersecurity incidents to ensure that the appropriate channels are in place so relevant information about cybersecurity incidents is processed and reported to appropriate personnel to make disclosure decisions.

Be prepared to regularly review and update cybersecurity incident disclosures.

Under the proposed rules, if a company were to determine that a cybersecurity incident is material as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident  and therefore trigger a disclosure obligation under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K  the company would need to be prepared to disclose any material changes, additions, or updates to the information disclosed previously on the Form 8-K in its periodic and annual reports.

In addition, the SEC has stated that there may be situations where a registrant would need to file an amended Form 8-K to correct disclosure from the initial Item 1.05 Form 8-K, such as where that disclosure becomes inaccurate or materially misleading as a result of subsequent developments regarding the incident.

Practically speaking, given the complexity and duration of cybersecurity incident investigations, it might take weeks or months for a company to understand the full scope and impact of such an incident.

As additional material facts come to light during such an investigation, companies should be prepared to regularly review and, depending on the circumstances, update existing cybersecurity incident disclosures  even before the next periodic or annual report  to avoid having outdated information in the public domain.

In its request for comment, the SEC inquired whether defining cybersecurity would be helpful, and stated that it could define the term as any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any cybersecurity threat or any potential cybersecurity threat."
Cooley,EU Proposes New Rules on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence,"On February 23, 2022, the European Commission published its long-awaited proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence and annex , with an aim to  foster sustainable and responsible corporate behaviour throughout global value chains .

If adopted, the directive will require certain companies to conduct due diligence on their own operations, as well as those of their subsidiaries and commercial partners.

Because of the extensive scope of the obligations proposed, the draft text is seen as a milestone in policymakers attempts to regulate businesses impact on human rights and the environment.

Specifically, companies will need to: Maintain corporate policies on due diligence.

Conduct due diligence.

Take steps to prevent adverse impacts on human rights and the environment.

Establish a complaints procedure.

Report on due diligence.

The idea is that this due diligence will help to identify and prevent adverse human rights and environmental impacts, with various EU member state supervisory authorities being able to investigate and impose sanctions on companies failing to comply.

Below, Cooleys international products and public international law specialists examine the proposal and its practical implications for product manufacturers and their directors.

Background Regulators and companies are becoming increasingly interested in environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues, including in the products sphere.

(For more information, refer to our January 2022 and March 2022 Productwise blog posts.)

Against this backdrop, the European Commission began consulting on a sustainable corporate governance initiative in October 2020.

There were also calls from the EU member states and the European Parliament for EU legislation on mandatory  cross-sector corporate due diligence along global value chains .

Separately, various countries across Europe have introduced or are considering their own national legislation on due diligence in the areas of sustainability and human rights.

If adopted, the new EU proposal will use a harmonized approach, which is likely to be easier for businesses to manage, given the global nature of most large companies operations across Europe.

Who would the new rules apply to?

The new rules would apply to EU and non-EU companies of a certain size, including product manufacturers.

In particular, the directive would apply to: EU companies with more than 500 employees and global revenue of more than 150 million euros.

1 EU companies with more than 250 employees and global revenue of more than 40 million euros, and which generate more than half of their revenue in certain high-impact sectors, namely textiles, agriculture and resource extraction.

Non-EU companies with EU revenue of more than 150 million euros.

2 Non-EU companies with EU revenue of between 40 and 150 million euros, and which generate more than half of their revenue in one or more of the high-impact sectors.

3

What are the key requirements being proposed?

The key obligations on companies are: Maintaining corporate policies on due diligence (Article 5): Any company in scope must have in place a due diligence policy that sets out its approach and processes with respect to identifying any harmful human rights or environmental practices (known as adverse impacts) in its value chain, as well as a code of conduct it will follow when conducting such due diligence.

Conducting due diligence and monitoring (Articles 6 and 10): Companies must continuously monitor actual or potential adverse impacts arising from their own operations, or the operations of their subsidiaries or any companies with whom they have an established business relationship.

Preventing adverse impacts (Articles 7 and 8):

Companies must take steps to prevent or mitigate any potential adverse environmental or human rights impacts and end or minimize the extent of any actual adverse impacts."
Cooley,EU Proposes New Rules on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence,"Companies must take steps to prevent or mitigate any potential adverse environmental or human rights impacts and end or minimize the extent of any actual adverse impacts.

This could involve seeking contractual assurances from a business partner.

Establishing complaints procedures (Article 9): The proposal requires companies to establish and maintain effective procedures by which any third parties can submit complaints to the company regarding adverse supply-chain impacts.

Reporting on due diligence (Article 11): Companies must publish an annual statement on their website (to the extent they are not already required to do so via their annual reports) on the due diligence matters covered by the proposed directive.

Which adverse impacts would companies need to identify and prevent?

Rather than specifying the adverse impacts by way of new definitions or criteria, the European Commission has taken the approach of referring to various instruments of international law.

For example, one adverse human rights impact listed in the annex to the directive is any violation of the prohibition of arbitrary or unlawful interference with a persons privacy, family, home or correspondence and attacks on their reputation, in accordance with Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

4

In practice, this means companies will need to train the executives in charge of their supply chains to understand and verify compliance with the various human rights and environmental treaties and instruments listed in the annex to the directive.

Consequences of non-compliance Under the proposal, national regulators will be empowered to investigate companies suspected of non-compliance, issue orders requiring a company in breach to take remedial action and impose fines.

5 Member states also will be required to establish civil liability regimes  if they do not already exist  whereby companies could be liable for damages if their failure to comply results in harm to individuals.

6 Provisions affecting company directors Directors of companies in scope of the directive would be responsible for putting in place and overseeing the due diligence obligations set out above, particularly with respect to corporate policies on due diligence.

7 Directors of EU companies in scope also would need to take into account the consequences their decisions might have on sustainability matters, including with respect to human rights and the environment.

8

Next steps The proposed directive has now passed to the European Parliament and the European Council for their review.

They could adopt the proposal in full or (more likely) suggest amendments before adopting.

However, there are reportedly large areas of disagreement among the institutions, as well as indications that a final text might not be agreed upon during the current European Parliament and European Commission presidencies, which will both change in 2024.

Once the directive is adopted, EU member states would have two years to transpose it into their national law.

We will be closely following this development and how it might impact our clients businesses.

Annex, Part I, paragraph 5 Articles 18 and 19 Article 22 Article 26 Article 25"
Cooley,"Is DOJ Looking to Bring Criminal Charges Under Sherman Act’s Section 2? ‘Yes, Absolutely’","On March 2, 2022, Richard Powers, the deputy assistant attorney general of the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice, said that the division is prepared  for the first time in decades  to bring criminal charges under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits monopolists or attempted monopolists from engaging in certain exclusionary conduct.

Speaking on a panel at the American Bar Associations National Institute on White Collar Crime, Powers was asked whether the DOJ was committed to prosecuting monopolization cases, and whether this meant the Antitrust Division was prepared to bring criminal charges under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

Powers responded that he was not making any announcements, but that the short answer was yes, absolutely.

Powers further explained that Congress made violations of the Sherman Act, both Section 1 and Section 2, a crime and Section 2 is a felony just like Section 1, and thats been true since the 1970s.

He said that Section 2 charges were historically brought alongside Section 1 charges, when companies and executives committed flagrant offenses intended to monopolize markets.

Powers further stressed that [m]arket concentration and consolidation is not only a civil antitrust issue; consolidated industries tend to harbor price-fixing conspiracies and other forms of collusion or anticompetitive conduct.

Powers comments came after Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanters January 2022 remarks in which he expressed concerns about a dearth of Section 2 case law addressing modern markets.

Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it a felony punishable by up to ten years of imprisonment for any person to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations  .

But even though attempts to monopolize commerce are a felony under the statute, the DOJ has not brought criminal charges against companies or individuals under Section 2 for decades.

What to know Undoubtedly, Powers comments came as a surprise  not only because the DOJ has not criminally prosecuted Section 2 violations in more than 40 years, but because Powers did not provide concrete guidance as to how the Antitrust Division intends to implement this significant policy shift.

Without further guidance, it is difficult for companies to understand what they should be doing to avoid DOJ scrutiny and how to best stay clear of potential criminal exposure.

Powers noted that criminal prosecutions would be directed to those who have committed the most obvious and flagrant offenses intended to monopolize the market.

But it is unclear how this new approach will work in practice.

Being a monopolist is not, in and of itself, unlawful under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

That is because sometimes monopolists or attempted monopolists have gained market power through better products or services, not through illegal means.

In an attempt to not penalize companies who have succeeded on their merits, or suppress modernization, the antitrust laws are designed to only punish actors who are gaining monopoly power in an exclusionary way that harms competition.

An analysis of what is exclusionary conduct thats actionable under Section 2 requires an intensive market and economic analysis under the rule of reason  which provides that antitrust law needs to be applied only to the unreasonable restraints of trade  and can be complicated in the new economy, particularly for tech and pharma companies.

To criminally prosecute some of these actors may result in overcorrection and a stifling of innovation.

In addition, Powers hinted that criminal Section 2 prosecutions could accompany charges under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as consolidated industries tend to harbor price-fixing conspiracies and other forms of collusion or anticompetitive conduct."
Cooley,"Is DOJ Looking to Bring Criminal Charges Under Sherman Act’s Section 2? ‘Yes, Absolutely’","However, the Antitrust Division already has the ability to criminally prosecute Section 1 agreements, so it is unclear why the DOJ needs this additional tool in its arsenal.

The Antitrust Division declared a similarly drastic policy shift in 2016, announcing that it would be criminally prosecuting certain labor agreements, such as naked no poach or wage-fixing arrangements, which had previously been treated civilly.

In that instance, the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission issued a joint publication titled  Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals , which provided guidance on the types of conduct that may be a criminal violation .

In the future, the Antitrust Division may issue more concrete guidance on the criminalization of Section 2.

A significant policy shift In the meantime, companies should be on notice that criminal charges under Section 2 may be on the horizon.

This is a significant policy shift and an aggressive expansion of the DOJs antitrust enforcement efforts, but it very much reflects the Biden administrations strong emphasis on antitrust enforcement.

Last year, in enacting a sweeping executive order focused on antitrust reform , President Joe Biden said, [w]e are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and what have we gotten from it?

Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses.  

I believe the experiment failed.

As a result, as a first step, we encourage clients to invest in their antitrust compliance programs.

The Antitrust Division has made clear that in evaluating charging decisions in criminal antitrust investigations, it will evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of a companys pre-existing antitrust compliance program.

This may prove critical in the face of criminal Section 2 charges."
Cooley,HM Treasury Publishes UK Prospectus Regime Review Outcome,"Background On 1 July 2021, HM Treasury published a consultation on the UK prospectus regime (the UK Prospectus Regime Review).

In the UK Prospectus Regime Review, the UK government considered that there was a significant opportunity to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation (being  the EU Prospectus Regulation that became part of national law on expiration of the Brexit transition period).

HM Treasury sought views on a number of matters, including the: Separation of the regulation of the public offer of securities from the regulation of admissions of securities to trading.

Delegation to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of powers relating to admissions of securities to regulated markets.

Scope of the UKs public offering rules, including the definition of the public, the 150-person threshold, the qualified investor exemption, and the exemption for employees, former employees, directors and ex-directors.

Standard of liability for forward-looking information.

Making of public offers by private companies (defined as companies with securities that are not admitted to any type of stock market), including alternatives to the requirement that an offeror publish a prospectus.

Making of public offers into the UK by overseas companies.

The UK Prospectus Regime Review acknowledged that prospectuses are, and will remain, an important component of the regulation of UK regulated markets  and that there is a commitment to ensuring they are clear, relevant and reliable.

The four key objectives of the UK Prospectus Regime Review were: Facilitate wider participation in the ownership of public companies and to remove the disincentives that currently exist for the issuance of securities to wide groups of investors, including retail investors.

Simplify the regulation of prospectuses and remove unnecessary duplications.

Improve the quality of information that investors receive.

Make the regulation of prospectuses more agile and dynamic, so theyre capable of being quickly adapted and updated as times change.

UK Prospectus Regime Review outcome HM Treasury published the outcome of the UK Prospectus Regime Review on 1 March 2022.

As proposed in the UK Prospectus Regime Review, the UK government will replace the regime currently contained in the UK Prospectus Regulation and legislate to do so when parliamentary time allows.

The aim of these changes is to simplify regulation in this area and make it more agile and effective, as well as facilitate wider participation in the ownership of public companies and improve the quality of information investors receive.

These changes will separate the regulation of public offers of securities from the regulation of admissions of securities to trading.

In addition, the UK government will delegate a greater degree of responsibility to the FCA to set out the detail of the new regime through rules.

HM Treasurys approach to the reform of the UK prospectus regime is outlined below.

Admissions to trading on regulated markets The published outcome concludes that the FCA will be given enhanced rule-making responsibilities to specify if and when a prospectus is required for admissions to trading on regulated markets, including for further issues by listed issuers.

In addition, the UK government will remove the criminal offence which prohibits requesting admission to trading on a UK regulated market without an FCA-approved prospectus.

The FCA will also be able to determine whether an overseas prospectus can be used.

Its rulemaking responsibilities will cover other matters currently set out in the UK Prospectus Regulation, including prospectus contents, whether a prospectus must be reviewed and approved by it prior to publication, and the manner and timing of publication.

New architecture for public offerings of securities in the UK While the FCA will be able to require a prospectus for admissions to trading on regulated markets, prospectuses will not be a feature of the public offerings regime."
Cooley,HM Treasury Publishes UK Prospectus Regime Review Outcome,"Instead, the new system will have a general prohibition on public offerings of securities against which there will be exemptions.

The exemptions will derive from the existing exemptions in the UK Prospectus Regulation and will include the qualified investors and 150 persons exemptions, and an exemption for director/employee offers.

However, the list of exemptions will be expanded to cover: Offers of securities which are, or will be, admitted to UK regulated markets.

Offers of securities to those who already hold equity securities in the offering company, subject to certain conditions, including that the offer is made pro-rata to the existing holding.

This exemption will not apply to securities of another company offered as consideration (for example, in a merger or acquisition); the existing exemptions for these offers in the UK Prospectus Regulation will be retained and amended.

Offers of securities which are, or will be, admitted to trading on certain multilateral trading facilities (MTFs).

Other categories of offer described in the Junior markets, Private companies and Public offerings from overseas sections below.

All exempted offers will continue to be subject to an equality of information requirement.

Thresholds stated in euros will be restated into sterling at a rate of one for one, except that the current 100,000 threshold in the Article 1(4)(d) exemption for offers of wholesale non-equity securities will be changed to 50,000.

Necessary information test The published outcome confirms that the UK government intends to retain a single statutory necessary information test as a basic standard of preparation for a prospectus, with three key alterations: Denomination will not be included as a factor which would permit differing disclosure for non-equity securities.

(The test currently differentiates between non-equity securities in denominations over and under 100,000).

There will be clarification that necessary information may vary according to whether an offer of securities relates to a first-time admission to a market or is a secondary issuance.

A modified necessary information test, which focuses on the issuer or guarantors creditworthiness, rather than prospects, will apply to debt securities.

As is the case now, under the new regime, investors who can show they have sustained losses as a result of false or misleading information in, or the omission of information from, a prospectus will be able to seek compensation through the courts.

Facilitating forward-looking information While retaining the existing statutory remedy for false, misleading or omitted information, the UK government intends to raise the threshold for liability that applies to certain categories of forward-looking information in prospectuses.

This will ensure that a person responsible for the preparation of a prospectus is liable to pay compensation only if one of the following applies: That person knew the statement to be untrue or misleading.

That person was reckless as to whether it was untrue or misleading.

In the case of an omission, that person knew the omission to be a dishonest concealment of a material fact.

The UK government intends to ensure that these disclosures are clearly labelled as forward-looking information to which that threshold applies, and that the FCA will be given responsibility for specifying the categories of forward-looking information to which the new liability threshold will or will not apply.

Junior markets Offers of securities which are or will be admitted to trading on certain MTFs, such as the AIM market operated by the London Stock Exchange, will be exempt from the new general prohibition on public offers of securities.

In addition, admission documents published in accordance with the rules of the relevant MTFs will be treated as a type of prospectus.

The operators of MTFs will continue to establish admission criteria and rules for the facilities they run, subject to FCA rules and oversight."
Cooley,HM Treasury Publishes UK Prospectus Regime Review Outcome,"The operators of MTFs will continue to establish admission criteria and rules for the facilities they run, subject to FCA rules and oversight.

Scope of new public offerings regime The existing obligations under the UK Prospectus Regulation apply to offers of transferable securities  and this will continue to be the case under the new public offerings regime.

Certain offerings of securities will continue to be entirely out of scope of the new public offerings regime.

In April 2021, the UK government consulted on the regulation of non-transferable debt securities and presented three options, one of which was to bring those securities within the scope of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The governments preferred option is to include non-transferable securities within the scope of the new public offerings regime.

Private companies Companies will remain able to offer securities to the public without admitting them to a stock market.

The current requirement for an FCA-approved prospectus for offers over 8 million will be removed, and securities will be allowed to be offered to the public provided the offer is made through a platform operated by a firm specifically authorised for the purpose.

In connection with this, the UK government intends to create a new regulated activity covering the operation of an electronic platform for the public offering of securities, such as an equity crowdfunding platform.

The requirements applicable to such platforms will be set by the FCA.

The threshold below which offers of securities from private companies are exempt from the prohibition on public offers  but still will be subject to the equality of information requirement  is being considered by the UK government.

Overseas private companies will not be excluded from offering securities to the UK public, subject to UK regulation.

Public offers from overseas The UK government intends to develop a new regime of regulatory deference for offers into the UK of securities listed on certain designated overseas stock markets.

This will permit offerings to be extended into the UK on the basis of offering documents prepared according to the rules of the relevant overseas jurisdiction and market.

The FCA will have power to intervene to protect UK investors in exceptional circumstances.

Next steps The UK government will legislate to make the necessary changes to the prospectus regime when parliamentary time allows, and the FCA will need to consult on the new rules under its expanded responsibilities."
Cooley,War and Office of Foreign Assets Control Exclusions: Insurance Policy Language Matters,"Nearly two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, numerous companies are focused on how the war might impact their business, including their insurance coverage.

This advisory provides a high-level overview of two types of insurance exclusions that may be implicated: war exclusions and OFAC exclusions.

War exclusions In numerous insurance policies over the past century, war exclusions have become a standard coverage term that often goes unnoticed.

With a hardened insurance market and in the face of novel risks in the modern world, the industry has reassessed legacy language to add expanded war exclusions in insurance policies.

For example, at the end of 2021, the Lloyds Market Association released four model clauses to specifically exclude coverage for cyber war from cyber insurance policies.

However, consideration of the definition of war certainly doesnt stop with cyber insurance.

What is meant by war has been the subject of case law and interpretation for decades in both insurance and non-insurance contexts.

The seminal decision in the insurance context is Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co.

, 505 F.2d 989 (2d Cir. 1974), which rejected the application of a war exclusion to a terrorist groups hijacking and destruction of a plane.

Referring to existing precedent, as well as international law, the court held that war is a course of hostility engaged in by entities that have at least significant attributes of sovereignty.

Indeed, cases dealing with the insurance meaning of war have defined it in accordance with the ancient international law definition  that is, war refers to and includes only hostilities carried on by entities that constitute governments at least de facto in character.

Various subsequent authorities rely on Pan American sdefinition of war, including recently the Ninth Circuits decision in Universal Cable Productions, LLC v. Atlantic Specialty Ins.

Co. , 929 F.3d 1143, 1147, 1155 (9th Cir. 2019)

(war has a specialized meaning in the insurance context, requiring hostilities between de jure or de facto sovereigns and employment of force between governments or entities essentially like governments, with war being the method by which a nation prosecutes its right by force).

But certain war exclusions reach events broader than formally declared, all-out war per se, including those issued by the Insurance Services Office, which drafts policy forms for the insurance industry that provide that the insurer will not pay for loss or damage caused directly orindirectly by War And Military Action, including undeclared wars and [w]arlike action by a military force (ISO Form CP10201012, B.1.f.).

The issue for insureds is the risk that insurers invoke a war exclusion  some of which may incorporate vague concepts such as hostile or warlike action or warlike operations  to reserve rights on or deny coverage for an otherwise meritorious claim.

OFAC exclusions In addition to war exclusions, many policies, including directors and officers (D&O) insurance policies, have Office of Foreign Assets Control exclusions.

The US Department of the Treasury has issued strict guidelines for insurance companies when it comes to coverage, including having insurers add an explicit exclusion for risks that would violate U.S. sanctions law.

For example, the following standard exclusion clause is often used in open marine cargo policies to avoid OFAC compliance problems: whenever coverage provided by this policy would be in violation of any U.S. economic or trade sanctions, such coverage shall be null and void.

The legal effect of this exclusion is to prevent the extension of a prohibited service (insurance or risk assumption) to sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.

Like war exclusions, not all OFAC exclusions are created equal.

Although the sample exclusion above is somewhat narrow, some OFAC exclusions are broader, arguably reaching beyond the scope of the sanctions issued."
Cooley,War and Office of Foreign Assets Control Exclusions: Insurance Policy Language Matters,"Although the sample exclusion above is somewhat narrow, some OFAC exclusions are broader, arguably reaching beyond the scope of the sanctions issued.

The issue is that, in some cases, a carrier may invoke these exclusions to negate coverage, despite a policyholders expectations for coverage in a given scenario.

So, what should companies do?

Check your policy language to better understand where there might be gaps in coverage.

If the exclusions are overly broad, think about what your exposures might be  and potentially assess whether the exclusions can be narrowed or clarified at renewal.

In some cases, companies we have spoken to are already making decisions to alter or limit certain parts of their business, not because they will be in violation of OFAC regulations, but because the exclusions that they have are so broad, they are at risk of insurers denying (possibly unjustifiably) coverage when a loss occurs.

And that risk is too great."
Cooley,"Evolving US, UK and EU Sanctions and Export Controls Target Russia for Ukraine Invasion","In response to Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, with support from its allies including the United Kingdom and the European Union, has imposed a complex mix of financial sanctions and export control restrictions aimed at Russia and Belarus.

These measures include expanded territorial embargoes; blocking sanctions on banks, financial institutions, government leaders, and other entities and high-wealth individuals; correspondent banking restrictions; sovereign debt restrictions; and expansive export controls.

As events continue to unfold, further actions are anticipated.

These measures affect companies with operations or business in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, as well as companies that have taken or plan to take investment from these jurisdictions.

The complexity of the measures assumes that companies have basic risk-appropriate sanctions and export compliance frameworks in place, including processes to: Classify products, software and technology (including foreign-produced items) for export control purposes.

Screen customers, contractual counterparties and other third parties against applicable restricted party lists.

Block access to products and services by parties located in embargoed jurisdictions (e.g., via geo-IP restrictions).

Obtain specific licenses or confirm the availability of other regulatory authorizations, such as license exceptions or general licenses.

Incorporate compliance provisions in customer and third-party contracts.

Conduct diligence regarding investors, including actual and beneficial owners of investing entities.

Close monitoring of regulatory responses to rapidly evolving geopolitical events is critical to ensure compliance.

Overview of US measures targeting Russia The recent US regulatory measures in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine comprise an aggressive and complex blend of financial sanctions and export control restrictions.

These measures are summarized below.

US financial sanctions The US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed the following financial sanctions aimed at Russia, Belarus and two self-proclaimed independent regions of Ukraine: Comprehensive embargoes on the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics (the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine): OFAC comprehensively sanctioned the DNR and LNR regions, similar to the territorial sanctions imposed on Crimea in 2014.

As a result, US persons are prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in any activities with persons or entities that are located, organized or resident in these regions.

OFAC is permitting certain wind-down activities until March 23, 2022, and is authorizing, with limitations and strict conditions, certain humanitarian, telecommunications , internet communications and personal remittance transactions.

As a practical matter, however, the DNR and LNR regions should be fully off-limits to commercial activity by US persons and companies, and transactions involving US dollars.

Blocking (i.e., asset freezes) and other sanctions on designated persons and entities: OFAC has added dozens of entities and individuals (persons) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List in the past week, including prominent Russian banks, government officials, oligarchs, high-wealth individuals, persons with ties to the Russian government or Russian aggression in Ukraine and the Belarusian military.

Importantly, pursuant to OFACs 50 Percent Rule, entities that are owned 50% or more, individually or in the aggregate, by one or more blocked parties are also treated as blocked, despite not being affirmatively designated.

Notable designations include Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, two state-owned financial institutions, and several Russian financial institutions, including VTB Bank, Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank."
Cooley,"Evolving US, UK and EU Sanctions and Export Controls Target Russia for Ukraine Invasion","Non-blocking financial prohibitions and restrictions: OFAC also issued four new directives that stop short of full blocking, but nonetheless prohibit or restrict dealings with targeted parties.

These measures: Impose new restrictions on dealings in Russias sovereign debt ( Directive 1A ).

Prohibit US persons from opening or maintaining correspondent or pay-through accounts for or on behalf of sanctioned parties, or processing transactions involving such parties ( Directive 2 ).

Expand the list of parties with whom US persons are prohibited from dealing in new debt of longer than 14 days maturity ( Directive 3 ).

Prohibit US persons from engaging in transactions involving the Russian Central Bank, National Wealth Fund or Ministry of Finance ( Directive 4 ).

Concurrent with these measures, OFAC issued several general licenses permitting limited categories of activities, including certain wind-down activities, humanitarian transactions, activities of specified international organizations and certain energy-related transactions.

In addition to the above, the US government announced that it may, in coordination with allies, remove certain Russian banks from the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) messaging system.

Such sanctions would effectively disconnect these Russian banks from the international financial system.

On March 2, the EU announced that as part of this allied, coordinated effort, seven Russian banks would be removed: VTB Bank, Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank and VEB.RF.

US export control measures In addition to OFACs hard-hitting financial sanctions, the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) significantly expanded controls applicable to Russia and Belarus.

Notably, these restrictions increase the scope of hardware, commodities, software and technology (collectively referred to as items below) subject to the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that require a license to be exported, reexported or transferred in country (each referred to as an export) to Russia and Belarus.

These measures also extend the reach of US export control regulations to certain foreign-produced items that are the direct product of US-origin software or technology and known to be destined for Russia or Belarus.

These measures are complex and nuanced  and appear primarily aimed at dramatically inhibiting both nations ability to procure a wide range of critical items originating in the US or otherwise dependent on US-indigenous technology.

Specifically, these measures: Prohibit exports of items to the DPR and LPR regions: Complementing OFACs territorial embargo, these restrictions effectively preclude the DPR and LPR regions of Ukraine from receiving any items subject to the EAR (subject to certain very limited exceptions, such as in the humanitarian aid context).

Impose new country-based export licensing requirements: The new measures significantly expand the scope of items subject to license requirements for exports to Russia and Belarus.

Items that will now require a license include microelectronics, telecommunications items, certain software, certain encryption items, sensors, optics, navigation equipment, avionics, marine equipment and aircraft components, among many others.

Further, BIS significantly reduced or, in some cases, fully eliminated certain license exceptions, requiring exporters who previously relied on them to apply for licenses for future exports.

These actions affect commonly relied upon license exceptions, including License Exception ENC.

License applications will be reviewed, with few exceptions, under a policy of denial, meaning that BIS is generally unlikely to issue licenses.

Expand controls on military end users and end uses: The scope of items restricted from export to Russian or Belarusian military end users and end uses (MEUs) has been significantly expanded."
Cooley,"Evolving US, UK and EU Sanctions and Export Controls Target Russia for Ukraine Invasion","Expand controls on military end users and end uses: The scope of items restricted from export to Russian or Belarusian military end users and end uses (MEUs) has been significantly expanded.

Although some such restrictions were previously in effect, a license is now required for all items subject to the EAR , with narrow exceptions for food and medicine.

Add Entity List designations: BIS added 49 Russian entities to the Entity List (47 Russian entities previously designated on the MEU List were transferred to the Entity List, and two new Russian MEUs were added).

BIS also added two Belarusian MEUs to the Entity List.

A license is required for all exports of EAR-regulated items to these Entity List parties, including items designated EAR99.

Extend licensing jurisdiction to foreign-produced items intended for Russia or Belarus:

The new measures extend the reach of the EAR to control a larger scope of items produced outside the United States (i.e., foreign-produced items).

Specifically, the expanded license requirements for exports to Russia or Belarus will result in potentially more controlled US content in foreign-produced items, thereby increasing the likelihood that such items will be subject to EAR jurisdiction under the EARs de minimis test .

In addition, foreign-produced items that are the direct product of certain US-origin software or technology, or that are produced by a plant or major component of a plant that is the direct product of such software or technology, are now subject to the EAR, unless such items are minimally controlled (i.e., foreign-produced items that would be designated as EAR99) and destined for commercial end users.

Controlled foreign-produced items will require an export license when the exporter knows that such items are destined for Russia or Belarus  or will be incorporated into or used in the production or development of an item produced in or destined for either of those countries.

Compliance with these new restrictions on foreign-produced items will require complex, case-by-case analyses.

Overview of EU and UK sanctions against Russia The UK and the EU generally coordinated with the US in their responses to Russias invasion of Ukraine, with some key distinctions.

EU and UK financial sanctionsThe EU and the UK similarly imposed financial sanctions on Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions.

In addition to the SWIFT removals summarized above, these measures include: Asset freezes on Russian persons and entities: The EU imposed asset freezes on hundreds of entities and individuals determined by the EU to have undermined the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

The list of sanctioned entities includes three significant Russian banks  Bank Rossiya, Promsvyazbank and VEB.RF.

For transactions originating prior to the designation date, certain wind-down activities are permitted until August 24, 2022.

Further designations are expected in the near term.

Additionally, the EU has sanctioned 22 high-ranked members of Belarusian military personnel for their support to the Russian forces in the invasion of Ukraine.

The UKs asset freezes, administered by the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation, are more limited, but similarly target Putin and his inner circle, as well as prominent Russian financial institutions, including VTB Bank, Bank Rossiya, Sberbank, IS Bank, Genbank, and Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction.

Like the EU, the UK is permitting certain limited wind-down activities and is expected to issue additional asset freezes in the coming days.

The UK has also listed Belarusian entities and persons associated with providing support to Russia.

Restrictions on access to capital and financial markets: These measures restrict Russian companies and banks from dealings in transferable securities and money-market instruments within the EU and UK."
Cooley,"Evolving US, UK and EU Sanctions and Export Controls Target Russia for Ukraine Invasion","Restrictions on access to capital and financial markets: These measures restrict Russian companies and banks from dealings in transferable securities and money-market instruments within the EU and UK.

In the EU, certain exceptions apply for emergency loans to EU entities owned by designated persons.

Restrictions on loans and transactions with Russian governmental agencies: These measures prohibit transactions with the Russian government, the Russian Central Bank and the Russian Wealth Fund.

Restrictions on investment in the DNR and LNR regions: These measures prohibit EU and UK companies from investing in these regions.

Acquiring real estate or shares of companies are among the prohibited transactions.

Prohibition on broadcast for Russia Today and Sputnik in the EU: The EU suspended the broadcasting of Russian state-owned media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik in the EU territory.

This regulation also prohibits other platforms  including internet-based platforms  from hosting content produced by these media companies or rebroadcasting their programs.

EU and UK export and trade-related sanctions Like the United States, the EU and the UK adopted export and trade-related measures that include: Prohibitions on exports of dual-use controlled goods: Exports of dual-use goods from the EU or the UK to any person or entity in Russia or for use in Russia are now prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, including use by non-Russian MEUs or for limited authorized purposes such as humanitarian and medical-related activities, software updates, certain consumer IT devices, or personal use.

Export bans: The EU and the UK have banned unlicensed exports to Russia and Belarus of high-tech products that could be used in the military or defense sectors (an authorization can be requested); goods to be used in oil refining; and certain aviation goods.

Additionally, in connection to Belarus, the EU has restricted the trade of products used for the production or manufacturing of tobacco products, mineral fuels, bituminous substances and gaseous hydrocarbon products, potassium chloride (potash) products, wood products, cement products, iron and steel products, and rubber products.

Import bans: The EU and the UK have banned imports of all goods originating from the DNR and LNR regions.

Compliance essentials The scope and complexity of these new measures underscore the importance of establishing or shoring up a risk-appropriate compliance program.

The following elements are critical to identifying and preventing unauthorized transactions.

Compliance considerations for financial transactions and investments Conduct diligence on existing and prospective investors: Existing and prospective investors with a known or potential Russia nexus should be screened and undergo appropriate diligence (e.g., with respect to actual or beneficial ownership and control) to ensure that they are not subject to sanctions.

As screening alone is insufficient to identify all such risks, obtaining representations that investors are not subject to sanctions through ownership or control would be prudent and further protective.

Assess governance rights of existing investors: Given the fluid situation and the potential for additional Russian persons and entities to be sanctioned with no notice and immediate effect, companies should consider proactively reviewing investment agreements with existing Russian investors to assess their governance rights.

If a Russian investor is sanctioned and unable to provide consent or exercise rights, company governance may become difficult or impossible; accordingly, consideration should be given to proactively amending the critical consent requirements or other governance rights of Russian investors at risk of being sanctioned to reduce disruption in the event that such parties become designated."
Cooley,"Evolving US, UK and EU Sanctions and Export Controls Target Russia for Ukraine Invasion","Exercise care when accepting non-sanctioned Russian financing: Companies should seek a commitment from each investor to promptly notify the company if the investor becomes subject to sanctions.

In addition, companies should consider limiting the rights of new Russian investors or ensuring that the investors governance rights would be automatically revoked should the investor become subject to sanctions.

Compliance considerations for company operations and sales Perform diligence and screen customers, business partners and other counterparties: Although not a regulatory requirement, screening is the best way to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions with restricted parties and embargoed jurisdictions.

Restricted party screening can be conducted manually through the US, UK, or EU published lists or through automated tools  and geo-IP restrictions to block access to products and services, including software as a service (SaaS) solutions and software downloads, by users with IP addresses associated with embargoed jurisdictions can typically be implemented via a third-party cloud provider.

Importantly, screening may not be sufficient to identify parties that are prohibited due to their ownership or, in some circumstances, control, by sanctioned parties.

Accordingly, companies should develop risk-appropriate diligence processes to complement their screening efforts.

Such diligence should address risks related to expanded restrictions on exports to MEUs, government end users and state-owned enterprises.

Confirm the export classification of products, software and technology: Export classification is a critical element of compliance, and companies that have not classified their products for export purposes should do so as soon as possible  ideally, prior to new export activities.

Parties that export products (including software downloads) or provide technical support to Russia or Belarus should evaluate their existing activities with the understanding that most non-EAR99 items will now require a license.

In addition, even EAR99 items  other than food and medicine  will require an export license to MEUs.

Reevaluate EAR license exception eligibility for Russia:

Exporters that have historically relied on license exceptions for exports to Russia or Belarus, including the commonly used License Exception ENC for encryption hardware and software, should reevaluate eligibility given the significant reductions in scope and availability.

Transactions previously authorized by a license exception may now require a license.

Assess supply chains for foreign-produced items: The expansion of US export control jurisdiction to reach foreign-produced items intended for Russia or Belarus will require companies to reevaluate their supply chains and assess whether specific licenses are required for items that contain more than a de minimis level of controlled US content, are the direct product of certain US-origin software or technology, or are produced by a plant or major component of a plant that is the direct product of such software or technology.

Companies that export foreign-produced items to Russia or Belarus based on a prior determination that such items are not subject to the EAR will need to update their jurisdictional analyses in light of the new rules.

Review contractual terms and conditions with customers and other counterparties: Companies should evaluate their customer agreements, terms and conditions, distributor and reseller agreements, and other contractual documents to ensure that these materials effectively cover sanctions and export controls compliance, including representations regarding prohibited destinations, end users, and end uses for the companys products and services.

Such contracts should also provide companies with the right to immediately terminate services should the counterparty become subject to sanctions."
Cooley,"Evolving US, UK and EU Sanctions and Export Controls Target Russia for Ukraine Invasion","Such contracts should also provide companies with the right to immediately terminate services should the counterparty become subject to sanctions.

Evaluate banks involved in payments to employees and contractors in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine: If employees and contractors in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine do not appear on any US or other applicable sanctions lists, are not located in any embargoed jurisdictions (e.g., Crimea or the DNR or LNR regions), and the payments would not involve any sanctioned financial institutions, then companies are currently authorized to make payments to such parties.

However, many banks and payment processors have suspended processing of all inbound payments to Russia and/or Ukraine (including authorized transactions) and may soon extend these actions to Belarus.

As such, some companies are considering alternative mechanisms for paying contractors in the region, such as cryptocurrency or digital asset transfers.

However, such transfers should be separately evaluated to address potential sanctions and financial regulatory risks.

Whats next?

Circumstances on the ground, as well as responsive regulatory actions, are in flux.

More measures are forthcoming, and interpretive guidance from US enforcement agencies is expected.

Companies with business activities in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine should carefully monitor these developments  and be prepared to adjust their compliance response accordingly.

Cooley attorneys are available to advise on these requirements, and assist you in establishing appropriate compliance measures and procedures."
Cooley,US Justice Department Appoints First National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Director,"The US Department of Justice has announced the appointment of Eun Young Choi as the first director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.

Choi has been a DOJ prosecutor for nearly a decade and most recently served as senior counsel to the deputy attorney general.

Choi will lead the NCET in investigating and prosecuting the criminal use of digital assets, and her appointment is the latest in an array of actions by the US government to increase oversight for cryptocurrency and digital assets.

In the announcement, Choi stated that the NCET will play a pivotal role in ensuring that as the technology surrounding digital assets grows and evolves, the department in turn accelerates and expands its efforts to combat their illicit abuse by criminals of all kinds.

According to the DOJ, the NCET was established to ensure that the department meets the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

It focuses particularly on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, infrastructure providers, and other entities that are enabling the misuse of cryptocurrency and related technologies to commit or facilitate criminal activity.

The NCET also will serve as a focal point to ensure there is a more coordinated effort across agencies, including the FBI and US attorneys offices, as well as the DOJs National Security Division, and its Criminal Divisions Computer Crime and Intellectual Property and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery sections.

On the need for the NCET, Criminal Division Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite cited the rapid innovation of digital assets and distributed ledger technologies, and their connection to cyberattacks, narcotics trafficking and money laundering.

This tracks with a prior call by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco for crypto companies to root out abuses.

To those who do not, we will hold you accountable where we can.

FBI creates Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit As part of this increased focus on enforcement activity in the cryptocurrency space, the DOJ also announced that the FBI is creating a new Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit, which is dedicated to providing analysis, support, and training across the FBI, as well as innovating its cryptocurrency tools to stay ahead of future threats.

Cooley regularly advises clients on managing digital assets, and defends clients in associated government investigations and commercial litigation.

Our blockchain technology & tokenization, financial services, cyber/data/privacy, and regulatory practice groups regularly confront these issues  and have successfully advised clients amid a rapidly evolving regulatory environment.

The DOJs announcement makes clear that cryptocurrency will be a bigger issue for government enforcement and, ultimately, commercial litigation.

In light of increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, we urge clients to stay vigilant and reach out to our teams."
Cooley,CFPB Warns Government Benefits Distributors About Compulsory Use of Prepaid Cards,"On February 15, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a compliance bulletin indicating that it will be scrutinizing prepaid card providers who distribute government benefits and payments.

Specifically, the CFPB bulletin highlighted the regulatory requirement for consumer choice and forthcoming scrutiny of exclusive contracting and fees, and underscored the CFPBs authority under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA)  which codifies the CFPBs unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) authority  to take action against those who attempt to limit this choice.

The EFTA and government benefit accounts The EFTA and its implementing regulations (Regulation E) establish compliance requirements for financial institutions engaged in electronic fund transfers.

The EFTA and Regulation E contain provisions related to, among other things, card and account consumer disclosures, error and dispute resolution processes, and preauthorized transfer requirements.

Additionally, the EFTA and Regulation E prevent government benefit administrators from requiring that a consumer establish an account at a particular financial institution as a condition of receipt of a government benefit, known as the compulsory use prohibition.

Government benefit accounts are defined as accounts established by a [state or federal] government agency for distributing government benefits to a consumer electronically, excluding distributions for needs-tested benefit programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

1

The bulletin explains that the compulsory use prohibition requires that consumers receiving government benefits have a choice with respect to how they receive their funds.

2

As a result, a consumer must have at least two options for receipt of funds, starting with the first payout of the government benefits.

The bulletin clarifies that the compulsory use prohibition does not require a government agency, financial institution, or other participating person or entity to offer two different methods for receiving the funds.

For example, according to the CFPB, it is permissible to require consumers to use direct deposit, as long as the consumers can choose the financial institution at which they would like to receive the direct deposit.

3

Alternatively, a government benefits program may require use of a particular financial institution for direct deposit, but allow consumers to select another means by which to receive the funds.

Further, Regulation E requires that the disclosures provided before the consumer acquires a government benefit account include a statement of the available payment options.

Additional Regulation E requirements The bulletin also highlights several key Regulation E prohibitions and requirements that apply to financial institutions providing government benefit accounts, as outlined below.

4 Disclosures Institutions must provide three different types of disclosures for government benefit accounts pre-acquisition disclosures, disclosures on the access device itself (e.g., the card) and initial disclosures  which must contain certain information related to the government benefit account and its protections for the consumer.

Such information includes the name of the financial institution that holds the account or issues the access device, applicable fees related to the account or access device, the consumers liability for unauthorized transfers, an error resolution notice, and limitations on transfer frequency.

Change-in-terms notices Institutions are required to notify consumers whenever there is a change in the terms or conditions required to be provided in the initial disclosures for government benefit account, or a change results in an increased fee or liability for the consumer or limitations in the availability, frequency, or dollar amount of electronic fund transfers."
Cooley,CFPB Warns Government Benefits Distributors About Compulsory Use of Prepaid Cards,"Access to account history Institutions are required to provide either a periodic statement to consumers showing the account transaction history or otherwise make available to the consumer certain items, such as the consumers account balance by telephone, electronic history through a website and written transaction histories, upon request.

Limited liability for unauthorized transfers and error resolution rights The bulletin reiterates that limited liability protections and error resolution rights fully apply to government benefit accounts, with limited modifications regarding the period within which an unauthorized transfer must be reported by the consumer to the financial institution.

CFPB monitoring and enforcement  dont forget UDAAP Notably, in its closing comments, the bulletin makes passing reference to the fact that the CFPB will rely on its enforcement authority under the CFPA to rein in those in its crosshairs, highlighting not just the CFPBs power to enforce the EFTA against providers of government benefits accounts, but also its ability to more broadly interpret gray areas of potential concern.

Indeed, as the CFPBs press release noted, the CFPBs recent enforcement action penalizing a prepaid card provider for imposing fees to access benefits was based on alleged violations of the EFTA and UDAAP.

The provider issued prepaid cards to recently incarcerated individuals to access certain post-release benefits.

Given the recent CFPB scrutiny in this space, providers of government benefits on prepaid cards should be aware of the importance of strict compliance with the EFTA and potential UDAAP concerns.

Cooley,US Commerce Department Adds 33 Chinese Entities to Unverified List,"On February 8, 2022, the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added 33 Chinese entities to the agencys Unverified List (UVL).

The UVL does not fully prohibit transactions with the designated parties; however, individuals and entities on the UVL are ineligible to receive items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by means of a license exception.

In addition, exporters must obtain a statement from designated parties prior to exporting, re-exporting or transferring any item subject to the EAR to a designated party, and file an Automated Export System (AES) record for all exports to UVL-designated parties.

Global drug development company affiliates WuXi Biologics Co. and WuXi Biologics (Shanghai) Co. were among the 33 entities added.

What is the UVL?

BIS administers and enforces the EAR, which principally regulate exports, re-exports, and transfers of commercial and dual-use items.

As part of its administration of the EAR, BIS maintains various lists identifying parties subject to end-user restrictions.

BISs UVL identifies parties whose bona fides  i.e., legitimacy and reliability  it has been unable to verify through pre-license checks or post-shipment verifications.

Several factors, including a partys inability to satisfactorily demonstrate the end use of EAR-regulated items and/or lack of cooperation in connection with pre-license checks or post-shipment verifications, may contribute to BISs designation determinations.

UVL restrictions As noted, the UVL does not fully prohibit transactions with the listed parties, but it imposes certain restrictions and requirements (as outlined below) on exports, re-exports, and transfers of EAR-regulated items such as hardware, materials, software and technology to UVL parties.

Ineligibility for License Exceptions Exports, re-exports and transfers to UVL parties of items subject to the EAR are not permitted to be made in reliance on any of the License Exceptions under the EAR.

In certain circumstances, this may mean that exporters must obtain specific licenses from BIS to authorize export transactions with UVL parties.

Exporters should account for application preparation and processing times in their business planning, as well as the possibility that licenses may not be issued.

UVL statement requirement Before exporting, re-exporting or transferring to a UVL party an EAR-regulated item that is not subject to a license requirement, exporters, re-exporters and transferers (collectively referred to as an exporter or exporters below) must obtain a UVL statement from that party that includes these important details about the transaction: The name, address, website and contact details of the UVL party.

The UVL partys agreement to not use the item(s) at issue for a prohibited end use, or re-export or transfer the same in violation of the EAR.

The intended end use, end user and country of destination.

An agreement to timely and full cooperation with BISs pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications.

An agreement to provide copies of related documentation.

A certification that the signer is duly authorized to make the representations on the UVL partys behalf.

An exporter may use a singular UVL statement for multiple transactions, provided the underlying information remains the same and the exporter maintains records identifying each transaction tied to the UVL statement.

Exporters must maintain the UVL statement, as well as related export documentation, for a period of five years, pursuant to the EARs recordkeeping requirements .

AES filings requirement Exporters must file (or cause their freight forwarders to file on their behalf) an AES record for all exports to UVL parties of EAR-regulated items  regardless of value or destination."
Cooley,US Commerce Department Adds 33 Chinese Entities to Unverified List,"Guidance for affiliates The UVL requirements and restrictions apply to listed parties only  i.e., parents, subsidiaries and other affiliates of UVL parties are not affected as a result of their affiliation with a listed party.

However, transactions with affiliated parties should be considered red flags, and further diligence is recommended to ensure that such parties are legally distinct entities (as opposed to divisions or branches of the UVL party) and to confirm the absence of circumstances suggesting potential unlawful diversion of EAR-regulated items.

Exporters of EAR-regulated items to UVL party affiliates should document their diligence on these points and consider obtaining compliance statements from their counterparties.

UVL parties may seek removal from the UVL by submitting a written request to BIS, which may remove such parties upon verification of their bona fides through satisfactory completion of a pre-license check and post-shipment verification.

Compliance implications Although UVL designations do not preclude all export transactions with the listed parties, they materially increase the regulatory compliance burden for exporters of EAR-regulated items.

Exporters doing business with UVL parties must take steps to ensure that: Their export transactions with UVL parties are authorized pursuant to a specific license or because no license requirement applies.

They have obtained a proper UVL statement before the export, re-export or transfer of any EAR-regulated items.

They are maintaining records as required by the EAR.

They are making AES filings for covered exports, re-exports and transfers.

In addition, exporters should confirm that their third-party screening and other diligence protocols are sufficient to identify risks in dealings with UVL party affiliates.

These efforts may require the assignment of additional internal resources, increase compliance costs and/or impact business dealings, including contractual obligations and relationships.

If you make or are contemplating making exports, re-exports or transfers to a UVL party, and have questions about the regulatory requirements, please contact Cooleys international trade group for assistance."

Cooley,UK Supreme Court Considers Privacy Rights of Executives Under Investigation,"Two recent cases in the UK courts highlight the tension between an individuals right to privacy during a criminal investigation and the freedom of the press to report on the investigation as a matter of public interest.

Historically, the UK courts and authorities have largely protected the identities of individuals who are under investigation but not facing charges.

However, courts are now scrutinising that long-standing approach  including in a case pending before the UK Supreme Court  raising fresh questions about the privacy rights of the subjects of investigation under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

We detail these cases below.

Background ZXC v. Bloomberg LP In May 2020, the English Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in Bloomberg , a case concerning a US executive under investigation by an unspecified UK law enforcement body for allegations of corporate corruption.

Having identified the subject in an initial report, Bloomberg published a second report describing a letter of request for mutual legal assistance from the investigator to foreign authorities, including details of the theory of suspected fraud.

Of note: The letter was marked confidential.

The investigation was in its early stages.

The individual had not been arrested.

The individual successfully obtained an award of damages for violation of their Article 8 privacy rights, and Bloomberg appealed.

The Court of Appeal affirmed the ruling, relying on the two-stage balancing exercise customarily used by UK courts: Does the claimant have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the relevant information?

If yes, is this expectation outweighed by a countervailing interest in the right to freedom of expression?

The Court of Appeal found that the balance tipped in favour of privacy, even though the investigation related to the business dealings of a large international company and included matters of high public interest.

1

A key reason why the suspects Article 8 rights prevailed was the potential damage to the suspects reputation and the risk that the public would overlook the fundamental legal principle that those accused of an offence are deemed innocent until proven guilty.

2 Bloomberg appealed to the Supreme Court.

Counsel for Bloomberg argued that the Court of Appeal applied an incorrect approach, and that individuals under investigation do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in the absence of charges.

If the Supreme Court were to adopt Bloombergs argument, it would constitute a marked shift in how UK courts have treated these cases.

The Supreme Courts judgment is expected imminently.

Amec Foster Wheeler Energy Limited deferred prosecution agreement Relatedly, the English High Court recently addressed the privacy rights of individuals under investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the course of its approving a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) between the SFO and Amec Foster Wheeler Energy Limited (AFW) that brought allegations of bribery and corruption against AFW .

In its consideration of the DPA, the High Court noted that the individuals allegedly involved in the misconduct had neither testified nor agreed to the DPAs version of the facts.

As such, the High Court ordered the postponement of publication of the statement of facts and the indictment containing those individuals names in order to avoid substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice .

The High Court also added a third-party disclaimer to the DPA clarifying that only AFW had been found culpable  not any particular individual.

The High Court intended to consider whether the statement of facts and indictment should be published once individual charging decisions had been made, but the SFO has since declined to prosecute any individuals ."
Cooley,UK Supreme Court Considers Privacy Rights of Executives Under Investigation,"On 4 February 2022, the High Court approved an agreement between the SFO and the relevant individuals that only an anonymised statement of facts be published, thus balancing the SFOs goal of transparency and those individuals right to privacy.

Looking ahead The Supreme Courts judgment in ZXC v. Bloomberg LP will provide much-needed clarity on the scope of the right to privacy of individuals in criminal investigations.

The impact of the judgment will be significant, and may curb the privacy rights of individuals identified as under investigation, especially in cases where charges may not be brought, and thus no evidence would be tested through a trial process.

While the High Court in the AFW case erred on the side of protecting the privacy of the individuals under investigation, courts will likely revisit these issues as future DPAs arise.

It is also worth noting that the SFOs current guidance on DPAs states that consideration must be given to the necessity and impact of publication of the identities of third parties, and whether it is compliant with data protection law and the ECHR .

In the meantime, on a practical note, companies and individuals who are weighing the impact of reporting possible misconduct to the authorities may wish to consider the potential effect of individuals identities being revealed to the public  and seek to mitigate such risk through careful negotiation with the authorities if a report to the authorities is made.

Cooley,"California Reinstates COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave Retroactive to January 1, 2022","On February 9, 2022, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Senate Bill 114, which requires employers with 26 or more employees to provide supplemental paid sick leave to employees who are unable to work for reasons related to COVID-19.

It also allows employees to use leave to care for family members.

SB 114 creates new California Labor Code Sections 248.6 and 248.7.

In April 2021, California enacted SB 95, which similarly required employers to provide supplemental paid sick leave to employees, but expired on September 30, 2021.

SB 114 reinstates the supplemental paid sick leave requirements but differs from SB 95 in several significant ways.

This alert focuses on the requirements of SB 114 that apply to employers generally.

SB 114 will go into effect on February 19, 2022 , but its requirements will apply retroactively to January 1, 2022, and will expire on September 30, 2022.

Which employers are covered by SB 114?

All private employers that employ more than 25 employees must provide supplemental paid sick leave to their employees for certain COVID-related reasons.

Which employees are covered under SB 114?

A covered employee means any employee who is unable to work or telework for an employer because of a qualifying reason (addressed in the next section).

For what reason can a covered employee take supplemental paid sick leave?

A covered employee is entitled to supplemental paid sick leave if unable to work or telework due to any of the following reasons: The employee is subject to a quarantine or isolation period related to COVID-19 as defined by an order or guidance of the California Department of Public Health, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or a local public health officer who has jurisdiction over the workplace.

(If the employee is subject to more than one of the foregoing circumstances, the employee can use COVID-19 supplemental paid leave for the minimum quarantine or isolation period under the order or guidance that provides for the longest such minimum period.)

The employee has been advised by a healthcare provider to isolate or quarantine due to COVID-19.

The employee is attending (or accompanying a family member to) an appointment to receive a vaccine or a vaccine booster that prevents the employee from being able to work or telework.

The employee is experiencing symptoms, or caring for a family member experiencing symptoms, related to a COVID-19 vaccine or booster that prevent the employee from being able to work or telework.

The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and is seeking a medical diagnosis.

The employee is caring for a family member who is subject to an order or guidance, or who has been advised to isolate or quarantine.

The employee is caring for a child whose school or care provider is closed or otherwise unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.

A child is defined as a biological adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom an employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of age or dependency status.

A family member is defined as a child; a biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an employee or the employees spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child; a spouse; a registered domestic partner; a grandparent; a grandchild; or a sibling.

How much supplemental paid sick leave does a covered employee receive?

Supplemental paid sick leave under SB 114 is divided into two categories, as outlined below.

SB 114 COVID-related sick leave reasons In the first category, covered employees considered full time (or who worked or were scheduled to work, on average, at least 40 hours per week for the covered employer in the two weeks before the date the employee takes supplemental paid sick leave), are entitled to 40 hours of supplemental paid sick leave for any COVID-related reason listed above."
Cooley,"California Reinstates COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave Retroactive to January 1, 2022","For part-time covered employees, the amount of supplemental paid sick leave available is determined as follows: Employees with a normal weekly schedule are entitled to supplemental paid sick leave equal to the total number of hours they are normally scheduled to work in one week.

Employees with a variable schedule are entitled to supplemental paid sick leave equal to seven times the average number of hours worked each day in the six months preceding the date they take supplemental paid sick leave.

If an employee has worked for the employer for less than six months, but more than seven days, this calculation is instead made over the entire period of employment.

Employees with a variable schedule, but who have worked for the employer for seven days or less, are entitled to supplemental paid sick leave equal to the total number of hours that they have worked for the employer.

Positive COVID-19 test result As for the second category, covered employees can take additional supplemental paid sick leave of 40 hours (or in the numbers above for part-time covered employees), if the employee, or a family member for whom the employee is providing care, tests positive for COVID-19.

If the employee requests to use additional leave pursuant to this subparagraph because a family member for whom the employee is providing care tests positive for COVID-19, the employer may require that the employee provide documentation of that family members test results before paying the additional leave.

Employers are not obligated to pay for any additional leave time if an employee refuses to provide documentation of the test results.

Additionally, if an employee tests positive for COVID-19, an employer may require the employee to submit to a diagnostic test  at no cost to the employee  on or after the fifth day after the initial positive test result and provide documentation of the test results.

The total number of hours of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave to which a covered employee is entitled is in addition to any paid sick leave that may be available under state or local law.

A covered employer cannot require such employees to use any other paid leave or unpaid leave, paid time off or vacation time provided by the employer before allowing them to use COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave or in lieu of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave.

Additionally, covered employees are not required to use supplemental paid sick leave before receiving exclusion pay under the Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standards.

The total maximum amount of supplemental paid sick leave hours must not exceed 80 hours from January 1, 2022, to September 30, 2022.

Are there any limitations on the use of supplemental paid sick leave?

Yes.

If a covered employee is taking supplemental paid sick leave because the employee or the employees family member is experiencing symptoms related to the COVID-19 vaccine or booster, then the employee is limited to a total of supplemental paid sick leave of three days or 24 hours for each vaccination or booster, unless the employee provides verification from a healthcare provider that the employee or the family member is continuing to experience symptoms related to the COVID-19 vaccine or booster.

This period includes time used to attend the appointment.

Are employees compensated for supplemental paid sick leave in the same manner as regular paid sick leave?

For nonexempt covered employees, each hour of supplemental paid sick leave must be calculated/compensated at a rate equal to one of the following: Calculated in the same manner as the regular rate of pay for the workweek in which the employee uses paid sick leave, whether or not the employee works overtime that week."
Cooley,"California Reinstates COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave Retroactive to January 1, 2022","Calculated by dividing the employees total wages, not including overtime premium pay, by the employees total non-overtime hours worked in the full pay periods of the prior 90 days of employmentprovided that, for nonexempt employees paid by piece rate, commission or other method that uses all hours to determine the regular rate of pay, total wages, not including overtime premium pay, are divided by all hours, to determine the correct amount of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave.

For exempt employees, the rate of pay for supplemental paid sick leave is to be calculated in the same manner as the employer calculates wages for other forms of paid leave.

Similar to SB 95, a covered employer is not required to pay more than $511 per day or $5,110 in the aggregate to a covered employee for supplemental paid sick leave.

Does SB 114 apply retroactively?

Yes.

The requirements under SB 114 apply retroactively to January 1, 2022.

If a covered employee took time off for any COVID-related reason under SB 114 and was not compensated by the employer  or was compensated in an amount less than what is required under SB 114  then upon the oral or written request of the employee , the employer must provide a retroactive payment that provides for that compensation on or before the payday for the next full pay period after the oral or written request.

If an employer makes a retroactive payment, the number of hours corresponding to the amount of the retroactive payment must count toward the total number of hours of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave that the employer is required to give to the employee.

If a covered employee took leave for any COVID-related reason under SB 114 between January 1, 2022, and the effective date, and was compensated in an amount equal to or greater than the amount of compensation for COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave required under SB 114, then upon the oral or written request of the employee, the employee should be credited for any leave hours used for COVID-specific purposes, and the employer should be credited for providing those hours as COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave.

Do employers have to provide notice of SB 114?

Yes.

Employers must display a poster explaining the nature of the supplemental paid sick leave law.

If employees do not have a physical workplace, the notice may be disseminated to employees electronically.

The California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement will make publicly available a model notice setting forth the requirements under SB 114.

In addition, as with regular paid sick leave, covered employers must also provide notice in each covered employees wage statement showing the amount of available COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave each pay period.

The employer must list zero hours used if a worker has not used any COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave.

What does this mean for covered employers?

Effective February 19, 2022, covered employers will need to comply with the provisions of SB 114 with respect to supplemental paid sick leave.

They must provide notice to employees of the supplemental sick leave available to them (which can be accomplished by sending a copy of the poster to employees via email), and provide supplemental paid sick leave for qualifying reasons.

The California Department of Industrial Relations will update its webpage, including FAQs with respect to the requirements under SB 114.

Employers should keep in mind that this supplemental benefit is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other paid sick leave benefits that employees are entitled to by law or policy.

Cooley,Congress Passes Prohibition on Mandatory Arbitration of Certain #MeToo Claims,"On February 10, 2022, the US Senate passed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021.

The Act, once signed into law by President Joe Biden, as expected, will amend the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to prohibit agreements that mandate arbitration of sexual harassment and sexual assault claims in advance of such conduct occurring.

The Act reflects a resurgence for the #MeToo movement at the federal level.

While the movement spurred a wave of state legislation combating workplace sexual misconduct, efforts to prohibit mandatory arbitration of claims involving sexual misconduct have been less successful.

Even when states such as New York and Washington enacted these prohibitions, they were overturned by courts due to the FAAs well-established preemptive effect over conflicting state arbitration laws.

By amending the FAA, the Act eliminates this procedural obstacle.

What does the Act say?

Under the Act, a party to a predispute arbitration agreement, or an agreement to arbitrate a dispute that had not yet arisen at the time the parties enter the arbitration agreement, cannot enforce this arbitration agreement against a person who files a case alleging either (i) conduct that would constitute sexual harassment under federal, tribal, or state law (a Sexual Harassment Dispute) or (ii) nonconsensual sexual act or sexual contact (a Sexual Assault Dispute).

Similarly, in response to a Sexual Harassment Dispute or a Sexual Assault Dispute, a responding party cannot enforce a predispute joint-action waiver, which is an agreement, that would prohibit, or waive the right of a party to participate in a joint, class, or collective action in a judicial, arbitral, administrative, or other forum, concerning a dispute that has not yet arisen at the time of the making of the agreement.

This limitation on joint-action waivers applies regardless of whether it is included in a predispute or postdispute arbitration agreement.

The Act notably does not extend to any other types of disputes, including those based on claims of discrimination or retaliation.

It also would not apply to claims brought under local law.

Who determines if the Act applies?

The Act states that a court, rather than an arbitrator, will determine whether the Act applies to an agreement to arbitrate and whether such agreement is valid and enforceable under the Act.

The court is not bound by the language of the arbitration agreement, including any language delegating such determination to an arbitrator.

The court also must use federal law, meaning any conflicting state laws will be superseded.

Will the Act apply immediately?

Yes.

Once signed, the Act will immediately apply to any dispute or claim that arises or accrues after the date of enactment.

As it stands, the Act could jeopardize the enforceability of arbitration agreements that predate the Acts enactment.

Action items for businesses While the Act obviously aims to give employees a path to bring sexual assault and harassment claims in a public forum, the Act is notably not limited to just arbitration agreements between employers and employees.

Any predispute arbitration agreement or predispute joint-action waiver will be governed by the Act.

As such, in anticipation of these new restrictions on arbitration agreements, employers and others who utilize individualized arbitration agreements in the course of business should conduct a thorough review of their arbitration agreements and dispute resolution procedures to determine whether modifications are required.

We are closely tracking developments on the Act and will publish further guidance when additional information becomes available.

If you have any questions related to the Act, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."
Cooley,Ninth Circuit Opens Door to State-Level Regulation of Internet Access,"On January 28, 2022, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision upholding a California law that applies network neutrality requirements to internet service providers in the state , affirming a decision by a federal district court to deny a preliminary injunction requested by industry trade associations.

Network neutrality is a form of regulation that prohibits internet service providers from adopting practices that could impede the flow of information on the internet.

It typically includes obligations not to block traffic, not to discriminate in transmitting different types of traffic, and to provide customers with information about their services.

This decision allows California to continue to enforce its law, increases the likelihood that similar state laws could be adopted and enforced, and potentially permits other forms of regulation for internet access services.

The central issue in the case was whether Californias legislation was preempted by federal law.

The Ninth Circuit held that a 2018 decision from the Federal Communications Commission eliminating federal network neutrality regulation did not prevent states from adopting similar laws.

In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit relied on a separate case in which the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the FCCs broad claim that it was preempting any state network neutrality laws could not be accepted because the FCC had disclaimed any general authority to regulate internet access.

The court also dismissed arguments that the California law conflicts with the federal Communications Act and that the act precludes regulation of internet access because such access is an interstate service.

Whats next?

The industry parties to this case have sought further review from the full Ninth Circuit.

If this request is denied, they can seek review from the Supreme Court or allow the case to go back to the district court.

This decision leaves Californias network neutrality requirements in place, but it also could have wider implications.

In particular, the decision encourages other states to adopt their own network neutrality requirements.

In addition, because the Ninth Circuit rejected broad preemption of state internet regulation, this decision could encourage efforts to adopt other types of regulation, such as requirements to serve sparsely populated areas, obligations to provide inexpensive service to low-income customers or mandatory service-quality standards.

This decision also will add urgency to efforts by the FCC to reinstate its network neutrality rules, and could spur Congress to consider enacting a federal network neutrality law, although it does not appear that network neutrality is a legislative priority at this time."
Cooley,Delaware Expands Use of Directors and Officers Captive Insurance,"On February 7, 2022, Delaware Gov. John Carney signed into law a bill that amends the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) to expressly allow the use of captive insurance companies to fund a Delaware corporations directors and officers insurance coverage .

The insurance business is historically cyclical in nature, and were currently experiencing a particularly hard D&O insurance market, in which companies seeking D&O coverage face capacity and pricing challenges.

This hardening of the market is especially pronounced for companies engaged in new and innovative sectors such as technology, crypto and the sharing economy.

Although many companies, in response to a hard market, turn to the use of captives to self-insure their own risks, certain ambiguities in the law have historically discouraged the use of captives in the D&O space, particularly for Side A coverage for non-indemnifiable loss.

This law intends to mitigate these legal impediments and opens the door for the increased use of captives to fund companies D&O coverage.

A primary  though not the only  legal impedimentto self-funding D&O coverage through a captive concerned whether Delaware corporations could or should use captives to fund Side A D&O coverage, which insures against the wrongful acts of directors and officers when a company is not permitted, as a matter of a law or pursuant to a companys governing documents, to indemnify these individuals.

Background Section 145(a) of the DGCL allows a Delaware corporation to indemnify a director or officerif the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful.

Separately, Section 145(g) of the DGCL permits Delaware corporations to purchase insurance protecting directors, officers and other indemnified persons against any liability asserted against such person  whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability.

Accordingly, to hedge its risk with respect to any non-indemnifiable acts (e.g., acts not taken in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation), a corporation could purchase insurance coverage.

However, until this new legislation, there has been uncertainty whether or not risk captured by a captive should be treated, for purposes of the DGCL, as insurance or as indemnification.

If captive insurance is treated as the latter, then it would be suspect to provide Side A coverage through this mechanism.

This law amends Section 145 of the DGCL to expressly permit Delaware corporations to utilize captives to provide coverage for D&O liability, as long as the program meets certain statutory safe harbors  including, most notably, requiring the exclusion of coverage associated with certain bad acts and the involvement of a third-party administrator in certain situations.

Looking forward In light of this amendment to the DGCL, we anticipate more Delaware corporations will consider using captives to fund coverage of D&O risk.

With a number of jurisdictions to choose from, companies will need to evaluate which jurisdiction is appropriate for their particular risk profile.

Captive insurance can be offered through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary of the insured company or through a segregated cell captive where the insured will rent a separate cell of a standalone captive to self-insure their risk.

Although there are regulatory requirements and costs associated with forming and maintaining these types of entities, captives can generally be a great risk management tool for well-capitalized companies that have the capacity to think strategically over the long term about their risk profile and risk management."
Cooley,Delaware Expands Use of Directors and Officers Captive Insurance,"For example, captives may provide companies with greater flexibility in how they structure their insurance program and manage risk, allowing them to obtain broader coverage for more bespoke risks, and often at lower premiums, by being able to access the reinsurance markets.

Furthermore, if losses are less than anticipated, then captives  subject to applicable laws  may dividend excess premium back to the sponsor companies.

Companies have long used captives to self-insure a wide variety of risk with low-value, high-frequency claims.

However, with the hardening of the D&O market, companies have started to consider how to effectively and efficiently use captives to protect against their potential D&O liability.

We expect the new law to accelerate this trend in the market."
Cooley,Q4 2021 Venture Financing Report – Record Quarter Closes Record Year,"Despite the ongoing pandemic and various political and economic turmoil, Cooleys representation of emerging companies and venture investors in disclosable VC financings during the final quarter of 2021 was essentially on par with record-high deal volume and shattered the previous record for dollars raised.

In Q4 2021, Cooley handled 392 disclosable deals (versus 399 in Q2 2021, the record), representing more than $25 billion of invested capital (versus more than $22billion in Q2 2021, the prior record).

Before Q2 2021, disclosable deals had not exceeded 355 deals for any quarter, and the largest amount raised reported for a quarter had not exceeded $19 billion.

In all of 2021, we handled more than 1,475 disclosable deals, representing more than $84billion of invested capital.

This far exceeds the prior annual record of 1,300+ disclosable deals and $47billion of invested capital just set in 2020.

In Q4 2021, median pre-money valuations remained robust across deal stages, although our data does point to a slight decrease in valuations across all deal stages during December.

We will continue to monitor valuations, but this decrease still left deals at favorable valuations.

For example, median pre-money valuations for Series Seed deals during Q4 2021 reached $17million, which may be a sign of an increased pool of funds available to early-stage companies.

Likewise, median pre-money valuations for Series D+ transactions in Q4 reached more than $1.9billion.

During the quarter, Cooley handled 10 disclosable deals with pre-money valuations greater than $5billion.

Overall, deal terms during Q4 remained company-friendly.

Approximately 99% of our disclosable deals were up rounds, another record for this report.

Similarly, more than 95% of disclosable deals in Q4 have non-participating preferred.

In addition, the percentage of recapitalizations remained historically low.

While we did see a slight increase in the utilization of pay-to-play provisions in Q4, pay-to-plays were only implemented in 4% of our disclosable deals.

According to PitchBooks 2021 Annual Global League Tables, Cooley advised more companies on venture capital transactions  in the US and globally  than any other law firm.

Cooley continues to surpass its own records in terms of VC deal volume, reaching its highest-ever annual volume in 2021.

Spotlight on life sciences In Q4 2021, Cooley handled 82 disclosable financings of life sciences companies, representing more than $5.2billion of invested capital.

Both levels represented significant increases from the prior quarter.

Deal sizes spiked, with an average deal size of more than $63million in the quarter.

Meanwhile, in a signal of investor caution, the percentage of life sciences transactions structured in tranches increased to more than 17% of deals, doubling from the prior quarter.

To view more details on life sciences trends, use the Life sciences filter in our interactive data visualization tool.

Spotlight on technology In Q4 2021, Cooley handled 211 disclosable financings of technology companies, representing more than $14billion of invested capital.

Both numbers increased markedly from the prior quarter.

Cooley,Ninth Circuit’s Fraudulent Payments Coverage Ruling Has Implications for Cyber Insurance Purchasers,"In a decision with significant implications for policyholders seeking coverage for social engineering scams and cybercrime losses, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in Ernst and Haas Management Company, Inc. v. Hiscox, Inc. that an insurance policy covering losses resulting directly from computer fraud included coverage for payments made based on a fraudulent invoice.

The Ninth Circuit held that the loss was directly caused by the fraud, disagreeing with the insurers argument that the unwitting employee who received the fraudulent invoice and sent the payment to the fraudster was an intervening actor.

Ernst and Haas Management Company was a victim of a common social engineering scam: A fraudster emailed an Ernst employee a fraudulent invoice, posing as that employees superior.

Believing the email to be legitimate, the employee directed Ernsts bank to wire $200,000 to a third-party account reflected in the fraudulent invoice.

Afterward, the employee discovered that the superior did not actually send the fraudulent invoice.

However, the $200,000 had already been transferred, and Ernst could not recover the funds.

Ernsts crime insurance policy contained two types of coverage common in many cyber and crime insurance policies: computer fraud coverage and funds transfer coverage.

The computer fraud coverage insured loss resulting directly from the use of any computer to fraudulently cause a transfer.

The insurer denied coverage on the basis that the bank transfer did not result directly from computer fraud; rather, it resulted from the employees subsequent instruction to the bank.

The Ninth Circuit disagreed, following the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuits reasoning in Am.

Tooling Center, Inc., v. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am. , 895 F.3d 455, 457 (6th Cir. 2018), and held that Ernsts loss resulted directly from a computer fraud because the employee was acting pursuant to a fraudulent instruction received in an email.

Similarly, the funds transfer coverage insured loss resulting directly from a Fraudulent Instruction directing a financial institution to transfer, pay or deliver Money.

The insurer denied coverage, arguing that the fraudulent instructions were directed to the insured, and not to the financial institution.

The Ninth Circuit again disagreed, reasoning that the sole purpose of the fraudsters instructions was to direct the employee to initiate a wire from Ernsts bank.

Hence, this instruction was direct enough to trigger the policys funds transfer coverage.

The Ninth Circuits decision rejects a common defense often raised by insurers to avoid providing coverage for increasingly frequent social engineering scams.

While the decision is a victory for policyholders, it also serves as a reminder to be proactive about purchasing cyber coverage with more favorable terms to avoid coverage disputes like this one.

Ambiguities can lead to lost coverage for the costs of ransomware attacks, data breaches, privacy claims, government investigations and other cyber exposures.

Coverage counsel can assist with minimizing these potential gaps and vulnerabilities as part of an organizations overall cyber risk management strategy.

Cooley,US Antitrust Enforcers Take Next Steps to Strengthen Merger Enforcement,"To strengthen enforcement, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are undertaking a review of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, last revised by the Obama administration in 2010, and the Vertical Merger Guidelines, issued in 2020 by the Trump administration.

The Biden DOJ and FTC on January 18, 2022, jointly issued a request for information (RFI), soliciting public comment on revisions to modernize the analytical framework used to assess mergers.

Comments are due March 21, after which the agencies have said they will publish proposed guidelines for further comment, with a goal of finalizing new guidelines before the end of 2022.

This process follows President Joe Bidens July 2021 issuance of an executive order , which called on the antitrust agencies to evaluate whether the Horizontal and Vertical Merger Guidelines required revision.

In announcing the RFI, the DOJ and the FTC said the objective is to strengthen enforcement against illegal mergers and combat mounting concerns that many industries across the economy are becoming more concentrated and less competitive.

This joint effort is the latest example of the antitrust agencies efforts to aggressively enforce antitrust law, announce enforcement principles and influence the courts when they challenge mergers in court.

Role of the merger guidelines Both sets of guidelines lay out how the antitrust agencies will approach merger enforcement.

As the current Horizontal Merger Guidelines put it, the guidelines outline the principal analytical techniques, practices, and the enforcement policy of the [DOJ] and

[FTC] with respect to mergers and acquisitions.

Historically, they have been important in influencing merger case law, and federal courts have often cited the guidelines in ruling on merger challenges.

The current Horizontal Merger Guidelines were last published in 2010 jointly by the DOJ and the FTC.

The current Vertical Merger Guidelines were published jointly in 2020, but the FTC withdrew from those guidelines in September 2021.

While the DOJ did not withdraw at the same time, DOJ Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter has said that too much has been made of the purported divergence between the DOJ and the FTC on the treatment of vertical mergers.

He also said that the Antitrust Division shares the FTCs substantive concerns that the guidelines overstate potential efficiencies and fail to identify important relevant theories of harm.

What might change?

The RFI seeks public comments on 15 categories of questions which, according to Kanter, are an attempt to understand why so many industries have too few competitors, and to think carefully about how to ensure our merger enforcement tools are fit for purpose in the modern economy.

Kanter and FTC Chair Lina Khan homed in on specific categories of interest in their public statements announcing the review.

Kanter highlighted a desire to explore whether the framing of horizontal versus vertical analysis implicitly limits the agencies to analyzing transactions in a two-dimensional view that may not reflect complex markets.

He also indicated the agencies will be looking at tools that may be used to assess potential harms from mergers aside from market definition.

Khan questioned whether the guidelines are adequately attentive to the range of business strategies and incentives that might drive acquisitions, including data aggregation strategies and roll-up plays by private equity firms.

She also questioned whether the current guidelines take into account harm to competition in labor markets, which is an enforcement priority for the Biden administration.

Of particular interest, the agencies are focusing on aspects of what they have said are unique aspects of digital markets, highlighting characteristics such as zero-price products, multisided markets and data aggregation, while asking questions about the impact of network effects and interoperability."
Cooley,US Antitrust Enforcers Take Next Steps to Strengthen Merger Enforcement,"The agencies will also be examining: The adequacy of the presumptions in the merger guidelines regarding unlawful transactions, suggesting they may strengthen presumptions based on concentration, which currently are really just a starting point for analysis.

The need to develop a formalized process for divestitures and other remedies that are not currently addressed by the guidelines.

The weight efficiencies should have on merger review, suggesting the DOJ and FTC are likely to downplay efficiencies.

The FTCs Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, issued a statement welcoming review and lauding the benefits of administrability, predictability and credibility that guidelines offer, but suggested skepticism, noting that some questions the agencies are raising appear to be premised on debatable assumptions and that much of the legal authority cited  is nearly or more than half a century old.

They suggested that asking for examples of mergers that made it more difficult for rivals to compete with the merged firm may equate harm to competitors with harm to competition, which would conflict with the oft-cited mantra that antitrust law protects competition, not competitors.

Guidelines review follows 2021 procedural changes to merger review The announcement that the agencies intend to revise the guidelines follows efforts over the past year to amp up the merger review process.

Noteworthy developments to the merger review process over the past year include: Temporary suspension of early termination: Since February 2021, the antitrust enforcers have suspended granting early termination for transactions subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR) filings.

Rescinded 1995 policy statement: In July 2021, the FTC rescinded a 1995 Clinton administration Policy Statement on Prior Approval and Prior Notice Provisions.

The FTC is now requiring prior approval and prior notice provisions for mergers subject to consent decrees, though the scope of such approvals remains unclear.

Warning letters following expiration of the HSR waiting period: The FTC began sending letters to merging companies in August 2021 warning that the agencys decision not to issue second requests to investigate a transaction does not indicate approval and that consummation of the transaction would be at the parties own risk.

These letters also indicate that the FTCs investigation would continue, though few if any investigations have in fact continued after the transactions subject to such letters have been consummated.

Looking forward The RFI and statements by the antitrust enforcers reflect a desire to update the merger guidelines to accurately reflect modern market realities, and to equip the DOJ and FTC to aggressively enforce antitrust law.

Revisions to the guidelines are likely to alter merger review and lead to challenges on new theories of harm.

How significant those changes will be, and whether courts would be willing to adopt substantial changes in merger case law, remains to be seen."
Cooley,CFPB Issues Bulletin to Restrain Collection and Credit Reporting of Prohibited Medical Debt,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has released a compliance bulletin and policy guidance reminding debt collectors that attempting to collect on or furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies regarding medical debt that is prohibited under the recently passed No Surprises Act may violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

The No Surprises Act, which generally went into effect on January1, 2022, provides protections (including limiting amounts required to be paid) to participants, beneficiaries and enrollees in group health plans and group and individual health insurance coverage from surprise medical bills when they receive, under certain circumstances, emergency services, non-emergency services from nonparticipating providers at participating healthcare facilities, and air ambulance services from nonparticipating providers of air ambulance services.

1

In addition, consumer reporting agencies could be in violation of the FCRA if they issue inaccurate consumer reports regarding such debt.

The bulletin provides guidance to debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies regarding their obligations under the FDCPA and FCRA concerning medical debts that would exceed the limits imposed by the No Surprises Act.

In particular, the bulletin provides these reminders: Under the FDCPA and its implementing Regulation F, third-party debt collectors are prohibited from misrepresenting the character, amount or legal status of any debt, and cannot use unfair or unconscionable means to collect such debt.

This prohibition would include misrepresenting that a debtor must pay a medical debt that exceeds the amount permitted by the No Surprises Act.

Under the FCRA and its implementing Regulation V, debt collectors who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies must have reasonable written policies and procedures in place regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information provided to the consumer reporting agency, and they must conduct a reasonable and timely investigation of consumer disputes to verify the accuracy of such information.

A debt collector who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency concerning medical debt that exceeds the limits imposed by the No Surprises Act may violate the FCRA if it fails to accurately note this fact or fails to meet the dispute obligations regarding such debt.

Consumer reporting agencies preparing a consumer report must follow reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of information contained in the report, and they must conduct a reasonable and timely investigation of a consumer dispute involving the accuracy of such information in the report.

A consumer reporting agency may be found to have violated the FCRA if it reports medical debt that exceeds the amount permitted by the No Surprises Act.

The CFPB states that it will closely monitor the practices of those engaged in the collection or reporting of medical debt, and will take action against companies that violate either the FDCPA or FCRA.

The bulletin makes it clear the CFPB is willing to use both the FDCPA and FCRA to hold debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies accountable for failing to comply with the No Surprises Act.

Notes Surprise medical bills are bills from out-of-network providers, air ambulance services and/or facilities to patients that represent the difference between the amount charged by the provider and/or facility and the amount reimbursed by the patients health plan.

Cooley,Federal Reserve Seeks Comments on a US Central Bank Digital Currency,"The Federal Reserve Board recently released a discussion paper and is seeking public comments on the potential benefits and risks, and related policy considerations, of introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States.

The Federal Reserve emphasizes that the paper is the first step in a public discussion between the Federal Reserve and stakeholders about CBDC,and that itwill only take further steps toward developing a CBDC if research points to benefits for households, businesses, and the economy overall that exceed the downside risks, and indicates that CBDC is superior to alternative methods.

The Federal Reserve will also not issue a CBDC without clear support from the executive branch and Congress.

Accordingly, the Federal Reserve makes clear it is not signaling it will make any imminent decisions regarding whether to introduce a CBDC.

As the development of a CBDC would be a highly significant innovation in American money, the Federal Reserve is seeking public comments on 22 questions related to this topic.

Comments are due by May20, 2022, and may be submitted online .

Function and characteristics of a CBDC The Federal Reserve envisions that a CBDC could be used by individuals, businesses and governments to make payments using a risk-free asset.

For example, users could use a CBDC for purchases of goods or services, and governments could collect taxes or make benefit payments.

Importantly, CBDC transactions would be final and complete in real time.

A CBDC might also be able to be programmed to deliver future payments.

The Federal Reserve states that a CBDC would best serve the needs of the United States if it were: Privacy protected to safeguard the privacy rights of consumers, while also providing sufficient transparency to deter criminal activity.

Intermediated such that the private sector could offer accounts or digital wallets to facilitate management of CBDC holdings and payments.

Transferable between customers of different intermediaries, making the payment system more efficient.

Identity verified to help combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Potential benefits of a CBDC The paper outlines a variety of potential benefits of introducing a CBDC.

The Federal Reserve believes that a CBDC could: Offer broad public access to digital money that is free from credit risk and liquidity risk.

Improve cross-border payments, provided there is significant international cooperation.

Help preserve the dominant role of the US dollar globally.

Promote greater financial inclusion (e.g., facilitate access to digital payments and provide a secure means to save).

Extend access to safe central bank money to the general public.

Potential risks of a CBDC The paper also identifies potential key risks posed by the introduction of a CBDC.

In the Federal Reserves view, a CBDC could: Reduce the aggregate amount of deposits in the banking system and cause a shift away from lower-risk assets, both of which could decrease credit availability or raise credit costs for market participants.

Increase the risk or severity of runs on financial firms.

Impact monetary policy implementation and interest rate control.

Be susceptible to operational disruptions and cybersecurity risks.

Comments and outlook A CBDC would be a liability of the Federal Reserve available to the general public.

In this regard, a CBDC would potentially provide a safe, digital payment option for individuals and businesses.

While the development of a CBDC would be a significant innovation itself, the issuance of a CBDC would also spur innovation in the private sector.

Under the intermediated model discussed in the paper, banks and nonbank financial services providers could offer accounts or digital wallets to hold or make payments with a CBDC, as the Federal Reserve Act does not authorize individuals to hold Federal Reserve accounts."
Cooley,Federal Reserve Seeks Comments on a US Central Bank Digital Currency,"Notwithstanding the potential benefits of a CBDC, the paper also highlights existing developments in the US payment system that are focused on making payments faster, cheaper, more convenient and more accessible.

Nonbank providers of payment services have played an important role in advancing these goals, and the development of new interbank settlement services offers greater capabilities for instant payments.

The request for comments indicates that the Federal Reserve is interested in both understanding how the US payment system might evolve in the absence of a CBDC and gathering input on issues that would have to be addressed if it were to move ahead with implementing a CBDC."
Cooley,CFPB Requests Information on Consumer Financial Products or Services Fees,"On January 26, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a request for information seeking comments related to fees charged to consumers in connection with selected products or services.

The CFPB expressed concern that when financial institutions charge back-end fees  including late fees, convenience fees for processing payments and stop payment fees  they entice consumers into making product decisions based on the perception of a lower price.

In requesting public input on such fees, the CFPB indicated that it would use the input it collects to inform its rulemaking, guidance and enforcement priorities.

The CFPB cites its authority to regulate back-end fees in the Consumer Financial Protection Acts mandate that the CFPB ensure consumer financial markets are fair, transparent and competitive.

1 Echoing his previous comments concerning competition in the markets, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated that such fees lack transparency because they allow financial institutions to obscure the true price of their services by luring customers with enticing offers and then charging excessive junk fees.

In the request for information, the CFPB stated that it is concerned about fees that far exceed the marginal cost of the service they purport to cover.

The CFPB also noted that its research has identified specific products and markets where back-end fees can impose significant costs to consumers: Deposit accounts: The cost of a deposit account includes a number of associated fees, such as overdraft and insufficient funds (NSF) fees.

The CFPB alleges that overdraft and NSF fees make up the majority of the revenue that banks derive from deposit accounts, though many established and challenger banks have been moving away from overdraft fees.

Credit cards: The CFPB asserts that in 2019, card issuers charged more than $14billion in punitive late fees.

Specifically, the CFPB alleges that nearly every issuer charges the maximum fees allowed by law of $30 for the first late payment and $41 for subsequent late payments.

Remittances and payments: The CFPB asserts that financial institutions charge fees to stop payments, and on automated clearing house (ACH) or payment transfers, among other services.

International transfers are also subject to fees, including charges to make payments over the phone.

Prepaid accounts: While consumers may select a product based on a monthly rate, the CFPB notes that prepaid accounts often include fees for regularly conducted activities such as cash reloads or balance inquiries.

Mortgages:

Along with fees such as closing costs that are baked into the upfront cost of a mortgage, some borrowers may be charged fees for making a payment in a certain manner, such as over the phone or online.

Other loans: The CFPB notes that it is also interested in loan origination and loan servicing fees for student loans, auto loans, installment loans, payday loans and other types of loans.

The CFPB has requested that consumers, including those it has traditionally considered vulnerable and for whom there are dedicated offices within the CFPB  such as older consumers, students, service members and consumers of color  submit stories, data and information about how such fees have impacted their lives.

The CFPB made the same request of other stakeholders, such as small business owners, legal aid attorneys, academics and researchers, state and local government officials, and financial institutions, including small banks and credit unions.

The CFPB noted its particular interest in learning about consumers experiences with: Fees they believed were included in the baseline price of a product or service.

Unexpected or back-end fees for a product or service.

Fees that seemed excessive for a product or service.

Fees where it was unclear why they were charged."
Cooley,CFPB Requests Information on Consumer Financial Products or Services Fees,"Unexpected or back-end fees for a product or service.

Fees that seemed excessive for a product or service.

Fees where it was unclear why they were charged.

The CFPB suggested several topic areas that stakeholders may choose to comment on, such as the types of fees that obscure the true cost of the product or service by not being built into the upfront price, the obstacles to building fees into upfront prices, the existence of data and evidence that suggests consumers do or do not make decisions based on fees, and the oversight and/or policy tools the CFPB should use to address such fees.

Comments must be received on or before March 31, 2022.

Cooley,"Annual SEC Filing Deadline for Venture and Private Equity Funds Is February 14, 2022","Venture and private equity funds that own equity securities of public companies may have numerous Securities and Exchange Commission filing requirements, including filings based on the size of the holdings of a particular portfolio company, aggregate holdings of securities across all public portfolio companies, and filings triggered by the volume of sales and purchases of portfolio company equity securities.

Many of these filing requirements are annual or quarterly.

These filings are briefly described below.

Schedule 13G Funds (including their general partners and, in some cases, managing principals) that hold in excess of 5% of a class of public equity as of December 31, 2021, generally must file a Schedule 13G within 45 days of year-end.

Also, any fund that has previously filed a Schedule 13G with respect to a portfolio company must file an annual amendment to its Schedule 13G within 45 days of year-end if there have been any changes in ownership since the most recent filing  including an exit filing if the funds ownership has declined below 5%.

Form 13F Investment advisers who exercise investment discretion over Section 13(f) securities (generally equity securities of public companies) are required to file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter-end.

Subject to certain exceptions, if your funds collectively owned in excess of $100 million of Section 13(f) securities as of the last day of any month during the 2021 calendar year, you are obligated to file an initial Form 13F filing for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, within 45 days of calendar year-end.

In addition, the filing obligation continues for a minimum of three consecutive calendar quarters (i.e., March 31, June 30 and September 30).

It is important to note that even if you didnt meet the $100 million threshold as of December 31, the obligation to file a Form 13F remains if that threshold was met as of the last day of any single month during the calendar year.

Form 13H Investment advisers who have previously filed a Form 13H to register as a large trader are required to file an annual update to the filing within 45 days of year-end.

Large traders who have completed a full calendar year without exceeding any of the Form 13H triggering thresholds, measured across all portfolio companies, may be eligible to elect inactive status and thereby suspend certain ongoing large trader obligations.

These triggering thresholds are: (A) daily trading of at least (i) 2 million shares or (ii) $20 million in share value, or (B) calendar month trading of at least (i) 20 million shares or (ii) $200 million in share value, in each case, aggregating the trading activity of the securities of all portfolio companies during the relevant day or month.

In addition to the annual filing requirement, large traders are reminded that there is a quarterly obligation to make a prompt amendment following any quarter during which any of the information in the larger traders Form 13H materially changes.

Action required The determination of whether you have a Form 13F, Schedule 13G or Form 13H filing obligation is often complex.

Reach out to the Cooley fund formation team early to allow sufficient time for us to assist you in undertaking the necessary analysis to enable a timely filing, if required."

Cooley,CFPB Initiative to Oversee Institutional Lending and Servicing – What It Means for You,"Join the education and financial services enforcement groups for a short webinar on how to prepare for this CFPBinitiative.

Feb 3, 2022, 1:00 pm EST Register now Whats the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau up to?

On January 20, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau signaled a new front in its ongoing scrutiny of student loan origination and servicing practices by announcing an initiative to examine the lending and servicing practices of the schools themselves .

The CFPB has previously targeted for-profit higher education institutions, but this recent announcement suggests the broader deployment of bureau supervision staff to examine institutional lending practices at all colleges and universities.

The announcement also comes on the heels of last falls Federal Trade Commission issuance of 70 notices of penalty offense related to claims by for-profit institutions regarding graduates job and earnings prospects, as discussed in this CooleyED blog post .

In connection with its announcement, the CFPB helpfully unveiled revised Education Loan Examination Procedures that will guide future exams and announced a set of lending and servicing practices of particular concern.

Specifically, the bureau has singled out as problematic: Tying enrollment and transcript access restrictions to borrower delinquencies.

Acceleration of loans upon borrower withdrawal from an educational program.

Failure to properly issue to borrowers refunds due under those agreements when a borrower withdraws from the program.

Institutional arrangements with third-party lenders that may steer borrowers toward higher-priced loans.

While the CFPB called out specific practices of concern, it noted that its assessment of institutional lending practices will take place within the broader context of its private student lending and servicing examination playbook.

This suggests that examiners will be looking for compliance with a range of technical origination and servicing requirements, potential claims of unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, and whether the institution maintains a proper compliance management system to oversee its lending and servicing functions.

What should happen next?

Post-secondary schools with significant direct lending, brokering and/or servicing operations are likely unfamiliar with the CFPB, and they should immediately set out to understand their financing operations and what to expect.

This includes not only understanding the practices called out in the CFPBs press release, but more broadly ensuring that theyve built a sufficient compliance framework to support their lending and servicing operations.

Such a framework would consist of adequate management reporting, written policies and procedures, employee training, monitoring and testing, and operational compliance.

While Cooleys education practice has helped post-secondary institutions navigate a dynamic regulatory environment for more than four decades, Cooleys new financial services enforcement group is intimately familiar with the CFPB, and has long helped institutions prepare for and navigate CFPB examinations and investigations.

Cooley is happy to discuss the CFPBs initiative with individual institutions and help them get their operations ready for CFPB scrutiny."
Cooley,Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Thresholds Jump in 2022,"Basic size-of-transaction threshold now $101 million The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act thresholds, which govern when mergers and acquisitions must be reported to the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, will jump 9.8% in February 2022.

The basic size-of-transaction threshold will increase from $92 million to $101 million.

The FTC announced the annual revisions on January 21, 2022, based on the change in the US gross national product (GNP) in the governments last fiscal year.

The increases will go into effect on February 23, 2022.

This is the largest annual increase in the HSR thresholds since they became subject to annual adjustment in 2004 and follows a 2.1% decrease from 2020 to 2021.

The HSR Act requires that parties to mergers and acquisitions, including acquisitions of voting securities and assets, notify the DOJ and the FTC, and observe a statutory waiting period if the acquisition meets specified size-of-person and size-of-transaction thresholds and doesnt fall within an exemption to the HSR Act.

The waiting period, which is 30 days for most transactions, historically has been terminated early when transactions dont present substantive issues, but the Biden administration has at least temporarily stopped granting early termination .

In addition to adjustments to the minimum size-of-transaction threshold, the most significant adjustments are the following: The size-of-person test will increase from $184 million to $202 million and from $18.4 million to $20.2 million, with respect to the required level of annual net sales or total assets.

The larger size-of-transaction threshold, which is applicable even if the size-of-person test isnt met, will increase from $376 million to $403.9 million, which means that acquisitions of more than $403.9 million will be reportable regardless of whether the size-of-person threshold is met (unless an exemption applies).

In addition to adjustments to the jurisdictional thresholds, the FTC updated the filing fee tier thresholds and certain exemption thresholds applicable to HSRs mandatory reporting regime.

The filing fee levels will be adjusted as follows: A $45,000 filing fee will be required for transactions valued in excess of $101 million but below$202 million.

A $125,000 filing fee will be required for transactions valued from $202 million but below $1.0098 billion.

A $280,000 filing fee will be required for transactions valued at or above $1.0098 billion.

The FTC also announced revised dollar thresholds applicable to the size criteria applied under Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which governs the legality of interlocking directorates.

Competitor corporations are covered by Section 8 if each one has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $10 million (as adjusted), with the exception that no corporation is covered if the competitive sales of either corporation is less than $1 million (as adjusted).

The revised levels for these thresholds also increased to $41.034 million and $4.103 million, effective January 24, 2022.

Finally, the FTC earlier this month announced an adjustment to the maximum daily civil penalty for HSR violations, which is adjusted for inflation (unlike the HSR thresholds, which are adjusted based on changes in the GNP).

The current maximum daily civil penalty is now $46,517 per day, effective January 10, 2022, upon publication in the Federal Register.

HSR filing analyses, and determinations of which interlocking directorates may violate Section 8 of the Clayton Act, are highly technical.

Cooley,Year-End Reporting for ISO Exercises and ESPP Stock Transfers,"This alert serves as a reminder of certain year-end reporting requirements imposed under Section 6039 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to: Incentive stock option (ISO) exercises by current and former employees.

Transfers of stock acquired by current and former employees under a tax-qualified employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).

For each ISO exercise and ESPP stock transfer that occurred in 2021, the corporation must furnish an information statement to the current or former employee regarding such transaction no later than January 31, 2022, and it must file an information return with the IRS regarding such transaction no later than February 28, 2022 (or March 31, 2022, if filing electronically).

These reporting requirements are intended to provide current and former employees with sufficient information to enable them to calculate their tax obligations.

Employee information statement Every corporation that in 2021 issued stock upon the exercise of an ISO (meaning a stock option described in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code) must, on or before January 31, 2022, furnish to the current or former employee who exercised the option a written statement containing the information on Form 3921.

Copy A of Form 3921 is filed with the IRS, copy B is furnished to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained by the corporation for its records.

Form 3921 is available on the Internal Revenue Service website , but a copy A downloaded from the IRS website should not be filed.

The official printed version of this IRS form is scannable, but the online version of it, printed from the IRS website, is not.

The official form may be ordered from the IRS website .

Corporations should also note: A penalty of $280 per information return may be imposed for failing to file a correct form by the due date.

The penalty is lowered to $50 if corrected within 30 days (by March 30 if the due date is February 28), and is lowered to $110 if corrected by August1, 2022, up to an aggregate annual limit of $3,426,000, or $1,142,000 for small businesses.

Penalties will not apply to any failure that the corporation can show was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

Similarly, every corporation that in 2021 records or has recorded by its transfer agent an initial transfer by a current or former employee of stock acquired by such employee under an ESPP  meaning a plan that is established under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code  must, on or before January 31, 2022, furnish to the current or former employee whos transferring the stock a written statement containing the information on Form 3922 when the purchase price is either: Less than 100% of the value of the stock on the grant date.

Not fixed or determinable on the grant date.

Form 3922 is available on the IRS website .

Copy A of Form 3922 is filed with the IRS, copy B is furnished to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained by the corporation for its records.

As discussed above, the copy A that is filed with the IRS needs to be scannable.

Form of employee information statement The employee information statement must either be: Contained on the appropriate form (i.e., Form 3921 for ISO exercises or Form 3922 for ESPP stock transfers).

Contained on a substitute form that meets the format and content requirements in Publication 1179.

A separate form must be filed for each transaction and, if an employee has more than one transaction during the year, then each form must contain a unique account number, such as a number provided by equity tracking software.

However, if a substitute form is used, the company may aggregate transactions, providing a single form to each employee."
Cooley,Year-End Reporting for ISO Exercises and ESPP Stock Transfers,"However, if a substitute form is used, the company may aggregate transactions, providing a single form to each employee.

Delivery of employee information statement Employee information statements, either copy B of the applicable form or an acceptable substitute, may be mailed or delivered to the current or former employees last known address or may be sent electronically, provided that the person has given their consent to receive the statement electronically and the corporation meets certain other specified requirements.

IRS information return A corporation is required to file an information return with the IRS in addition to providing information statements to employees.

For exercises and transfers in 2021, the information returns must be filed no later than February 28, 2022 (or March 31, 2022, if filing electronically).

Companies filing 250 or more copies of Form 3921 or Form 3922 in a year (determined separately and not aggregated between them for purposes of this 250-form threshold) must file their information returns electronically.

The Taxpayer First Act of 2019, enacted July 1, 2019, authorized the US Treasury Department and the IRS to reduce the 250-return requirement, and regulations proposed in July 2021 reduced the 250-return threshold to 100 in 2022 and to 10 in 2023.

However, the proposed regulations have yet to be finalized, and the threshold remains at 250 until issuance of final regulations.

The information returns must contain the same information required by the Section 6039 regulations with respect to employee information statements.

Information returns for ISO exercises must be made on Form 3921, and information returns for ESPP stock transfers must be made on Form 3922.

It is possible to file Form 8809 to get an automatic 30-day extension to the due date for filing information returns.

Form 8809 is available on the IRS website , and the extension will only extend the due date for filing the returns with the IRS, not the due date for furnishing statements to recipients.

Information requirements As described above, the information that corporations must provide to a current or former employee in an information statement is the same information that corporations must report to the IRS in an information return.

When reporting this information, corporations should use the applicable form for both the information statement and the information return.

Also as described above, copy A of the applicable form is filed with the IRS, copy B is provided to the current or former employee, and copy C is retained for the corporations records.

Form 3921 for ISO exercises must contain: The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation transferring the shares.

The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the current or former employee to whom the shares were transferred pursuant to the exercise of the ISO.

The grant date, the exercise price per share, the date of exercise, the fair market value per share on the date of exercise and the number of shares transferred pursuant to the exercise of the ISO.

Form 3922 for ESPP stock transfers must contain: The name, address and employer identification number of the corporation whose shares were transferred.

The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the current or former employee who transferred the shares.

The date the purchase right was granted to the current or former employee, and the fair market value per share on the grant date.

The purchase date, the fair market value per share on the purchase date and the purchase price paid per share on the purchase date.

The number of shares to which legal title was transferred by the current or former employee, the date the legal title of the shares was first transferred by the current or former employee and, if the purchase price was not fixed or determinable on the grant date, the purchase price per share determined as if the shares were purchased on the grant date."

Cooley,Antitrust Trends to Look Out for in 2022,"One year into his administration, President Joe Biden has made clear that aggressive competition policy is on the agenda.

With a team of progressives filling leadership roles at the Federal Trade Commission and in the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice, companies are able to predict what the next several years may look like.

Lina Khan, a former Columbia Law professor, has headed the FTC since June15, 2021, and has filled top spots in the Bureau of Competition and Consumer Protection with former staffers of Rohit Chopra, who left the FTC in October.

Chopras proposed replacement, Alvaro Bedoya, was renominated on January 4, 2022, after his nomination deadlocked on a 1414 party line vote in December.

Meanwhile, Jonathan Kanter was sworn in to lead the Antitrust Division on November18, 2021.

Procedural upheavals have swept the merger review process, erecting new hurdles that merging parties must leap over, from the temporary suspension of early termination to the FTCs issuance of pre-consummation warning letters.

Substantively, merging companies are facing greater scrutiny and novel antitrust theories of harm.

Legislators have introduced a variety of bills that could lead to restrictions on conduct in the technology and life science sectors.

As 2022 kicks off, the Cooley antitrust team has highlighted below developments and trends that corporate counsel should be aware of  and that are likely to impact businesses in 2022 and beyond.

Increasing procedural hurdles to merger review New obstacles to the merger review process are significant.

As the increase in reportable transactions continues to strain agency resources, this trend may continue into 2022.

In February 2021, the FTC and the DOJ announced that they were temporarily suspending the granting of early termination.

It has yet to be fully reinstated, though the FTC clarified in March 2021 that early termination will be granted when the agencies conclude that a transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition or agree to a consent agreement resolving competitive concerns before the parties fully comply with outstanding second requests.

The FTC also introduced additional obstacles when it rescinded a 1995 Policy Statement on Prior Approval and Prior Notice Provisions by a 3-2 vote in July 2021.

The 1995 statement required prior approval and prior notice provisions only for parties who had previously consummated an unlawful merger when there was a credible risk of a future unlawful merger.

The rescission of the 1995 statement means that parties to FTC consent decrees must agree to obtain prior approval and give prior notice for future mergers in the same product and geographic market, which may put those firms at a disadvantage when competing to acquire future businesses.

Whether the FTC will continue administrative litigation to impose a prior approval order when parties abandon proposed transactions during litigation, as it did before 1995, remains to be seen.

In August 2021, the FTC announced it would begin sending letters notifying parties to certain transactions that its investigation is continuing, even past the 30-day statutory waiting period.

The letters warn that the agencys failing to challenge a transaction during the statutory 30-day waiting period does not indicate that the transaction has been approved, and that parties consummating transactions that have not been fully investigated do so at their own risk.

We are now seeing such letters issued on a regular basis, even when parties are not contacted during the initial Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, and are not in fact seeing an ongoing investigation, so the letters appear to be aimed simply at deterring transactions or in some cases, even years later, the agency learns new information and decides to investigate and challenge a transaction."
Cooley,Antitrust Trends to Look Out for in 2022,"Withdrawal of 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines In addition to the aforementioned procedural hurdles, the FTC introduced ambiguity to the merger review process when it withdrew its approval of the DOJ/FTC 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines in September 2021.

In its press release , the FTC stated that the guidelines include unsound economic theories that are unsupported by the law or market realities and that it was withdrawing its approval to prevent industry or judicial reliance on a flawed approach.

The FTCs shift signals that vertical mergers will be more closely scrutinized, as the FTC explores new theories of vertical harm.

Notably, the DOJ did not withdraw its approval of the 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines, which continue to provide transparency and guidance for deals pending before that agency.

By withdrawing its approval, the FTC has increased the risk for divergence in outcomes between the two federal antitrust enforcement agencies.

The FTC has indicated that new guidance is in the works, with a focus on the characteristics of transactions that are likely to be challenged, expansion of harms identified in the 2020 guidelines, and guidance on remedies to address vertical concerns.

Companies may expect to see new guidance, likely issued jointly by the DOJ and FTC, in 2022.

In the meantime, parties must navigate vertical merger analysis with a lack of transparency.

Antitrust reform movement of 2021 During 2021, major pieces of legislation aimed at antitrust enforcement in key industries, including Big Tech and life sciences, were introduced.

The Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act (CALERA), introduced by Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in February, seeks to give the FTC more power to block mergers and acquisitions.

Provisions aimed at doing so include lowering the threshold for assessing whether a merger or acquisition is prohibited under the Clayton Act from the current standard of may substantially lessen competition to creat[ing] an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition.

1 CALERA would also shift the burden to companies to affirmatively prove that their merger or acquisition would not harm competition.

These provisions, together with an increase in the FTCs budget and the establishment of an FTC division to study the effects of past mergers, would make it easier for the government to challenge transactions.

Another notable bill, the Platform Competition and Opportunity Act, introduced by Klobuchar and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton as a bipartisan effort in November, shares significant elements with CALERA.

The bill is focused on blocking acquisitions in the dominant online platform industry, by similarly shifting the burden to force tech companies to prove that proposed mergers and acquisitions are not anticompetitive.

2 FTC updates to rulemaking processes also seek to enhance enforcement, empowered by Bidens July executive order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy which, in part, encouraged agencies to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws, including through rulemaking.

That same month, the FTC approved changes to its rulemaking process to facilitate issuance of new FTC unfair and deceptive acts and practices (UDAP) rules.

Changes include shifting oversight from an administrative law judge to the FTC chair, eliminating a staff report on proceedings and cutting public comment periods.

A recent FTC solicitation for public comments on contract terms that may harm competition, which may lead to limits on use of exclusive contracts, and FTC/DOJ workshop on noncompete agreements may foreshadow future rules limiting common business practices.

Labor markets and ESG  antitrust beyond the headlines Antitrust considerations for 2022 go beyond the press headlines highlighting enforcement challenging mergers and taking aim at high-tech and life sciences companies."
Cooley,Antitrust Trends to Look Out for in 2022,"Recent months have witnessed increased enforcement of conduct affecting competition in labor markets, a priority of the antitrust enforcers in the Biden administration.

3 DOJ has now brought four criminal cases that allege collusion in labor markets, including its first-ever criminal indictment of a no-poach agreement, making true on its promise to criminally prosecute such conduct.

4 Following the DOJs case against a former healthcare staffing company owner and, later, an ex-director, for conspiring to fix rates paid to physical therapists and therapist assistants, the DOJ brought several new charges against individuals and companies in healthcare and other sectors.

The DOJ recently scored a victory when a federal court declined a motion to dismiss of the DOJs charges against the two individuals, who had attempted to have the charges tossed on account of the lack of precedent in criminal charges for wage-fixing.

In the order denying the motion to dismiss, the judge found that the indictment alleges a naked price-fixing conspiracy that is per se unlawful.

While other defendants try to advance similar arguments against the DOJs criminal suits, how these arguments will resolve in the courts remains to be seen.

Continued antitrust focus on labor markets is expected in 2022.

Following Bidens July executive order declaring the policy of his administration to enforce the antitrust laws in labor markets, the DOJ and the FTC hosted a joint workshop on promoting competition in labor markets.

Assistant Attorney General Kanter asserted that principles for addressing and preventing concentration in the horizontal merger guidelines apply just as much to labor markets as in any other market, while FTC Chair Khan said her agency is committed to investigating potentially unlawful transactions or anticompetitive conduct that harms workers and further committed the FTC to consider competitive issues arising from noncompetition agreements through enforcement and rulemaking.

With respect to mergers, the primary concern appears to be that mergers that lead to market concentration may result in monopsony power over labor, leading agency staff members to ask about mergers leading to layoffs, historically seen as procompetitive by reducing costs.

Environmental, social and governance considerations are also poised to intersect with antitrust law.

Indeed, the FTC has started inquiring about ESG practices in investigating mergers.

Additionally, ESG initiatives  which Biden has promoted over the past year  may require navigation around antitrust issues regarding competitor collaborations.

AMG : Boon or bust?

For decades, the FTC has used Section 13(b) as its primary recourse to collect money from companies it deemed to have committed unfair or deceptive practices in violation of the FTC Act.

While Section 13(b) only explicitly allows the FTC to seek injunctive relief, federal courts had previously ruled that the agency could also seek equitable monetary relief, including restitution and disgorgement.

These rulings allowed the FTC to use the federal courts as a one-stop shop for altering behavior and collecting money versus the more lengthy and arduous administrative process.

Additionally, the FTC was able to use the threat of Section 13(b) as a way to seek monetary settlements from investigation targets.

However, in April 2021, the US Supreme Court in AMG Capital Management v. FTC unanimously ruled that the FTC does not have authority to seek monetary relief under Section 13(b).

While some thought the AMG decision was a boon for companies, it may be akin to kicking a hornets nest.

Even before the AMG decision was issued, FTC commissioners were discussing alternative means of enforcement that would allow the FTC to seek monetary remedies while also imploring Congress to reinstate its broader Section 13(b) authority."
Cooley,Antitrust Trends to Look Out for in 2022,"In the months that have followed AMG , the FTC has continued to seek monetary relief in federal court under other statutes, including civil penalties of up to $43,792 per violation, with each day being a separate violation for ongoing activities, which can amount to extraordinary sums.

The FTC has sent out several thousand Notices of Penalty Offenses to companies with the goal of being able to prove under Section 5(m)(1)(B) that these companies had actual knowledge that certain practices have been found to violate the FTC Act.

Return to Obama-era standard-essential patents antitrust policy

The DOJ has signaled a shift in its approach to standard-essential patents (SEPs), that is, patents considered essential for implementers of a standard articulated by a standard-setting organization (SSO) to exercise when implementing the standard.

Under the Obama administration, the DOJ expressed concern that SEP holders could violate the antitrust laws by engaging in patent hold-up, that is, exercising power to extract higher royalties or other licensing terms that reflect the absence of competitive alternatives because the SSO chose it as the standard.

In line with this concern, in 2013, the DOJ and the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued guidance stating that while it may be appropriate in some circumstances for a SEP holder to seek injunctive relief against infringing implementers, the public interest may preclude the issuance of an exclusion order in cases where the infringer is acting within the scope of the patent holders F/RAND commitment and is able, and has not refused, to license on F/RAND terms.

Under the Trump administration, the DOJ shifted to what it called a New Madison approach, where it considered concerted efforts of implementers to engage in patent hold-out (where implementers delay making royalty payments to SEP holders) a more significant antitrust concern than patent hold-up.

The DOJ characterized hold-up as fundamentally not an antitrust problem but instead an issue where contract or common law remedies would be adequate.

In 2019, the DOJ and the PTO rescinded the 2013 guidance and issued new guidance advising that injunctive relief should be made available to SEP holders.

Under the Biden administration, the DOJ has backed away from the New Madison approach as being overly favorable to SEP holders.

Most recently, on December6, 2021, the DOJ and the PTO announced that they were reviewing the 2019 joint guidance and issued new draft guidance for public comment , stating that monetary remedies will usually be adequate to fully compensate a SEP holder for infringement.

Congress targets pharmaceutical industry pricing and business practices On December 10, 2021, the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform released a 269-page report publishing findings from a three-year investigation into the pharmaceutical industry.

The report focuses on pricing and business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, finding that companies have engaged in strategies to suppress competition and maintain monopoly pricing.

According to the report, companies have specifically targeted the U.S. market for higher prices, even while cutting prices in other countries, because weaknesses in our health care system have allowed them to get away with outrageous prices and anticompetitive conduct.

The report details three practices: It asserts that pharmaceutical companies have raised prices with abandon, especially when they succeed in delaying or blocking competition.

It asserts companies have manipulated the patent system and marketing exclusivities granted by the Food and Drug Administration to extend their monopolies far longer than lawmakers envisioned when they created these systems.

It argues all the companies the Committee investigated have employed anticompetitive strategies to suppress generic competition."
Cooley,Antitrust Trends to Look Out for in 2022,"It argues all the companies the Committee investigated have employed anticompetitive strategies to suppress generic competition.

With this report fresh in lawmakers minds going in to 2022, pharmaceutical companies can expect to see a continued focus on competition in the industry.

Like the October 2020 House Judiciary Committees report on Competition in Digital Markets, this report may well lead to legislative proposals.

New scrutiny for tech and life science deals across the pond In April 2021, the European Commission accepted the referral of Illuminas proposed acquisition of GRAIL under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation.

Article 22 allows member states to refer transactions to the EC for review, even when they are not required to notify the EU or any member state.

Article 22 referrals are possible if the turnover of one of the parties is found to not reflect its actual or future competitive position, or where the value of the transaction is disproportionately high compared to the targets current turnover.

The ECs guidance points specifically to the digital and pharmaceutical sectors for which innovation is a key parameter and research and development results are not yet commercialized at the time of the acquisition.

In practice, this means we are likely to see more cases like Illumina and GRAIL.

Given the ECs view on a broad application of Article 22, a large number of transactions are at least theoretically exposed to EU review, which can result in substantial delays of up to 40 working days, or eight weeks, for transactions that do not raise significant issues.

In the future, merging parties need to plan and take this new referral procedure into account when negotiating transaction documents and timelines.

As the number of Article 22 cases increases, it is expected that the EC will codify procedural considerations to provide more certainty.

New rules for distribution agreements in the EU

The EUs Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (VBER) and Vertical Guidelines govern distribution agreements.

In July 2021, the EC published proposals to replace the current regime, which is set to expire on May 31, 2022.

The EC claims that the current rules require reform, as they lack clarity and have not adapted to the growth of online sales and the emergence of new market players, including online platforms.

Concurrently, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering a Vertical Agreements Block Exemption Order tailored specifically to business and consumers in the UK, which would widen its powers.

In parallel, the CMA is at the consultation stage to review its two Horizontal Block Exemption Regulations covering research and development and specialization agreements, which are set to expire.

Cooley,"Export Control Reminder: Encryption Reporting Deadline Is February 1, 2022","The deadline for submitting reports regarding certain exports of encryption items under the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) is February 1, 2022.Two types of reports are subject to the deadline: Annual self-classification reports for certain encryption items exported or re-exported under paragraph (b)(1) of License Exception ENC during calendar year 2021 (January1 through December31, 2021).

Semiannual reports for specified encryption items exported or re-exported under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(iii) of License Exception ENC between July1 and December31, 2021.

In addition, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the US Commerce Department amended the encryption controls and License Exception ENC, effective March 29, 2021, resulting in the following changes to the above reporting requirements: Mass market chips, chipsets, electronic assemblies and field-programmable logic devices classified under export control classification numbers (ECCNs) 5A992.c or 5D992.c (except for such items implementing non-standard cryptography) now fall under paragraph (b)(1) of License Exception ENC and are subject to the annual self-classification reporting requirement, unless a formal commodity classification (i.e., CCATS) has been obtained from BIS.

Such items previously fell under paragraph (b)(3) of License Exception ENC and required a CCATS.

Mass market cryptographic libraries, modules, development kits and toolkits classified under ECCNs 5A992.c or 5D992.c (except for such items implementing non-standard cryptography) now fall under paragraph (b)(1) of License Exception ENC, but are no longer subject to the annual self-classification reporting or mandatory classification requirements.

Such items previously fell under paragraph (b)(3) of License Exception ENC and required submission of a CCATS request.

Other mass market items classified under ECCNs 5A992.c or 5D992.c remain under paragraph (b)(1) of License Exception ENC, but are no longer subject to the annual self-classification reporting requirement.

Publicly available encryption source code and beta test encryption software classified under ECCN 5D002 (except for such items implementing non-standard cryptography) are no longer subject to an email notification requirement.

A few notes regarding the reporting requirements: We can provide templates and instructions that you can use to prepare and submit the reports.

Most mass market encryption products classified under ECCNs 5A992 and 5D992 are no longer subject to an annual reporting requirement.

Companies that have obtained a CCATS for certain encryption products arent required to submit annual self-classification reports.

Please contact us to learn more about how to obtain a CCATS from BIS and eliminate your annual self-classification reporting burden going forward.

The new year is also a good time to conduct an export compliance checkup, including an assessment of any new product offerings or changes to the encryption functionality of existing products.

Cooley,US Supreme Court Blocks OSHA’s Vaccine-or-Test Mandate,"On January 13, 2022, the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) granted the consolidated applications for stays of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration emergency temporary standard (ETS), including the vaccine-or-test mandate, on the grounds that OSHA had exceeded its regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.

Specifically, the majority SCOTUS opinion analyzed the authority granted to OSHA under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act and ruled that OSHAs authority under the act was limited to occupational safety hazards, whereas COVID-19 is a general risk that is not particular to the workplace.

SCOTUS did not block the vaccine mandate applicable to workers in nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities that receive federal funds.

Must employers implement the OSHA ETS mandate?

No. SCOTUS blocked the OSHA ETS vaccine-or-test mandate pending further proceedings.

What is the likely future of the OSHA ETS mandate?

The enforceability of the OSHA ETS mandate is cast into serious doubt by the ruling.

While SCOTUS only ruled on whether the mandate should be stayed pending a final resolution of the lawsuit regarding its enforceability, it held that the applicants seeking to invalidate the OSHA ETS are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Secretary lacked authority to impose the mandate.

To that end, the premise of the decision  that OSHA lacked statutory authority  cuts to the core of the issue of whether the mandate is enforceable, and thus it is unlikely that it would ultimately be upheld.

What if an employer already implemented a vaccination policy or other measures called for by the OSHA ETS?

An employer is not prohibited from voluntarily maintaining a vaccination policy or implementing the other measures in the OSHA ETS, subject to state or local laws that prohibit or limit such policies, as well as anti-discrimination laws.

What about local and state laws requiring vaccination?

All local and state laws unrelated to the OSHA ETS requiring masks, vaccination or related protocols remain in effect.

It remains to be seen whether US states, which have broader authority to regulate health and safety issues, will impose their own mandatory vaccination policies or will expressly prohibit them.

Some states already have statutes that limit employers ability to implement a mandatory vaccination policy and these statutes, which would have been preempted by the OSHA ETS, remain in effect.

What about the federal contractor vaccine mandate?

The federal contractor vaccine mandate was blocked nationwide by a Georgia federal court, and in Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky by a Kentucky federal court.

There are pending appeals of those decisions that also may reach SCOTUS.

The vaccine mandate applicable to federal contractors is not being enforced by the federal government while lawsuits and related appeals make their way through the legal system.

If you have any questions about or related to the vaccine mandates, please reach out to a member of the Cooley employment team."

Cooley,Joint Employer Lessons From Mass. Contractor Test Ruling,"Editor's note: Authored by Charlotte Drew, Bronwyn Roberts and Claire Metcalfe, this article was originally published in Law360 .

On Dec. 13, 2021, Massachusetts' highest court held that the multifactor standard of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and not the Massachusetts independent contractor law's so-called ABC test, determines joint employer status under state law.

This decision brings welcome relief for businesses that now have meaningful guidance for structuring their relationships with contractors, service providers and vendors, and limiting their exposure to employment laws in Massachusetts.

Background In Jinks v. Credico USA LLC,[1] Credico, a client broker for independent direct marketing companies, contracted with DFW Consultants Inc. to provide sales and marketing services, including door-to-door and face-to-face sales services, for Credico's nationwide clients.

DFW in turn hired the plaintiffs as salespeople.

DFW classified the plaintiffs as independent contractors, without any input from Credico.

The plaintiffs sought to hold Credico liable under a joint employer theory for their alleged misclassification and violations of Massachusetts wage and hour laws, including failure to pay minimum wage and overtime.[2]

The Supreme Judicial Court Adopts the FLSA Test The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that: Massachusetts wage and hour laws ""include the concept of joint employment""; and The standard for determining joint employer status is the multifactor, ""totality of the circumstances"" test applied under the FLSA.

First, the court explained that ordinarily, only the employing entity is liable for misclassification under the wage laws.

An exception exists, however, when an entity that does not directly employ the workers is nonetheless a joint employer because it retains sufficient control over the employment terms and conditions for the employees at issue.

The Supreme Judicial Court held that the Massachusetts wage laws, ""which neither define 'employer' nor expressly provide for 'joint employers,' include this long-standing concept of joint employment.

""[3] Second, the court held that the appropriate test to determine whether an entity is a joint employer is the multifactor, totality-of-the-circumstances test used to determine joint employer status under the FLSA.

Under that test, courts consider the totality of circumstances of the relationship between the employee and the entity, guided by a framework of four factors: whether the entity (1) had the power to hire and fire the individual, (2) supervised and controlled the individual's work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained employment records.[4]

In so holding, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the ABC test should apply.

The ABC test, ordinarily employed to determine if a worker can be classified as an independent contractor, asks whether (1) the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact; and (2) the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer; and, (3) the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.[5]

The Supreme Judicial Court explained that the joint employer inquiry ""focuses on whether an individual, whose work is controlled by one entity, is also subject to the control of another entity.

""[6] In contrast, the ABC test asks ""who, if anyone, controls the work other than the worker herself,""[7] as articulated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in its 2018 Browning-Ferris Industries of California Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board decision.

Thus, the FLSA test is better tailored to answer the question presented by the joint employer inquiry."
Cooley,Joint Employer Lessons From Mass. Contractor Test Ruling,"Thus, the FLSA test is better tailored to answer the question presented by the joint employer inquiry.

The Supreme Judicial Court Finds No Joint Employer Status

In affirming summary judgment for Credico, the court held that the plaintiffs could not establish that Credico exercised sufficient control over their terms of employment to qualify as a joint employer, and therefore could not be liable for any misclassification or violations of the wage laws.

The court relied on the two agreements that governed the relationship between Credico and DFW: a 2013 subcontractor agreement and a 2015 services agreement.

The 2013 subcontractor agreement provided that, while DFW employees were required to comply with Credico's business ethics and conduct code, DFW otherwise retained sole discretion with respect to the manner and means of carrying out assignments.

The agreement provided that DFW was responsible for preparing all tax filings, and for workers' compensation, Medicare and Medicaid.

It also provided that payment to DFW would be made in accordance with a commission schedule contained in the agreement, but made no provision for how DFW would pay the plaintiffs.

Credico paid DFW based on types of sales, and DFW was responsible for compensating the plaintiffs pursuant to its own policies.[8]

Likewise, the 2015 services agreement gave DFW sole discretion over the manner and means of its services, and exclusive control over labor and employee relations policies; policies relating to wages, hours and working conditions; and all personnel decisions.

Credico provided DFW with access to a data portal that tracked the number of salespersons working each day and required DFW to ensure that its salespersons complied with certain regulatory requirements, like background checks and nondisclosure agreements.[9]

Moreover, the Supreme Judicial Court noted that although the plaintiffs reported to the DFW office at the beginning and end of each day, the plaintiffs' work was done in the field.

The plaintiffs had never met or communicated with anyone employed by Credico or visited a Credico office.[10] With respect to the fourth factor, maintenance of employment records, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the data portal provided by Credico showed Credico's maintenance of employment records for DFW salespersons.

Rather, the court pointed to evidence in the record that ""Credico [did not receive] any reports as to the activity or employment of specific salespersons.

""[11] Practical Takeaways for Massachusetts Businesses Although the Supreme Judicial Court warned that ""the determination whether an entity is a joint employer is 'not a mechanical determination'"" and all relevant factors are considered,[12] important lessons can be gleaned from this decision that can help businesses structure their relationships with subcontractors and vendors to limit exposure to wage and hour laws.

Businesses should consider each of the four factors contained in the FLSA test as they evaluate their contractor and service agreements.

Small changes can make a significant difference in avoiding liability under the Massachusetts wage laws, which carry hefty damages and attorney fees.

Service agreements should clearly document that contractors, particularly staffing agencies, maintain complete control over the manner and means of employment of workers, including the day-to-day work of performing the services.

Service agreements should clearly document that a contractor has the power to hire and fire its workers, and make other personnel decisions, including those related to promotions, discipline, training and staffing.

Maintaining control over regulatory or safety requirements is acceptable, but discipline for violations of such policies and termination decisions should remain with the contractor.

Businesses should avoid a direct economic relationship with a contractor's employees."
Cooley,Joint Employer Lessons From Mass. Contractor Test Ruling,"Businesses should avoid a direct economic relationship with a contractor's employees.

All decisions concerning the method and manner of payment of the contractor's employees should be left to the contractor.

The court's decision represents rare relief for Massachusetts employers by narrowing the scope of joint employment, but businesses should still proceed with caution when engaging with staffing agencies to avoid costly violation of the Massachusetts wage laws.
