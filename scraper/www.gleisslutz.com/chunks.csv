Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NEW “MAINTENANCE AND ALIGNMENT” PACKAGE OF MEASURES AGAINST RUSSIA,"The EU tightened existing economic sanctions against Russia on 21 July 2022 in response to Russia’s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.

The new “maintenance and alignment” package of measures builds on the sanctions packages of 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ), 28 February/2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ), 16 March 2022 ( newsletter of 18 March 2022 ), 9 April 2022 ( newsletter of 12 April 2022 ) and most recently 3/4 June 2022 ( newsletter of 9 June 2022 ) .

The aim is to optimise and strengthen existing measures.

The new sanctions include a ban on the import, purchase or transfer of Russian-origin gold, the country’s most important export commodity after energy.

The G7 states had already agreed on this step at their recent summit in late June held in Elmau, Germany.

The EU has also amended some of the trade-related and financial sanctions, expanding the list of products and technology under Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

Further individuals and entities, including major Russian financial institution Sberbank, have also been listed.

In a move to bolster the effectiveness of previous measures to freeze assets ( see our newsletter of 9 June 2022 ), the EU has updated reporting requirements, with sanctioned persons now required to disclose and report their assets in the EU.

In addition to tightening sanctions, the package also eases existing restrictions, with the aim of reducing negative consequences for global food and energy security.

Exemptions have been extended to exports for medical purposes and petroleum products and foodstuffs, for example.

Some existing sanctions have also been clarified.

EU sanctions The EU’s package of measures (Regulations (EU) 2022/1269 and 2022/1273 and Implementing Regulations (EU) 2022/1274 and 2022/1270) tightens and adapts the existing sanctions against Russia.

The measures affect in particular the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and the financial and trade sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 .

The EU has introduced personal sanctions against a further 54 individuals and ten entities, bringing the current totals to 1,229 individuals and 110 entities.

Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons listed in Annex I to the Regulation.

No funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of these persons.

Natural persons are also banned from travelling to and through EU territories (see our newsletters of 7 March 2022 , 12 April 2022 and 9 June 2022 ).

The list in Annex I to the Regulation now includes six Syrian nationals as well as one entity involved in the recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

The EU sees the Syrian regime as providing military support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.

A number of further Russian politicians, including the mayor of Moscow, have been listed as well as entrepreneurs, soldiers and – to prevent circumventions – relatives of people already listed.

The nationalist motorcycle club, the Night Wolves, and its members as well as a Russian actor and individuals spreading pro-Russian propaganda are now also on the list.

The EU has now also included Sberbank , a move that was already expected as part of the last sanctions package when other major financial institutions were listed.

Sberbank is Russia’s largest bank and accounts for about a quarter of aggregate Russian banking assets and a third of banking capital.

It is largely owned by the Russian government and generates high revenues for it.

While Sberbank was excluded from participating in SWIFT, the international payments system, as part of the third sanctions package ( see our newsletter of 7 March 2022 ),this new listing and accompanying freezing of funds and other assets is tantamount to a complete ban on transactions."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NEW “MAINTENANCE AND ALIGNMENT” PACKAGE OF MEASURES AGAINST RUSSIA,"The EU has introduced one major exemption, however: The ban does not apply to payments relating to agricultural products.

Listed banks can still process payments of this type.

As well as adding names to the list, the EU has expanded the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014, requiring listed persons to report assets they hold in the EU.

This is to ensure effective and uniform implementation of the Regulation by Member States and to prevent circumvention of the asset freeze: This disclosure and reporting requirement , which has been introduced in Article 9(2) of the Regulation, applies to listed persons, entities or bodies from 1 September 2022 or within six weeks from the date of listing, whichever is later, towards the competent authority of the Member State where such funds or economic resources are located.

Failure to comply is deemed circumvention of the freezing of assets and may be subject to a fine or even a criminal penalty under applicable national law.

The EU has also adopted measures expanding and tightening financial and trade sanctions : The restrictions on gold originating in Russia have attracted extensive media coverage.

They include a prohibition on the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of such gold as well as on providing related assistance or brokering services.

The G7 states had already agreed on this step, which has been justified by the EU on the grounds that gold is Russia’s most significant export after energy and that this move could help reduce Russia’s revenues.

The EU sees this as a clear signal of its determination to keep up the pressure on Russia for as long as Russia continues its aggression against Ukraine.

The gold embargo introduced in Article 3o Regulation (EU) 883/2014 relates to gold originating in Russia and exported from Russia to the EU or a third country after 22 July 2022.

This embargo applies not only to unprocessed gold, but also gold products that have been processed in a third country using sanctioned unprocessed gold.

Exceptions apply to gold products for personal use of natural persons or for the official purposes of consular posts or international organisations.

However, these restrictions are not likely to have far-reaching consequences in practice : For one thing, only about 5% of Russian gold exports go to the EU – however, the U.S. and the UK, both more significant buyers, have already adopted their own embargoes on Russian gold.

The EU gold embargo will probably affect Germany even less than the EU as a whole:

According to the Central Association of German Goldsmiths, Silversmiths and Jewellers, Germany buys most of its gold from refineries in which gold is recycled, and not from Russia directly.

Since the previous sanctions already more or less excluded the six largest Russian gold producers from the European and U.S. markets from March onwards, this is not likely to have much more of an impact.

Difficulty in determining the origin of the gold may also limit the effectiveness of these new measures, creating opportunities for circumventing the ban.

The package also extends export controls on dual-use goods and advanced technology .

50 entries have been added to the corresponding list in Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

It now includes, for example, protective equipment for security forces and equipment needed for natural gas fracking and uranium enrichment, as well as special chemicals and machine tools, for example for manufacturing weapons or drills, and other high-tech goods.

However, in addition to these tightened restrictions, the new measures also adjust existing sanctions by expanding existing exemptions from bans on exports and transactions, on the one hand, and optimising or clarifying the scope of application, on the other."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NEW “MAINTENANCE AND ALIGNMENT” PACKAGE OF MEASURES AGAINST RUSSIA,"The already existing exemption from the prohibition on transactions with certain state-owned enterprises (“ transaction ban ”) has been expanded to include transactions relating to agricultural products and the supply of oil to third countries.

The EU wants to avoid any measures that could cause food insecurity around the world.

The EU’s measures are not aimed at the trade in agricultural and food products or pharmaceutical and medical products between third countries and Russia.

Article 3k(5)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014, new version, specifies that the competent authorities of the Member States may now grant licences for goods and technology that, strictly speaking, are subject to the export ban under Article 3k(1)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 in accordance with Annex XXIII if they have determined that such goods and technologies are necessary for medical, pharmaceutical or humanitarian purposes.

This revision was necessary given that the list of goods in Annex XXIII that could contribute in particular to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities is very wide-ranging and extensive ( see our last newsletter of 9 June 2022 ).

The amended Article 5aa(3) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 provides for similar exemptions from the bans in connection with petroleum products and foodstuffs.

It now contains an exemption from the otherwise complete ban on transactions with the Russian companies listed in Annex XXI relating to petroleum and refined petroleum products, as well as agricultural products and foodstuffs.

The prohibition – introduced in Article 3ea(1) Regulation (EU) 883/2014 as part of the fifth sanctions package ( see our newsletter of 12 April 2022 – on providing access to ports in EU territory to any vessel registered under the flag of Russia has been expanded to include locks in order to ensure effective implementation of the sanction and to prevent circumvention, e.g. by transferring cargo just outside the port.

An instance of this has supposedly already been witnessed in Northern Germany.

The EU has provided further clarification with regard to the prohibition in Article 5k Regulation (EU) 833/2014 concerning the award of public contracts.

Furthermore, Article 3c(9) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has been clarified so as not to impede the work of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on the establishment of technical industrial standards; the EU has also amended further regulations to ensure access to justic e. U.S. sanctions The U.S. Treasury Department took a similar approach to the EU’s current sanctions package on 14 June 2022, when it exempted transactions with Russian banks in the energy sector from sanctions up to 5 December 2022.

Transactions relating to liquefied natural gas (LNG), petroleum products and natural gas, coal, wood, uranium and nuclear energy, as well as transactions relating to thermal energy and in the field of renewable energies, are now permitted again.

On 27 June 2022, in a joint statement in support of Ukraine, the G7 states expressed their intention to sustain and intensify international economic and political pressure on Russia and its enablers in Belarus through coordinated sanctions measures.

The stated common aim is to isolate Russia from participating in the global market and reduce its revenues, as well as to restrict its access to industrial inputs and services which support its armament and technology sector.

In line with this joint statement, the U.S. has likewise prohibited the import of Russian gold and imposed sanctions on 70 additional Russian entities and 29 individuals, mainly from the military-industrial sector.

These personal sanctions primarily involve the aviation sector, including the key Russian companies UAC, Tupolev and Irkut.

Additional U.S. sanctions came into force on 7 July 2022, this time in relation to the Russian consulting sector."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NEW “MAINTENANCE AND ALIGNMENT” PACKAGE OF MEASURES AGAINST RUSSIA,"Additional U.S. sanctions came into force on 7 July 2022, this time in relation to the Russian consulting sector.

Under the new rules, U.S. companies and individuals are now prohibited from providing accounting, trust, and consulting services in Russia relating to corporate formation and management.

We reported on these sanctions in our newsletter of 9 June 2022 .

Conclusion and outlook: maintenance and alignment, but not a “fully-fledged sanctions package” While the G7 states have committed themselves to the common goal of optimising and intensifying the existing sanctions, there is no such agreement among all of the states currently imposing sanctions on Russia on the specific extent of these; not all of the Member States are on the same page with regard to the EU’s sanctions policy.

Since EU sanctions can only be decided unanimously by the Member States, this will continue to be a problem in the future.

The objection is frequently raised, and not only from the Member States, that the sanctions are having less of an effect on Russia than on themselves.

The African Union in particular has voiced such criticism, blaming the EU for the current food shortages.

The EU therefore found it important, when adopting the “maintenance and alignment” package, to point out that none of these measures target in any way the trade in agricultural and food products between third countries and Russia.

This also explains the exemptions described therein, which are aimed at avoiding any negative impact on global food security and medical care.

The EU also clarified once again that its sanctions are not binding on third countries.

The extent of the newly enacted sanctions falls short of that of previous packages which is why the EU is not officially designating it as a sanctions package.

This is not surprising given the large number of sanctions already in place.

Nevertheless, these are important new rules whose impact should not be underestimated.

The clarifications and adjustments the EU has now made (for example with regard to export authorisations pursuant to Article 3k(5) Regulation (EU) 833/2014) are to be welcomed.

This is in response to possible “drafting errors” which crept in due to the need to adopt sanctions legislation as quickly as possible.

The EU should continue this process and, for instance, allow for possible exemptions from the – very wide-ranging – import ban in Article 3i Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (for example if critical infrastructures/industries within the EU could be affected as a consequence of this ban – as can already be seen in practice).

Even if new far-reaching sanctions are not to be expected in the near future, it can be assumed that the current sanctions will remain in force for a long time – as recently as 26 July 2022, the EU resolved to extend them until 31 January 2023 – and that they will be further adjusted and optimised.

It is therefore still important to keep a watchful eye not only on the existing EU and U.S. sanctions, but also on the equally extensive Russian countersanctions.

There has been another interesting development in the area of EU criminal sanctions: On 7 July 2022, the EU resolved to harmonise legislation on criminal sanctions – currently the purview of the individual Member States – throughout the EU.

It would then be possible to adopt EU-wide minimum standards for the definition and prosecution of violations of EU sanctions, which the Member States would then transpose into national law."
Gleiss Lutz,U.S. DOJ PUBLISHES REVISIONS TO CORPORATE CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT POLICY,"The U.S. Department of Justice (""DoJ"") has announced a tightened corporate criminal enforcement policy: ""a combination of carrots and sticks"" On 15 September 2022, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco announced a strengthened corporate criminal enforcement policy.

The DoJ has clarified its position with regard to five core areas: (1) individual accountability, (2) corporate recidivism, (3) self-reporting and cooperation, (4) monitorships, and (5) corporate culture and compliance programs.

Key takeaways: The DoJ emphasizes self-disclosure, cooperation and remediation as “the clearest path” for companies to avoid a guilty plea or an indictment (""carrot"").

However, in exchange the company must cooperate ""fully"".

With these changes, the DoJ has considerably tightened the requirements for ""full"" cooperation.

If the company does not cooperate or does not cooperate fully, there is a considerable increased risk that it will only be possible to reach a settlement that includes an admission of guilt (plea agreement), high fines, and the appointment of a compliance monitor (""stick"").

As part of the ""full"" cooperation, the DoJ will now require that particularly relevant information be passed on to the DoJ ""promptly"" as soon as it is discovered.

Delays, even if due to (further) internal investigations, can jeopardize the cooperation credit.

Going forward, the DoJ intends to settle criminal proceedings against companies only if there is a concrete plan for prosecuting the individuals involved.

This means that companies should cooperate with DoJ investigations against individuals (i.e. employees) if they are seeking a settlement for the company.

In practice, this is likely to jeopardize employees’ cooperation in a company’s own internal investigations.

In an attempt to allay such concerns, the DoJ says that the company ""only"" has to provide the facts and not a (criminal legal) assessment.

In practice, however, this subtle distinction often makes no difference to those implicated.

The DoJ recognizes that data privacy laws can make it difficult to hand over information located outside of the U.S. To obtain cooperation credit under these circumstances, the company needs to substantiate the restrictions imposed by data privacy laws, use all available legal bases for processing the information, and identify ""reasonable alternatives"" for providing the requested information.

A history of misconduct by the company remains relevant for the DoJ, especially if the misconduct stemmed from the same cause or happened under the same management.

If one company takes over another, the acquirer must immediately address any compliance issues within the target company.

The DoJ expects companies to implement internal processes that govern the use of personal devices and messenger services for business purposes.

The cooperation credit is contingent on the company being able to collect and hand over relevant business information from private devices as well – in other words, these actions must also be permissible under data protection law.

Compliance can also be managed through employee remuneration.

Going forward, the DoJ will specifically look at whether there are clawback clauses in contracts and whether companies specifically reward compliance – not only on paper, but also in practice.

Assessment In October 2021, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco established a multidisciplinary working group (the Corporate Crime Advisory Group) and tasked it with a top-to-bottom review of the DoJ’s criminal corporate enforcement efforts.

The now-published, tightened corporate criminal enforcement policy stems from the recommendations of the working group and fits into the overall strategy of the DoJ in the Biden Administration."
Gleiss Lutz,U.S. DOJ PUBLISHES REVISIONS TO CORPORATE CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT POLICY,"The now-published, tightened corporate criminal enforcement policy stems from the recommendations of the working group and fits into the overall strategy of the DoJ in the Biden Administration.

Deputy Attorney General Monaco summarized it as follows in her speech on 15 September 2022: ""In short, we’re empowering companies to do the right thing – and empowering our prosecutors to hold accountable those that don’t.""

On the one hand, this means that the DoJ is further incentivizing preventive compliance measures within companies.

The aim is to give the compliance and legal departments the tools to make a ""business case"" for responsible, lawful behavior.

This also fits in with the DoJ's policy – announced in the spring – of considering in the future whether a company's chief executive officer (“CEO”) and chief compliance officer (“CCO”) must declare in writing, as part of a resolution, that the compliance system is adequately designed and effective for detecting and preventing violations.

In the recent past, Glencore plc committed to making such a declaration in one of its plea agreements.

Before the CEO and CCO declare that this is the case, it is advisable to conduct a certification or review beforehand to confirm that the compliance management system (""CMS"") is indeed appropriately designed and effective.

Particularly with regard to the effectiveness of the CMS, it may also be necessary to ""test"" the processes and controls.

On the other hand, companies have to cooperate more quickly and extensively in order to achieve a favorable resolution – through enhanced cooperation, the DoJ will to be able to prosecute individual persons more quickly and effectively.

Without voluntary, immediate, and complete self-disclosure, cooperation and restitution, there is a risk of considerable penalties.

Conclusion The elements of the tightened corporate criminal enforcement policy are not fundamentally new, but they are profound.

The strategy is already clearly recognizable and impacts companies that have business relations with the U.S. — especially in the case of a possible investigation, but also from a prevention standpoint, e.g. with regard to internal compliance measures.

As a rule, there are good arguments for companies to cooperate with the DoJ.

However, whether a company cooperates ""fully,"" in the sense of the new Corporate Criminal Enforcement Policy, or defends itself otherwise remains a discretionary decision.

In addition to the threat of sanctions, fines and reputational risks, other concerns that can play a significant role in the respective defense strategy include, in particular, procurement law risks, private damages claims, and securities lawsuits."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FUTURE FINANCING ACT – ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR STRUCTURING CAPITAL MEASURES AND GOVERNANCE,"The Future Financing Act (Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz, “ZuFinG”) entered into force on 15 December 2023.

Its primary objective is to strengthen the performance of the German capital market and enhance Germany’s attractiveness as a financial hub.

The new act focuses primarily on start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and aims to make it easier for them to access the capital market and increase their competitiveness not only in Europe, but also further afield.

The following overview highlights key changes in stock corporation and capital markets law.

I. Reintroduction of multiple voting shares The reintroduction of multiple voting shares represents a paradigm shift triggered by the global competition among capital markets.

Dual-class shares carrying different numbers of votes are common among public companies in the US.

Since various European states now also allow multiple voting shares in public companies, the new act aims to prevent German start-ups and IPO candidates from choosing a foreign legal form for this reason alone.

Founders will be able to retain a controlling influence over the company even after selling shares to investors or going public.

Section 12, sentence 2 Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, “AktG”) (new version) now allows corporations – not just SMEs or publicly traded companies – to issue registered shares with multiple voting rights.

Multiple voting shares are a separate class and not a special type of preference share.

Section 135a

AktG (new version) sets out the options and limits when issuing multiple voting shares: The multiple voting rights may not exceed ten times the voting rights of “ordinary” shares.

All shareholders must agree to create multiple voting shares, which makes it more or less impossible to introduce such shares at existing public companies.

Multiple voting rights expire ten years after the company’s IPO or inclusion in the regulated unofficial market (sunset clause).

This period can be extended by up to ten years based on a shareholders’ resolution adopted with a three-quarters majority.

The resolution is only valid if it is approved by the shareholders of each class of voting shares.

As multiple voting rights are intended to allow founders or early investors to maintain a controlling influence for a limited period of time, they expire if multiple voting shares are transferred to third parties after an IPO or inclusion in the regulated unofficial market (section 135a(2)

AktG (new version)).

Multiple voting shares also cannot be issued when utilising authorised capital (section 202(1), sentence 2 AktG).

A company’s articles of association may restrict the exercise of multiple voting rights to certain resolutions, but there is no obligation to do so.

When it comes to resolutions on appointing the external auditor (section 119(1), no. 5 AktG) or a special auditor (section 142(1) AktG), however, also multiple voting shares only confer one vote (section 135a(4)

AktG (new version)).

Multiple voting shares can play an important role in more than just the start-up phase – when a subsidiary goes public, for example, the parent company may wish to retain influence by holding shares with multiple voting rights.

For financial investors, shares with multiple voting rights may offer a way of acquiring control over a company using only a limited amount of capital and based on an agreement with the current shareholders.

II.

Additional options and greater legal certainty for capital measures 1.

Increased volume for capital increases with simplified exclusion of subscription rights The increase in the permissible volume for a capital increase with simplified exclusion of subscription rights laid down in the ZuFinG will have a substantial impact in practice."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FUTURE FINANCING ACT – ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR STRUCTURING CAPITAL MEASURES AND GOVERNANCE,"Under section 186(3), sentence 4 AktG subscription rights may be excluded for a capital increase against cash contributions in particular if the issue price is not significantly lower than the stock market price.

The volume for capital increases with simplified exclusion of subscription rights was limited to 10% of share capital so far; this limit has now been increased to 20%.

Listed companies generally use this type of capital increase in the context of utilising authorised capital.

It remains to be seen how proxy advisors and institutional investors will view the increase in volume.

To date, a common recommendation has been to approve authorisations for capital increases with the exclusion of subscription rights only up to 10% of the share capital due to the associated dilution.

Issuers planning authorised capital with an increased volume for the simplified exclusion of subscription rights at their 2024 general meetings should contact their proxy advisors well in advance.

Capital increases with simplified exclusion of subscription rights will also be more attractive to issuers because legal remedies are largely excluded.

Resolutions on a capital increase with simplified exclusion of subscription rights cannot be contested on the basis that the issue price is unreasonably low (section 255(2) AktG (new version)).

Nor are shareholders whose subscription rights have been excluded as part of such an issue entitled to cash compensation pursuant to section 255(4)

AktG (new version) (see 3).

2.

Volume limits for conditional capital increases The ZuFinG also raises some of the volume limits for conditional capital: Conditional capital increases to fund stock options for members of management bodies and employees may now be carried out up to 20% (previously 10%) of the share capital.

This amendment is likely to have practical implications for start-ups where significant portions of the remuneration are paid in the form of shares.

Under the new rules (section 192(3), sentence 1

AktG (new version)), conditional capital used to create shares for a merger with another company – an option that is rarely exercised – can now amount to 60% instead of the previous maximum of 50% of existing share capital.

The limit of 50% of share capital for conditional capital created to issue convertible bonds (which is generally the primary purpose) remains unchanged, however.

3.

Fundamental revision of the system of legal protection against capital measures The ZuFinG completely overhauls the system of legal protection afforded to shareholders against capital measures introduced by the general meeting.

In doing so, the ZuFinG addresses a criticism frequently levelled in the past at the concept laid down in section 255(2), sentence 1

AktG (old version).

This previously made it possible to contest a resolution to increase the company’s capital with the exclusion of subscription rights on the basis that either the issue price or the minimum price was unreasonably low.

Since an action based on a valuation-related objection was as a rule not obviously unfounded and there was no guarantee that the court would rule in the company’s favour pursuant to section 246

AktG, there were risks that such capital increase resolutions could be delayed or not implemented at all.

According to section 255 AktG (new version), a resolution can no longer be contested on the basis that a shareholder sought to obtain special benefits (section 243(2) AktG) or that the value of the contribution attributable to a share was unreasonably low.

It is worth noting that the scenario in which a resolution cannot be contested is not restricted to capital increases with the exclusion of subscription rights, but also covers any rights issue."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FUTURE FINANCING ACT – ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR STRUCTURING CAPITAL MEASURES AND GOVERNANCE,"It is worth noting that the scenario in which a resolution cannot be contested is not restricted to capital increases with the exclusion of subscription rights, but also covers any rights issue.

When it comes to valuation-related objections, the ZuFinG replaces the legal protection afforded to shareholders in the form of avoidance and/or nullity actions that can render the resolution null and void with a compensation claim awarded in appraisal proceedings.

This significantly improves transaction security for capital increases.

Following the example of the Act implementing the Directive on Cross-Border Conversions (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Umwandlungsrichtlinie), a company can choose whether to settle any compensation claims of its shareholders in cash or – to protect its liquidity – by granting additional shares (sections 255a, 255b AktG (new version)).

At first glance, the concept seems sound, but raises questions on closer scrutiny.

It does not appear conclusive to allow valuation-related objections in the case of capital increases with subscription rights, but to refuse them in the case of capital increases with simplified exclusion of subscription rights (section 255(4)

AktG (new version)).

Moreover, dealing with compensation claims in appraisal proceedings is time-consuming for the issuer and also complex, especially where compensation is granted in the form of shares.

Given that the risk of having to pay costs is relatively low for applicants, we will likely see an increase in appraisal proceedings where shareholders contest capital increase resolutions.

Ultimately, the increase in transaction security brings with it the burden of subsequent proceedings.

Section 255(5)

AktG (new version) does provide significant relief, however, in that the value of the granted shares in the case of listed companies must generally be set at the stock market price and there is no claim to compensation if the issue price is not significantly lower than this.

We expect that this valuation will also have an impact on the judicial review of compensation for structural measures and simplify appraisal proceedings in such cases.

III.

Change to the record date for participation in the general meeting For bearer shares of listed companies, the certificate confirming share ownership required for participation in the general meeting previously had to “make reference to the beginning of the 21st day prior to the meeting” (section 121(4), sentence 1

AktG (old version)).

In future, however, “close of business on the 22nd day prior to the meeting” will be the relevant record date.

This change is a direct response to Article 1, point 7 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1212 of 3 September 2018.

In practice, this means that the invitation to the general meeting and the shareholders’ rights must be based on the close of business on the 22nd day prior to the general meeting, for example 24:00 on 25 May instead of 0:00 on 26 May, as was previously the case.

Given the primacy of the AktG, the new provision also applies to companies that had adopted the previous wording of the act in their articles of association.

For reasons of legal certainty, companies in this position would be well-advised to amend their articles of association by shareholders’ resolution.

IV.

Introduction of a German SPAC A SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) is a company without commercial operations formed specifically to raise capital through an IPO for the sole purpose of acquiring a non-listed company within a specified period of time.

SPACs have been around in the US for decades, but have as yet not been of major practical significance on German stock exchanges.

The few known SPACs in Germany were all set up exclusively in accordance with foreign law, mainly because of the restrictive requirements laid down in the AktG.

The ZuFinG makes it easier for German companies to be used as SPACs."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FUTURE FINANCING ACT – ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR STRUCTURING CAPITAL MEASURES AND GOVERNANCE,"The ZuFinG makes it easier for German companies to be used as SPACs.

To this end, the Stock Exchange Act (Börsengesetz, “BörsG”) now provides for a special variant of the German stock corporation (AG) or the Societas Europaea (SE), which is called a Börsenmantelaktiengesellschaft (or listed shell stock corporation).

This is the German equivalent of a SPAC and is not subject to certain restrictive provisions of the AktG. The Börsenmantelaktiengesellschaft is an AG or SE that expressly trades as such and whose corporate purpose is to manage its own assets, execute its own IPO and prepare and conclude a corporate acquisition that meets the criteria described in the listing prospectus.

It is important to note in this regard that the target cannot be a listed company.

Following the successful IPO, a Börsenmantelaktiengesellschaft has 48 months in which to complete a target transaction and acquire a company (section 44(3) BörsG (new version)).

The target transaction must be approved by the general meeting with a 75% majority and any shareholders who object to the transaction may offer their shares for sale.

If no company is acquired within 48 months, the Börsenmantelaktiengesellschaft must be dissolved in accordance with general regulations and as a rule be wound up (section 47b(1) BörsG in conjunction with section 262(1), no. 1 AktG).

V. Improvements to the tax framework for employee participation programmes In addition to increasing the volume limit for conditional capital for granting shares to management board members and employees, the ZuFinG includes a number of tax measures to promote employee participation programmes (article of 5 December 2023).

VI.

Setting the stage for electronic shares The Electronic Securities Act (Gesetz über elektronische Wertpapiere, “eWpG”), which came into force on 10 June 2021, has to date only allowed bearer bonds and investment fund units to be issued electronically in accordance with the Capital Investment Code (Kapitalanlagegesetzbuch).

The ZuFinG allows shares to be issued in the form of electronic securities, as defined in the eWpG, with effect from 1 November 2025.

The certificate issued for a security will be replaced by an entry in an electronic register – either a central or crypto securities register – which will at the same time provide the requisite public record in the case of transfer.

For central register securities, a central register is kept for all issued shares at a securities clearing and deposit bank or at a central securities depository authorised by the company (e.g. Clearstream) (sections 4(2), 12 eWpG).

A crypto securities register, in contrast, is a tamper-proof recording system in which data is logged and stored in chronological order.

The European market infrastructure regulations do not currently provide any framework for the trading, listing and settlement of electronic securities, although a trading framework is likely to be in place by the end of 2025.

VII.

Entry into force Large parts of the ZuFinG have come into force following its promulgation in the Federal Law Gazette, but the provisions revising the eWpG and introducing crypto securities (Article 16 ZuFinG) will only take effect on 1 November 2025.

VII.

Conclusion The ZuFinG contains a number of improvements for start-ups and SMEs seeking access to the capital market, while its reintroduction of multiple voting shares opens up interesting options.

The new law also creates better conditions for employee participation programmes.

The ZuFinG offers listed companies greater flexibility and legal certainty when carrying out capital measures, although it remains to be seen how the new provisions on valuation-related objections will affect these."

Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN GENDER QUOTAS FOR BOARD POSITIONS,"The European Union is currently working on a directive that will oblige Member States to lay down binding gender quotas of 40 % for supervisory boards or 33 % for management boards together.

The current status of the consultation process is summarised below.

Procedure The European Commission already started working on a proposal for a “Directive on improving the gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges” back in 2012.

The aim of the proposal was to address the serious problems around the under-representation of women in key corporate positions.

The legislative procedure ground to a halt in 2015 at the latest, however.

Ursula von der Leyen has now resurrected the project, putting it back on the agenda of the Council of the European Union.

The intention seems to be to adopt the directive in second reading in the European Parliament, possibly before the end of the year.

However, it is doubtful whether such a target is realistic, as Slovakia, Poland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary have all expressed concerns.

What the directive covers The aim of the directive is to increase the share of the under-represented sex (to date this has usually been women) in board positions.

The planned directive will initially target only listed companies and will also not apply to companies with fewer than 250 employees and an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.

Since this is a directive, it will not apply directly, but merely serve as a basis for transposition into national law by the Member States.

According to the current draft, Member States would be able to choose between two transposition options: Option 1 : The Member State agrees to implement a target of at least 40 % of supervisory board and non-executive director positions being held by the under-represented sex.

Option 2 : The Member State agrees to implement a general target of 33 %.

However, this target will apply not only to members of supervisory boards and non-executive directors but also to executive directors and management board members.

The planned quotas are however not supposed to result in more than half of the positions on smaller supervisory boards and management boards having to be held by members of one sex.

Accordingly, the under-represented sex is to hold the number of board positions that comes closest to the target of 40 % or 33 %, but is less than 50 %.

It would therefore still be the case that for a supervisory board with three members, only one position would need to be held by a member of the under-represented sex.

Member States may also provide that companies where the members of the under-represented sex make up less than 10 % of the workforce are generally exempt from the minimum quotas.

Finally, the proposal specifies that candidates have the right to be provided with the following information on request: 1. the qualification criteria upon which the selection was based, 2. the objective comparative assessment of those criteria and 3.

the considerations tilting the balance in favour of a candidate of the other sex.

Implementation in Germany According to the current draft, individual Member States may suspend implementation of the European quotas if they have already ensured a balanced representation of men and women through existing targets (“opt-out option”).

The Federal Republic presumably already meets the requirements for such an opt-out based on its Second Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions ( Zweites Fürhrungspositionen-Gesetz , “FüPoG II”) ( see newsletter 4/21 ), which came into force on 12 August 2021.

This means that, in its current version, the directive would not have to be implemented.

It is however conceivable that the current coalition government will use the directive as an opportunity to raise existing quotas from 30 % to 40 %."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN GENDER QUOTAS FOR BOARD POSITIONS,"It is however conceivable that the current coalition government will use the directive as an opportunity to raise existing quotas from 30 % to 40 %.

Conclusion The directive still has to be negotiated with and adopted by the EU Parliament.

Only then will it be clear what the final content of the directive will be.

It is not currently possible to say whether it will actually get to that stage, however.

If the directive were to be implemented, the quotas would – as things presently stand – have to be fulfilled by the companies concerned by 31 December 2027 in any case, unless the Federal government makes use of its opt-out option.

Should the quota actually be increased to 40 %, many larger companies would once again be under pressure to take action.

We will monitor developments and keep you informed."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"The processing of data in the financial sector raises particular legal questions and problems, regardless of whether this involves personal data.

Financial data are particularly sensitive, often have increased value and entail a significant level of risk.

Moreover, financial regulatory provisions lay down far-reaching requirements for the handling of data, compliance with which has been closely monitored by the regulatory authorities, especially in recent years.

This article points out the main risks and looks at possible ways of dealing with these.

Background The financial sector is more dependent on the processing of data than almost any other industry.

A modern financial industry is simply inconceivable without intensive data processing.

At the same time, several primary and secondary regulatory frameworks overlap here, from financial regulatory law to anti-money laundering law and IT security law to data protection law.

For the companies concerned, this also entails special risks of violations punishable by fines and damage to their reputation.

In what follows, we highlight the most important legal challenges facing financial companies today when it comes to dealing with data, including processing, and look at possible ways in which these challenges can be met.

The article especially has credit institutions and financial services institutions as defined by the German Banking Act and securities institutions as defined by the German Securities Institutions Act in mind, but the information can essentially also be applied to payment institutions as defined by the German Payment Services Supervision Act, insurance companies as defined by the German Insurance Supervision Act and investment management companies as defined by the German Capital Investment Code.

Payment institutions, in particular, are subject to strict principles when it comes to the security of information technology systems (see in particular sections 53, 54 German Payment Services Supervision Act).

Given the complexity of the issues involved, this article does not purport to be an exhaustive overview.

Financial regulatory requirements Why do financial regulatory provisions deal with the handling of data?

Financial regulatory provisions require a bank’s internal risk management to be both appropriate and effective (section 25a(1), sentence 3 German Banking Act) and the proper handling of data is laid down in this context as a means of controlling, monitoring and communicating risks.

At the international level, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision already published a detailed set of rules for this in 2013 with Standard 239 (Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting).

However, BaFin’s circular 10/2021 (BA) – Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (“ MaRisk ”) also devotes an entire chapter to data management, data quality and risk data aggregation, which applies at least to significant institutions (at individual and group level).

According to this approach, data serve to reduce or mitigate the risk profile of financial companies, provided that they handle the data in accordance with the regulations.

In addition, financial regulatory provisions also consider data (usually referred to as “information” in this context) and the processing thereof as a source of risk.

Here, too, preparatory work has been done by international standard setters.

Recently, for example, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published comprehensive guidelines for ICT (information and communication technology) and security risk management.

BaFin also addresses these information risks in its circular 10/2017 (BA) – Supervisory Requirements for IT in Financial Institutions (“ BAIT ”).

This concerns the risk of possible damage due to inadequate integrity, availability, authenticity or confidentiality of data."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"This concerns the risk of possible damage due to inadequate integrity, availability, authenticity or confidentiality of data.

Consequently, BaFin requires institutions to have an appropriate and effective information risk management system, which includes, in particular, information security precautions, proper identity and access management as well as data backup concepts.

In contrast to the previous paragraph, data are not a means of risk management, but rather the object or goal of risk management.

How must institutions handle data so that they can be a useful tool for effective risk management?

For data to contribute to effective risk management, the institution’s data structure and data hierarchy must meet high standards.

For example, the institution must ensure that data can be unequivocally identified, collated and evaluated and that they are available promptly when needed.

Special requirements apply to so-called risk data, i.e. data that are directly relevant for the identification, assessment and measurement of risks.

Such risk data must be accurate and complete, and each institution must lay down internal requirements to ensure that this is the case.

Furthermore, the risk data must not only be available in raw form, but must be processed appropriately.

For example, institutions must aggregate the data and ensure that the data can be evaluated based on different categories (risk categories, business areas, group companies, etc.).

In principle, data aggregation must be automated because aggregated risk data must be available promptly (especially during periods of stress).

In BaFin’s opinion, the use of manual processes and interventions must therefore be limited to “the level necessary” (and must also be adequately justified and documented).

Finally, institutions must not rely solely on available risk data, but must reconcile such data with other information available at the institution (e.g. from the accounting or reporting systems) and carry out plausibility checks.

This should make it possible, among other things, to identify data errors and weaknesses in data quality.

What aspects must companies in the financial sector consider in order to appropriately and effectively manage the risks associated with data and data processing (information risk management)?

Defined broadly, information risk management as required by regulatory provisions consists of (i) drawing up an IT strategy, (ii) specifying an IT governance structure on the basis of this, (iii) setting up appropriate monitoring and management processes with regard to information risks (information risk management) and (iv) implementing an information security management system.

The IT strategy must include, in particular, the development of the institution’s organisational and operational IT structure (including staffing and budget), the development of the IT architecture as well as principles of IT service continuity management.

How detailed the strategies are depends on the scale and complexity of the institution’s business activities as well as the level of risk these entail (cf.

MaRisk, AT 4.2, number 4).

The strategy must be submitted to the supervisory board and discussed with it (cf.

MaRisk, AT 4.2, number 6).

According to the financial regulatory provisions, IT governance means the structure used to manage and monitor the operation and further development of IT systems including the related IT processes (cf. BAIT, number 2.1).

Of central importance here is the organisational and operational IT structure, i.e. the definition of tasks and processes (operational structure) as well as the establishment of organisational units (organisational structure) and the allocation of the aforementioned tasks and processes to one or more of the established organisational units.

The organisational and operational IT structure includes, in particular, the allocation of access rights to data."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"The organisational and operational IT structure includes, in particular, the allocation of access rights to data.

These are to be allocated (as in other areas of the organisation of a financial company) on a need-to-know basis and adjusted swiftly if necessary (cf.

MaRisk, AT 4.3.1, number 2).

According to BaFin, information risk management requires implementing a system for managing information risks (cf. BAIT, number 3.2).

Of particular importance here is the concept of the information domain, which includes business-relevant data and information, business and support processes, IT systems and related IT processes as well as network and building infrastructures.

The protection requirements must be determined for each and every information domain and cover the risk (determined by the institution) that the “integrity”, “availability”, “confidentiality” or “authenticity” of the data belonging to the information domain could be compromised.

The “integrity”, “availability”, “confidentiality” and “authenticity” of the data are also referred to as the protection objectives of information risk management (cf. BAIT, number 3.4).

This means that the protection requirements analysis is a risk analysis, specifically of the abstract information risk.

Using this abstract risk analysis as a basis, the institution concerned must define the measures that are appropriate for meeting the relevant protection requirements (catalogue of target measures).

Subsequently, the catalogue of target measures must be compared with the measures actually implemented.

To a certain extent, this comparison represents the specific risk analysis and takes into account possible threats, the potential for damage, the frequency of damage and the risk appetite of the institution.

The management board must be informed of the results of the analysis on a regular basis, but at least quarterly (cf. BAIT, number 3.11).

According to the financial regulatory provisions, information security management is a continuous process that comprises various phases, namely planning, implementation, success monitoring as well as optimisation and improvement of the security of the institution’s data.

An information security policy to be adopted by the institution’s management board constitutes one of the core elements of information security management (cf. BAIT, number 4.2).

This policy lays down the strategic requirements for information security.

According to BaFin, this includes defining competences, roles and responsibilities so that the security of information can be ensured.

Based on the information security policy, the departments must lay down more specific, state-of-the-art information security guidelines and information security processes (including the sub-processes of identification, protection, discovery, response and recovery) (

cf. BAIT, number 4.3).

However, the financial regulatory requirements not only involve organisational or procedural prerequisites, as BaFin also has equipment and resources in mind.

The institution must ensure that appropriate resources, in terms of both quality and quantity, are available for information risk management (in the narrower sense) and information security management (cf. BAIT, number 2.3).

Who is responsible for compliance with these requirements?

According to BaFin, all the members of the management board are responsible for ensuring that the key elements of the institution’s risk management system are appropriate and effective.

There is much to suggest that these key elements also include the requirements for data management (as a means of risk management) and information risk management (as a goal or object of risk management).

This is also clear from the MaRisk and the BAIT.

Accordingly, data management and data quality are management issues: the corresponding principles must be approved and put into force by the management board of the institution (cf.

MaRisk, AT 4.3.4, number 1)."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"MaRisk, AT 4.3.4, number 1).

The IT strategy, IT governance structure and information security policy must also be adopted by the management board (cf. BAIT, numbers 1.1, 2.2 and 4.2).

The members of the management board of a group parent company are responsible for appropriate and effective risk management at group level too.

This also includes the aspects of risk management relevant for data and data processing described in this article (cf. also MaRisk, AT 4.3.4, number 1).

Apart from the management board, however, financial regulatory provisions also explicitly assign responsibility for the proper handling of data to other units in the institution concerned.

If such units do not exist, they must be established: A unit that is independent of the front office must check whether the institution’s internal rules, procedures, methods and processes for handling and processing data are being followed (MaRisk, AT 4.3.4, number 7).

The position of information security officer must be established for the purpose of information security management (BAIT, number 4.4).

The information security officer must be independent and, in addition to advising the management board, must contribute to appropriate information security management, for example by preparing information security policies, managing information security processes, investigating information security incidents and providing training sessions on information security.

The information security officer is also the contact person for BaFin.

What consequences does the institution face if it breaches the financial regulatory requirements for the handling of data?

The financial regulatory requirements are more than just obligations on paper.

The German Banking Act (and other applicable laws) give the regulatory authorities a comprehensive set of instruments for enforcing compliance.

As a first step, BaFin may order an institution to eliminate deficiencies in its risk management system (including information risk management) (cf. section 25a(2), sentence 2 German Banking Act).

Such an order may be issued following a special audit or for another reason (e.g. tips from a whistleblower).

In order to monitor compliance, BaFin may require the institution concerned to submit regular reports on its progress (section 44(1) German Banking Act) or may appoint a special representative who has comprehensive rights of inspection and information vis-à-vis the institution’s management (section 45c(2), no. 6 German Banking Act).

If these measures are not effective, BaFin also has the option of ordering the institution in question to increase own funds pursuant to section 6c German Banking Act or restricting the institution’s business activity (section 45b(1) German Banking Act).

The latter can also include restrictions on growth (e.g. with regard to new customers), as has happened in the recent past.

Furthermore, the regulator may also take action against the institution’s management board members and give them formal warnings (section 36(2) German Banking Act) or, if such measures are unsuccessful, demand that the management board members concerned be dismissed and ban them from working for other institutions (section 36(1) German Banking Act).

Since the members of an institution’s supervisory board must also monitor the management board members’ compliance with the relevant banking regulatory requirements (section 25d(6) German Banking Act), such demands for dismissal and working bans may also be issued with respect to the supervisory board members (section 36(3) German Banking Act).

Finally, the members of the management board (or the supervisory board) may also be held liable under civil law, since non-compliance with financial regulatory obligations usually constitutes a breach of the duty of legality.

The details of this are disputed in the case law and legal literature, especially if there is “only” a violation of BaFin’s circulars."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"The details of this are disputed in the case law and legal literature, especially if there is “only” a violation of BaFin’s circulars.

The extent to which these are binding (i.e. whether they set out further details of the statutory provisions in a legally permissible manner) has not yet been clarified by the highest courts.

Due to the threat of personal liability risks, we would advise treating the requirements as statutory law and observing them accordingly.

Data protection requirements Which companies in the financial sector are particularly affected by data protection regulations?

Data protection requirements affect all companies in the financial industry.

However, they are particularly relevant for banks and payment service providers that process data on transactions carried out by natural persons.

Neobanks and other financial companies with digitalised business models such as robo-advisors, account information providers, etc., where data processing goes beyond simply enabling transactions, also have an increased level of risk.

Forums in which customers can discuss investment strategies in a manner similar to social media or dashboards that show customers their payment behaviour – such special services require particularly careful assessment under data protection law.

What are the most important data protection requirements for companies in the financial sector?

The data protection regulations also lay down requirements for data security (Article 32 GDPR).

Appropriate protection measures must be put in place to ensure that personal data, especially customer data, are not impaired accidentally or intentionally, and in particular that such data are not lost, unavailable or disclosed without authorisation.

This poses a particular challenge in outsourcing scenarios, where the company engages a service provider and grants it access to the personal data of customers (and possibly also employees).

The regulatory requirements are supplemented in this regard by the need for data protection provisions.

Typically, companies and service providers must conclude an agreement on commissioned data processing, but in individual cases it what is known as a joint controllership agreement may also be required (Articles 26, 28 GDPR).

When it comes to data security, many companies in the financial sector also have to deal with conflicting objectives under data protection law.

On the one hand, the security of customer data requires a certain degree of monitoring of those who handle such data – the employees.

Security incident & event management (“SIEM”) systems are often used for this.

Such systems track who accesses customer data, when, for how long and with what authorisation.

On the other hand, the processing of personal data of employees is only permitted to a proportionate extent (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, section 26(1) Federal Data Protection Act).

So companies have to tread a fine line in order to comply with their legal obligations.

A data protection impact assessment (Article 35 GDPR) often helps make it clear where this line lies.

But companies need to process data not only securely, but also lawfully.

This means that the processing must, in particular, serve a specific legitimate purpose, have a sound legal basis and not go beyond what is necessary.

This often means that customers’ consent is required before the company can use their data to personalise the service it offers or for advertising purposes.

In addition, forms used for data collection should be carefully checked to ensure that only the necessary data is collected.

There is also a certain tension between the principle of data minimisation and specific regulatory requirements."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"There is also a certain tension between the principle of data minimisation and specific regulatory requirements.

In principle, obligations to keep records laid down in regulatory and data protection provisions should mesh seamlessly – the legally required retention of documents, e.g. records of discussions in which investment advice is provided pursuant to MiFiD II, is justified under data protection law (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR), whereas retention not required by law is prohibited unless there are other legitimate grounds for this.

In practice, however, different regulatory authorities may often interpret the regulations differently, especially if they belong to different states.

Therefore, companies need to be careful in their communication and when weighing up the various risks, options and requirements in order to meet all the regulatory requirements.

What is currently the biggest data protection problem for financial companies?

European financial companies that have to transfer data to countries outside the EU for legal or operational reasons find themselves in a similarly difficult situation, as European law imposes special restrictions on the transfer of personal data to third countries outside the EU and EEA, in order to ensure that personal data in the third country remains adequately protected.

This is deemed to be the case if the level of data protection in the third country has been officially recognised as adequate by the EU Commission (Article 45 GDPR) – however, such adequacy decisions have only been issued for a small number of countries (including the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Argentina and Japan, but not the U.S., India, Russia, China, Brazil, Turkey or Australia).

In the absence of an adequacy decision for the respective country, additional safeguards must be provided, e.g. by concluding a data protection agreement based on the EU standard contractual clauses (Article 46 GDPR).

However, according to a recent ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union, standard contractual clauses alone are not sufficient if the law of the recipient state allows (official) data access that goes beyond what is proportionate according to European standards.

This is because contractual obligations alone cannot provide effective protection against such data access.

EU companies that want to transfer personal data to third countries, especially the U.S., must therefore carefully analyse the circumstances and consequences of this transfer ( data transfer impact assessment ) and take additional protective measures if necessary.

However, there are as yet no definitive rules governing the form these protective measures could take and these must therefore be assessed for each individual case.

Authorities in third countries will not usually be willing to enter into standard contractual clauses with a European company anyway.

The company concerned must therefore check whether a data transfer is permissible on the basis of one of the exceptions laid down in Article 49 GDPR, in particular for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Article 49(1)(e) GDPR).

This exception is specifically aimed at the use of personal data in judicial proceedings (e.g. in a subpoena), but may also justify other types of disclosures (e.g. in the context of monitorships).

Outlook

The legal challenges involved in processing data in the financial sector are set to become even greater in the future – increasing in step with the opportunities, as it were.

At the same time, it is likely that the legal regulations will be enforced more strictly in the future than in the past.

The authors’ experience shows that BaFin, for example, has made data security and information risk management a focus of its regulatory work and has also urged established market operators to make improvements in these areas."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,"For neobanks and fintechs, however, shortcomings in these areas can threaten their very existence, as they may find themselves subject to drastic measures up to and including the withdrawal of their licence."
Gleiss Lutz,SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – THE LATEST ON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT’S MEASURES,"In response to the possibility of Russia blocking gas supplies to Germany, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection triggered the early warning level of the gas emergency plan in March, followed by the second and penultimate level, the alert level, in June.

Numerous legislative changes have since expanded the Federal Government’s options for intervening in the market.

These include price adjustment provisions that would allow energy providers to pass on soaring gas costs to their customers.

The legislator has also introduced ambitious filling level requirements for gas storage facilities.

The Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency) has set up a digital gas security platform that can be used – if the emergency level is triggered – to generate IT-based models of different shutdown scenarios on the basis of data collected from all major gas consumers.

These models can then be used to initiate specific measures to safeguard supply.

Gleiss Lutz commentary – summary: By adopting numerous legislative amendments, including to the German Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , “EnWG”) and the German Energy Security Act ( Energiesicherungsgesetz , “EnSiG”), the legislator has laid the groundwork for dealing with an escalation in the energy crisis.

The gas shortage and the Federal Government’s measures to maintain security of supply have given rise to the following risks and expectations, although it remains to be seen which of these will materialise and to what extent: If the supply situation worsens, the Federal Government can trigger the emergency level as the final level of the gas emergency plan.

The Bundesnetzagentur would then assume the role of “federal load distributor”, allowing it to order the partial or complete shutdown of the gas supply to certain consumption points.

To facilitate this, industrial companies with a technical connection capacity of at least 10 MWh/h must register on the Bundesnetzagentur ’s digital gas security platform and regularly update the information on how important the gas supply is to the company.

In the event of an acute gas shortage, only a small number of companies, namely those that are indispensable for public supply as so-called critical infrastructures, will qualify as protected customers whose gas supply must be maintained.

Beyond this, there is no fixed order of priority.

When weighing up which companies to prioritise, criteria such as economic relevance, the possibilities for switching to an alternative fuel source and reducing consumption as well as the necessary lead time for this will probably be as important as the urgency of the measure, the size of the plant and how much gas it uses, the lead time for reducing its gas consumption, the expected financial losses, how long it will take and how much it will cost to start operations again, how crucial the plant is to supplying the general public, whether it belongs to the primary sector, whether it is integrated into supply chains and whether there will be any permanent damage to property or public health risks.

In the event of a further drop in gas imports, the Bundesnetzagentur is also authorised to give energy providers the option of passing on the additional costs incurred to procure gas from different sources to customers by way of price increases.

Alternatively, the Federal Government can introduce a levy on all consumers in the form of a balanced price adjustment, i.e. it can spread the additional costs – including those of struggling energy providers – across all energy providers and therefore all gas customers.

The procedure would probably be similar to that for the levy previously imposed under the German Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneubare-Energien-Gesetz , “EEG”)."
Gleiss Lutz,SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – THE LATEST ON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT’S MEASURES,"The procedure would probably be similar to that for the levy previously imposed under the German Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneubare-Energien-Gesetz , “EEG”).

Finally, further government measures to secure the gas supply could be introduced in the short term, in particular an incentive system (possibly auction-based) for companies to reduce their own gas consumption and make freed-up gas volumes available to the market.

Background Germany gets most of its gas from Russia, but following Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, would like to become independent of Russian gas.

This is not something that can be achieved immediately and without further ado, however.

So a shutdown of gas supplies from Russia could lead to shortages in the supply of gas in Germany, either because of a European embargo or, more likely, a Russian boycott.

Based on Article 8 of the Security of Supply Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/1938), Germany has drawn up a “gas emergency plan” (Notfallplan Gas) to ensure gas supply even in crisis situations.

This emergency plan dates back to September 2019 and therefore to a time when no-one expected a gas supply crisis to be looming on the horizon.

It provides for three warning levels: the early warning level, alert level and emergency level.

Whereas there are no formal requirements for triggering the first two levels, the third level requires an ordinance issued by the Federal Government.

This has not happened to date.

Already at the beginning of the energy crisis, companies and associations submitted preemptive letters to the Bundesnetzagentur in which they explained how they would be individually affected if the gas supply were to be shut down.

According to reports, the Bundesnetzagentur has received around a thousand of these letters.

In the vast majority of cases, companies have emphasised that they cannot afford for the gas to be shut off; apparently only a very small number of companies have indicated how much gas they can do without in an emergency situation.

Early warning and alert levels triggered The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection triggered the first level of the gas emergency plan, the early warning level, on 30 March 2022, followed by the alert level on 23 June 2022.

Triggering the early warning level requires there to be indications of an event that is likely to lead to a deterioration in the gas supply.

During the early warning stage, European internal market regulations continue to apply without restriction.

Gas supply companies can take market-based measures to maintain the security of the gas supply.

Under the gas emergency plan, these measures include the procurement of balancing energy or even reductions in gas supplies by the network operators.

Transmission system operators must closely monitor the gas supply situation and submit an assessment of this to the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (at least) once a day.

There is, however, no government intervention in the market at either the early warning level or the alert level.

The situation was escalated in June when the alert level was triggered.

A prerequisite for this is that the gas supply must have been disrupted or there must have been an exceptionally high demand for gas.

The significant deterioration in the gas supply resulting from this can however still be offset by market-based measures.

The purpose of the alert level is primarily to give consumers and industrial companies a clear signal that they must save as much gas as possible at this stage already instead of waiting until winter.

It does not give the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection or the Bundesnetzagentur a substantially expanded set of instruments to intervene in the market.

It does however entail new price adjustment provisions that could significantly impact all gas customers (see below)."
Gleiss Lutz,SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – THE LATEST ON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT’S MEASURES,"It does however entail new price adjustment provisions that could significantly impact all gas customers (see below).

Preparations for the emergency level The Bundesnetzagentur is already preparing for the third and highest escalation level of the gas emergency plan, namely the emergency level.

The emergency level is triggered when there is a significant disruption in the gas supply and market-based measures are not sufficient to meet gas demand.

Such a disruption would certainly occur if Russian gas deliveries were to be stopped in the next few weeks or months.

In addition to the market-based measures, the emergency level gives rise to additional sovereign powers of intervention, in particular the instruments as defined in the EnSiG and the German Ordinance to Ensure the Supply of Gas in a Supply Crisis ( Gassicherheitsverordnung , “GasSV”).

What is particularly relevant for companies that use gas is that the Bundesnetzagentur will become the federal load distributor if the emergency level is triggered.

It would then be responsible for distributing gas within Germany with the aim – as defined in the GasSV – of ensuring vital gas deliveries, paying particular attention to protected customers and the minimisation of consequential damage.

As things currently stand, priority will be given in an emergency to supplying gas to private households, social institutions such as hospitals and other critical infrastructure.

Despite concerns from the business community and the associated planning uncertainties, the Bundesnetzagentur has not yet laid down a fixed shutdown sequence for companies.

Whether or not to shut down the gas supply is to be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a number of factors.

These include system relevance, the necessary lead time and the possibilities for switching to alternative fuel sources, the urgency of the measure, the size of the plant and how much gas it uses, the lead time for reducing its gas consumption, the expected financial losses, how long it will take and how much it will cost to start operations again, how crucial the plant is to supplying the general public, whether it belongs to the primary sector, whether it is integrated into supply chains and whether there will be any permanent damage to property, public health risks or any environmental impacts.

Digital gas security platform The Bundesnetzagentur plans to distribute the gas load on the basis of IT-supported modelling if the emergency level is triggered.

To this end, it is currently developing a digital gas security platform and collecting relevant data from network operators and major gas consumers.

The aim is to have the platform ready for launch on 1 October 2022.

In order to prepare for the emergency level, the Bundesnetzagentur issued a request for information on 20 April 2022.

Should this level be triggered, the Bundesnetzagentur must have the most up-to-date data possible to fulfil its role as federal load distributor.

Using this data, it can determine the impact of a (partial) shutdown of the gas supply on individual companies or sectors.

It can also assess each company’s situation on the basis of information about the sector in which the company operates, the shutdown response times and the contractually agreed gas capacities.

In this way, the impact of a disruption to the gas supply can be minimised.

All major gas consumers with a technical connection capacity in excess of 10 MWh/h, gas network operators and all balancing group managers such as gas supply companies or gas traders are required to register on the platform.

Major gas consumers must in particular indicate how much gas they need for their production processes and what impact an interruption in the gas supply would have on them, and a number have already done so."
Gleiss Lutz,SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – THE LATEST ON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT’S MEASURES,"In addition to providing their initial data, these companies must also ensure that the information is regularly updated, especially the data on the importance of gas for their respective business operations.

If a company succeeds in the coming months in reducing its need to procure gas, the data provided must be adjusted.

Advice: Section 12 EnSiG provides for hardship compensation if an ordinance enacted on the basis of the Act will jeopardise or even destroy a company’s economic existence.

In such a case, the company concerned must assert a claim for compensation against the Bundesnetzagentur .

Hardship compensation under the EnSiG will be granted to companies according to the principle of equity.

It is therefore essential for companies to use the digital gas security platform and provide the Bundesnetzagentur with comprehensive and pertinent information on the consequences of disconnecting their gas supply.

Companies should therefore carefully prepare the data they wish to submit and ensure that they upload any relevant updates to the platform without delay.

Unless a partial reduction in the gas supply will already have dire consequences, companies should refrain from submitting “all-or-nothing” notifications.

In order to fulfil their responsibility to cooperate with the Bundesnetzagentur and safeguard their potential entitlement to hardship compensation, companies must provide accurate information on possible shutdown scenarios and indicate what the consequences of a partial reduction in or complete loss of the gas supply would be.

Price adjustment rights of energy providers With the introduction of section 24 EnSiG on 25 May 2022

, the legislator created a price adjustment mechanism in the event of reduced gas imports.

This was already amended with the legislative package adopted in July.

There are two prerequisites for the activation of this mechanism.

Firstly, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Protection must have declared the alert or emergency level of the gas emergency plan.

This prerequisite has already been met.

The second prerequisite, which is still outstanding, is a formal determination by the Bundesnetzagentur that there has been a significant reduction in total gas imports to Germany.

This decision must be published in Germany’s Federal Gazette.

As a result of this determination, all energy providers that are affected by the reduction in supply volumes either directly, due to disruptions in supply, or indirectly, due to price increases by their supplier, have the right to adjust gas prices to an appropriate level vis-à-vis their customers along the supply chain.

A price adjustment is considered not to be appropriate if it exceeds the additional costs for procuring gas from other sources.

Levy in the form of balanced price adjustment The EnSiG was amended on 8 July 2022 to include a new section 26 authorising the Federal Government to issue an ordinance replacing the price adjustment rights described above with financial compensation financed by a balanced price adjustment.

This provision, which was included at a very late stage, is intended to provide the Federal Government with a means of assisting struggling energy companies.

While section 29 EnSiG makes it possible to apply to the Federal Government for stabilisation measures, section 26 EnSiG means that price hikes can in future also be passed on to customers.

With the authorisation in this section, the governing parliamentary parties have introduced the option of a levy.

The additional costs are to be passed on and distributed equally across all gas customers (along the lines of the former EEG levy), thereby minimising the burden on individual users.

The requisite ordinance can only be issued if a significant reduction in gas imports to Germany is imminent or has been determined by the Bundesnetzagentur and published in the Federal Gazette."
Gleiss Lutz,SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – THE LATEST ON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT’S MEASURES,"The requisite ordinance can only be issued if a significant reduction in gas imports to Germany is imminent or has been determined by the Bundesnetzagentur and published in the Federal Gazette.

According to press reports, the Federal Government does not want to use this option – at least not at present.

Filling level requirements for gas storage facilities On 26 April 2022

, the Bundestag introduced a new section 35b EnWG specifying filling level requirements for the operators of gas storage facilities.

According to this, a filling level of 90% is to be achieved by 1 November.

The filling levels of the German gas storage facilities are currently at 63.2% and thus in some cases even significantly higher than in previous years.

Since only about 40% of the maximum amount is currently flowing through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, however, it is highly unlikely that a storage level of 90% can be achieved by November without additional measures, according to the Bundesnetzagentur .

Fiduciary management

In May, the legislator also created a new legal basis for the fiduciary management of companies operating critical infrastructure in the energy sector with section 17 EnSiG.

This affects companies involved in the production, transport and storage as well as distribution and trading of gas whose production, storage, distribution or trading volume exceeds 5,190 GWh per year.

The provision is aimed at enabling the Bundesnetzagentur to act as fiduciary without having to meet the requirements of the German Foreign Trade Act ( Außenwirtschaftsgesetz , “AWG”) (i.e. in particular without acquiring the company concerned).

According to the amendment to the EnSiG, the Bundesnetzagentur can be appointed as fiduciary of the abovementioned companies if there is a real risk that the companies will not contribute to the functioning of the energy system, thereby jeopardising security of supply.

The Bundesnetzagentur can then manage the business of the companies concerned to ensure that vital gas needs are met.

This fiduciary management may be carried out for a maximum of 12 months.

After that, the companies may – as a last resort – be expropriated in return for appropriate compensation if security of supply cannot be guaranteed by the fiduciary management.

Gas backup reserve and fuel stockpiling The German Act on Keeping Backup Power Plants Available to Reduce Gas Consumption in the Electricity Sector ( Gesetz zur Bereithaltung von Ersatzkraftwerken zur Reduzierung des Gasverbrauchs im Stromsektor ) also came into force on 12 July 2022.

This allows coal-fired power plants forming part of the grid reserve to participate in the electricity market again, subject to two prerequisites.

Firstly, the alert level must have been triggered in accordance with the gas emergency plan.

This is already the case.

Secondly, participation in the electricity market must be authorised by an ordinance issued by the Federal Government.

This was published in the Federal Gazette on 13 July 2022 under the title “Ordinance on the Temporary Expansion of Electricity Generation using Plants from the Grid Reserve” ( Verordnung zur befristeten Ausweitung des Stromerzeugungsangebots durch Anlagen aus der Netzreserve ) and came into force on 14 July.  

The ordinance stipulates that the power plants forming part of the grid reserve may participate in the electricity market until midnight on 30 April 2023.

This is less than the maximum period laid down in the Act, namely until 31 March 2024. 

The plant operator must then notify the Bundesnetzagentur of the plant’s participation in the electricity market five working days in advance.

The Act also bans the closure of coal-fired power plants that were supposed to be shut down this year and in 2023 until 31 March 2024.

As from 1 November 2022, operators of reserve plants must keep these ready for continuous operation as temporary participants in the electricity market."
Gleiss Lutz,SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – THE LATEST ON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT’S MEASURES,"As from 1 November 2022, operators of reserve plants must keep these ready for continuous operation as temporary participants in the electricity market.

To comply with this obligation, the EnWG now requires fuel to be stockpiled.

It provides that – as of 1 November in 2022 and 2023 and as of February in 2023 and 2024 – sufficient fuel stocks must be available to generate electricity at the maximum possible net nominal capacity for 30 calendar days if coal is used and 10 calendar days if oil is used.

It also provides that lignite reserve plants will be transferred from the grid reserve to a newly created supply reserve from 1 October 2022 until 31 March 2024 and will be permanently decommissioned as of midnight on 31 March 2024.

These plants will serve the purpose of making additional generating capacities available to the electricity supply system at short notice, in particular to reduce the amount of gas consumed for electricity generation.

The supply reserve will also have to be activated by means of an ordinance.

Operators must ensure that their plants – while part of the supply reserve – can be operational within 240 hours of such an ordinance coming into force.

The supply reserve is currently still subject to approval under state aid law, as the plant operators are to receive remuneration for the period during which this reserve applies.

Conclusion The legislator has initiated a wide range of regulatory measures to secure the gas supply in Germany, picking up the tempo in the run-up to parliament’s summer recess.

These measures have two aims: storing gas and stockpiling substitute fuels, on the one hand, and reducing gas consumption, on the other.

In addition, preparations are underway in the background for a possible emergency level scenario, in which – as far as can be foreseen at present – there will be considerable gas reductions for companies and consumers.

This is a very comprehensive package of measures.

Companies that use gas and operators of generating plants should carefully assess what impact this will have on their business.

The last few weeks have also shown that companies should keep a close eye on regulatory developments to stay abreast of the rapid changes in this sector."

Gleiss Lutz,OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY: 2023 SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN PUBLISHED AND FIRST AUCTIONS KICKED OFF,"On 20 January 2023, Germany’s Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency ( Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie , “BSH”) published its 2023 site development plan ( Flächenentwicklungsplan ).

This plan puts the country’s statutory goals for expansion of offshore wind energy on a sound footing.

These goals were recently expanded when the Offshore Wind Energy Act ( Gesetz zur Entwicklung und Förderung der Windenergie auf See , “WindSeeG”) was amended with effect as of 1 January 2023, stipulating that installed capacity be increased to 30 gigawatts by 2030.

To reach these goals, the 2023 WindSeeG provides for a number of measures to accelerate planning and approval processes, a significantly larger area across which capacity will be auctioned, and new auction procedures.

The recently published 2023 site development plan forms a basis for realising offshore wind energy expansion.

The first auctions have already started for offshore wind energy installations located on sites which have not been subject to a preliminary investigation conducted centrally.

What the 2023 site development plan covers The site development plan is prepared, amended and updated by the BSH in accordance with the WindSeeG. It forms the foundation of sectoral planning in offshore wind energy, setting binding stipulations for specific areas and sites for wind energy generation in the North Sea and Baltic as well as the auction volume and how it is distributed.

In addition, the plan governs grid connection and commissioning of offshore wind energy installations, offering a basis for a European offshore electricity grid connecting individual wind farms.

The plan also defines a test area to support research and development in Germany’s territorial waters.

Realising the goal of expanding installed offshore wind energy capacity to 30 gigawatts by 2030 will mean more than quadrupling current capacity, which stands at 8 gigawatts.

The 2023 site development plan therefore identifies potential sites, consolidates capacity on existing sites, and defines which auction procedure the specific sites are auctioned in.

The next step is for the BSH to carry out a preliminary investigation, where this is stipulated by the 2023 plan; other sites will be put up for auction without such investigation.

As a rule, it is the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur, “ BNetzA ” ) that puts the stipulated areas and sites up for auction.

“Other energy generation areas” ( sonstige Energiegewinnungsbereiche ) constitute an exception and are dealt with below.

If a preliminary investigation of the sites has been carried out, the results of the investigation are made available to the bidders.

Once the approval procedure has been completed, successful bidders construct wind energy installations on the respective site.

Such bidders are entitled to the market premium (where their bid exceeded zero) and to use grid connection capacity.

The site development plan schedules the years in which auctions are held as well as the commissioning of wind energy installations together with their grid connections.

2021 and 2022 saw the first auctions of offshore installations located on North Sea and Baltic sites which had been subject to a preliminary investigation conducted centrally; further auctions are planned for 2023 to 2027.

The next auction for such sites will be for the N-3.5, N-3.6, N-6.6 and N-6.7 sites in the North Sea.

This auction is scheduled for 2023 and will be announced on the website of the BNetzA’s Ruling Chamber 6.

Start of offshore auctions for sites which have not been subject to a preliminary investigation conducted centrally The first auctions for offshore wind energy installations were announced on the BNetzA’s website on 31 January 2023.

The auctions are for the N-11.1, N-12.1, N-12.2 sites in the North Sea and the O-2.2 site in the Baltic Sea.

These sites were not subject to a preliminary investigation conducted centrally."
Gleiss Lutz,OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY: 2023 SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN PUBLISHED AND FIRST AUCTIONS KICKED OFF,"The auctions are for the N-11.1, N-12.1, N-12.2 sites in the North Sea and the O-2.2 site in the Baltic Sea.

These sites were not subject to a preliminary investigation conducted centrally.

The total auction volume is 7 gigawatts, and all bids must be submitted by 1 June 2023.

According to the auction information, the maximum value for electricity from the offshore wind energy installations at these sites is 6.2 ct/KWh.

Commissioning of the wind energy installations and associated grid connections for these sites is planned for Q3 2030 and, in the case of the N-11.2 site, for Q4 2030.

The remaining sites designated in the 2023 site development plan that have not been subject to a preliminary investigation conducted centrally, namely N-11.2 and N-12.3, are scheduled to be auctioned in 2024 and commissioned in 2031.

More detailed information on the requirements for bids and further guidance can be found on the website of the BNetzA’s Ruling Chamber 6.

New auction procedure for projects in “other energy generation areas”

In addition to areas and sites for wind energy generation, “ other energy generation areas ” can be designated in the site development plan.

Offshore wind energy installations and other energy generation installations which, in both cases, are not to be connected to the grid can be constructed in other energy generation areas to test new innovative concepts.

Other energy generation installations means installations that generate electricity or other energy carriers from renewable energies other than wind.

The WindSeeG explicitly mentions the use of hydropower, for example.

In other energy generation areas – which by definition are not connected to the grid – the main potential uses are those that do not require a grid connection, e.g. because the electricity generated there is consumed directly at sea.

This could be the case for an electrolysis plant for hydrogen production.

Following the cancellation of SEO-1 (designated in the 2020 site development plan), SEN-1 is now the only “other energy generation area” designated in the 2023 site development plan.

The SEN-1 site covers approximately 101.61 km 2 and is located in the Exclusive Economic Zone (“ EEZ ”) of the North Sea.

If hydrogen were to be produced at SEN-1 by means of electrolysis using electricity from offshore wind farms, the area could be connected with a hydrogen pipeline.

The Ordinance on the Allocation of Other Energy Generation Areas in the EEZ ( Verordnung zur Vergabe von sonstigen Energiegewinnungsbereichen in der AWZ , “ SoEnergieV ”) has introduced a new auction procedure specifically for other energy generation areas.

Application authorisations for zoning procedures for the construction and operation of energy generation installations are awarded as part of this auction procedure, which – in contrast to other auctions – is not carried out by the BNetzA but by the BSH.

Such an auction procedure will be announced on the BSH’s website within six months of the announcement of the 2023 site development plan and will be carried out at the earliest six months after this announcement, i.e. for SEN-1 probably between August 2023 and January 2024 .

When submitting the respective bids, specific information must be provided on the project to be realised in the (sub-)areas of the SEN-1 site, including information on the envisaged energy conversion chain and the final energy carrier, the anticipated quantity of energy to be generated, the innovative aspects of the project and the concept for transporting the final energy carrier, insofar as the energy generated is not consumed at sea.

Overall, it must be clear from the project description that the project in question can be implemented in other energy generation areas, as would be the case for a hydrogen project, for example.

Summary and outlook The expansion of offshore wind energy is picking up speed."
Gleiss Lutz,OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY: 2023 SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN PUBLISHED AND FIRST AUCTIONS KICKED OFF,"Summary and outlook The expansion of offshore wind energy is picking up speed.

The 2023 site development plan creates the framework conditions for rapid expansion so that the relevant goals can be achieved.

The next procedure for updating the site development plan in order to lay down the expansion plans beyond 2030 is likely to begin as early as this spring.

The first auctions for offshore wind energy installation in the North Sea and Baltic have already started, and several more are planned for this year."
Gleiss Lutz,ESTABLISHMENT OF HYDROGEN CORE NETWORK,"The hydrogen core network will connect future hydrogen producers and consumers throughout Germany.

Section 28r Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , “EnWG”) now provides a procedure for bringing together industry and public administration in a cooperative process.

An accompanying innovative financing concept is intended to resolve the common infrastructure problem of high (ramp-up) investment costs.

A germany-wide hydrogen network for the economy of the future The German government sees hydrogen as the backbone of a climate-friendly economy of the future.

For this to become a reality, hydrogen producers and consumers will have to be connected through network infrastructure.

The details for establishing Germany-wide hydrogen core network infrastructure are now set out in section 28r EnWG which came into force on 29 December 2023.

Under this provision, the main future hydrogen producers and consumers as well as hydrogen storage facilities are to be connected by the “hydrogen core network” by 2032.

Companies from sectors that are difficult to decarbonise and have a high greenhouse gas reduction potential – and for which there is no energy- and cost-efficient alternative – are to be prioritised for connection.

Non-essential hydrogen consumers will then be connected as part of the network development plan.

Construction of the hydrogen core network by transmission system operators The transmission system operators will be responsible for constructing the hydrogen core network, which will mean easier use of already existing natural gas network infrastructure in particular.

Pursuant to section 28r(2) EnWG, the transmission system operators have the right to initiate the planning for a nationwide hydrogen core network and have until 19 January 2024 to submit an application to the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) for approval of their plans.

A draft application was in fact submitted to the Bundesnetzagentur on 15 November 2023 and the consultation process ended on 8 January 2024.

The transmission system operators are now expected to formally apply to the Bundesnetzagentur for approval of the core network, with the application taking into account the findings from the consultation process.

The Bundesnetzagentur will decide whether or not to approve the network.

Current planning status of the hydrogen core network The draft application of the transmission system operators provides for a 9,700 km-long supra-regional hydrogen network, 60% of which will comprise converted natural gas pipelines.

This means that much of the planned hydrogen infrastructure is already in place.

However, since conversion of the infrastructure must not put the public’s current energy supply at risk, section 28r(2) EnWG stipulates that it will only be possible to convert natural gas pipelines if this does not jeopardise the current security of supply.

Cooperative process for faster results Section 28r EnWG is aimed at securing prompt approval of the hydrogen core network.

As a result, the Bundesnetzagentur has no discretion when it comes to approving the network and, in order to save time, any applications by transmission system operators that do not meet the criteria for approval pursuant to section 28r(6), sentence 1 EnWG will not be rejected.

The Bundesnetzagentur will instead be able to require that the application be amended accordingly.

If the transmission system operators fail to make use of their right to initiate planning, section 28r(3) EnWG sets a four-month time limit for the Bundesnetzagentur to design the hydrogen core network itself.

In this way, the hydrogen core network is conceptualised as a cooperative process between the energy sector and public administration.

However, from a purely practical standpoint, the establishment of Germany-wide energy infrastructure will also affect the general public."
Gleiss Lutz,ESTABLISHMENT OF HYDROGEN CORE NETWORK,"However, from a purely practical standpoint, the establishment of Germany-wide energy infrastructure will also affect the general public.

In construction law, the typically divergent interests of citizens, hydrogen producers and consumers, transmission system operators and public administration converge in complex balancing processes.

In some instances, balancing these interests on a case-by-case basis will have the potential to create a permanent obstacle to the construction of a hydrogen core network.

The legislator has therefore anticipated the balancing process in section 28r(8)

EnWG and, on the basis that rapid construction of the hydrogen core network is necessary and urgent for the future energy industry, taken the general basic decision that the hydrogen core network infrastructure to be commissioned by 2030 is in the overriding public interest .

This principle has already been established in section 2 Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Eneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz ) for the expansion of renewable energies.

In this context, judicial practice over the past year shows that this basic decision by the legislator has given renewable energies additional clout in court reviews.

It is therefore to be expected that a parallel basic decision in favour of the expansion of the hydrogen core network will accelerate the implementation of the hydrogen core infrastructure under construction law.

Financing the hydrogen core network

The hydrogen core network is expected to involve investment costs of around EUR 20 billion.

The financing will generally be accomplished through market-based fees.

As only a few hydrogen users will be connected to the hydrogen core network during the market ramp-up phase, however, the fees charged will likely not cover the investment costs during this phase.

In anticipation of this, the German government has developed a “fee deferral” concept, in which revenue shortfalls from the construction phase will be offset against increased revenues from the operating phase.

Fee deferral is based on a two-pillar model in which network fees for users will be capped and the Federal Government will set up an “amortisation account” to be used for interim financing of the difference between the initially high investment costs and the later (presumably) higher fee revenues.

This will ensure that users connected at a later time bear a share of the initial investment costs.

The plan is for the amortisation account to be balanced by 2055.

If the shortfall has not been made up for by then, subsidiary state cover will take effect and the Federal Government will pay the shortfall, with the operators of the hydrogen core network contributing up to 24%.

Whereas the capped fees will benefit the network users (hydrogen producers and consumers) and in this way make the hydrogen network more attractive to users, the purpose of the amortisation account is to encourage investment in the hydrogen core network.

This is to pave the way for the infrastructure to be financed entirely by the private sector.

The subsidiary state coverage of any shortfall in the amortisation account will provide additional security for the network operators and investors.

Conclusion The construction of a Germany-wide hydrogen network is an ambitious large-scale infrastructure project.

The hydrogen core network is intended to ensure the supra-regional transport of hydrogen and will serve as the foundation for the future hydrogen economy.

As such, it will connect producers and consumers.

The planned completion by 2032 underscores the significance of hydrogen as a future energy source.

Against this background, the process culminating in a hydrogen core network is structured as a cooperative process between industry and the Bundesnetzagentur."
Gleiss Lutz,ESTABLISHMENT OF HYDROGEN CORE NETWORK,"Against this background, the process culminating in a hydrogen core network is structured as a cooperative process between industry and the Bundesnetzagentur.

This cooperation is reflected in the right of the transmission system operators to initiate planning, in the various measures to speed up the process and in the legislator’s affirmation that the hydrogen core network is in the overriding public interest.

At the same time, the Federal Government’s innovative financing concept ensures that the project will be attractive for both users and investors.

Section 28r EnWG is thus intended to combine the strengths of industry and public administration and to ensure the rapid establishment of sustainable energy infrastructure."
Gleiss Lutz,“GREEN DEAL” LEADS TO RADICAL CHANGES: COMMISSION’S NEW DRAFT GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY,"The draft revised guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy have been eagerly awaited.

On 7 June 2021, the European Commission published the draft of the so-called “Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy 2022” , or CEEAG for short (hereinafter the “draft CEEAG”).

Together with the publication of the draft, the Commission also invited interested parties to take part in a public consultation, setting a deadline of 2 August 2021 for responses.

Although this is only a draft of the new guidelines, it is already worth taking a look at the key changes and possible implications for State aid in the future.

CEEAG vs EEAG

The draft CEEAG contains numerous changes as compared to the current Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (“ EEAG ”).

At almost 100 pages, the main part of the draft CEEAG exceeds its predecessor by far.

For example, the Commission has integrated several new categories of aid in the draft CEEAG, including aid for the reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions (4.1), aid for the acquisition or leasing of clean transport vehicles and the deployment of recharging or refuelling infrastructure (4.3), as well as aid for resource efficiency and for supporting the transition towards a circular economy (4.4).

In addition, special provisions for energy-intensive users (4.11) and aid for the closure of power plants that burn coal, peat or oil shale (4.12) have also been created.

Structurally, the draft CEEAG is still similar to the EEAG at least insofar as the individual categories of aid are preceded by a general section.

This general section applies to all categories of aid, unless the general criteria are clarified, amended or rendered inapplicable in the more category-specific sections.

Categories of aid that are to be assessed solely on the basis of the general criteria are no longer included in the draft CEEAG.

In this respect, the structural approach differs from the current EEAG, which, for example, make aid to undertakings that go beyond Union standards or that increase the level of environmental protection in the absence of such standards subject only to the general criteria.

In the draft CEEAG, aid to undertakings that go beyond Union standards or that increase the level of environmental protection in the absence of such standards is still taken into account, but is now reflected in the new section 4.5.

Overall, therefore, the categories of aid in the draft CEEAG appear at first glance to be more comprehensive.

This is also made clear in the new section 4.1.

General criteria

The general section already shows an increasing trend towards granting aid on the basis of a competitive bidding process (see para.

48 et seq.).

Only in the event that this was not done does the Commission refer to determining the extra costs on the basis of a counterfactual analysis (para.

50 et seq.).

In certain cases where a competitive bidding process was not carried out, the Commission now also explicitly refers to the possibility of compensation models, which may consist of a mix of ex ante and ex post features or even a claw-back mechanism (para. 53).

In addition, it is noticeable that the strict thresholds for individual notifications to the Commission – as laid down in para.

20 EEAG and which, in the absence of a competitive bidding process, can lead to an individual notification obligation despite an approved aid scheme – are no longer to be found in the draft CEEAG.

However, the draft CEEAG contain a general provision allowing the Commission to require individual notification in certain cases.

In this respect, the Commission does refer to “further factors” which it will take into account when weighing up certain aid schemes, however, whether it will make a difference remains to be seen.

In addition to such an individual notification obligation, para."
Gleiss Lutz,“GREEN DEAL” LEADS TO RADICAL CHANGES: COMMISSION’S NEW DRAFT GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY,"In addition to such an individual notification obligation, para.

72 also provides for the possibility of limiting the duration of aid measures.

Aid schemes may be subject to an ex post evaluation even if they have already been approved by the Commission (para.

399 et seq.).

The Commission refers in particular to schemes with large aid budgets (more than EUR 150 million per year or EUR 750 million over the total duration of the scheme).

However, an ex post evaluation is also conceivable in other cases (e.g. aid schemes with new features).

Member States must also submit an evaluation plan to the Commission.

Another new aspect is the explicit reference to the fact that measures must not entail a violation of Union law (see para.

32).

This is the product of recent case law.

The categories of aid in the draft CEEAG – in particular aid for the reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions Section 4.1 (Aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions including through support for renewable energy) represents a significant change.

In addition to already known instruments such as carbon capture and storage, this section also includes the reduction or removal of emissions resulting from industrial processes.

The Commission explicitly points out that aid can in principle be an appropriate means of decarbonisation and that a variety of different instruments can therefore be used.

In addition to the possibility of grants, it explicitly refers to so-called contracts for difference, which can also be structured as “carbon contracts for difference”.

Aid linked to operation is now explicitly mentioned as well (para. 103).

The Commission seems to be interested in the measures being technology-neutral.

Member States should therefore at least give reasons if the measures do not take into account all technologies or projects that are in competition (see para.

82).

At first glance, the newly introduced requirement that the Member State must carry out a public consultation prior to notification seems surprising (see para.

85).

This may take a minimum of four weeks or a minimum of eight weeks, depending on the amount of annual aid.

The results of such a consultation process must also be published.

This is – at least with this broad scope – a new aspect that many Member State authorities could find difficult to implement.

It could even slow down the whole process of granting aid.

However, exceptions to the obligation to carry out a public consultation appear to be possible under certain (stringent) conditions (see in particular para.

86).

Furthermore, the Commission seems to assume that aid on the basis of section 4.1 should generally be granted through a competitive bidding process (para. 89).

The exceptions to this rule concern specific smaller projects or cases where there is insufficient supply to ensure competition.

This means that aid must in future be applied for in an open, transparent, non-discriminatory and “clear” process involving competition with other undertakings.

It is presumably the Commission’s view that this move towards the general use of competitive bidding processes should lead to a needs-based and more proportionate aid level that is limited to the minimum needed.

As far as aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions is concerned, this goes hand in hand with a move away from the predefined maximum aid rates (aid intensities), which still largely appear and are used in the current EEAG.

According to the new provision, it would appear that it is the outcome of the competitive bidding process that plays the main role in the aid amount.

As already explained above, it appears that the draft CEEAG no longer provides for an individual notification obligation as from a specific amount of aid despite an approved underlying aid scheme."
Gleiss Lutz,“GREEN DEAL” LEADS TO RADICAL CHANGES: COMMISSION’S NEW DRAFT GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY,"As already explained above, it appears that the draft CEEAG no longer provides for an individual notification obligation as from a specific amount of aid despite an approved underlying aid scheme.

Section 4.1 adds the provision that an individual notification obligation or a time limitation for the aid measures is only to be ordered in cases where measures are particularly novel or complex or the Commission identifies risks of additional competition distortions (para. 111).

Brief overview of other categories of aid covered by the draft CEEAG Section 4 of the draft CEEAG provides for further categories of aid.

These are summarised briefly below: Aid for the improvement of the energy and environmental performance of buildings (4.2):

This relates particularly to aid for improving energy efficiency, Aid for clean mobility (4.3): This covers aid for the acquisition and leasing of clean transport vehicles and clean service equipment and for the retrofitting of vehicles and aid for the deployment of recharging or refuelling infrastructure, Aid for resource efficiency and for supporting the transition towards a circular economy (4.4): This includes, among other things, aid for investments improving resource efficiency through a reduction in the resources consumed in the production of the same quantity of output or through the replacement of primary raw materials with re-used or recycled materials, Aid for the prevention or the reduction of pollution other than from greenhouse gases (4.5):

This section covers aid for undertakings which go beyond Union standards or comply with Union standards that are not yet in force or which increase the level of environmental protection in the absence of such standards, Aid for the remediation of contaminated sites, for the rehabilitation of natural habitats and ecosystems and for biodiversity and nature-based solutions (4.6), Aid in the form of reductions in taxes or parafiscal levies (4.7), Aid for the security of electricity supply (4.8): This covers, for example, capacity mechanisms, and provides for a public consultation, Aid for energy infrastructure (4.9), Aid for district heating or cooling (4.10):

This category relates to support for the construction or upgrade of energy efficient district heating and cooling systems, Aid in the form of reductions from electricity levies for energy-intensive users (4.11): Section 4.11 now explicitly refers to energy-intensive users and covers aid in the form of reductions from electricity levies.

The current EEAG already provide for a similar category of aid in section 3.7 (aid in the form of reductions in or exemptions from environmental taxes and in the form of reductions in funding support for electricity from renewable sources), but some of the details have changed: Section 4.11 includes levies financing support to renewable sources and combined heat and power as well as financing social tariffs or energy prices in isolated regions.

Levies which reflect part of the cost of providing electricity (such as exemptions from network charges or financing of capacity mechanisms) are not covered, however.

The section does not cover levies on the consumption of other forms of energy, such as natural gas, either (para.

354).

Reductions may only be granted if the overall cumulative level of these levies, before any reductions, exceeds a certain amount (para.

356).

The Commission has not proposed a specific figure for this as yet.

Such an upper limit is new, however.

Aid based on section 4.11 is to be limited to sectors that are particularly exposed.

These are characterised by two factors, a trade intensity of at least 20% and an electro-intensity of at least 10% at Union level.

In addition, the Commission considers that a similar risk exists in the case of undertakings with an electro-intensity of at least 7% and a trade intensity of at least 80%.

The Commission has listed these sectors in Annex I to the draft CEEAG."
Gleiss Lutz,“GREEN DEAL” LEADS TO RADICAL CHANGES: COMMISSION’S NEW DRAFT GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY,"The Commission has listed these sectors in Annex I to the draft CEEAG.

The Commission generally considers the aid to be proportionate if the beneficiary pays at least 25% of the levies covered by the aid scheme (see para.

359 et seq.

for details).

This is higher than in the current EEAG, under which 15% is sufficient in the context of aid in the form of reductions in the funding of support for energy from renewable sources (para. 188).

In addition, section 4.11 now also provides that undertakings that conduct an energy audit must meet additional requirements.

According to this, undertakings must, for example, reduce their carbon footprint so as to cover 30% of their electricity consumption from carbon-free sources, or must invest a significant share of at least 50% of the aid amount in projects that lead to substantial reductions of their installation’s greenhouse gas emissions.

The current EEAG provide for such conditions for example in the context of aid in the form of reductions in or exemptions from environmental taxes and in that case also only as an alternative to the 20% threshold (see para.

178 EEAG).

Aid for coal, peat and oil shale closure (4.12): This covers two different measures, namely aid for early closure and aid for exceptional costs resulting from closure.

Outlook The almost 100 pages of the draft CEEAG contain a large number of changes as compared to the current EEAG.

Section 4.1 seems to be the most striking change and at the same time shows where the Commission’s focus lies, namely on the decarbonisation of industrial production processes.

It is not yet possible to say whether the draft CEEAG will ultimately come into force in this form.

There are likely to be a great number of submissions as part of the public consultation process that is currently underway.

The additional administrative hurdles could pose challenges for some Member States, in particular, and jeopardise the swift implementation of potential aid measures.

The strong focus on competitive bidding processes could reinforce this tendency.

This is all the more so because projects submitted as part of such a competitive bidding process may differ in terms of objective, sector, technology, content and funding level, which could pose further challenges for Member States.

It remains to be seen whether this will ultimately be a merely theoretical problem, which the Commission will solve by way of a flexible and practicable interpretation of the exceptions.

The outcome of the public consultation, as well as any resulting changes to the current draft of the CEEAG, should therefore be awaited with great anticipation."
Gleiss Lutz,CONVERSION DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT ADOPTED: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-BORDER CHANGES OF LEGAL FORM AND DIVISIONS OF CORPORATIONS – SIMPLIFICATION OF MERGERS – ACCELERATION OF SHAREHOLDER COMPENSATION APPRAISAL PROCEEDINGS,"The Bundestag adopted the Act Implementing the European Conversion Directive (EU) 2019/2121 ( Gesetz zur Umsetzung der europäischen Umwandlungsrichtlinie (EU) 2019/2121 ) on 20 January 2023.

The Act was also passed by the Bundesrat on 10 February 2023.

The German Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz , “UmwG”) provides, for the first time, a legal framework for cross-border divisions and cross-border changes of legal form of corporations in the EU and the EEA.

In addition, cross-border mergers have been simplified and changes have been made to accelerate shareholder compensation appraisal proceedings.

On 1 December 2022, the Bundestag also enacted amendments to the Act on Employee Participation in the Event of a Cross-Border Merger ( Gesetz über die Mitbestimmung der Arbeitnehmer bei einer grenzüberschreitenden Verschmelzung , “MgVG”) and adopted a new Act on Employee Participation in the Event of a Cross-Border Change of Legal Form or Cross-Border Division ( Gesetz über die Mitbestimmung der Arbeitnehmer bei grenzüberschreitendem Formwechsel und grenzüberschreitender Spaltung , “MgFSG”).

The amendments to the MgVG and the MgFSG came into force on 31 January 2023.

The new provisions in the UmwG will come into force on the day after they are promulgated, probably in mid-February.

I. Framework for cross-border conversion measures The provisions on cross-border conversion measures are brought together in a new sixth book of the UmwG, with the provisions on cross-border mergers serving as a model for cross-border divisions and cross-border changes of legal form: In Germany, the provisions on cross-border conversion measures apply to stock corporations ( AG ), Societates Europaeae ( SE ), partnerships limited by shares ( KGaA ) and limited liability companies ( GmbH ).

Partnerships continue to be covered only in the case of cross-border mergers into a general partnership (OHG)/limited partnership (KG) with, as a rule, fewer than 500 employees, and are otherwise referred to Articles 49, 54 TFEU and the case law on freedom of establishment.

Without complementary provisions in other Member States, a provision for partnerships introduced by the German legislator would hardly have been of any practical use.

The Conversion Directive itself only regulates divisions for the formation of a new company.

This means that there might not be complementary provisions in other Member States governing divisions for absorption .

Moreover, the UmwG only allows cross-border divisions for absorption if, in the case of an outbound division, the transferring company and the receiving company have each employed fewer than 400 employees in the six months prior to the announcement of the draft terms of the division.

Inbound division for absorption is limited to companies that employ, on average, less than four-fifths of the number of employees that would trigger employee participation in the departure Member State.

A prerequisite for cash compensation for shareholders exiting the company on account of a cross-border conversion measure is that the absorbing or new company is not subject to German law and an objection to the relevant shareholders’ resolution has been lodged in writing.

A two-stage procedure is laid down in this regard: the respective shareholder must submit a corresponding declaration of intent one month after the resolution on the conversion measure and acceptance must be declared at the latest two months after the resolution.

The exiting shareholders may demand security.

In the case of cross-border mergers and divisions, it is possible – in the event of an inappropriate exchange ratio – for an AG/SE/KGaA to (also) provide for compensation for shareholders by granting additional shares instead of a cash payment, in order to preserve its liquidity and facilitate investments in the context of restructurings.

This possibility must however be laid down in the draft terms of the conversion."
Gleiss Lutz,CONVERSION DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT ADOPTED: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-BORDER CHANGES OF LEGAL FORM AND DIVISIONS OF CORPORATIONS – SIMPLIFICATION OF MERGERS – ACCELERATION OF SHAREHOLDER COMPENSATION APPRAISAL PROCEEDINGS,"This possibility must however be laid down in the draft terms of the conversion.

In shareholder compensation appraisal proceedings, the court may increase the number of shares to be granted.

Complex adjustment mechanisms are set out for interim dividend payments, capital increases, conversion measures, etc.

It is not specified whether a non-cash contribution review is required in the case of compensation in shares and whether the shares can be created using authorised capital.

Moreover, there is no cross-border harmonisation of procedures concerning the necessity and amount of a compensation (in particular no cross-border erga omnes effect), but only a requirement for cooperation.

As far as the protection of creditors is concerned, the underlying system has been changed, with creditors’ rights being strengthened.

The draft terms of the conversion must specify what security will be offered to the creditors of a German transferring or form-changing company for claims that arose before the draft terms were announced but have not yet fallen due and whose fulfilment is jeopardised by the conversion measure.

If no security is offered or this is, in the creditors’ view, insufficient, the creditors may demand the provision of adequate security within three months of the announcement of the draft terms.

If a claim for the provision of security is asserted in court, the registration of a conversion measure cannot take place.

The court in whose district the registry court responsible for issuing the pre-conversion certificate is located will have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes concerning the claim for the provision of safeguards.

This centralisation of jurisdiction, which was only introduced by the Rechtsausschuss (Committee on Legal Affairs of the Bundestag), eliminates the risk of a multitude of court proceedings in Germany and abroad dealing with the creditors’ entitlement to security.

The registry court may not issue the pre-conversion certificate for registration of the cross-border conversion measure until the creditors’ application period has expired, their application has been rejected with final and binding effect or the specified security has been provided.

In addition, the members of the representative body must, at the request of the court, affirm that the security offered has been provided to all creditors.

Providing a false affirmation is punishable by law.

With creditor protection as a prerequisite for registration and an instrument for blocking entry in the register, there can be a considerable delay until the conversion measure is registered.

A procedure with EU-wide compatibility will be introduced in which the participating commercial registers or competent foreign agencies communicate directly with each other digitally through the European Business Register Interconnection System (BRIS).

In this context, the pre-conversion certificate concerning the respective domestic prerequisites for a conversion measure will also be adapted and issued ex officio in future.

One novelty is the (substantive) abuse test to be carried out by the German registry court or the competent foreign agency for all cross-border conversion measures as part of issuing the pre-conversion certificate.

It must be checked whether the cross-border conversion measure is set up for abusive or fraudulent purposes leading to or aimed at the evasion or circumvention of EU or national law, or for criminal purposes, if there are factors indicating that this may be the case.

The lack of detailed requirements for abuse control (the Act only mentions three examples involving employee participation, the handling of pension liabilities, and disadvantaging of creditors) may lead to problems, especially in the case of crisis-related restructuring, and may also hinder reorganisation measures given that the check may cause a delay of up to six months."
Gleiss Lutz,CONVERSION DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT ADOPTED: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-BORDER CHANGES OF LEGAL FORM AND DIVISIONS OF CORPORATIONS – SIMPLIFICATION OF MERGERS – ACCELERATION OF SHAREHOLDER COMPENSATION APPRAISAL PROCEEDINGS,"Especially when it comes to employee participation, minimum levels of capital and creditor protection, the different degrees of protection offered by the Member States should be respected by the registry courts in the context of freedom of establishment.

In addition, creditor protection is sufficiently covered by the obligation to provide security.

When registering the cross-border conversion measure, the members of the representative body must in future give assurances that there are no grounds for insolvency proceedings to be opened in respect of the transferring or form-changing German company.

If such assurances cannot be given, the grounds for insolvency must be stated, as well as whether insolvency proceedings have been applied for or opened.

II.

Corporate co-determination aspects in the case of cross-border conversion measures The protection of corporate co-determination for employees in cross-border conversion measures is – in the case of cross-border mergers – ensured by the negotiation model stipulated in the MgVG with a statutory fall-back provision that has now been adapted.

Where cross-border changes of legal form and divisions are concerned, the newly created MgFSG also provides for a negotiation model with a statutory fall-back provision : Accordingly, negotiations on employee participation are now already required if one of the companies involved has a number of employees that corresponds to at least 4/5 of the threshold that triggers corporate co-determination in the outbound Member State, which in Germany is 400 employees (4/5 of the threshold of 500 employees under the One-Third Employee Representation Act).

If no agreement is reached in the course of the negotiations, the employee participation regime of the transferring company will apply on a permanent basis in the absorbing company.

This is not entirely persuasive, particularly if a division gives rise to small companies that are permanently subject to the employee participation regime of the transferring company.

Moreover, in the case of cross-border changes of legal form and divisions, companies not subject to employee participation will be forced to enter into time-consuming negotiations, at the end of which the statutory fall-back solution will confirm that such companies are still not subject to employee participation.

Unlike in the case of mergers, where cross-border changes of legal form and divisions are at issue, there is no possibility to apply the statutory fall-back provision without prior negotiations.

The MgFSG also provides for protection of corporate co-determination in subsequent conversion measures .

If, after a cross-border change of legal form or a cross-border division into Germany, employee participation exists in the resulting company and a further domestic conversion measure is adopted in this company within four years , the MgFSG will apply to this measure accordingly.

The MgFSG applies for an unlimited period of time to scenarios in which a company resulting from a cross-border conversion measure carries out a further cross-border change of legal form or a further cross-border division and the resulting company has its registered office in Germany.

Employee participation in the German company according to the MgFSG must then be negotiated.

III.

Significant changes in the case of domestic conversion measures The implemention of the Conversion Directive will also give rise to changes to provisions for domestic conversion measures, which from a practical standpoint will lead to simplifications: In the UmwG, the mandatory information, the structure, as well as the provisions on exceptions to the report and the audit report on conversion measures will be amended.

In the future, the report will not be necessary for a legal entity in respect of which all the shareholders have, by means of a notarised declaration, waived reimbursement without the situation of other legal entities involved having any influence on this."
Gleiss Lutz,CONVERSION DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT ADOPTED: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-BORDER CHANGES OF LEGAL FORM AND DIVISIONS OF CORPORATIONS – SIMPLIFICATION OF MERGERS – ACCELERATION OF SHAREHOLDER COMPENSATION APPRAISAL PROCEEDINGS,"In addition, there will be simplifications with respect to intragroup conversion measures such as parent-subsidiary mergers, mergers of sister companies, and for single-member companies.

In the case of stock corporations (AG)/partnerships limited by shares (KGaA)/Societates Europaeae (SE), the conversion measure will still have to be audited unless all shareholders waive this requirement.

In the future, also the shareholders of an absorbing company – as has already been the case for the shareholders of a transferring company – will no longer be able to challenge the adoption of a conversion measure by arguing that the exchange ratio is inadequate.

This means that there will no longer be a block on entry in the register due to valuation complaints .

Instead, it will only be possible to review the adequacy of the cash compensation and the exchange ratio for all legal entities in a uniform manner after a conversion measure has taken effect in the shareholder compensation appraisal proceedings .

In order to avoid contradictory decisions, the intention is for cases to be joined and judicial jurisdiction centralised at the court first seized of the matter.

To speed up shareholder compensation appraisal proceedings , an obligation to be represented by a lawyer and the jurisdiction of the Division for Commercial Matters will be introduced and the – often time-consuming – redress proceedings abolished.

In addition, when the court is assessing adequate compensation, it will be possible for a settlement with at least 90% of the parties to the proceedings to be taken into account.

This will provide a legal basis for the majority consensual assessment, which has previously been rejected by the courts.

If a compensation requirement is determined in the shareholder compensation appraisal proceedings, a stock corporation (AG)/Societas Europaea (SE)/partnership limited by shares (KGaA) will not have to provide the compensation as cash compensation only, but will also have the option of granting additional shares , even in the case of domestic changes of legal form and divisions.

However, compensation in shares by means of a capital increase against non-cash contribution of the compensation claim must already be provided for in the conversion agreement in this case as well.

The joint and several liability – of all legal entities involved in a division process – for the liabilities of the transferring legal entity is generally maintained.

In the future, however, the joint liability of the legal entities for liabilities of another legal entity involved will be limited to the value of the “net assets” (“ Nettoaktivvermögen” ) at the date on which the division takes place.

The liability periods will remain unchanged.

This limitation of liability is generally appropriate.

In practice, the challenge is to clarify the term “net assets” (“ Nettoaktivvermögen” ), which is taken directly from the Conversion Directive and has previously not been used in German Law.

However, the German Federal Ministry of Justice is of the opinion that the term has the same meaning as the German term “ Reinvermögen ”, i.e. net assets.

The changes will come into force on the day after the promulgation of the Act, probably in mid-February.

Provided that the other Member States have implemented the Conversion Directive in a timely manner, the first conversion measures under the new regime could start as early as the first quarter of 2023.

Conversion measures that are adopted before the changes come into force can be concluded under previous law, provided that they are filed for registration in the commercial register by the end of 2023.

IV.

Our assessment The far-reaching reform of conversion law fits in with the general scheme of the UmwG from a conceptual standpoint and is to be welcomed from a practical point of view."
Gleiss Lutz,CONVERSION DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT ADOPTED: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-BORDER CHANGES OF LEGAL FORM AND DIVISIONS OF CORPORATIONS – SIMPLIFICATION OF MERGERS – ACCELERATION OF SHAREHOLDER COMPENSATION APPRAISAL PROCEEDINGS,"IV.

Our assessment The far-reaching reform of conversion law fits in with the general scheme of the UmwG from a conceptual standpoint and is to be welcomed from a practical point of view.

For the first time, it creates a unified legal framework for cross-border divisions and changes of legal form of corporations in the EU and the EEA, which framework will facilitate cross-border transactions and restructurings, particularly in groups, and in many cases make them more legally secure.

A (court) practice has yet to evolve for the new mechanisms for creditor protection and control of abuse in the case of cross-border conversion measures.

The simplifications for domestic conversion measures are also helpful, even if there are still some ambiguities in the details, in respect of which an established case law and practice must also still evolve.

Cross-border conversion measures will remain technically demanding and complex.

In view of the necessary coordination with the registry courts as well as the various submission, information and publication deadlines and waiting periods, they must in any case be prepared in a careful and timely manner."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW RULES FOR ONLINE BUSINESSES – DIGITAL SERVICES ACT PUBLISHED TODAY,"Today, on 27 October 2022, the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (see here ).

Complementing the competition focused Digital Markets Act which itself was only recently published on 12 October 2022, the DSA represents another building block in the strategy of the European Commission (""Commission"") to more comprehensively regulate the digital space and strike a balance between the protection of recipients and the competitiveness of the EU market.

As we have previously laid out in more detail, the DSA specifically targets major technology companies in the form of “very large online platforms” or “very large online search engines” with at least 45 million monthly active recipients, imposing on them detailed organizational and procedural obligations to react to and combat illegal online content in a transparent manner.

While the DSA largely preserves the liability principles applicable to so called providers of intermediary services – involving the transmission, caching or hosting of information via communications networks to recipients in the EU (extraterritorial application) – established by the e-Commerce Directive of 2000, the DSA goes much further than the Directive, introducing a basic transparency regime which will apply to all such providers of intermediary services.

Hence, the DSA’s material scope may extend well beyond “typical” intermediary service providers like social media or content platforms.

Hosting service providers will be required to put in place so-called notice and action mechanisms that allow third parties to notify the provider of illegal content in an easily accessible and user-friendly way.

The moderation of such content will need to be documented and justified in a transparent manner.

From online platforms other than micro and small enterprises, the DSA further requires a sophisticated internal complaint-handling system for user complaints.

Where online platforms allow for consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders, they must comply with certain KYBC-style obligations ensure that such traders are traceable , and set-up their user interface to enable traders to comply with their own transparency obligations (so-called compliance by design ).

Restrictions on certain targeted advertising practices , in particular regarding minors, the use of sensitive personal data and so-called “black pattern practices” such as nudging, will likely have an impact even beyond the material scope of the DSA, as data protection supervisory authorities will likely seize on this legal development to bolster their own enforcement efforts directed at all actors in the advertising space.

The DSA will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication, i.e. on 16 November 2022, and will apply from 17 February 2024 .

However, the DSA may apply even sooner to “very large online platforms” and “very large online search engines”, namely from four months after they have been notified that they have been so designated by the Commission.

While the Commission will now be setting out to prepare its designation of “very large online platforms” and “very large online search engines”, the EU Member States will first have to decide whether they will designate existing authorities as enforcement authorities under the DSA (the so-called Digital Services Coordinators) or set up new authorities for this purpose.

In some states like Germany and France, data protection supervisory authorities have already voiced their interest to take on the mantle of Digital Services Coordinators, as well.

Violations of the DSA can result in significant fines up to a maximum of 6% of total worldwide annual turnover , exceeding even the maximum fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"")."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW RULES FOR ONLINE BUSINESSES – DIGITAL SERVICES ACT PUBLISHED TODAY,"Violations of the DSA can result in significant fines up to a maximum of 6% of total worldwide annual turnover , exceeding even the maximum fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"").

Under the right of complaint set out in the DSA, an increase in claims raised by individuals/consumers as well as consumer protection bodies is also likely, especially given recent jurisprudence regarding the parallel provision in the GDPR and the impending transposition of the EU Directive on representative actions in many EU Member States.

Moreover, the agreed version of the DSA has introduced a new right to compensation for recipients of intermediary services against damage or loss suffered due to an infringement of a provider of its obligations under the DSA.

Companies providing digital services would therefore be prudent to use the remaining time to review whether they fall under the broad scope of the DSA and, if so, begin adapting and/or supplementing their technical and organizational set-up to be ready for compliance with the DSA by 17 February 2024 (or sooner in the case of very large online platforms and search engines)."

Gleiss Lutz,UPDATE ON EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION (FSR),"The FSR started as a much-expected tool to contribute to the level playing field in the Single Market.

The mood, however, has changed.

The draft Implementing Regulation published by the Commission in early February received fierce criticism by companies and business associations (cf. europa.eu: Distortive foreign subsidies – procedural rules for assessing them ). 

Rather than the desired protection from distorting foreign subsidies, companies believe that the FSR will add “excessive red tape” and are concerned that the EU Commission has lost “sight of the big picture” .

Rumor has it that the Commission is planning far-reaching amendments to the draft filing forms.

According to different sources, DG COMP has unofficially spread the word that it envisages to significantly amend the – much criticized –  scope of third-country financial contributions to be notified to the Commission if an M&A deal meets the filing thresholds.

It appears that the Commission is planning, inter alia, to no longer request companies to provide, in the merger filing form, information on third country financial contributions stemming from transactions regarding the provision of goods or services or the purchase of goods or services at market terms, resulting from non-selective tax advantages, or not exceeding certain thresholds, which would be significantly higher than the thresholds currently foreseen in the draft notification forms (EUR 200k/EUR 4m).

The above amendments would significantly alleviate the companies’ administrative burden under the FSR.

They would constitute a (major) step into the direction of a more focused application of the FSR which ultimately aims at targeting foreign subsidies distorting the internal market.

For full clarity we will need to await the publication of the final version of the FSR Implementing Regulation, which is foreseen for beginning of July at the latest.

Gleiss Lutz has followed the legislative process closely and will continue to inform on important developments regarding the FSR.

Gleiss Lutz,CHANGES AFFECTING CIVIL LAW PARTNERSHIPS FOLLOWING THE REFORM OF PARTNERSHIP LAW,"Previously, a civil law partnership ( Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts, ""GbR"") could not be entered as a legal entity in the commercial register ( Handelsregister ).

This has changed with the introduction of the Act to Modernise the Law on Civil Law Partnerships ( Personengesellschaftsrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz, ""MoPeG""), which came into force on 1 January 2024.

GbRs can now be registered in a newly established partnership register kept at the local courts ( Amtsgerichte ).

Registration is neither mandatory nor necessary to act with legal capacity.

This means that a GbR can still have legal capacity without being registered in the partnership register.

Even though registration is not mandatory, it is advisable to register a GbR if there are plans to carry out transactions which require registration in a German public register.

This is particularly important for real estate transactions.

A GbR must be registered if real property or hereditary building rights are to be purchased, sold or encumbered.

Changes to the law on civil law partnerships As of 1 January 2024, the MoPeG applies to existing and newly founded GbRs, with few transitional provisions.

It introduces necessary adjustments for a more comprehensible legal framework.

By turning existing case law into statutory law and including new transparency provisions, the reform aims to increase legal certainty and transparency in business transactions involving GbRs.

Once registered in the partnership register, a GbR is irrefutably presumed to have legal capacity – something that is explicitly recognised by statute for the first time.

This will not have any impact on the current view of what constitutes an ""external"" ( außen ) or ""internal"" ( innen ) GbR or the consequences of this status for the legal capacity of a GbR.

An external GbR will still be deemed to have legal capacity as long as it participates in legal transactions.

A GbR which is neither registered nor participates in legal transactions (internal GbR) still lacks legal capacity under the new legislation.

This means that there are now three different types of GbRs: (i) registered GbRs with legal capacity, (ii) unregistered (external) GbRs with legal capacity and (iii) (internal) GbRs without legal capacity.

New register for partnerships The MoPeG introduces the possibility of registering GbRs in a new partnership register.

Information published in the partnership register is available to the public, creating an increased level of transparency.

Current problems regarding uncertainties about the actual existence of a GbR can be resolved by registering the partnership in the partnership register.

This enables a GbR not only to publish the power of representation of its partners but also to enter any location in Germany as its registered office.

The registered office need not be the administrative headquarters where the business is conducted, making it easier to relocate business activities.

Once a GbR is registered, it acquires an additional "" e "" – short for "" eingetragen "" (registered) – in its name, making it an ""eGbR"" ( eingetragene Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts ).

Situations where registration is required According to the new legislation, transactions that must be registered in a German public register and involve a GbR can only be carried out after the GbR has been validly registered in the partnership register.

This is an important change.

German public registers that require such prior registration include the commercial or company register, the land register, the DPMAregister, the list of shareholders of a limited liability company ( Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung – GmbH ) and the share register of a stock corporation ( Aktiengesellschaft – AG ).

The Land Register Code ( Grundbuchordnung, ""GBO"") now stipulates that a right will only be registered for a GbR if it has been registered in the partnership register."
Gleiss Lutz,CHANGES AFFECTING CIVIL LAW PARTNERSHIPS FOLLOWING THE REFORM OF PARTNERSHIP LAW,"The Land Register Code ( Grundbuchordnung, ""GBO"") now stipulates that a right will only be registered for a GbR if it has been registered in the partnership register.

Only such registered GbRs can be entered in the land register as the owner of real property or hereditary building rights.

However, a GbR can still be entered in the land register after 1 January 2024 according to the provisions of the previous law, if the corresponding agreement or consent was declared and the application for registration was filed with the land register before 1 January 2024.

The same applies if a priority notice was entered or consented to and applied for before 1 January 2024: the legal change secured by this priority notice can still be entered in the land register after 1 January 2024 without prior registration of the GbR.

The Limited Liability Companies Act ( Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, ""GmbHG"") provides for a similar provision that applies to any GbR acquiring shares in a limited liability company ( Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung , ""GmbH"").

Situations in which registration is advantageous As from 1 January 2024, a registered GbR can undergo conversion in accordance with the Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz, ""UmwG"" ) .

The provisions set out in the UmwG entitle any registered GbR to participate in a merger ( Verschmelzung ), spin-off ( Abspaltung ) or change of legal form ( Formwechsel ).

This makes it easier for GbRs to participate in legal transactions.

Application of the Money Laundering Act Once a GbR is registered in the new partnership register, it falls under the scope of application of the Money Laundering Act ( Geldwäschegesetz, ""GwG"").

This triggers the obligation to submit a list of its beneficial owners to the Transparency Register.

Registration procedure The application for registration in the new partnership register must be submitted by all partners of the GbR.

The application must be certified ( beglaubigt ) in front of a German notary public, a process that can also be completed via video conference.

The application must contain the following information: name of the GbR, registered office of the GbR, address in a Member State of the European Union, purpose of the GbR, unless this is clear from its name, surname, first name, date of birth and place of residence of all partners, if the partners are legal entities or partnerships with legal capacity: the name, legal form and registered office of the legal entity or partnership and, if required by law, the relevant register and register number, information on the partners’ power of representation, and confirmation that the GbR is not already registered in the commercial or partnership register.

Applications for registration in the partnership register can be submitted from 1 January 2024 onwards.

Summary and conclusion The changes following the introduction of the MoPeG will not only provide more certainty regarding GbRs, but will also facilitate the involvement of GbRs in legal transactions in general.

As of 1 January 2024, any changes that must be filed with German public registers will not be enforceable until the GbR has been registered in the new partnership register.

Even though registration is neither mandatory nor necessary for legal capacity, we recommend early registration and expect that most partners of GbRs will register their GbRs with the partnership register."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S DRAFT BILL FOR 11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION,"Germany’s Federal Cabinet approved the 11th Amendment to the Act against Restraints of Competition on 5 April 2023.

The government’s draft bill ( Regierungsentwurf ) will now be passed on to the German parliament ( Bundestag ).

There have been months of controversy since the competent Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz ) published its initial draft ( Referentenentwurf ) back in September (Article of 30 September 2022) .

That draft’s key elements have been retained in the new draft bill, in particular the extensive additional powers it granted the Federal Cartel Office ( Bundeskartellamt ).

After widespread criticism, primarily from the business community but also from academics and legal practitioners, the initial draft has been improved (at least to some extent) and extra procedural and legal safeguards put in place.

However, if passed in this form, the new bill will still make competition law in Germany considerably tougher and lead to a paradigm shift.

According to the Federal Government, the amendment aims “to improve the State’s ability, in the interest of consumers, to put a stop to malfunctioning of competition.

Antitrust intervention mechanisms are to be strengthened where market structure conflicts with competition, for example where there are only a few providers on the market and prices generally develop in parallel, to the disadvantage of consumers.”

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action wants to give antitrust law some teeth.

I. Key changes in the 11th Amendment 1. Introduction of new British-style intervention mechanisms (sections 32e and 32f of the draft bill)

New intervention mechanisms will allow the Bundeskartellamt to follow up on a sector inquiry by quickly and effectively remedying significant and continuous malfunctioning of competition.

In future, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to impose remedies following sector inquiries in order to enforce effective competition.

Such remedies will include behavioural or quasi-structural measures, such as obligations regarding access to interfaces or data.

The Bundeskartellamt will also be able to impose orders on how businesses conduct their relationships with other companies on the markets investigated or across different market levels, or on how contracts are drafted (including disclosure of information).

Companies may also be obliged to establish separate corporate divisions.

As a measure of last resort, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to impose unbundling on dominant companies – regardless of whether or not they engaged in abusive practices – to eliminate a significant, ongoing or repeated malfunctioning of competition.

For mergers that have already been approved, however, companies’ legitimate expectations will be generally protected for a ten-year period.

In addition, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to force companies in certain markets to notify virtually all mergers after a sector inquiry has been completed.

Under this new power, mergers will need to be notified where the purchaser generated more than EUR 50 million in turnover in Germany over the last financial year and the company to be acquired generated turnover of more than EUR 500,000.

The provisions of the existing section 39a GWB have therefore been significantly tightened and extended under the draft bill.

2. Simplified disgorgement of benefits from antitrust violations (section 34 of the draft bill)

Benefits derived by companies from antitrust violations are to be disgorged more easily and effectively in future.

Companies will not be allowed to keep profits from proven antitrust violations.

By law, the presumption will apply that a company has obtained a benefit amounting to 1% of its domestic turnover with the product or service relating to the proven antitrust violation."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S DRAFT BILL FOR 11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION,"By law, the presumption will apply that a company has obtained a benefit amounting to 1% of its domestic turnover with the product or service relating to the proven antitrust violation.

A cap of 10% of the total annual group turnover worldwide in the year prior to the authority’s decision is intended to alleviate hardship.

It will only be possible to rebut this presumption subject to very restrictive criteria.

3. Amendment of the procedural provisions for enforcement of the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”)

At the same time, the draft bill will create the legal basis for the Bundeskartellamt’s support of the European Commission in enforcing the new DMA.

It also aims to ensure effective private enforcement of the DMA in German courts.

II. 

Key changes in the new draft bill compared to the initial draft 1. Central provision and key concept of malfunctioning of competition in section 32f(3) of the draft bill have narrower scope Some of the wording in section 32f(3) of the draft bill (one of the new intervention mechanisms) has been significantly changed compared with the initial draft in order to accommodate the fierce criticism from the business community (for example statements by the Federal Association of German Industry (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie, “BDI”) and other business associations of 8 December 2022 as well as a statement by the BDI of 10 October 2022 ), some academics (cf.

Thomas, ZWeR 2022, 333 et seq.; Ackermann, ZWeR 2023, 1 et seq.; Grzeszick, NZKart 2023, 52 et seq.; Körber, NZKart 2023, 193 et seq.) and legal practitioners (cf. statement by the Association for the Study of Antitrust Law (Studienvereinigung Kartellrecht) of 28 October 2022 or statement 39/2022 by the German Federal Bar (Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer) ).

But in principle, this part of the draft bill continues to envisage new and far-reaching powers for the Bundeskartellamt .

Sentence 1 now states: “The Bundeskartellamt may officially determine that there is significant and continuous malfunctioning of competition on at least one market extending across Germany, several smaller markets, or across markets, where application of the powers set forth in Part 1

[of the GWB] cannot be expected to appropriately counter the identified malfunctioning of competition, given the findings available to the Bundeskartellamt at the time the decision is taken.”

The end of sentence 1 stipulates a “soft” subsidiary application, in particular in relation to the prohibition of cartels and rules on abuse.

No provision is made as to how the Bundeskartellamt is to prove in individual cases that “the other powers set forth [in the law] cannot be expected to appropriately counter the identified disruption of competition, given the findings available to the Bundeskartellamt at the time the decision is taken.”

According to the explanatory memorandum, however, the Bundeskartellamt will not be subject to very strict requirements when setting out grounds for its decision.

It remains unclear how this subsidiary application will be put into practice.

In the case of “significant [...] malfunctioning of competition” (the key concept here), the criteria “repeated or ongoing malfunctioning” have now been replaced by “continuous malfunctioning” .

The frame of reference has also been extended: “a market” has been replaced by “at least one market extending across Germany” or “several smaller markets” .

It is not clear what material changes this means compared with the initial draft.

The procedure now has two stages.

Companies that are subject to remedies may ask a court to review the order finding significant and continuous malfunctioning of competition.

This means that the results of the sector inquiry can be reviewed by a court.

By contrast, under the initial draft judicial relief would only have been available against the remedies themselves.

It would therefore only have been possible to indirectly contest the results of the sector inquiry."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S DRAFT BILL FOR 11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION,"It would therefore only have been possible to indirectly contest the results of the sector inquiry.

The draft bill is therefore responding to harsh criticisms brought by legal practitioners, according to whom companies’ need for legal relief had been insufficiently considered.

Section 32f(3), sentence 3 and sentence 4 of the draft bill also clarify the criteria for determining which companies will be subject to remedies.

The company concerned must have significantly contributed to the cause of the malfunctioning of competition and its market position must also be taken into account.

Although section 32f(3), sentence 5 of the bill gives the Bundeskartellamt the option of later extending the order to other companies, it is still likely that businesses already subject to the regulations on companies with a strong market position or market power will be the primary targets.

But the details remain vague.

2. Malfunctioning of competition Using a number of (non-exhaustive) examples drawn from complex theories of harm in competition law, section 32f(5), sentence 1 of the draft bill is more specific than the initial draft on what constitutes a significant and continuous malfunctioning of competition – a concept new to German law.

Four categories are mentioned here “in particular”: (no. 1) unilateral seller or buyer power, (no. 2) restrictions on entering or leaving a market, on company capacity, or on switching provider or customer, (no. 3) uniform or coordinated behaviour, and (no. 4) input or customer foreclosure through vertical relationships.

This attempt to be more specific addresses one of the main criticisms levelled at the initial draft, but still falls short of the mark.

The criteria for deciding when competition may be malfunctioning have also been improved in section 32f(5), sentence 2 of the draft bill.

But section 32f(5), sentence 2, no. 1-7 continues to lack a binding system for determining that malfunctioning has occurred, and is merely a guideline for the Bundeskartellamt.

This provision sets out possible indications that competition is malfunctioning (such as cross-ownership of companies (no. 2), prices, volumes, selection and quality of the goods offered (no. 3)).

A new criterion here is the degree of market dynamics (no. 6).

Under section 32f(5), sentence 2, no. 7, it is now also possible to mount an efficiency defence.

Section 32f(5), sentence 3 of the draft bill now makes it clear that the malfunctioning of competition is continuous only “if this malfunctioning has continued or occurred repeatedly over a period of three years and no indications exist at the time of the order under section 3 that it is more likely than not that the malfunctioning will cease within two years.”

This was not dealt with in the initial draft.

3.

Changes relating to remedies The wording of the extensive, but not exhaustive, list of behavioural measures in section 32f(3), sentence 7, nos.

1-6 of the draft bill has been clarified.

Two measures have been deleted, namely (i) an explicit supply obligation, although this can – at least in abstract terms – still fall under no. 2 with “requirements for the business relationships” as well as (ii) official or comparable approvals or licences.

The draft bill does, however, introduce – in no. 5 – a prohibition on the unilateral disclosure of information that favours parallel behaviour by companies.

The last resort of ordering an unbundling measure under section 32f(4) of the draft bill, which still does not require any violation, is now limited to dominant companies, and the requirements for proportionality have been clarified somewhat.

As already provided for in the initial draft, unbundling is only possible if it can be guaranteed that the malfunctioning of competition will be eliminated or significantly reduced and the behavioural remedies of section 32f(3), sentence 6 of the draft bill would not be possible or at least equally effective."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S DRAFT BILL FOR 11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION,"Section 32f(4), sentences 7 and 8 of the draft bill sets minimum proceeds of 50% of the business unit’s value as a prerequisite for unbundling and introduces a compensation provision should the proceeds fall short of the value.

If the actual sales proceeds are less than the value of the business unit as determined by the auditor appointed by the Bundeskartellamt, the state must pay half the difference between the calculated value of the relevant assets and the sales proceeds to the party ordered to carry out the unbundling.

The state must also pay for the valuation.

In this way, the constitutional concerns about unbundling are to be taken into account.

In contrast to the initial draft, merger control clearance or ministerial authorisation is grandfathered in for ten instead of the previous five years for unbundling measures.

4. Further procedural additions Under section 32f(8) of the draft bill, the Bundeskartellamt must reach an agreement with the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) where it wishes to implement remedies on regulated markets (railways, post and telecommunication as well as the regulated electricity and gas supply networks).

The Bundesnetzagentur must then issue a statement on this.

This is also aimed at ensuring that the Bundeskartellamt’s new powers are implemented in as coordinated a manner as possible.

Given the extent to which it can intervene, the Bundeskartellamt is now obliged to hold a public hearing when imposing remedies under section 32f(3), sentence 6 and (4) of the draft bill in order to grant the right to be heard and comply with the transparency requirement under section 56(7) of the draft bill, unless the parties waive this.

Finally, section 66(1) of the draft bill stipulates – in contrast to the initial draft – that an appeal against an unbundling measure has suspensive effect.

This does not, however, apply to the other measures pursuant to section 32f(3), sentence 6 of the government’s draft bill.

This is also aimed at allying constitutional concerns.

In practice, it will therefore not be possible to use unbundling to implement, in the short or medium term, the legislator’s goal of shaping markets in a particular way.

The legislator nevertheless wanted to retain this as a last resort.

5. Changes relating to the disgorgement of benefits The proposals made in the initial draft regarding the disgorgement of benefits under section 34 have generally been adopted in the new draft bill – with the exception that the latter retains the fault requirement.

The draft bill takes a stricter approach, however, by making it more difficult to rebut the presumption that the lump-sum benefit amounts to at least 1% of the domestic turnover generated through the offence, as it “cannot be argued that no or only minor economic benefit has accrued” .

But it does make it possible to rebut the presumption “if obtaining a benefit is excluded due to the special nature of the violation.”

The explanatory memorandum mentions very specific exceptions where the violation does not result in a benefit, e.g. bid-rigging where none of the participating companies is awarded the contract or a violation of the boycott prohibition that goes no further than a “request” without this request being complied with.

The draft bill has furthermore retained the possibility of rebuttal if the company in question proves that neither the legal entity directly involved in the violation nor the company as a whole achieved a profit in the relevant amount during the period concerned.

Contrary to the proposals of the initial draft, the time limits set in connection with the disgorgement of benefits have not been tightened.

A time limit of seven years (instead of ten) after termination of the violation has therefore been retained.

The maximum disgorgement period remains limited to five years.

III.

Conclusion The new draft bill significantly bolsters the Bundeskartellamt’s powers by adding new intervention mechanisms."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S DRAFT BILL FOR 11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION,"The maximum disgorgement period remains limited to five years.

III.

Conclusion The new draft bill significantly bolsters the Bundeskartellamt’s powers by adding new intervention mechanisms.

The planned market structure control, which will not be based on violations or abuses, de facto provides antitrust law with a fourth pillar alongside the prohibition of cartels, abuse control and (preventive) merger control, even if the draft bill stipulates a very soft form of subsidiary application for section 32f.

This means that the draft bill does nothing to change the basic new approach: The Federal Government regards the intervention powers of the competition authorities to be insufficient in the case of a malfunctioning of competition that lacks a demonstrable infringement and could have causes related to market structure.

In such cases, competition authorities will not only be able to prevent negative structural changes (merger control), but also to actively promote preferable structures.

There continue to be conflicting assessments as to whether the described gap in the law actually exists, and business associations and some academics and legal practitioners strongly doubt that this is the case.

The explanatory memorandum does not contain any new arguments in this regard over and above those in the initial draft.

This discussion is likely to continue during the legislative process.

The planned intervention powers signal a paradigm shift for antitrust law: In future, even internal growth, efficiency and economic success in fair competition could be grounds for intervention.

Therefore, these new mechanisms will have to be carefully scrutinised from a constitutional law perspective on the basis of Article 12 and Article 14 Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) and the fundamental procedural rights.

This will be aided by the amendments made by the draft bill with the procedural changes and clarifications of the principle of proportionality.

In terms of the rule of law, the two-stage nature of the process, in particular, is a step forward for affected companies as compared to the initial draft.

However, the Bundeskartellamt was cautious in its initial reaction to the additional substantiation and procedural hurdles and expressed doubts about the practicability and intended aim of the acceleration of proceedings (cf.

GCR of 6 April 2023 ).

Ultimately, the draft bill generally follows the same approach as the initial draft.

Above all, it essentially maintains the new intervention mechanism of section 32f as the “centrepiece” of the amendment, so there can be no doubt that the Bundeskartellamt’s powers will be considerably increased.

As will the Bundeskartellamt’s responsibility to use this new mechanism responsibly and prudently and not – as some critics fear – for political purposes.

The extension of preventive merger control below the thresholds of section 35 GWB, which is also retained unchanged in the draft bill, is in line with parallel developments at European level.

This is demonstrated by the new stance taken by the European Commission and the General Court ( Illumina/Grail ) on referrals under Article 22 ECMR, also by Member States which did not originally have jurisdiction, as well as the most recent case law of the ECJ ( Towercast ) on the application of Article 102 TFEU to non-notifiable concentrations by national competition authorities.

This significantly reduces legal certainty for corporate acquisitions, especially given the new hurdles created by the expansion of regulatory procedures in connection with investment control (FDI) and the newly introduced control of third-country subsidies at EU level (FSR).

The constitutional standards will also have to be carefully re-examined in the case of the simplified disgorgement of benefits, especially with regard to the blanket presumption that profits are obtained by infringing companies."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S DRAFT BILL FOR 11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION,"There are still no provisions governing how this relates to damages awards or allowing for any privileged treatment of leniency applicants, although amendments would be useful here.

It is helpful, however, that the draft bill retains the fault requirement and the disgorgement of benefits therefore does not lead to (additional) liability, irrespective of fault, in the event of competition law violations.

The 11th Amendment is merely intended to implement the first part of the Ministry’s competition policy agenda from February 2022, which sets out ten points for achieving sustainable competition, fleshing out what was agreed in the coalition agreement (cf.

Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action – 10 points for sustainable competition as a pillar of the socio-ecological market economy of 21 February 2022 ).

Further elements of the ten-point agenda – such as more legal certainty for cooperations between companies aimed at greater sustainability and stronger consumer protection – are to be addressed in a 12th Amendment before the end of this legislative period.

This is apparent from the consultation on the study “Competition and Sustainability in Germany and the EU” conducted on behalf of the Ministry at the end of March 2023, which ended on 6 April 2023 (cf.

Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action – Transformation towards a socio-ecological market economy of 22 March 2023, only available in German )."
Gleiss Lutz,THE UNIFIED PATENT COURT ON “OPT-OUT”: FIRST REASONED DECISION NOW AVAILABLE,"Gleiss Lutz is excited to contribute to shaping the new unified European patent law: On 20 October 2023, the Helsinki Local Division of the Unified Patent Court (“UPC”) issued the reasoning of its much noticed “opt-out”-ruling. 

You can download the decision here .

The court ruled that where a patent has been opted out of the UPC during the “sunrise period”, a later “opt-in” is ineffective, if a national action concerning the patent is pending at the time the opt-out is taking effect (i.e. the start of the UPC-system on 1 June 2023).

With reference to Art. 83(4) UPCA and Rule 5.8 RoP, the ruling convincingly sets out the reasons why a national litigation commenced before, and still pending at, the entry into force of the UPC blocks the withdrawal of the opt-out.

The ruling does not deal with the question whether an opt-out is also irreversible in case of a national litigation already completed before the start of the UPC-system.

However, the considerations in the ruling support the conclusion that also this question would have to be answered in the affirmative.

Thus, to be on the safe side, a patentee who wants to maintain the option to assert a patent in the UPC, which was the subject of national litigation before the start of the UPC-system, should refrain from an opt-out of the litigated patent.

In case the opt-out took place already, any litigation strategy would have to accommodate the potential inadmissibility of a UPC action.

As the UPC dismissed the infringement action and the request for provisional measures for lack of competence, the decision did not have to address the multitude of other legal issues raised in the case, such as “long-arm” jurisdiction of the UPC and availability of a “springboard”-type of injunction against an artificial intelligence system, to name only two.

Gleiss Lutz,RECORDING WORKING TIME – HAS THE FEDERAL LABOUR COURT’S DECISION BROUGHT CLARITY?,"Since the publication of the Federal Labour Court’s press release on its decision (13 September 2022, 1 ABR 22/21) regarding the obligation to record working time, there has been much anticipation ahead of the publication of the grounds for the decision.

Now they are available.

So what do they tell us?

Background: ECJ requirements ( CCOO ) and legislative plans On 14 May 2019, the European Court of Justice handed down a decision (C-55/18, CCOO ) relating to Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time.

It ruled that Member States must require employers to implement an objective, reliable and accessible system enabling the length of time worked daily by each and every worker to be measured.

This decision called for a response from the German legislator.

Aside from a few exceptions, under German law the only obligation to record working time is for time worked beyond regular daily working hours and on Sundays and public holidays (section 16(2)

Working Hours Act ( Arbeitszeitgesetz , “ArbZG”)).

In its coalition agreement, the German government agreed it would review whether “any changes were needed in light of the European Court of Justice’s ruling”, emphasising that “flexible working arrangements (e.g. trust-based working time)” should “continue to be possible” (cf.

Coalition Agreement of 24 November 2021, p. 68).

So far, however, there has been no bill – and on 13 September 2022, the Federal Labour Court moved on its own (see also the upcoming Gleiss Lutz Newsletter Arbeitsrecht, issue 01/2023).

Federal Labour Court’s decision of 13 September 2022 The press release on the decision (PR no.

35/22 of 13 September 2022) makes it clear that employers already have an obligation to record the hours worked by their workers.

The (now confirmed) rationale behind the decision was also already apparent: Employers are obliged under section 3(2), no. 

1 Occupational Health and Safety Act ( Arbeitsschutzgesetz , “ArbSchG”) to introduce a system for recording workers’ hours .

This the Federal Labour Court concludes from its EU law compliant interpretation of the provision.

Other than this clear and unambiguous message, no details of the obligation to record working time have transpired so far.

The following key messages can be taken from the grounds: Employers already have an objective legal duty to track and record the daily working time (beginning and end and therefore the length of working time, including overtime) of their workers.

Simply introducing a system of this kind is not enough – it must actually be used.

The obligation follows from section 3(2), no. 

1 ArbSchG; section 16(2) ArbZG and other provisions of the ArbZG are not open to EU law compliant interpretation.

(So far)

no requirements have been imposed as to the type of system to be used for recording working time.

Neither European law nor any other legislation stipulates that working times need to be recorded electronically.

It may suffice if records are kept manually (in paper form), for example.

As far as the type of system is concerned, much depends on the kind of work done by the workers and the nature of the business (in particular its size).

Employers can still delegate the recording of working time to their workers , but cannot merely provide a system for workers to use “as and when they see fit”.

The system must actually be used.

Though the Federal Labour Court does not directly address this point, trust-based working time (meaning that workers are basically free to choose the timing and duration of their working hours) therefore remains possible, provided that the hours are documented."
Gleiss Lutz,RECORDING WORKING TIME – HAS THE FEDERAL LABOUR COURT’S DECISION BROUGHT CLARITY?,"Works councils have no right to initiate the introduction of an electronic system to record working time, though under section 87(1), no. 7 Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz , “BetrVG”) they do have a right of initiative and co-determination when it comes to how the system is designed .

The guiding principle when choosing and designing the system should be to “improve health and safety at work”, and “considerations of a purely economic nature may not take precedence” over these objectives.

The decision is not entirely clear on whether working time has to be recorded for all workers.

The Federal Labour Court states that the employer’s obligation to record working time extends to “all workers employed in its business within the meaning of section 5(1), sentence 1 BetrVG”.

The Court refers to the right to derogate under Article 17(1) of Directive 2003/88/EC.

In light of the ECJ decision, the obligation to record working time applies “notwithstanding Article 17(1)”.

Consequently, the recording of working time need not extend to workers for whom the national legislator provides for exceptions, e.g. because the specific characteristics of the activity concerned means that their working time is not measured and/or predetermined or can be determined by the persons concerned themselves .

The Directive describes examples of this (managing executives or other persons with autonomous decision-taking powers; family workers and persons officiating at religious ceremonies in churches and religious communities).

However, the Federal Labour Court states in the grounds for the decision that – aside from sections 18 to 21 ArbZG – the legislator has not enacted any special rules “to date” for workers within the meaning of Article 17(1) of Directive 2003/88/EC.

It therefore remains unclear whether working hours of managing executives , for instance, currently fall under the obligation to record working time by virtue of section 3(2), no. 

1 ArbSchG, subject to future statutory provisions.

Strictly speaking, this is not the case.

All of these provisions are subject to further specification by the legislator.

The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs ( Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales , “BMAS”) had announced that it would await the publication of the grounds and then make “proposals for the design of working time recording systems” (BMAS, Recording Working Time – Q&A, 28 September 2022 ( Arbeitszeiterfassung - Fragen und Antworten - Stand 28.

September 2022 ), p. 5).

It is to be hoped that the legislator will act upon the Federal Labour Court’s decision and make regulatory proposals in the near future.

In practice The messages from the grounds for the decision are clear and compelling : Employers already have an obligation to record working time.

They should review their time recording systems in light of the decision and will have to consider how best to meet their obligation, especially for workers working from home.

It is important to note that an electronic system is not mandatory.

The system can be designed to accommodate the specific nature of the business and may make allowances for the kind of work performed by the workers.

The works council must be involved in this process; however, it has no right to initiate the introduction of an electronic system.

It is positive to note that the Federal Labour Court is retaining the rule that employers can delegate the recording of working time to workers.

The question of whether managing executives also come under the obligation to record working time unfortunately remains open; the German legislator should clarify that they do not."
Gleiss Lutz,RECORDING WORKING TIME – HAS THE FEDERAL LABOUR COURT’S DECISION BROUGHT CLARITY?,"The question of whether managing executives also come under the obligation to record working time unfortunately remains open; the German legislator should clarify that they do not.

The Federal Labour Court does not comment on the possible consequences (in terms of fines) of the lack of – or the lack of a proper – system for the recording of working time, arguing simply that it must be possible on the basis of the records for the competent authorities to check compliance with the maximum daily and weekly working time.

The ArbSchG does not (yet) provide for the payment of fines for violations of its section 3(2).

The decision also continues to put the onus on the legislator .

There are several places where this becomes apparent.

That is why some of the things the Federal Labour Court says in its decision apply subject to a change in the law to be expected in the future (such as the works council’s right of co-determination, provided that the legislator imposes precise requirements as to the obligation to record working time).

Legally, action needs to be taken now that the Federal Labour Court has handed down its decision – though there is still much room for manoeuvre.

Given that bill is expected, companies should be aware that if they make changes to their time recording systems in the short term, they run the risk of having to make further changes after the law comes into force.

This is extremely unfortunate, considering the amount of time, effort and cost involved in modifying such systems.

But we may soon see the first reliable indications from the legislator signalling what adjustments employers will need to make."
Gleiss Lutz,THE PLANT OPERATOR – MUNICH REGIONAL COURT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF NOTICE PERIODS IN PLANT LEASE AGREEMENTS,"There has been, and still is, much legal dispute over the matter of whether the EEG surcharge (EEG = E rneuerbare-

E nergien- G esetz (Renewable Energy Sources Act) was payable in the case of leased power plants and, if so, under what conditions.

This issue is currently the subject of a large number of court cases.

The question at the core of the issue is generally whether the party leasing the power plant has validly become its operator.

This depends in particular on the manner in which the economic risks are distributed in the contracts between the power plant owner and the lessee.

In an as yet unpublished decision handed down on 15 June 2022 (case 15 O 1271/20), Munich Regional Court adjusted the criteria for the definition of “plant operator”.

One key point of contention in this and other proceedings is the question of whether a short notice period for the lease stands in the way of the lessee being deemed the plant operator.

Unlike other courts, Munich Regional Court is of the opinion that the notice period in lease agreements has no relevance when it comes to the question whether a lessee qualifies as the plant operator or not.

The good news first: The Munich Regional Court ruling and its clearly worded grounds support the existing plant lease models.

The lease notice periods are basically irrelevant when it comes to the distribution of the economic risks of the operation of the plant – what matters is, rather, that it is the lessee that bears the economic risks of operating the plant during the term of the lease.

The bad news is that Munich Regional Court’s ruling shows once again that although the EEG surcharge has been abolished, transmission system operators are actively putting power plant leases to the legal test, which means that companies are finding themselves facing claims for very significant back payments of EEG surcharges.

Because Munich Regional Court’s ruling may well go through the entire appeal process, i.e. via Munich Higher Regional Court to the Federal Court of Justice, the risks associated with plant leases remain.

Background Power plant leasing has become common practice throughout Germany over recent years, and the rationale behind this is often twofold:

First, the law explicitly states that the plant operator does not have to be the owner of the plant; there is no question, therefore, that the leasing of power plants is possible and that the plant can be operated by a lessee.

Second, the (in the meantime abolished)

EEG surcharge was not payable on electricity that the plant operator supplied to itself.

In the past, energy-intensive companies increasingly went down the road of leasing large and small power plants and using the produced electricity for themselves.

In the context of power plant leases, transmission system operators, who have the right and the obligation to collect the EEG surcharge, are now increasingly seeking clarification of the legal question of whether the plant lessee and electricity consumer has actually also become the plant operator.

The lawsuits filed by the transmission system operators not only concern so-called capacity lease (“slice lease”, Scheibenpacht ) scenarios, which are a special kind of plant lease, but also leases in which the entire power plant is to be operated by one lessee.

These lawsuits generally involve the transmission system operators suing the plant owner for payment of the EEG surcharge for electricity (allegedly) “delivered” to the plant lessee.

In its defence, the plant owner then argues, among other things, that the power plant was leased out and the lessee acted as the plant operator; as the plant operator, the lessee generated and consumed its own electricity.

Plant operator must bear the economic operational risks In a lease scenario the courts make an overall assessment, involving a number of different criteria, to determine whether the lessee is the operator."
Gleiss Lutz,THE PLANT OPERATOR – MUNICH REGIONAL COURT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF NOTICE PERIODS IN PLANT LEASE AGREEMENTS,"Under established case law, the plant operator has to bear the economic risk of operating the plant and has the right to use the plant for its own account and with its own economic opportunities (first criterion).

Further criteria factored into an assessment of the status of plant operator are the possibility to influence the operating procedures at the plant (second criterion) and the actual right of disposal over the plant (third criterion).

Especially with regard to the first criterion, i.e. the distribution of the economic risk of operating the plant, the courts have to look into the details of the contractual relationship between the lessor and the lessee.

This is complex in the individual case because there is frequently not just one single contract, but a whole set of them (e.g. a lease contract together with a fuel procurement contract, a management contract and a service exchange contract).

Considerable uncertainty has arisen in recent months as a result of Duisburg Regional Court having ruled that economic risks did not pass over because the contract provided for a right of (regular) termination of the lease; in another case, Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (case I-27 U 12/20, 27 U 12/20) pointed out that even the possibility to terminate without notice in the event of a plant failure can minimise the plant lessee’s economic risk and thus the lessee cannot be qualified as an operator.

This comes as something of a surprise given that termination rights in leases are not only customary in the market, but are even provided for by law; they can therefore hardly be used as an argument against operator status.

The increasingly strict (lower court) case law on the transfer of plant operator status has led to considerable legal uncertainty around power plant leases.

Munich Regional Court is now – loudly and clearly – pushing back.

Its decision was based on a lease that was terminable on either one or four months’ notice, depending on the circumstances.

In its grounds for the decision – which has not been published yet – the court made it clear that the option to terminate the contract has no influence on categorisation as plant operator.

The termination of a contract has no effect, it argues, on the bearing of the economic risk during the term of the contract.

Gleiss Lutz commentary Determining the plant operator in multi-person relationships will continue to occupy the courts – if only because the decision handed down by Munich Regional Court will presumably go through all the stages of appeal (Munich Higher Regional Court and possibly the Federal Court of Justice).

The transmission system operators are also examining other scenarios and, although the EEG surcharge has been abolished, are continuing to sue for payment of surcharges that – in their opinion – should have been paid in the past.

With recent months having seen the prerequisites for the valid transfer of operator status tighten considerably, the Munich Regional Court ruling can be seen as a positive sign for affected companies who trusted in the permissibility of plant leases.

The transmission network operators – and some courts – called de facto for lessees to be required to also shoulder fundamental risks attaching to the plant, therefore making them the “beneficial owner” of the plant.

In view of the clear wording of section 3, no. 2 EEG, which can also be applied to fossil-fuelled power plants, the only criterion is who actually “uses” the plant; assumption of fundamental risks is not a prerequisite for the operation of the plant in this sense.

Munich Regional Court’s ruling is to be welcomed insofar as it makes it clear in terms of operator status that, above all, it is the bearing of risk during the operation of the plant that is the key factor."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DEALING WITH PERSONAL DATA IN CROSS-BORDER COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"Companies already face a large number of legal challenges when processing personal data as part of compliance investigations within a single country.

The legal requirements are especially strict if the case has cross-border aspects.

This article points out the main risks and looks at possible ways of dealing with these.

Background If a company suspects that laws have been or are being violated, its management must conduct an internal investigation and is essentially free to choose how this is to be done.

This “how” includes, in particular, the measures used by management to obtain the information it needs to investigate the suspicion and deal with the violation.

In practice, this often includes conducting interviews and reviewing documents and records as well as e-mail and other electronic communication.

Data protection law, however, curbs a company’s free reign in this regard as it only permits the processing of personal data under certain conditions.

And if the investigation requires cross-border data access, the company must negotiate a particularly complex network of legal requirements (including data protection regulations).

Violations of data protection provisions can result in significant fines (up to EUR 20 million or 4% of the consolidated annual turnover) and claims for damages by the data subjects.

In addition, data collected illegally may be inadmissible in a court case.

If the violation becomes public, the company could suffer damage to its reputation, and in some areas data protection violations can even prevent the company from being awarded public contracts.

General data protection requirements for compliance investigations Since 25 May 2018, the primary source of data protection law has been Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation – “ GDPR ”).

This stipulates first and foremost that data processing must be lawful.

It also lays down a number of organisational requirements.

Lawfulness of data processing as part of investigation A – German – company may only process personal data for the purpose of an internal investigation if there is a legitimate interest in doing so that is not overridden by the conflicting confidentiality interests of the data subjects.

If the investigation involves looking into a violation by a specific person, in particular an employee, there must also be a documented reason to believe that the employee has committed the violation in question (Article 6(1), letters (b), (f) GDPR; section 26 Federal Data Protection Act).

Furthermore, the company must observe the processing principles, in particular the principle of data minimisation (Article 5 GDPR).

The company is generally deemed to have a legitimate interest if it has to safeguard its corporate interests by carrying out a comprehensive investigation into the alleged violation.

For it is only when all the relevant facts are known that the company can make rational decisions on how to avoid or limit fines, defend against claims for damages or assert them itself, comply with regulatory (reporting) obligations, stop the violation or prevent similar violations, and communicate with the public.

Companies must ensure that the confidentiality interests of the data subjects are taken into account by structuring the investigation in a way that complies with data protection requirements.

This also applies to passing on personal data within a corporate group and to third parties such as legal, PR or forensic advisors.

It is only in the case of processors – service providers for specific technical processing operations such as data hosting, in particular – that a separate legal basis for data transfer is not required (the data processing contract is instead used as a basis, Article 28 GDPR).

A legally binding order issued by a European authority usually constitutes a legal basis for the disclosure of personal data (Article 6(1), letter (f) GDPR)."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DEALING WITH PERSONAL DATA IN CROSS-BORDER COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"A legally binding order issued by a European authority usually constitutes a legal basis for the disclosure of personal data (Article 6(1), letter (f) GDPR).

In contrast, non-binding requests for cooperation and disclosure should be scrutinised with particular care.

However, if it is common practice that such requests are promptly followed by binding requests, or if a lack of “willing cooperation” is punished by increased fines (or similar disadvantages), disclosure is often lawful on the basis of legitimate interests (Article 6(1), letter (f) GDPR).

As a rule, consent is not a suitable legal basis.

Firstly, it can be withdrawn at any time (Article 7 GDPR).

Although the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing before such consent was withdrawn, it does initially remove the legal basis for any future (further) processing.

German data protection supervisory authorities take a critical view of the practice of “stacking” legal bases, especially having recourse to a legal basis after consent is withdrawn.

Secondly, supervisory authorities question whether consent given by an employee in the context of a compliance investigation can be considered freely given.

They argue that employees are under considerable pressure in such situations, which means that their consent is frequently involuntary and therefore has no legal effect.

Organisational requirements In addition, the company must comply with organisational requirements: If, as described, data are passed on to other group companies or third parties, the companies involved may have to conclude specific data processing contracts (Articles 26, 28 GDPR).

The data subjects must be informed about the data processing unless, exceptionally, the duty to provide information does not apply, e.g. on account of special confidentiality obligations or requirements.

Right from the outset, the company must put measures in place to ensure that the data processed during the internal investigation can be securely stored and, if necessary, deleted.

This also includes stipulating time limits for the storage and erasure of data or specific criteria that determine the life span of the data.

A data protection impact assessment (Article 35 GDPR) may be required, especially if the company uses innovative technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence) to process particularly large amounts of data efficiently.

Data protection requirements for cross-border compliance investigations In a cross-border investigation, the above requirements in terms of legal basis and organisational structure become more complicated.

Companies also have to navigate a range of restrictions on the transfer of data.

Leeway in national regulations on employee data protection The protection of employees’ personal data continues to be regulated by national law despite extensive harmonisation of data protection provisions via the GDPR.

This means that the processing of employee data in different countries must be assessed using different standards, even within the EU.

Companies usually find it extremely challenging to set up processes in the context of a cross-border investigation that comply with national law in all the (Member) states concerned.

The problem is exacerbated when the investigation also involves countries outside the EU that have adopted their own data protection laws.

This now includes not only all the BRIC countries, but also countries such as Australia, Nigeria, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Switzerland.

It is in many cases not possible to choose the – particularly strict – data protection law of one country as the “gold standard” and then assume that the requirements in other countries will also be met.

This is because international data protection regimes cannot easily be classified on a linear scale from lenient to strict, as they emphasise different aspects."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DEALING WITH PERSONAL DATA IN CROSS-BORDER COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"This is because international data protection regimes cannot easily be classified on a linear scale from lenient to strict, as they emphasise different aspects.

As the example of consent shows, the panacea of one legal system is precisely not the remedy of choice in another.

Group-wide policies Group-wide policies or works agreements are also factored into the assessment under data protection law via the principle of weighing of interests.

This becomes relevant in particular when a European parent company imposes policies which make the requirements of the GDPR binding for all group companies.

In such cases, companies may no longer take advantage of more generous local processing powers without risk.

It is usually difficult to explain to the authorities in the respective country why the company is processing less data to investigate a violation than it is legally entitled to just because it has to comply with an internal policy that is based on the requirements of what is, from the authority’s point of view, foreign law.

Restrictions on outbound transfer European law imposes special restrictions on the transfer of personal data to third countries outside the EU and EEA, in order to ensure that personal data in the third country remain adequately protected.

This is deemed to be the case if the level of data protection in the third country has been officially recognised as adequate by the EU Commission (Article 45 GDPR) – however, such adequacy decisions have only been issued for a small number of countries (including the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Argentina and Japan, but not the U.S., India, Russia, China, Brazil, Turkey or Australia).

In the absence of an adequacy decision for the respective country, additional safeguards must be provided, e.g. by concluding a data protection agreement based on the EU standard contractual clauses (Article 46 GDPR).

Authorities in third countries will not usually be willing to enter into standard contractual clauses with a European company, however.

The company concerned must therefore check whether a data transfer is permissible based on one of the exceptions laid down in Article 49 GDPR, in particular for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Article 49(1), letter (e) GDPR).

This exception is specifically aimed at the use of personal data in judicial proceedings (e.g. in a subpoena), but may also justify other types of disclosures (e.g. in the context of monitorships or antitrust proceedings).

So that they can demonstrate their efforts to comply with the GDPR, companies should generally only transfer personal data to authorities or courts to the extent that is absolutely necessary.

This includes redacting irrelevant personal data (e.g. relating to persons not involved in the matter), if this is accepted by the authority or court concerned.

Restrictions on inbound transfer The collection of personal data in third countries and the transfer of such data to the EU may also be subject to stringent legal restrictions.

States such as Russia, China and Brazil have laid down strict requirements for the transfer of data abroad.

In some cases, it is mandatory for at least a copy of the data to be kept in the country concerned.

Another aspect to be considered when disclosing personal data with a link to third countries is how this will affect the common law institution of legal privilege.

The release of information may result in a loss of this “privilege” in the U.S. or UK, along with the associated protection against such information being handed over.

Possible steps Companies should therefore start thinking about the challenges posed by a (cross-border) compliance investigation even if this seems merely a hypothetical problem."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DEALING WITH PERSONAL DATA IN CROSS-BORDER COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"Possible steps Companies should therefore start thinking about the challenges posed by a (cross-border) compliance investigation even if this seems merely a hypothetical problem.

Steps to be taken include, in particular: drafting intra-group data protection agreements in such a way that exchanging information in compliance investigations is covered; developing processes and organisational structures relevant for compliance investigations taking into account data protection requirements (e.g. data minimisation, data localisation); acquiring and implementing IT systems that can meet both the practical requirements of a cross-border compliance investigation (e.g. cross-border legal hold) and data protection requirements (e.g. segmentation, data minimisation through electronic filtering); and drafting group policies, data protection agreements and works agreements in such a way that different national regulations can be taken into account.

If a compliance investigation is imminent, it is all the more important to consider the data protection requirements when planning and implementing the project.

This is especially relevant when it comes to: the composition of the project team and the structuring of the cooperation between entities in different locations or at different corporate levels; a possible upcoming exchange of data with authorities, where consideration should be given to the handling of binding and non-binding requests for information right from the outset.

If the company is to cooperate (voluntarily) with an authority (e.g. in the context of a leniency application or monitorship), it is also advisable, at an early stage, to manage expectations with regard to possible delays caused by data minimisation measures; the documentation of the internal investigation, which on the one hand should be as detailed as possible in order to be able to prove compliance with legal requirements to the data protection supervisory authority, and on the other must be carried out with due awareness of data subjects’ possible rights of inspection and access as well as the possibility of access by authorities; the fulfilment of duties to provide information and to ensure transparency, taking into account secrecy obligations and requirements; the involvement of employees holding the relevant positions in the company and group, e.g. compliance officer, data protection officer, human rights officer under the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains, etc.; and the preparation of a budget and resource plan, in particular with regard to a review that may be layered for forensic and/or data protection reasons, relevant advisors and (local) counsel.

Outlook

The legal challenges posed by the transfer of personal data in the context of internal investigations will become even more complex in the future as more and more countries – following the example of the GDPR – enshrine specific requirements for the lawful “export” of data across national borders in their laws.

Efforts by the EU, the UK and a number of other countries to create a safe space for the free exchange of data via mutual recognition of “adequate” levels of data protection are a step in the right direction, but are not progressing fast enough to raise high hopes.

Moreover, such decisions on adequate levels of protection are regularly challenged in court and – as the European Court of Justice’s Schrems II ruling in summer 2020 showed – can suddenly be invalidated.

Meanwhile, more and more regulations – from the GDPR to the Whistleblower Directive and the German Money Laundering Act to the Supply Chains Act – are creating new requirements to be met by group-wide risk management systems.

Parent companies of international groups are therefore less and less able to leave compliance tasks to their local subsidiaries alone."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DEALING WITH PERSONAL DATA IN CROSS-BORDER COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"Parent companies of international groups are therefore less and less able to leave compliance tasks to their local subsidiaries alone.

Cross-border compliance investigations will thus become increasingly the rule, and companies should take steps to ensure that they are as well prepared as possible – also when it comes to data protection."
Gleiss Lutz,MORE RED TAPE TO BE EXPECTED SHORTLY: EU REGULATION ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIES,"In May 2021, the EU Commission presented its “Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market”. 

The proposal is supposed to close a “regulatory gap” resulting from the fact that the EU State Aid rules strictly limit the ability of EU Member States to subsidize companies active in the EU without the Commission’s approval, whereas no similar limitation and control mechanism exists for subsidies granted by third countries.

The proposed regulation is currently being discussed in the European Parliament.

Its enactment is among the EU institutions’ top legislative priorities for 2022.

If the regulation is adopted without significant changes to the current proposal, it will have a major impact on M&A transactions and significantly increase the costs and the administrative burden for many domestic and foreign companies doing business in the EU internal market.

New ex officio investigative tool The proposal will allow the Commission to investigate potential distortions of competition arising from “foreign subsidies” of non-EU-countries for undertakings active in the internal market, and to adopt “redressive measures” in order to remedy such distortions of competition.

To this end, the Commission will be entitled to investigate on its own initiative the existence of foreign subsidies, including any foreign subsidies granted in the last 10 years prior to the start of the application of the proposed regulation to the extent they continue to have distortive effects after the start of the application of the proposed regulation.

New notification obligations The proposal also introduces new notification obligations based on certain turnover and value thresholds, namely: An obligation to notify certain M&A-transactions (“ concentrations ”), i.e. acquisitions of control of EU-based targets or mergers and joint ventures involving an undertaking based in the EU, where (a) the EU-based undertaking has an aggregate EU-turnover of at least EUR 500 million , and (b) all undertakings involved received aggregate “financial contributions” from third countries exceeding EUR 50 million in the last three years prior to the notification; An obligation of undertakings participating in public procurement procedures (“PPP”) with an estimated value of at least EUR 250 million to notify all (!)

“foreign financial contributions” received in the last three years prior to notification or declare that no such financial contribution was received during this period of time.

In addition, the Commission is entitled to request the ad hoc -notification of concentrations or PPP participations even if they do not meet these thresholds.

The notification obligations are accompanied by standstill obligations : notifiable M&A-transactions cannot be closed, and public tenders cannot be awarded to bidders that had to notify foreign financial contributions, before the Commission has concluded its foreign subsidies review. 

A failure to notify or to respect the standstill obligations can be sanctioned with substantial fines (i.e. up to 10% of aggregate global turnover of the undertakings concerned).

The “financial contributions provided by third countries” that determine the notification obligations are defined extremely broadly and include many types of transactions and measures that ultimately may not be “subsidies” at all: Relevant financial contributions include the transfer of funds or liabilities, such as capital injections, grants, loans, loan guarantees, fiscal incentives, setting off of operating losses, compensation for financial burdens imposed by public authorities, debt forgiveness, debt to equity swaps or rescheduling, but also any foregoing of revenue that is otherwise due and even the mere provision or purchase of goods or services, regardless of whether these transactions are conducted at market terms or not."
Gleiss Lutz,MORE RED TAPE TO BE EXPECTED SHORTLY: EU REGULATION ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIES,"Relevant “third country” originators of “foreign financial contributions” are not only foreign government authorities, but also all public and even private entities whose actions can be attributed to the third country.

Importantly, all such “financial contributions” from all third countries granted in the last three years prior to notification have to be taken into account, regardless of whether they are directly or even indirectly linked to the transaction/PPP participation at issue.

The relevant “financial contributions” are not confined to contributions received by the legal entities directly participating in an M&A-project or PPP.

Rather, all financial contributions received by any member of the corporate group of the participating entity have to be added together for the purpose of assessing whether the notification thresholds are met. 

Given the broad scope of the notion of “financial contribution”, the identification of all such relevant contributions alone will be very difficult and burdensome for the undertakings concerned.

Should the notification requirements and the definition of the relevant “financial contributions” remain unchanged during the legislative process, it is likely that a very large number of transactions of internationally active companies will have to be notified and reviewed under the new regulation.

It remains to be seen whether and how the Commission will be able to cope with this additional workload.

The notification and review procedures are independent from potential other reviews, e.g. under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR), with the result that companies may have to prepare and file parallel notifications and cope with parallel proceedings under different legal instruments with different timelines and standstill obligations.

The review of notifiable concentrations is closely modelled after merger control procedure under the EUMR: a preliminary investigation (“phase I”) lasting 25 working days , potentially followed by an in-depth investigation (“phase II”) of additional 90 working days (with possible extensions upon request and in case of a submission of commitment proposals).

The review of notifiable PPP participations is subject to different timelines: the preliminary investigation can last up to 60 days , and the in-depth investigation can last up to 200 days from the receipt of the notification.

Substantive test In substantive terms, the proposal entitles the Commission to examine whether foreign financial contributions constitute “ foreign subsidies ” that “ distort the internal market ”, and to ensure that such distortions are remedied by commitments of the undertakings concerned, or by “redressive measures” imposed by the Commission.

The Commission may also prohibit notifiable transactions or tender awards to subsidized undertakings if no appropriate commitments are offered by the undertakings concerned.

Foreign subsidies shall be deemed to exist where a financial contribution of a third country (i) confers a “ benefit ” to an undertaking engaging in an economic activity in the internal market; and (ii) is “ selective ”, i.e. limited to one or more specific undertakings or industries. 

These notions are very similar to the well-established concepts of “advantage” and “selectivity” under EU State Aid law and will likely be interpreted in line with the case law and Commission practice on the corresponding EU State Aid law concepts.  

Broadly speaking, this means that a “foreign subsidy” will be deemed to exist if an undertaking/industry obtains a financial contribution from foreign state resources (or resources/entities attributable to the foreign state) at terms that the undertaking could not have obtained from private actors on the market, and if that financial contribution is not made available to all other undertakings/industries in a similar situation."
Gleiss Lutz,MORE RED TAPE TO BE EXPECTED SHORTLY: EU REGULATION ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIES,"If a foreign contribution constitutes a foreign subsidy, the Commission will further assess whether this subsidy “ distorts the internal market ”, i.e. whether it is liable to improve the competitive position of the undertaking concerned in the internal market and thus actually or potentially negatively affects competition on the internal market. 

The proposal contains a non-exhaustive list of indicators factoring into this assessment, such as the amount and nature of the subsidy, the economic and competitive situation of the undertaking and the markets concerned, the purpose and conditions attached to the foreign subsidy, as well as its use on the internal market.

The proposal also specifies certain categories of foreign subsidies that will “most likely” be deemed to distort the internal market, i.e. Foreign subsidies granted to an ailing undertaking in absence of a viable restructuring plan; Unlimited guarantees for debts/liabilities of beneficiary undertakings; Subsidies directly facilitating a concentration or the submission of an “unduly advantageous tender” that would enable the undertaking concerned to win a public contract.

On the other hand, the proposal states that “de minimis”-subsidies with a total amount of less than EUR 5 million over a period of three years are deemed “unlikely” to distort the internal market.

If the Commission finds that a foreign subsidy distorts the internal market, the Commission will further assess whether the distortive effects may be counterbalanced or possibly even outweighed by positive effects “on the development of the relevant economic activity”. 

The outcome of this “ balancing test ” is supposed to determine the need for commitments or redressive measures and their respective scope and content.

Regrettably, the proposal does not contain any guidance as to how the “balancing test” shall actually be applied in practice. 

The Commission seems to be left with almost unlimited discretion in weighing the negative and positive effects of the foreign subsidy and in deciding on the redressive measures or commitments it deems appropriate. 

It is likely that the Commission will use the “balancing test” and its power to request commitments or impose redressive measures in order to shape foreign subsidies, their use in the internal market and/or the activities of the beneficiaries in a way that would ensure the equal treatment of recipients of foreign subsidies on the one hand, and recipients of State Aid granted by EU Member States on the other hand. 

However, this is not guaranteed, and there remains a significant risk that foreign subsidies and their recipients may be held to stricter standards than the ones applicable under EU State Aid law.

Red tape and legal uncertainty There is no question that the new regulation will lead to significantly more red tape for any company doing business or willing to invest in the EU.

The notification procedure for planned acquisitions and PPP participations will be costly and time-consuming .

The new system is to run in parallel to the merger control systems at EU and national level, as well as the national rules of foreign trade law and investment control which will also continue to apply.

The standstill obligations, as well as the potential risks and uncertainties resulting from the new foreign subsidies control proceedings will also have to be addressed and catered for in M&A deal documentations.

From the perspective of a foreign investor, all these parallel regimes with different requirements and objectives create a complicated maze for investment projects in the EU that will be increasingly difficult – if not impossible – to navigate without highly specialized legal advice of practitioners experienced not only in M&A-deals and merger control, but also in EU State Aid law and national FDI regimes."
Gleiss Lutz,MORE RED TAPE TO BE EXPECTED SHORTLY: EU REGULATION ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIES,"The Commission has announced that it will be issuing detailed guidelines on the application of the new law once the proposed regulation has been adopted.

Until such guidance will enter into force and will consequently bind the Commission when exercising its discretion, undertakings active in the EU and benefitting from foreign subsidies (or undertakings acquiring EU-based recipients of such subsidies) will be exposed to significant legal uncertainty when investing and/or competing in the EU.

On the other hand, the practical relevance of the new proposal will largely depend on the reaction of foreign countries.

Art. 40 (7) of the proposal explicitly stipulates that international agreements concluded by the EU take precedent over the proposed new regulation.

The very far-reaching and ambiguous content of the proposal may therefore be a bargaining chip and a strategic attempt of the EU to demonstrate to third countries that there is a need for bilateral or multilateral trade agreements with clear rules for a fair and predictable investment regime and for legal certainty for foreign investments.

It remains to be seen whether this strategy will succeed."
Gleiss Lutz,REGULATION OF METAVERSE PLATFORMS UNDER MEDIA LAW,"Metaverse platforms open up new opportunities for three-dimensional virtual interaction with attractive applications for users and major economic potential for companies – but also create rights and obligations.

This article explores the regulatory issues under media law associated with these platforms.

A metaverse platform is a virtual, three-dimensional environment accessible via the internet.

Users can engage in economic, social and cultural activities, such as “attending” concerts or other events and playing online games, using avatars.

Businesses can acquire virtual properties and contact other users (both businesses and consumers) in a variety of ways.

This creates the basis for an extensive exchange of virtual goods and services (including legal services; see here ).

However, the metaverse is not a uniform entity, but a blanket term applied to a range of virtual experiences.

There are various platforms providers within it, some of which are owned by a single legal entity, and others run by decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).

The rapid changes in EU law (see 1. below) bear watching and recent decisions of courts and public authorities on the failure of ISPs and social network providers to comply with German regulatory law (see

2. below) throw light on the current regulatory framework – and what may change in the future.

1.

Regulation under EU law a) EU Digital Services Act The Digital Services Act (DSA) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 October 2022 (see here ) and introduces a comprehensive legal framework for providers of intermediary services, with particular emphasis on “very large online platforms”.

It aims to establish uniform due diligence and transparency obligations and requires procedures to be laid down for reporting and removing illegal content.

The DSA also largely preserves the liability principles laid down in the e-Commerce Directive of 2000.

The DSA does not specifically mention either metaverse platforms or virtual reality.

The European Commission also made it clear at the end of 2021 that it wanted to refrain for the time being from creating any regulations for the metaverse launched by Meta.

According to the European Parliamentary Research Service, this leaves the question open as to whether EU rules on content moderation – which are currently being amended – would also apply to illegal or harmful content in the metaverse.

This cannot be ruled out, however.

The DSA may in future apply to a large number of providers operating in the metaverse, especially since it contains general rules for accessing and storing content on platforms.

In purely practical terms, however, the large number of companies operating in the metaverse and the complex links between them can make it hard to identify the company responsible for the content.

Violations of the DSA may lead to substantial fines of up to a maximum of 6 % of total worldwide annual turnover, exceeding even the maximum penalties under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The final version of the DSA has also introduced a new right to compensation for damage or loss suffered by users due to a provider having violated its obligations under the DSA.

b) Draft EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (AI)

On 21 April 2021, the EU Commission published a proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (see here ).The proposal provides for bans on certain AI practices and sets out specific requirements and obligations related to high-risk AI systems, as well as harmonised transparency rules for AI systems in general."
Gleiss Lutz,REGULATION OF METAVERSE PLATFORMS UNDER MEDIA LAW,"According to the definition in Article 3, point 1 of the draft Regulation, an “artificial intelligence system” is software that is developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I to the draft Regulation and can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing the environments they interact with.

Although the draft Regulation does not include any explicit provisions on metaverse services, it is likely that artificial intelligence will be used for certain applications in the metaverse, and the provisions of the Regulation – once adopted – will apply in this respect.

The transparency obligations set out in the draft could be especially important for providers or users of such AI systems.

Data subjects must, for example, generally be informed about the use of an AI system or biometric categorisation.

The draft also lays down an obligation to disclose “deep fakes ” , i.e. AI-generated or manipulated content that appreciably resembles existing persons, objects, places or other entities or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic or truthful.

c) Cybersecurity and data protection in the metaverse The general cybersecurity and data protection risks on the internet obviously also apply (and perhaps even more so to the metaverse, see our articles “ Commission’s proposal for the Data Act ”, 9 March 2022 and “ New rules for online businesses – Digital Services Act ”, 27 October 2022.

2. Regulation under German law: Current examples a) Telecommunications law Current developments in German regulatory law for internet services and social networks, which are also relevant for metaverse platforms, have relatively little to do with the Telecommunications Act ( Telekommunikationsgesetz , “TKG”), which was fundamentally revised in December 2021.

The Act applies the principle of lex loci solutionis – it is not where the company offering the service is based that matters, but whether the activities governed by telecommunications law are carried out within the “ area of application of this Act ”.

The definition of telecommunications services in section 3, no. 

61 TKG also covers not only conventional telephone services (internet telephony and VoIP) – as before – but also e-mail, messenger and group chat services ( see also our article on the Telecommunications Modernisation Act ( Telekommunikationsmodernisierungsgesetz ) , 14 May 2021).

In the metaverse, which is not itself a telecommunications service, some of the services offered may however be classified as interpersonal communication services.

But even then, the question is whether such applications merely have a secondary function that is inextricably linked with other services, and therefore do not fall under the TKG. b) Telemedia Act and Network Enforcement Act Under section 1(1), sentence 1 Telemedia Act ( Telemediengesetz , “TMG”), both the operation of a metaverse platform and – depending on the specific form – commercial offers by companies to market their products and services in the metaverse are classified as telemedia.

While there are no authorisation and notification obligations for telemedia, they must include a legal notice if offered commercially (generally in return for a fee) (section 5 TMG).

In addition, section 6 TMG stipulates that service providers must fulfil certain obligations in the case of commercial communications – these and the person in whose name the communication is made must be easily identifiable.

As hosting providers, metaverse platform operators will not be responsible for content from third parties in accordance with section 10 TMG (and in future, under the DSA; see 1.a) above)."

Telemedia service providers operating platforms on the internet with the intention of making a profit and whose platforms allow users to share content with other users or make it accessible to the public (social networks) and are not platforms with independent editorial content (see regarding the latter the Commission’s controversial proposal for a European Media Freedom Act – see here ), will also have to comply with the requirements of the Network Enforcement Act ( Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz , “NetzDG”).

Non-compliance with these requirements can result in substantial fines – as the Federal Office of Justice ( Bundesamt für Justiz ) made clear when it imposed fines totalling EUR 5.125 million on Telegram FZ-LLC in mid-October ( see here ).

The fine notice can still be contested, however.

The NetzDG obliges companies falling under its scope of application to provide reporting channels on their platforms so that users can report criminal content to the social network provider and have it reviewed.

In addition, social network providers must name a person who is authorised to receive service and has an address for summons in the Federal Republic of Germany.

The obvious reason for this is so that courts and authorities can serve documents with legally binding effect in Germany.

According to the Federal Office of Justice, Telegram violated both these obligations.

However, due to the considerable overlap with the DSA, the NetzDG will have to be fundamentally revised.

c) Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors from Harmful Media Providers of applications and services in the metaverse may also have to comply with the Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors from Harmful Media ( Jugendmedienschutzstaatsvertrag , “JMStV”).

Recent expedited decisions handed down by North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court in Münster have attracted a great deal of attention in this context.

Although it is true that the country of origin principle applies according to telemedia law, with section 3(1) TMG stipulating that internet providers established in an EU Member State will generally only be subject to the laws of that Member State, this does not apply without restriction.

Accordingly, the dissemination of telemedia is subject to the restrictions of German law to the extent that this serves to protect certain objectives – such as public safety and order, public health or the interests of consumers and investors – and the measure is proportionate to the objectives being protected.

These objectives very explicitly also include the protection of minors.

In this context, North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court ruled on 7 September 2022 (decisions 13 B 1911/21, 13 B 1912/21 and 13 B 1913/21) that providers of pornographic websites based in Cyprus cannot invoke the country of origin principle against an injunction issued on the grounds that they had not sufficiently prevented children and adolescents from accessing their websites.

The national authority had fulfilled the consultation requirements under European law vis-à-vis the providers’ country of origin before taking the measures.

According to the rulings, the level of protection afforded to minors in the providers’ country of origin is also irrelevant.

Given the importance of protecting minors, the other Member State concerned has discretionary powers when it comes to guaranteeing the level of protection.

Conclusion Regulation of the metaverse – as a relatively new phenomenon – through legislation and case law is likely to move quickly in future.

As a guiding principle, it is safe to say that those regulations that apply to two-dimensional social media platforms also apply to the metaverse itself and the services offered therein."
Gleiss Lutz,INCREASED LIABILITY RISKS FOR QUASI-PRODUCERS,"Based on a recent ruling by the ECJ, trademark owners, especially those in white label, private label and store brand business, are potentially facing higher liability risks in future.

This will be the case when a product bearing the trademark is defective and results in damage to property or personal injury.

The ECJ has lately rejected the protection mechanisms previously used by quasi-producers to avoid liability, creating a need for legal action by many companies.

Product liability in white label/store brand business White label, private label and store brand business is widespread.

In this form of business, branded goods manufacturers have products manufactured by external suppliers and then affix their own established and well-known trademarks to them and sell the products under them.

The information indicating that the goods were made by an external producer is usually displayed far less prominently and conspicuously than the branded goods manufacturer’s trademark.

At least in the case of consumer products, but also in the case of certain products in regulated sectors (e.g. products subject to the Machinery Directive), the relevant product safety provisions require that the party that manufactured the product and assumes manufacturer responsibility vis-à-vis the product safety authorities must be identified. 

In practice, the trademark of the branded goods manufacturer often features prominently on the product in large format, while the producer information is printed far less prominently, whether with the producer being named as producer or simply by the words “produced for” followed by the name of the trademark owner.

Contact details are occasionally provided, but without further comment.

Pursuant to German product liability law, any person who by putting his trademark on a product presents himself as its producer (“quasi-producers”, section 4(1), sentence 2 Product Liability Act ( Gesetz über die Haftung für fehlerhafte Produkte , “ProdHaftG”) is also liable for product defects within the meaning of the ProdHaftG. In the event of property damage or personal injury due to product defects (section 3 ProdHaftG), the trademark owner is then liable in addition to the actual producer.

This can be problematic if it is easier for injured parties to make a claim against the trademark owner rather than against the actual producer, for example because the latter is located abroad, which is frequently the case – and often outside Europe – , or because the trademark owner is more solvent than the producer.

This liability risk has led to various avoidance strategies in practice.

What they all have in common is the attempt, by identifying the actual producer, to counteract the legal impression given by the use of the trademark, namely that the trademark owner is also the producer.

The thinking behind this is that quasi-producers are not liable if the name of the actual producer is explicitly indicated.

In practice, therefore, it is common to find the two identifiers, namely the actual manufacturer and the trademark owner, often linked by the words “produced for”, as mentioned above.

In those few instances where, for reasons of marketing or product design, it is not considered opportune to clearly identify the actual producer on the product itself, it is named only in accompanying documents such as operating instructions, package inserts, declarations of conformity or the like.

The ECJ’s decision: avoidance strategies no longer possible – trademark owner liable as quasi-producer These everyday practices will now no longer work due to the ECJ’s ruling of 7 July 2022 – C-264/21 – Koninklijke Philips NV .

The ECJ’s decision is relevant to the interpretation of the ProdHaftG because the Act implements Product Liability Directive 85/374/EEC and the statutory definition of quasi-producer in section 4(1), sentence 2 ProdHaftG is taken verbatim from Article 3(1) Product Liability Directive."
Gleiss Lutz,INCREASED LIABILITY RISKS FOR QUASI-PRODUCERS,"The case before the ECJ concerned a coffee machine bearing two very well-known trademarks, one the name of a Dutch company, the other the name of a coffee machine company.

The machine was manufactured in Romania by a subsidiary of the company that owned both brands.

In addition to the trademark of the well-known company for coffee machines, the machine bore an address in Italy and the words “Made in Romania”.

There were no specific indications, other than the name of the Dutch company, that this entity might be the producer of the coffee machine. 

The coffee machine having caught fire and caused property damage to the home of a Finnish consumer, the consumer’s insurer took the Dutch company to court in Finland for compensation.

The Supreme Court of Finland was primarily interested in whether the mere fact that a company affixes its trademark to a product suffices to make it a quasi-producer, or whether other criteria also apply in order for the trademark owner to be classified as producer.

Connected to this, the Finnish court also wanted the ECJ’s view on whether an indication on a product that the actual producer is a company other than the trademark owner is capable of discharging the trademark owner of liability and removing its status as quasi-producer.

The ECJ said no.

Pointing to the wording of Article 3(1) Product Liability Directive, the Court held that status as producer (i.e., as quasi-producer) was established by the mere fact of a trademark being affixed to a product.

The wording did not allow for alternatives or qualifications based on circumstances other than the affixing of the trademark.

Referring to the meaning and purpose of the provision, the ECJ further stated that the affixing of the trademark gave the impression that the trademark owner was involved in the production process or even assumed responsibility for it.

By using the trademark, the trademark owner was effectively using its reputation to make the product more attractive in the eyes of consumers.

Therefore, the trademark owner had to accept – as a quid pro quo or the other side of the coin, so to speak – that it could also be held liable in respect of that use.

The ECJ also used consumer protection as an argument.

Consumers could not be expected to grapple with the internal arrangements between the quasi-producer and the actual producer.

The idea was specifically to relieve consumers of the burden of having to determine identity of the actual producer.

Quasi-producers and actual producers were equally liable, it argued.

The quasi-producer therefore remained fully liable towards the consumer.

Conclusion and outlook It is hard to overestimate the implications of this ruling for white label, private label and store brand business since it means that trademark owners must in future expect to be fully liable vis-à-vis consumers.

Based on the ECJ’s unambiguous position, a trademark owner can no longer argue in its defence that it provided other information on the product or accompanying materials to indicate that it is not the actual producer.

This ECJ ruling is therefore in contrast to the earlier prevailing view as regards the definition of a quasi-producer in section 4 ProdHaftG, which considered it possible to override the legal impression created by the trademark’s use by indicating the actual producer.

Consequently, many types of product design that were previously considered permissible will no longer have the function of removing liability in future.

A trademark owner must expect to be held responsible and liable for product defects solely on the basis of use of its trademark.

This is problematic in a number of respects: Firstly, a trade mark owner must now ensure – by using the proper contract wording – that it can take full recourse against the actual producer, not only in law but also in fact.

This can be problematic in practical terms, especially (but not only) with suppliers from the Far East."
Gleiss Lutz,INCREASED LIABILITY RISKS FOR QUASI-PRODUCERS,"This can be problematic in practical terms, especially (but not only) with suppliers from the Far East.

The trademark owner bears the claim enforcement and insolvency risks in this respect.

Furthermore, drafting legally watertight standardised clauses is a complex matter.

Secondly, trademark owners often do not have the operational set up to defend claims as quasi-producers and obtain redress from suppliers in this regard since trademarks are frequently held within specialist holding structures by companies that are not operationally active.

This liability issue aside, other legal interests, such as tax incentives, also play a decisive role in the relevant corporate structures.

The ruling also raises issues relating to the adjustment of insurance cover.

Gleiss Lutz,TRADEMARK LAW IN THE METAVERSE,"The metaverse offers trademark owners new opportunities – and also exposes them to new risks.

But whether you plan to use your trademarks in the virtual arena or simply want to avert potential trademark infringements, the metaverse must be part of your trademark strategy.

Virtual goods: what’s the hype?

Fashion brands such as Nike , Gucci , and Balenciaga have all opened flagship stores in the metaverse and are offering so-called NFTs for digital wearables – apparel, shoes and accessories – for avatars.

Other branded goods manufacturers, such as Hermès , have however deliberately decided not to virtualise their products and are taking legal action against third parties who use their trademarks in the metaverse.

EUIPO statement of 23 June 2022 As a recently published statement by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) shows, trademark offices are also receiving increasing numbers of applications to protect virtual goods and NFTs ( Virtual goods, non-fungible tokens and the metaverse (europa.eu) ).

According to the EUIPO, virtual goods – for example, a designer evening dress that exists only in virtual form and can be worn by an avatar – are proper to Class 9 because they are ultimately treated as digital content or images.

When drafting a list of goods, it is nevertheless not sufficient to simply use the term “virtual goods”, as this is not precise enough.

The trademark application must instead state the specific type of virtual goods for which protection is sought.

For example, the virtual goods registered in Class 9 for the word mark of the TOMMY HILFIGER fashion label include – similar to the physical goods offered under that trademark – perfumes, clothing, footwear, headgear and bags.

So-called NFTs are to be distinguished from virtual goods.

The EUIPO defines NFTs as unique digital certificates registered in a blockchain, which authenticate digital items but are distinct from those digital items .

Digital goods – for example, a pair of virtual shoes – can be duplicated an unlimited number of times.

An NFT, however, makes it possible to purchase an exclusive certificate of authenticity for a specific digital object. 

Also with regard to NFTs, the term “Non-Fungible Token” is not sufficient for a trademark registration according to the EUIPO; rather, it is necessary to specify the type of digital item authenticated by the NFT – which must also be registered in Class 9.

The forthcoming 12th Edition of the Nice Classification will accordingly incorporate the term “downloadable digital files authenticated by non-fungible tokens” into Class 9.

The EUIPO concludes by saying that services relating to virtual goods and NFTs will continue to be classified in the corresponding Nice Classification service classes in line with the established principles.

For example, EU trademarks have already been registered in Class 35 for “ computerised online wholesale and retail services for buyers and sellers of downloadable digital videos, clothing, hats, glasses, bags authenticated by non-fungible tokens

[NFTs]"" .

Is a virtual handbag a handbag?

Virtual environments also harbour new risks.

Fashion house Hermès , for example, faced a situation where a third party was selling over 100 virtual MetaBirkins – inspired by its famous Birkin bag – on metaverse marketplace OpenSea .

Because Hermès had decided not to have their trademark protection extended to virtual goods, the question is whether a trademark registered for handbags is infringed by offering virtual handbags.

Under EU law, a trademark is generally infringed if there is a likelihood of confusion (section 14(2) Trademark Act ( Markengesetz ), Article 9(2) European Union Trade Mark Regulation).

This requires the use of a similar or identical sign for similar or identical goods or services – making comparison between the physical and virtual goods the key factor."
Gleiss Lutz,TRADEMARK LAW IN THE METAVERSE,"This requires the use of a similar or identical sign for similar or identical goods or services – making comparison between the physical and virtual goods the key factor.

Only if the courts assume a similarity between virtual and physical goods can trademark owners defend themselves against the use of their trademarks for virtual goods even without virtual goods protection on the basis of their protected trademark.

However, it is not yet possible to say what position trademark offices and courts will take.

According to the principle of territoriality under trademark law, the trademark infringement must take place in-country.

It is not yet clear when that is the case where virtual trademarks are used in the metaverse.

Owners of trademarks with a reputation are in a better position in this regard, as trademark protection is not restricted to the use of the sign for similar goods.

However, it can be very burdensome to prove the reputation of a trademark in infringement proceedings.

Given the uncertainties about the scope of trademark protection, it is advisable to extend this protection to virtual goods also as part of an initial defensive trademark strategy.

At the same time, this will make it easier to ward off trademark applications that third parties file in bad faith for virtual versions of trademarked goods.

Owners of German and EU trademarks benefit from the five-year grace period for use, providing enough time after filing the trademark application for virtual goods to actually launch these goods in the metaverse before the trademark in question becomes ready for cancellation due to non-use.

Where the lines between countries and markets are blurred, a trademark strategy geared solely towards national markets is unlikely to offer sufficient protection against trademark infringements in the metaverse.

It also remains to be seen how cease-and-desist orders will be enforced in the metaverse.

Conclusion Just as our universe continues to expand, so too does the metaverse – with new players and applications emerging on a daily basis.

But the metaverse does not exist in a legal vacuum.

Whether you want to offer goods or services in the metaverse, or first focus on protecting your trademarks from infringement, you should make sure you have the best possible trademark strategy for the virtual realm.

This includes: Expanding your trademark portfolios to include trademarks for virtual goods and NFTs in Class 9 and service marks in Class 35.

Extending the territorial scope of your trademark protection, as it is currently unclear what range national trademarks will have in the metaverse.

Adapted monitoring of trademark applications filed by third parties – especially for virtual goods and NFTs in Class 9 – so as to identify conflicting applications in time.

Gleiss Lutz,EU SUPPLY CHAIN ACT: RAPPORTEUR LARA WOLTERS PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT TIGHTENING OF THE DRAFT DIRECTIVE,"The stage is set for tough negotiations: On 8 November 2022, the Dutch rapporteur on the European Supply Chain Act, Lara Wolters, submitted her draft report – which goes far beyond the European Commission’s proposal published in February this year.

Which provisions are affected?

The report recommends that provisions on the following be tightened, in particular: Target group: size of the relevant companies Definition of high-risk sectors Scope of application: value chain Definition of business relationships Liability issues at corporate governance level Increased climate protection Access to justice Expansion of target group Wolters proposes extending the scope of the Act to cover companies with 250 or more employees and an annual turnover of more than EUR 40 million, as well as publicly listed companies.

Under the proposal, companies operating in high-impact sectors need only have more than 50 employees and EUR 8 million in annual turnover to fall under the EU Supply Chain Act if at least 30% of their company activities are carried out in such sectors.

By way of comparison, the Commission laid down thresholds of 500 or more employees and an annual turnover of EUR 150 million, or – for companies in high-impact sectors – 250 employees and an annual turnover of EUR 40 million, if at least 50% of their company activities are carried out in these sectors.

High-impact sectors At the same time, the report extends the list of high-impact sectors, which would again significantly increase the target group.

While the Commission defined agriculture, the textile industry and minerals as high-impact sectors, Wolters adds energy, construction, financial services and information technologies to the list.

Entire value chain as opposed to just upstream

The material scope of application is to be broadened further by using the term “value chain”, bringing both upstream and downstream activities under the purview of the EU Supply Chain Act.

For comparison, the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettengesetz , “LkSG”) currently only covers upstream chains, i.e. raw materials extraction, production and retail.

Since the Council and especially the German government take the position that the material scope of application should refer to “supply chains” – and therefore also only to the upstream chains – there are bound to be heated discussions about this wording.

Business relationships While the Commission’s proposal wants to regulate due diligence along the supply chain for established business relationships, Wolter’s report calls for a due diligence responsibility to be applied to all business relationships along the value chain, without these having to be “established” and therefore “permanent” relationships.

This would further expand the Act’s material scope to ensure that due diligence obligations also apply to sectors such as the textile industry, where supplier relationships often change quickly.

In this context, a provision on fair contractual terms is also intended to prevent the implementation of legal obligations from being shifted to weak parties at the start of the value chain.

At the same time, companies would have to ensure that business partners comply with legal due diligence requirements and, above all, are able to comply with them in the first place.

In a worst-case scenario, the company would have to provide technical and financial assistance to its business partners and prove that it has complied with this obligation.

This obligation to ensure compliance by a company’s smaller business partners at the start of the supply chain with due diligence obligations is supposed to prevent them from not being able to shoulder the associated administrative and financial burdens, and being forced out of the market as a result."
Gleiss Lutz,EU SUPPLY CHAIN ACT: RAPPORTEUR LARA WOLTERS PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT TIGHTENING OF THE DRAFT DIRECTIVE,"Linking directors’ remuneration to the achievement of sustainability targets The Commission’s current proposal of obligating companies to adopt a plan outlining the extent to which the company is pursuing the 1.5 o C target laid down in the Paris Agreement or its transition to a sustainable economy is also to be tightened.

Wolters calls for more precise wording here, arguing that directors’ plans must include measures the company intends to take to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

According to the report, a significant portion of directors’ remuneration should be linked to the implementation of these measures, especially those to reduce greenhouse gases.

However, this idea has met with hardly any support in the Council, so that at present there seems to be very little chance of directors’ remuneration being linked to the fulfilment of these obligations.

Increased climate protection The draft report also recommends tightening the Commission’s proposal with regard to environmental protection, where it currently only covers actual or potential adverse impacts on the environment.

Wolters wants environmental protection to be understood more broadly and to add obligations regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

Her report also defines adverse environmental impacts more precisely.

For example, in addition to the violation of one of the prohibitions listed in the Annex to the international environmental conventions, the proposed directive would also cover negative impacts on certain environmental categories.

This means that any adverse effects on air, water, soil, biodiversity and animal welfare, climate or the transition to a circular economy could qualify as an environmental degradation.

In this context, the report provides for remedial measures such as financial compensation or rehabilitation, to be taken by companies to compensate for adverse impacts.

Wolters is thus responding to demands made by NGOs in this regard.

Access to justice Wolters wants to allow stakeholders affected by human rights or environmental due diligence violations to take legal action before the European courts against the companies that committed these violations.

She also advocates reducing the burden of proof in favour of the claimants.

The latter would not have to submit evidence of the violation, but merely provide elements substantiating the likelihood of a company’s liability.

It would then be up to the company in question to submit exculpatory evidence.

It can be assumed that this point will also be hotly debated, as there are many voices in Parliament in favour of a safe harbour clause, and the German government is also likely to speak out against sweeping provisions enabling lawsuits to be brought against companies.

With a safe harbour clause, companies could avoid liability by meeting certain criteria in a type of checklist.

Conclusion The significantly more stringent proposals of rapporteur Lara Wolters are likely to trigger heated debate as the European Parliament determines its position, as well as among the Parliament, Council and Commission as they explore the possibility of a compromise.

Some of the rules proposed by the Commission have already encountered resistance in the Council – and this is unlikely to subside given the stricter rules proposed in the report.

Some Member States, for example, are demanding that the EU Supply Chain Act not cover financial services at all – not even in the weakened form proposed by the Commission.

The Federal Association of German Industry ( Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie , “BDI”), for example, has already criticised the Commission’s proposal as unrealistic in scope, meaning that the proposed extension to include the value chain will no doubt also meet strong resistance.

Intense debate can therefore be expected when it comes to the target group, the scope of application and the liability of companies, in particular."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION LAW FOR NIS2 – COMPREHENSIVE EXTENSION OF CYBERSECURITY OBLIGATIONS AND DIRECT LIABILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT,"Since 16 January 2023, the Network and Information Security 2 or NIS2 Directive ( Directive (EU) 2022/2555 ) has been in force.

It extends the scope of the cybersecurity obligations, which until now mainly applied to operators of critical infrastructures and providers of digital services, to large parts of the economy and significantly tightens the sanction regime in case of violations.

This also has consequences for co-determination at the workplace.

Unlike other digital legal acts of the EU, however, the NIS2 Directive still requires implementation by the national legislators.

Now the first Draft of an implementation law with the sonorous name “ NIS-2-Implementation and Cybersecurity Strengthening Act ” has become known, which partly even goes beyond what the NIS2 Directive requires.

The core of the draft law is a revision of the BSI Act ( “ Act on the Federal Office for Information Security ” (G esetz über das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik ) in future extended by the addition “ and on the security of information technology of operators and facilities ” ( und über die Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik von Betreibern und Einrichtungen ) – hereinafter “ BSIG V.2 ” ).

Although the NIS2 Directive grants an implementation deadline until 17 October 2024, the German legislator wants to report implementation already in spring 2024.

We give here a first overview of the regulations that companies have to prepare for in the next months.

Extended scope of application Cybersecurity requirements already affect many companies indirectly via data protection.

However, the data protection requirements are rather vague and only oriented towards the protection of personal data.

More extensive cybersecurity requirements only apply to certain companies, especially in the area of critical infrastructures and digital services.

NIS2 and BSIG V.2 considerably extend the list of sectors in which binding cybersecurity obligations shall apply: Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial market infrastructure, Health care, Drinking water, Waste water, Digital infrastructure, Administration of information and communication technology services (business-to-business), Public administration, Space, Postal and courier services, Waste management, Production, manufacture and trade of chemical substances, Production, processing and distribution of food, Manufacturing/production of goods, Providers of digital services, Research.

Whether a company that falls under these sectors has to fulfil specific cybersecurity obligations and if so, which ones, depends on the size of the company as well as on the types of facilities it operates.

The BSIG V.2 differentiates between critical facilities, essential/very important facilities and (merely) important facilities.

Above the threshold of micro or small enterprises with less than 50 employees or an annual turnover that does not exceed EUR 10 million, an applicability of the new cybersecurity obligations for companies of the above sectors is relatively likely.

As can be seen in particular from the category “ Manufacturing/production of goods ” , a “ technology affinity ” of the company is not required to be subject to cybersecurity obligations.

For companies, it is therefore important to first check carefully whether and in what role they fall within the personal scope of the new cybersecurity legislation because this determines the obligations they have to fulfil and the sanctions they have to fear.

More specific and extended catalogue of obligations The new BSIG V.2 provides for a comprehensive catalogue of cybersecurity obligations , which is both more extensive than the current cybersecurity law and goes into more detail .

These obligations are essentially divided into preventive obligations to prevent or limit the consequences of security incidents and reactive obligations to report these incidents."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION LAW FOR NIS2 – COMPREHENSIVE EXTENSION OF CYBERSECURITY OBLIGATIONS AND DIRECT LIABILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT,"These obligations are essentially divided into preventive obligations to prevent or limit the consequences of security incidents and reactive obligations to report these incidents.

The preventive obligations include – summarised – the following cybersecurity measures (detailed in Art. 21 para. 

2 NIS2 and § 30 para. 

4 BSIG V.2): Risk analysis and information security concepts, including authorisation concepts and procedures for assessing the effectiveness of risk management; Security incident management ; Business continuity management including backups and emergency plans; Security management of own personnel (including cybersecurity requirements and training) and of the supply chain, especially of suppliers/service providers; Security measures for acquisition, development and maintenance; Cryptography and, where appropriate, encryption; Authentication procedures and secure communication channels.

This catalogue is partly further specified by implementing acts of the European Commission for certain categories of providers.

An interesting special case of the obligation to conduct cybersecurity training is regulated by § 38 para. 

4 BSIG V.2, according to which the management of essential/very important and (merely) important facilities mustregularly participate in training courses .

In addition, the obligation from § 8a para.

1a BSIG to use systems for attack detection for operators of critical facilities (§ 39 BSIG V.2) remains in place.

The Federal Office for Information Security ( Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik - “ BSI ” ) has recently published a guidance document on this.

The reactive reporting obligation provides for a staggered reporting to the BSI in the case of significant security incidents, which is stricter in terms of deadlines and also organisationally more complex than the data protection obligation to report so-called data breaches (§ 31 BSIG V.2): Without undue delay , but no later than within 24 hours after becoming aware, an initial report must be submitted, which indicates whether there is a suspicion that the security incident is due to unlawful or malicious actions or could have cross-border effects.

Also without undue delay and no later than within 72 hours , i.e. within the same period as the notification of a data breach to the data protection supervisory authority, the initial report must be updated.

In this update, the severity and impact of the security incident must be assessed for the first time, if necessary indicating indicators of compromise.

If the BSI asks, interim reports must be submitted, which further update the report.

Within one month after the update of the initial report, a final report must be submitted.

This final report must contain a detailed description and analysis of the security incident.

If the security incident is still ongoing at this point, a progress report must be submitted instead and then a final report one month after the completion of the handling of the security incident.

The BSI shall also be able to instruct companies under certain conditions to inform the recipients of their services (i.e. usually the customers) about the security incident (§ 35 BSIG V.2).

A mandatory public information about the security incident is also possible (§ 36 BSIG V.2).

In addition, the BSI shall be able to oblige companies to inform the recipients of their services about (merely) potential cyber threats and measures taken against them, and possibly even to make public information about legal violations (§ 64 para. 

4, 65 para. 

3 BSIG).

Similar to the data protection obligation to inform the data subjects, such far-reaching reporting and information obligations can be even more damaging to a company's business than the data security incident itself.

In addition to these operational obligations, most companies that fall under the BISG V.2 have an obligation to register with the BSI ."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION LAW FOR NIS2 – COMPREHENSIVE EXTENSION OF CYBERSECURITY OBLIGATIONS AND DIRECT LIABILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT,"In addition to these operational obligations, most companies that fall under the BISG V.2 have an obligation to register with the BSI .

Operators of critical facilities and essential/very important facilities must also prove to the BSI that their cybersecurity measures meet the legal requirements (§§ 32 ff., 39 para. 

2 BSIG V.2).

The BISG V.2 thus establishes a kind of accountability obligation , which some companies may already know from data protection compliance.

Sanctions and increased liability Like almost all legal acts of the European digital strategy, NIS-2 Directive and BSIG V.2 provide for considerable fines in case of violations.

Fines of up to EUR 10 million or 2% of the worldwide previous year's turnover can be imposed on operators of critical facilities or essential/very important facilities, while for operators of (merely) important facilities the upper limit is still EUR 7 million or 1.4% of the turnover.

Remarkably, the wording of the maximum limit from the directive has been adopted so literally in the current version of the draft of the BSIG V.2 that the above maximum limits are not clearly defined.

The directive wants to allow the member states even higher limit values and therefore speaks of “ maximum amounts of at least X ” (Art. 34 para.

4, 5 NIS2).

The adoption of this wording into national law, however, takes away the character of a maximum limit (cf. § 60 para.

7 BSIG V.2: “ fine […] with a maximum amount of at least 2% ” ).

It is to be hoped that the legislator will correct this presumed editorial mistake in the course of the legislative process.

Further peculiarities are offered by the BSIG V.2 in the regulation of the liability of management .

According to this, the managers shall approve the cybersecurity measures to be taken by the company and monitor their implementation, without being able to delegate this to third parties (§ 38 para. 

1 BSIG V.2).

This makes cybersecurity legally a top management issue , as it is rightly already internally provided for in many companies.

It is explicitly regulated that managers are liable to the company for violations of their corresponding obligations (§ 38 para. 

2 BSIG V.2).

This essentially corresponds to the current law, but the clarification is intended to provide legal certainty here.

However, it is new that , according to the explanatory memorandum, fines are also to be covered by the concept of damage.

This question is highly controversial in the context of antitrust fines, and the clear legislative assessment could now pave the way for proponents of a recourse liability of the management for fines, at least in the area of cybersecurity.

Considerable practical difficulties will be caused by the regulation that a waiver of or a settlement on claims for damages against the management are invalid , unless there is (imminent) insolvency or a settlement by insolvency plan (§ 38 para. 

3 BSIG V.2).

This deprives companies of a proven means of safeguarding the company's interest in the case of unclear prospects of litigation.

The purpose of the regulation is also questionable because a settlement on corresponding claims for damages is already subject to approval by the shareholders` meeting.

It is therefore to be hoped that the legislator will reconsider this inflexible and inappropriate prohibition in the course of the legislative process.

In addition to fines and claims for damages , the BSIG V.2 also provides for an extension of the catalogue of other supervisory measures .

These include, for example, rights of entry and inspection, which not only operators of critical infrastructures have to expect, instructions to prevent security incidents or to establish the required level of security, instructions to inform about cyber threats and measures taken against them (§ 64 para. 

1-3 BSIG V.2)."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION LAW FOR NIS2 – COMPREHENSIVE EXTENSION OF CYBERSECURITY OBLIGATIONS AND DIRECT LIABILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT,"1-3 BSIG V.2).

Under certain conditions, the BSI shall even be able to prohibit persons of the management or legal representatives from exercising management tasks (§ 64 para. 

6 no. 2 BSIG V.2).

What's next?

The draft of the BSIG V.2 is so far only a draft by the ministry, so it still has a number of coordination processes between the ministries and parliamentary groups ahead of it.

Nevertheless, the draft assumes that the NIS-2-Implementation and Cybersecurity Strengthening Act will be promulgated in March 2024 and then – after a six-month implementation period – enter into force on 1 October 2024 .

This would mean that Germany would fulfil its implementation obligation well two weeks earlier than legally required.

It is also conceivable that a further coordination of the draft with the efforts to adopt a KRITIS umbrella law, for which key points were presented in December 2022, and to implement the so-called Critical Entities Resilience (CER) Directive will lead to delays.

However, after there were several sensitive and public cyber attacks on German companies in spring 2023 alone, a swift implementation of the NIS2 Directive is likely .

Given the difficulties that can arise in implementing cybersecurity measures in the company or even in the group – from the allocation of budgets to data protection checks to the selection and commissioning of service providers – the good year that companies have to prepare for the new cybersecurity regime is not an excessively long time.

At least one hurdle that is usually high for companies when introducing new processes could cause less difficulties here than usual.

This is because the described extensions of legal obligations not only restrict entrepreneurial decisions, but also the scope for co-determination at the workplace.

Any introduction and extension of IT security systems that is legally required does not need to be negotiated with the works council (§ 87 para.

1 introductory half-sentence Work Council Co-Determination Act - Betriebsverfassungsgesetz )."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT PASSES ACT IMPLEMENTING THE EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS DIRECTIVE,"The German Federal Parliament ( Bundestag ) adopted the Act Implementing the European Directive on Representative Actions for the Protection of the Collective Interests of Consumers ( Verbandsklagenrichtlinienumsetzungsgesetz ) on 7 July 2023.

As the Federal Council (Bundesrat) will deliberate on the act after the summer recess, it is expected to enter into force in autumn.

The new type of representative action for performance (known as action for redress measures – Abhilfeklage ), which is to be implemented according to the Representative Actions Directive, will be introduced in a new Consumer Rights Enforcement Act ( Verbraucherrechtedurchsetzungsgesetz ) together with the already existing model declaratory action ( Musterfeststellungsklage ).

This will allow an association to assert claims, regardless of subject, on behalf of a large number of consumers and small businesses, provided that the claims are “essentially of the same kind”.

The action for redress measures will be the first redress mechanism under German law enabling collective actions for damages.

The key aspects of the new act, as well as the changes made to the ministerial and government bill, can be summarised as follows:

Key aspects The new action for redress measures may be used for any claims that consumers (and small businesses) may have against companies.

This means that the act goes further than the directive, which only requires that claims for violations of certain EU consumer protection rules (including national provisions for the implementation of these EU rules) be covered.

Entities with standing to sue are qualified consumer associations from the list published pursuant to section 4 of the Injunctions Act ( Unterlassungsklagengesetz ) which are subject to only minor restrictions and those listed in the register kept by the European Commission.

The ministerial bill was based on the considerably stricter requirements for model declaratory actions.

Claims must be “essentially of the same kind”.

How this criterion is interpreted will be decisive for determining how broad or narrow the scope of actions for redress measures will be in the future.

The restrictive addition “essentially” was only added in the course of the legislative process.

The act specifies an opt-in model for actions for redress measures, as already required for model declaratory actions.

Claim holders must therefore actively join the action.

Their claim is not automatically covered as it would be in an opt-out model similar to a US class action.

The deadline for opting to participate in an action for redress measures and suspend the statute of limitations is three weeks after the conclusion of the last hearing.

A judgment may be issued no earlier than six weeks after the conclusion of the hearing.

A decision on whether to register a claim or withdraw such registration will therefore have to be made without knowing what the outcome of the proceeding will be, but can take into account a preliminary assessment made by the court in the course of the hearing.

A court can order the defendant company to pay a collective total amount, which it can determine at its discretion after assessing all the circumstances.

A trustee ( Sachwalter ) will be appointed to distribute the total amount to the consumers who have joined the action.

The defendant company must bear the costs incurred by the trustee.

The act imposes restrictions on permissible third-party funding in order to prevent abuse.

Whether or not these will be sufficient to avoid the rise of a litigation industry remains to be seen.

All in all, the action for redress measures the implementation of which was imposed by the directive involves a considerable risk that companies will face high-volume, bundled claims for damages.

It will still be possible to bring collective actions in which claims are assigned to a special litigation vehicle, as well as mass individual actions."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT PASSES ACT IMPLEMENTING THE EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS DIRECTIVE,"It will still be possible to bring collective actions in which claims are assigned to a special litigation vehicle, as well as mass individual actions.

They are not excluded by this new action for redress measures and will very likely remain relevant.

Scope of the action for redress measures Under the directive, the representative action mechanism only needs to be available if certain EU consumer protection provisions (including national provisions for the implementation of these EU rules) are violated.

The act does not provide for this restriction, but allows for actions for redress measures in all civil litigation cases between consumers and businesses.

This means that actions for redress measures can also be filed for antitrust damage claims, as well as for general claims in tort.

The act now makes it possible for actions to be brought jointly by multiple entities or against multiple businesses.

However, an action for redress measures is only admissible if the claims asserted are “essentially of the same kind”.

According to the explanatory memorandum, the claims must be so similar that a court can perform a standardised review of the factual and legal prerequisites for the claim.

In the legislative process, the criterion “of the same kind” was relaxed by the restrictive addition “essentially”.

The court should not have to deal with several different legal issues that give rise to different individual scenarios.

The explanatory memorandum cited liquidated damages claims of air passengers for the delay or cancellation, where the individual circumstances of passengers on the same flight are irrelevant, as one example of claims of the same kind.

For claims to be of the same kind, it should also be possible to calculate their amount using a specific formula (e.g. for invalid interest rate adjustment clauses in savings contracts, already a frequent subject of model declaratory actions).

The claims must essentially be based on comparable facts and essentially the same factual and legal questions must be relevant to the decision.

Individual differences between the claims affected by an action for redress measures should not prevent their enforcement in a single procedure as long as it is ensured that the proceedings are conducted effectively and it makes sense to bundle them in the interests of procedural economy.

The criterion “essentially of the same kind” leaves a lot of room for discussion.

At the same time, it is decisive for determining how broadly or narrowly actions for redress measures will be used in future.

Actions for redress measures extended to small enterprises If an action for redress measures is brought on behalf of consumers, it can be joined by small enterprises as well, provided they are equally affected.

Small enterprises have less than ten employees and an annual turnover or annual balance sheet total of no more than EUR 2 million.

The law therefore deviates considerably in scope from the government bill, which had still set the limit at 50 employees and a maximum annual turnover/balance sheet total of EUR 10 million.

In addition, the law goes further than the provisions of the directive.

This could become relevant in antitrust damages actions, which in certain cases can affect both consumers and small enterprises.

In such cases, it will be particularly important to determine whether the claims involved are of the same kind, because businesses and consumers are often likely to be affected at different market levels.

Standing to sue – funding – protection from abuse The requirements for associations to have a standing to sue as set out in the government bill were still based on those applying to the model declaratory action.

Associations had to be registered for four years and were not allowed to operate commercially or bring actions with the intention of making a profit.

These requirements were greatly relaxed in the course of the legislative process."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT PASSES ACT IMPLEMENTING THE EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS DIRECTIVE,"These requirements were greatly relaxed in the course of the legislative process.

Under the act, a consumer association has standing to sue if it is included in the list published pursuant to section 4 of the Injunctions Act and does not obtain more than 5% of its funding from contributions from companies.

The origin of the funds used to finance the action or any agreements on these funds with third parties must be disclosed to the court.

Third-party funding, while generally permissible, is prohibited if the litigation funder (a) is a competitor of the defendant company, (b) is dependent on the defendant company, (c) has been promised an economic share of more than 10% in the payment to be made by the defendant company or (d) can be expected to influence the litigation of the entity with standing to sue, including settlement decisions, to the detriment of consumers.

The maximum share of 10% was inserted late in the legislative process.

Despite respective comments submitted by litigation funders, the act does not specify the basis on which a funding provider may get a share in the proceeds at all, since it needs to be ensured that the consumer receives the full payment awarded.

Moreover, there is no basis for the defendant company to assume the funding costs as part of the costs of litigation.

The act does not contain any new provisions on the disclosure of evidence similar to US discovery rules.

Although the options for ordering disclosure which already exist under current law can now also be enforced against the parties by means of sanctions, this will most likely not change the restrictive handling of such orders by the courts.

Opt-in and statute of limitations In order to join an action for redress measures and benefit from its suspensory effect, consumers must register their claims with the register of representative actions by no later than three weeks after the last hearing.

While an opt-out model was not seriously proposed, the timing of the opt-in was the subject of heated debate.

The ministerial bill still required an opt-in on the day before the first hearing at the latest, which was in line with the model declaratory action introduced in 2018.

The government bill proposed an opt-in no later than two months after the first hearing.

Some legal authors proposed a later opt-in, even only after a settlement or judgment – which, when combined with a suspension of the limitation period for all consumers affected by the action for redress measures, would ultimately be tantamount to an opt-out model.

Consumers would then have been able to wait for a final decision on the action for redress measures and then assert their claims, even years later, without any risk of their claims becoming statute-barred.

While the act does not follow this approach, the fact that it extends the deadline for the opt-in until three weeks after the conclusion of the last hearing will significantly increase the risk for companies.

If the court provides a preliminary legal assessment in favour of the consumers at the hearing, this may result in further claims being registered.

The suspensory effect of the registration applies retroactively from the date on which the action for redress measures was brought.

Unlike with the existing model declaratory action, it is not necessary for at least 50 consumers to register for the action for redress measures to be admissible.

Rather, it is sufficient to demonstrate plausibly, instead of providing prima facie evidence – as required by the government bill – that 50 consumers may be affected.

There is also a very low threshold for registering claims with the Federal Office of Justice ( Bundesamt für Justiz ): no lawyer is required, text form is sufficient, and there are no costs involved.

Judgment and implementation The act sets out a three-stage process.

First, the court can issue a redress judgment on the grounds if it considers the action to be justified on the merits."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT PASSES ACT IMPLEMENTING THE EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS DIRECTIVE,"Judgment and implementation The act sets out a three-stage process.

First, the court can issue a redress judgment on the grounds if it considers the action to be justified on the merits.

The judgment may not be handed down earlier than six weeks after the conclusion of the last hearing.

Settlement talks can then be held on this basis.

If a settlement is not reached, the court can issue a final redress judgment in which a collective total amount can be awarded for all of the claim holders.

The company must pay this amount into a fund, and a trustee will be appointed to implement the judgment by distributing the amount to the claim holders.

If both parties request it and settlement efforts appear futile, a final redress judgment will be issued immediately instead of a redress judgment on the grounds.

The court can determine the collective total amount at its discretion considering all the circumstances.

The court may also estimate the amount based on the possible maximum amount.

From the defendant company’s point of view, it is important to know that the adjudicated amount is provisional only, so paying this sum will not automatically resolve the matter definitively.

If the amount is not sufficient, it can subsequently be increased upon application.

Should it emerge after the justified claims have been satisfied that the amount paid was too high, the remaining amount will be returned to the defendant company.

But even a collective total amount that is merely provisional can still have a significant impact on the liquidity of the defendant company.

The court will appoint a trustee to distribute the total amount among the claim holders.

According to the explanatory memorandum to the ministerial bill, lawyers, tax advisors, economists, insolvency administrators and auditors could be appointed as trustee.

The trustee will then review the entitlements of the individual claim holders and satisfy their claims out of the total amount.

The defendant company must bear the costs of the implementation process, including the trustee’s fees.

If the company has specific objections concerning the asserted claim which were not recognised by the trustee, it may raise objections to the trustee’s decision and if necessary bring an action.

The same applies to consumers.

Conclusion Since the act enables collective actions for damages for the first time in German law, it creates a litigation model that will be more attractive to (allegedly) injured consumers and their service providers than the current statutory redress mechanisms.

However, it will still be possible to bring parallel collective actions in which claims are assigned to a special litigation vehicle, as well as mass individual actions.

They are not excluded by this new action for redress measures and will very likely remain relevant.

In any event, the Federal Government’s view that the action for redress measures will eliminate mass individual actions on a larger scale seems too optimistic.

The new action for redress measures is not a replacement but an additional instrument open to plaintiffs.

The number of lawsuits and the risks to companies can therefore be expected to increase."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ASSETS IN M&A TRANSACTIONS,"Data assets are becoming increasingly important in M&A transactions.

In some cases they are the main motivation for the transaction, representing the core asset – especially in tech acquisitions.

But data also impact how transactions are structured.

Not only because regulatory compliance has to be ensured, but also to secure the (ongoing) viability of the seller and the company sold in carve-out situations, for example.

Background Data are often a key component of a company’s value – especially in the technology sector – and may be the reason for entering into M&A transactions in the first place.

Examples of data assets include image, video and audio databases used to train AI software and prepared specifically for this purpose.

Customer, user and sales data are often equally important, as are price lists, production information, internal reports, etc., which may be trade secrets within the meaning of section 2, no. 1 German Trade Secrets Protection Act ( Gesetz zum Schutz von Geschäftsgeheimissen , “GeschGehG”) protected for the benefit of the target company.

Numerous other types of data also play a role, such as the target’s employee data, accounting data subject to statutory retention obligations under section 257 German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , “HGB”) and section 147 German Fiscal Code ( Abgabenordnung , “AO”), data relating to the target’s movable assets or real estate and other data necessary for the continuation of its business operation.

Although there is no ownership right to data, databases are protected by copyright and/or ancillary copyrights.

It is, however, possible to protect data as know-how or trade secrets.

This means that unauthorised use of data (even simple collections of data, so-called “data piles”) may establish cease-and-desist claims.

When handling personal data, the legal regulations, in particular the GDPR, must be observed, as data protection violations can lead to substantial fines.

It is therefore important to precisely define what data are to be acquired through the transaction and what data are (also) to remain with the seller.

This article looks at both traditional full share deals and asset deals.

It does not cover joint venture scenarios or questions that arise during pre-closing, such as handling and the accessibility of data in due diligence.

Share deal Transfer of legal entity that owns the data A share deal involves the transfer of the target, which owns the data.

Generally, all of the data necessary for the current business operations and/or that the target is required to retain by law must be handed over, meaning they remain with the target.

This also includes historical data (even if the retention periods have already expired).

The seller may retain data only if this is agreed in the transaction documentation and does not conflict with any legal requirements.

For non-personal data, such retention can be stipulated in the contract, but must comply with antitrust requirements (HR data can also be relevant in connection with the competition for talent), since access to competitively relevant data can influence a company’s market power (cf. section 18(3), no. 3 Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen , “GWB”).

In addition to the M&A transaction itself potentially being prohibited, conditions may also be imposed requiring the parties to refrain from exchanging certain data and transferring certain data together with ownership of the company.

Restrictions may also apply under foreign trade law, for example.

Regarding the target’s personal data, however, the seller may only retain, access and/or process data where such use is permissible under data protection law.

It would be possible, for example, for the seller to process data on behalf of the target, e.g. under a transitional service agreement (i.e. an agreement on the provision of interim services post-closing, see below) or another service relationship."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ASSETS IN M&A TRANSACTIONS,"Seller’s obligation to delete data, especially in carve-out scenarios In share deals where data relating to the target are (also) stored by the seller and no special provisions are agreed in the transaction documentation, the seller may be obliged to delete that data.

A fundamental distinction must be made between personal and non-personal data in this regard: Non-personal data For non-personal data, if no retention rights for the seller are stipulated in the purchase agreement and no other rights of the seller to access and use the target’s data have been agreed, the following, in particular, must be considered: The seller may not access or use data or databases protected as trade secrets within the meaning of section 2, no. 1 GeschGehG or as IP rights of the sold company, post-closing.

The purchaser may also require the seller to delete the protected data it holds unless it is obliged by law to retain such protected data under statutory provisions (e.g. under retention obligations pursuant to section 257 HGB and section 147 AO).

Personal data The seller is generally no longer allowed to access or process (i.e. in particular store, query, duplicate, transmit, etc.)

the target’s personal data post-closing.

All of the target’s personal data held by the seller that are not required, for example, for the performance of a transitional services agreement must be transferred to the sold company or deleted.

If the seller and the purchaser have entered into a transitional services agreement that includes data processing, the seller may generally process personal data required to provide the services under the transitional services agreement, but only to the extent that processing personal data is necessary for this purpose (e.g. for IT or HR services, etc.).

The following conditions apply: Access may only be granted to those employees of the seller who are entrusted with the provision of the relevant services under the transitional services agreement and require access in order to provide these services (need-to-know principle).

Even where the need-to-know principle is applied, it must be ensured that wherever data regarded as sensitive under antitrust law is involved, employees with access to the data do not perform similar operational functions for the seller (for example in the case of HR data, they may not work in the recruiting department).

From a technical standpoint, it must always be ensured that the data of the sold company is at least logically separated from the seller’s data.

This is usually achieved with the help of appropriate authorisation policies.

The technical and organisational measures (TOMs) normally attached to data processing create additional technical requirements in this regard.

The seller may only process further personal data if it is obliged or entitled to do so under applicable EU or national law.

The sold company must generally be informed of any such legal obligation prior to the processing.

Handling data in the transaction In the case of a share deal, if no special arrangement is made, the target’s data will remain with it.

Since the seller generally can neither retain the data belonging to the company’s current business operations nor the target’s historical data, such data must be handed over together with the ownership of the target.

As a result, there is a need for regulation in the following situations in particular: Handling of the target’s data on the seller’s servers If the target’s data are stored on the seller’s servers, the purchase agreement must include provisions on the IT carve-out: Data not to remain with the seller Data that are not to remain with the seller must be separated until closing and transferred to the target, subject to format specifications, if necessary (physical separation).

If physical separation cannot be implemented until closing, the data can continue to be stored in the systems if they are at least logically separated from other data."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ASSETS IN M&A TRANSACTIONS,"If physical separation cannot be implemented until closing, the data can continue to be stored in the systems if they are at least logically separated from other data.

Logical separation is usually achieved with the help of appropriate authorisation policies.

Failure to implement logical separation for personal data can lead to data protection violations that may carry substantial fines.

As a rule, the target’s access to the data post-closing is regulated in a transitional service agreement, but can also be determined in a long-term service agreement (in each case including an agreement on the processing of personal data, where necessary).

A migration project should simultaneously be set up to implement the physical data separation by the end of the transitional services agreement at the latest.

The key terms of this project and the allocation of the migration costs between the purchaser and the seller must be stipulated in a migration plan, which can become an annex to the purchase agreement or the transitional services agreement.

Data to remain with the seller If the target’s data are to remain (exclusively) with the seller on its servers, this must be explicitly stipulated in the purchase agreement — subject to statutory regulations, as explained above.

Such provisions can include, for example, the target’s time-limited access rights and special requirements for data storage at the seller (authorisation policies, need-to-know principle, etc.):

With regard to personal data, these provisions must be limited to cases where the seller is permitted to process such personal data at the time of closing (in particular where it has a statutory retention obligation).

If the seller requires personal data at a later point in time, but is not permitted to access it at the time of closing, the purchase agreement can oblige the purchaser to hand it over in such cases.

However, the seller must initially delete such personal data.

With regard to non-personal data, including anonymised data (i.e. the link to specific persons can only be restored with disproportionate effort and expense; such anonymisation is subject to stringent requirements), the parties are generally free to regulate the seller’s access and use of such data.

However, in order to avoid as far as possible a technically complex transfer and/or deletion of data, an agreement similar to the one described above would be preferable with regard to such data, as it allows the data to remain with the seller.

Handling data on the target’s servers that are to remain with the seller If the target’s servers still have data that are to remain with the seller, a reverse data carve-out is necessary.

This can be implemented by simply migrating the data prior to closing.

In this case it would make sense for the target and the seller to conclude a data transfer agreement prior to the sale of the target granting time-limited access rights to the target, if necessary.

Alternatively, a provision to this effect can be incorporated in the purchase agreement itself, clarifying what data are not included in the transaction and will therefore be transferred to the seller ahead of closing.

Personal data, on the other hand, can only be retained by or transferred to a group company subject to statutory data protection rules and regulations (e.g. customers must consent to the transfer of their data).

Asset deal Transfer of data assets In an asset deal, the transfer of data assets must be set out in detail in the purchase agreement.

If the data represent the core asset of the transaction, the purchase agreement must contain the main provisions on physical separation (described above) and transfer of the data to the purchaser.

A detailed migration project should be also set up to physically separate the data.

In an asset deal, the data relating to the transferred assets are transferred to the purchaser, but the transfer is limited to that data."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ASSETS IN M&A TRANSACTIONS,"In an asset deal, the data relating to the transferred assets are transferred to the purchaser, but the transfer is limited to that data.

In particular: Employee data are only to be transferred insofar as employees are taken over as part of the asset deal pursuant to section 613a German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , “BGB”) and are necessary for the continuation of the employment relationships with the purchaser.

Accounting data are only to be transferred insofar as the purchaser is subject to statutory retention obligations under section 257 HGB and section 147 AO, e.g. when taking over customer contracts.

Under the GDPR, the transfer of personal data as part of an asset deal requires a legal basis.

The legal basis for the transfer of the data of employees whose employment relationships are transferred to the purchaser pursuant to section 613a BGB is derived from section 26(1) Federal Data Protection Act ( Bundesdatenschutzgesetz , “BDSG”) (performance of the employment contract).

In other cases where the purchaser enters into the seller’s existing contractual relationships with a natural person, the contract also forms the basis for the data transfer (Article 6(1), letter (b) GDPR).

Apart from existing contracts with the data subjects, the legitimate interests of the parties involved in the transaction can justify a data transfer except where their interests are overridden by the interests of the data subjects (Article 6(1), letter (f) GDPR).

If no statutory legal basis applies, the only justification for the disclosure of personal data is the consent of the data subject (Article 6(1), letter (a) GDPR), but this is usually not feasible in practice.

General prior consent given when the data was collected normally does not meet the statutory requirements, as consent must be given for the personal data to be processed for a specific purpose; in particular, it must be clear who will be processing this data.

If there is no legal basis, the personal data may not be transferred.

Seller’s obligations to delete data When establishing whether the seller is obliged to delete data in an asset deal, a distinction must be made between personal and non-personal data.

Non-personal data Data relating to the transferred assets, in particular data protected as trade secrets within the meaning of section 2, no. 1 GeschGehG or as IP rights, may generally not be accessed or used unless the purchase agreement expressly stipulates otherwise.

Personal data Personal data relating to the transferred assets must almost always be deleted.

The seller may only continue to store them if and to the extent this is permitted under Article 6 GDPR, in particular if there are statutory retention obligations and the seller has a legitimate interest in processing the data: Where employees are transferred as part of an asset deal, retention obligations and rights may arise in particular with regard to employee data, e.g. timesheets for the purpose of monitoring compliance with section 16(2)

Working Hours Act ( Arbeitszeitgesetz , “ArbZG”) or data relating to the termination of the employment relationship, for example for issuing references and/or relating to potential claims of employees against the seller as the former employer which are not yet statute-barred).

The seller may also be obliged to retain accounting data under section 257 HGB and section 147 AO (e.g. company books, balance sheets, including any work instructions and organisational documents, trade and business letters, including any e-mails and correspondence with business partners, accounting records, etc.), as the shares in the company will continue to be held by the seller following the asset deal.

Handling data in the transaction An asset deal involves transferring only the assets specifically listed in the purchase agreement.

This means that – unless agreed otherwise – all data which are not listed will generally remain with the seller."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ASSETS IN M&A TRANSACTIONS,"This means that – unless agreed otherwise – all data which are not listed will generally remain with the seller.

If data relating to the transferred assets are to remain with the seller — where this is legally permissible — this must be regulated separately in the purchase agreement.

The principles described above for share deals also apply to data that are to remain with the seller.

Particularly in cases in which non-specific data assets are transferred, where specific provision would normally be made in the purchase agreement but any data provisions are lacking, transfer of the data is, however, also subject to contract interpretation.

If IP rights are transferred such an interpretation may mean, for example, that all of the data stored in connection with these rights have to be transferred to the purchaser.

It is therefore necessary to specify which data are to be transferred.

Handling the data assets in the transaction documentation Safeguarding the data assets Contractually safeguarding data assets is a vital aspect in both share and asset deals, especially where data represent the core asset in the M&A transaction.

Experience has shown that a technical and operational examination of the data and its usability is of particular importance in this respect.

From a legal perspective, the following aspects are key: For non-personal data: usability and possible rights of use.

For personal data: lawfulness of the data collection, usability for business operations and, if applicable, possible subsequent transferability and usability for further purposes.

In this connection, known and unknown risks must be covered by guarantees and indemnities from the purchaser’s point of view, whereas from the seller’s point of view, it is vital that the relevant data assets not expose it to incalculable risks.

Safeguarding handling of the data In the interest of both sides, the purchase agreement must clearly indicate how the data are to be handled in a manner that reflects the interests of the parties and is geared to the specific M&A transaction.

This not only raises the question of what specific data are to be transferred, i.e. how the contractual obligations of the parties are structured, but also how to ensure compliance with the relevant statutory requirements."
Gleiss Lutz,REAL ESTATE UPDATE 2024 – GROUNDS FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM?,"The property market will continue to face major challenges in 2024.

This is largely due to geopolitical developments such as the unpredictable situation in the Middle East and Ukraine – despite the fact that energy security fears raised at the beginning of the war in Ukraine have not fully materialised, as reliance on Russian natural gas has been significantly reduced.

The US presidential election in November 2024 also looms large.

Domestically, the persisting uncertainty surrounding the future of the ruling coalition „ Ampelkoalition"" and the potential impact of upcoming state elections as well as the sometimes tumultuous shifts in the German government’s economic and budgetary policy will likely continue to cause considerable uncertainty.

It is already becoming apparent that the budget crisis triggered by the Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling on the use of money from the Climate and Transformation Fund will result in numerous funding programmes being cut or suspended, particularly those intended to support the energy transition and the transformation of industry and the economy.

This will also indirectly increase energy and consumer prices – the grid fee subsidy paid from federal funds is to be eliminated, for example – something that will ultimately be felt on the property market.

Inflation, on the other hand, has noticeably cooled, which is starting to impact interest rates.

While the inflation rate was still at 8.7% in January 2023, it more than halved over the course of the year, resulting in overall inflation of just under 6% in 2023 with an ifo forecast of around 2.5% for 2024.

The European Central Bank’s key interest rate remains high, however; it stood at 2.5% at the end of 2022 and has since been successively raised to 4.5%.

Likewise, the Bundesbank raised its base rate from 1.62% at the beginning of 2023 to 3.62% as of 1 January 2024.

However, the ECB has recently resisted pressure to raise interest rates again, and the increase in the base rate has also significantly slowed.

Nevertheless, the relevant indices are expected to stagnate or at best fall moderately in the coming months in order to minimise any remaining inflation risks.

Meanwhile, the development of the key interest rate is beginning to have an impact on property interest rates .

While ten-year fixed rates were still well above 4% in November 2023, they had dropped below that by the beginning of 2024.

With construction costs still high and energy costs likely to rise again, interest rates will probably continue to hamper the development of property – and therefore property transactions – in all asset classes for some time to come, although the industry is much more optimistic than it was a year ago.

However, given that economic growth is still generally subdued, calls by property buyers (or sellers), lessors and lessees for legislators to take action are unlikely to cease in the new year.

All of this needs to be seen against the background of the immense challenges facing the property sector as a result of climate change, although there is a steadily growing awareness of the need for sustainable and climate-friendly action.

In the following, we look at the key developments and outline important legislative changes that are likely to have a decisive impact on the property market in 2024.

Continued clear focus on increasing sustainability in the property sector The property sector is not immune to the challenges posed by climate change.

In fact, the legislator has further tightened the requirements for the construction and operation of properties in the last year to ensure they are as climate-friendly and sustainable as possible.

GEG, GEIG and EnEfG Following extensive, sometimes acrimonious political debates, far-reaching changes to the Building Energy Act ( Gebäudeenergiegesetz, “GEG”) came into force on 1 January 2024.

The legislator’s main aim was to further strengthen the use of renewable energies in the building sector."
Gleiss Lutz,REAL ESTATE UPDATE 2024 – GROUNDS FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM?,"The legislator’s main aim was to further strengthen the use of renewable energies in the building sector.

Accordingly, the new regulation in section 71(1) GEG stipulates that new heating systems must generate at least 65% of the heat provided using renewable energies or unavoidable waste heat.

This requirement does not apply to heating systems used to supply buildings for national defence or alliance defence purposes (section 71(7) GEG) or systems for which a supply or service contract was concluded before 19 April 2023 and which are installed or set up for the purpose of commissioning on or before 18 October 2024 (section 71(12) GEG).

While new buildings must comply with this regulation, the legislator has for the time being refrained from including an immediate obligation to replace existing systems in existing buildings.

Instead, section 71(10)

GEG provides that heating systems that do not meet the requirements of section 71(1) GEG may be replaced or installed or set up and operated until midnight on 30 June 2026 in existing buildings in municipalities that have more than 100,000 inhabitants on 1 January 2024.

For smaller municipalities, this applies until midnight on 30 June 2028.

The legislator has retained the obligation to replace oil heating systems and boilers that are more than 30 years old.

Property companies should therefore ensure they keep track of when heating systems need to be replaced and what technical options are available, bearing in mind the municipality in which the property is located and when municipal heat plans are expected to take effect (see below for more details).

The special regulations in section 71o GEG and sections 559, 559e Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , “BGB”) take the interests of the affected lessees into account by capping any rent increases at EUR 0.50 per square metre of living space for a period of six years.

The economic interests of owners were to be taken into account as part of the federal subsidy for efficient buildings.

Following the budget crisis triggered by the Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling, this is to generally remain in place; however, the funding conditions have recently been adjusted and certain grants have been eliminated.

There will be further changes to the GEG, in particular to implement the European Union’s revamped Energy Performance of Buildings Directive .

The European Parliament and Member States reached a compromise on new rules for the energy efficiency of buildings in late 2023, making it likely that the directive will come into force in the first half of 2024 and subsequently be implemented by the Member States.

The new regulations contain a large number of measures to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and promote the renovation of existing buildings in the Member States, focussing on buildings with the lowest energy efficiency.

The main objectives are for all new buildings to be zero-emission by 2030 at the latest and for existing buildings to become zero-emission by 2050.

The requirements of the GEG are also closely linked to the Heat Planning Act ( Wärmeplanungsgesetz , “WPG”) , which aims to achieve a greenhouse gas-neutral heat supply by 2045 at the latest based on so-called heat plans.

These plans are intended to determine the best and most cost-efficient type of local heat supply, strategically divide the municipal area into heat supply areas and give consumers and suppliers certainty as to which heat supply they can expect in their area.

This should provide energy consumers with a basis for planning and deciding on their energy supply investments.

The Building Electromobility Infrastructure Act ( Gebäude-Elektromobilitätsinfrastruktur-Gesetz , “GEIG” , see also the corresponding GL newsletter ), which obliges builders and owners of certain residential and non-residential buildings to install wiring infrastructure and charging points, came into force in March 2021."
Gleiss Lutz,REAL ESTATE UPDATE 2024 – GROUNDS FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM?,"However, as section 10(1) GEIG requires owners of non-residential buildings with more than 20 parking spaces to ensure that the required charging points are installed after 1 January 2025, many owners will likely arrange for the installation of the required charging points in the coming year, particularly since failure to comply with this obligation may lead to a fine of up to EUR 10,000.

This gives rise to numerous (property) law issues, some of which are already being hotly debated, and not all of which are answered by the GEIG or the accompanying provisions in section 554 BGB or section 20(2), sentence 1, no. 2

Apartment Ownership Act ( Wohnungseigentumsgesetz , “WEG ”), according to which structural changes that serve to charge electrically powered vehicles must be tolerated or can be demanded.

In addition, the Energy Efficiency Act ( Energieeffizienzgesetz, “EnEfG”) came into force on 18 November 2023.

Its aims include helping reduce primary and final energy consumption as well as the import and consumption of fossil fuels, improving security of supply, and ultimately mitigating climate change and ensuring that national and European energy efficiency targets are met.

Under section 8(1)

EnEfG, companies with an annual average total final energy consumption of more than 7.5 GWh in the last three years must set up an energy or environmental management system.

Section 9 EnEfG gives companies with an annual average total final energy consumption of more than 2.5 GWh three years to draw up and publish feasible implementation plans for all final energy saving measures identified as economically viable under the Act.

Further legal changes Finally, there are various other legal changes that are likely to have an indirect impact on the property market.

First, on 1 January 2024 the CO2 price increased by EUR 15.00 to EUR 45.00 per tonne of CO2 emitted.

As lessors and lessees have been sharing the CO2 levy in accordance with the Carbon Dioxide Cost Allocation Act ( Kohlendioxidkostenaufteilungsgesetz , “CO2KostAufG”) since the beginning of 2023 (where the lessor’s share depends on the building’s efficiency level and can amount to up to 95% of the costs incurred under certain circumstances), this means a significant additional burden for both owners and users.

Next, the state price brakes for gas, district heating and electricity expired on 31 December 2023 and the full VAT rate of 19% has been reinstated for gas and district heating since 1 January 2024.

Not only will this increase ancillary costs, but also the already high construction costs.

The state price brakes also led to different notification and reporting obligations for lessees and lessors, which continue to apply.

This will likely continue to require considerable billing and monitoring effort in 2024.

In addition, on 1 January 2024 North Rhine-Westphalia imposed an obligation to install photovoltaic systems when carrying out roof overhauls or constructing new, non-residential buildings.

Bremen is to follow suit on 1 July 2024 but without the restriction to non-residential buildings.

Last year the German Property Federation (ZIA) fundamentally revised its 2018 guidelines on green leases , recognising the fact that green leases and green lease clauses have been steadily increasing in importance over the past few years – this despite there currently being no legal definition of a green lease, nor any (legally) binding criteria for determining when a lease qualifies as a green lease.

To reflect the increased importance of ESG ( Environmental, Social, Governance ) criteria, the draft of the guidelines is now entitled “ From Green Lease to ESG Lease ” and takes into account how the concept of sustainability has been fleshed out in recent EU regulations (such as the Taxonomy and Disclosure Regulations).

The guidelines will therefore likely continue to decisively shape the discussion on the further development of green leases."
Gleiss Lutz,REAL ESTATE UPDATE 2024 – GROUNDS FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM?,"The guidelines will therefore likely continue to decisively shape the discussion on the further development of green leases.

The consequences of continued high inflation Despite the continued high level of inflation, the legislator did not see fit to introduce changes to the provisions on frustration of contract (section 313 BGB) last year – unlike it did during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least to some extent and temporarily, with Article 240, section 7 Introductory Act to the Civil Code ( Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch , “EGBGB”).

Instead, it has been left to the courts and contracting parties to find appropriate responses to the challenges posed by this situation.

Given the reluctance to extend existing contracts to include provisions allowing for the latest developments in inflation, however, and also the degree of wrangling over the wording of indexation clauses in new rental and lease agreements – which must allow for the current unusually high level of inflation while also being commercially appropriate for the entire term of agreement – the issue of how to structure provisions protecting against inflation is likely to remain contentious even as inflation cools.

This is all the more so considering that the lower instance courts have repeatedly confirmed that indexation clauses can only be adjusted in accordance with the principles of frustration of contract under strict conditions.

Outlook

While there are certainly grounds for cautious optimism given that interest rates are showing signs of normalising, the COVID-19 pandemic has largely been overcome, energy security has improved and inflation has eased, the large number of ongoing multipolar crises mean that a certain degree of underlying uncertainty remains – which is also likely to have an impact on the dynamics of the property market.

The challenge of reconciling the goal of ever more climate-friendly and therefore more sustainable property development and management with legitimate profit interests under uncertain (geo)political conditions is therefore likely to continue to shape the property market in 2024."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYERS MUST PROVIDE NECESSARY WORK EQUIPMENT,"Couriers who receive their orders via an app and deliver food from restaurants are entitled to have their employer provide them with the equipment necessary to carry out their work.

This includes an internet-enabled mobile phone (smartphone) with data volume and a roadworthy bicycle.

Federal Labour Court, judgment of 10 November 2021 – 5 AZR 334/21

Background

The defendant operates a delivery service with its own app which customers can use to order food from restaurants.

The plaintiff is employed by the defendant as a courier or “rider”, delivering food and drinks from restaurants to customers.

The defendant provides the plaintiff with the addresses of customers and restaurants via the app and processes the payments.

The plaintiff is contractually obliged to use his own mobile phone and his own bicycle to carry out his work.

In return for using his own bicycle, the defendant granted the plaintiff repair credit of EUR 0.25 per hour worked, which the plaintiff could use in a workshop designated by the defendant.

With his lawsuit, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant provide him with a smartphone, including data volume, and a roadworthy bicycle to be used exclusively for his work as a rider.

The action was dismissed by the Labour Court, but subsequently upheld by the Higher Labour Court.

The Higher Labour Court noted that the required app usually consumed up to 2 GB of data volume per month.

After the appeal hearing, the defendant provided the plaintiff with an internet-enabled mobile phone for his work as works council chairman and stated during the proceedings before the Federal Labour Court that he could also use this phone for his work as a rider for as long as he served on the works council.

During these proceedings, the defendant continued to argue that the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed.

The plaintiff demanded that he be provided with a roadworthy bicycle for his work as a rider.

He also asked the Court to order the defendant to provide him with an internet-enabled mobile device with a data usage contract with 2 GB of data volume per month that he could likewise use specifically when working as a rider.

Federal Labour Court’s decision The Federal Labour Court also ruled in favour of the plaintiff.

It held that the action was admissible because the plaintiff had only received the mobile phone due to his position on the works council and for the duration of such position only.

There was therefore a legal interest in clarifying the question of whether the defendant had to provide him with an appropriate mobile phone specifically for his work as a rider.

The Court also found that the action had merit, arguing that the claim under section 611a(1) German Civil Code included the equipment suitable and essential for the agreed work.

It held that the employee had a legitimate interest in the employer providing the equipment necessary for the work because the employer organised the work processes and assigned the work to be carried out by the employee by way of its right to issue instructions (section 106 German Trade Regulation Act).

The employer was therefore also responsible for ensuring that the employee had the equipment necessary to carry out the contractually agreed work.

In the case in question, this included a smartphone with 2 GB of data volume and a roadworthy bicycle.

The Court pointed out that the employer could not refer the employee to subsequent claims for the reimbursement of expenses, either.

The Court went on to note that the contractual stipulation that the plaintiff had to use his own smartphone was unreasonably disadvantageous within the meaning of section 307(2), no. 1 in conjunction with (1), sentence 1 German Civil Code and was therefore invalid.

The basic idea behind section 611a(1) German Civil Code was that the employer had to provide the employee with essential work equipment."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYERS MUST PROVIDE NECESSARY WORK EQUIPMENT,"The basic idea behind section 611a(1) German Civil Code was that the employer had to provide the employee with essential work equipment.

General terms and conditions that obliged employees to provide the equipment necessary to carry out the agreed work deviated from this basic idea.

The Court also stated that although a clause that was unreasonably disadvantageous in and of itself could be compensated by way of another, significant advantage so that the agreement could on balance be regarded as valid, appropriate compensation for the plaintiff’s use of his own bicycle and mobile phone was neither agreed nor otherwise given in the case in question.

A claim for the reimbursement of expenses by way of the analogous application of section 670 German Civil Code already reflected the applicable legal situation and did not give the plaintiff any additional advantage.

The repair credit granted for the bicycle did not constitute appropriate compensation, the Court pointed out, as the plaintiff could not freely dispose of the money, nor was he free to choose which repair shop to use.

In addition, the amount of the repair credit was not based on the mileage relevant for wear and tear.

Gleiss Lutz comments The fact that employers must provide their employees with equipment that is suitable and essential for the agreed work is nothing new.

The Court’s conclusion that employers have some leeway when selecting the necessary work equipment (in this case a suitable smartphone and the necessary data volume, for example) is however welcome.

The Federal Labour Court’s view that employees can be adequately compensated in their employment contract for having to provide essential work equipment themselves is an interesting development.

This is the first time that the Federal Labour Court has made it clear that a statutory claim for the reimbursement of expenses (in this case, by way of analogous application of section 670 German Civil Code) does not constitute reasonable compensation to employees when employers deviate from statutory provisions on costs.

Provision must instead be made for this in the employee’s contract.

In order to ensure appropriate compensation, the employee must, in particular, be able to freely dispose of the compensation payment and this payment must be directly related to the disadvantage suffered as a result of the employee having to use his or her own work equipment.

Beyond platform work, employers would therefore probably be well advised to compensate their employees for using private equipment (such as a laptop or internet connection), for example when working from home or carrying out mobile work, by paying them an appropriate (lump) sum specified in their employment contracts."
Gleiss Lutz,ELECTRICITY PRICE BRAKE: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"Mirroring caps on gas and heat prices (gas and heat price brake), the German Bundestag passed an electricity price brake on 15 December 2022 to further shield households and businesses from rising energy prices.

The following aims to answer key questions about these measures: What are the legal regulations behind the electricity price brake?

While the relief for gas and heat will be a two-step process, 1) emergency aid in December in the form of the Gas and Heat Emergency Aid Act ( Erdgas-Wärme-Soforthilfegesetz , “EWSG”) and 2) the Gas and Heat Price Brake Act ( Erdgas-Wärme-Preisbremsengesetz , “EWPBG”) , which will apply from March/January 2023, the relief for electricity is to be granted in a single step.

The Electricity Price Brake Act ( Strompreisbremsegesetz , “StromPBG”) , which comes into force in January 2023, will provide the legislative basis.

The relief will apply for the entire year 2023 at least, with the option to extend that period through 30 April 2024.

For companies with especially high electricity consumption, the regulations will be based on the “State aid Temporary Crisis Framework to support the economy in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine” of 28 October 2022 – in particular with regard to the maximum limits on state aid.

Relief will take the form of a basic price quota for electricity consumption, with each withdrawal point being allocated a certain amount of electricity at a reduced price.

Withdrawal points with a consumption of up to 30,000 kWh will receive a quota capped at 40 ct/kWh for 80% of their previous consumption , while those with a consumption of over 30,000 kWh will receive a quota capped at 13 ct/kWh for 70% of their previous consumption.  

Relief payments for January and February 2023 will be made in March 2023 to give electricity providers sufficient time to implement the brake.

Who will benefit from these measures?

The relief will benefit all end consumers – both natural and legal persons – that are supplied with electricity at a withdrawal point either for their own or downstream third-party consumption or, in certain cases, withdraw the electricity without being supplied by a provider.

Specific eligibility depends on the amount of electricity consumed.

For households and small businesses , which typically consume less than 30,000 kWh a year, the price of electricity will be capped at 40 ct/kWh , whereas medium to large businesses whose previous annual consumption generally exceeds this amount will not be required to pay more than 13 ct/kWh .

How will the price brake work?

Electricity providers will deduct the relevant amount of relief from their end consumers’ electricity bill.

If consumers withdraw the electricity without being supplied by a provider, the transmission system operator responsible for the control area must grant the relief.

Consumers will not be required to take any action.

How is the relief calculated?

The monthly relief is calculated by multiplying the basic quota by the difference between a customer’s individual, contractual weighted average kWh price for the overall month and the reference energy price .

The reference energy price is the cap described above: 40 ct/kWh for withdrawal points with a consumption of up to 30,000 kWh of electricity and 13 ct/kWh for those that exceed this amount. 

This reduced rate is granted for a limited basic quota – either 80% or 70% of previous annual consumption – depending on whether the reference energy price of 40 ct/kWh or 13 ct/kWh applies.

Simply put, households and small businesses will pay 40 ct/kWh for 80% of their annual electricity consumption – based on previous years – and the contractually agreed price for the remaining 20%, which will ultimately reduce consumers’ payments .

Larger businesses, on the other hand, will pay 13 ct/kWh for 70% of their previous annual consumption and the contractually agreed price for the remaining 30%.

What framework conditions must be observed?"
Gleiss Lutz,ELECTRICITY PRICE BRAKE: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"What framework conditions must be observed?

Amounts paid can be recovered if it transpires that an end consumer was not eligible to receive them.

However, the StromPBG itself contains a series of restrictions.

For reasons relating to state aid law, no support may be granted if EU sanctions have been imposed on the company or its affiliated persons, organisations or institutions.

The receipt of relief of more than EUR 2 million is linked to a job retention obligation .

After much wrangling, the Bundestag finally also passed a limited ban on bonuses and dividends that will only apply once a relief amount of EUR 25 million has actually been claimed.

Above this threshold, variable compensation components and increases in the fixed salaries paid to members of corporate bodies on or before 31 December 2023 will only be able to be paid if they were agreed before 1 December 2022.

If a relief amount in excess of EUR 50 million is utilised, the payment of variable compensation components and increases in fixed salaries paid to corporate bodies as well as the distribution of dividends is generally excluded until after 31 December 2023.

What are the maximum relief limits?

Finally, it should be noted that for reasons relating to EU state aid law, absolute and relative maximum relief limits will apply under the StromPBG that must not be exceeded overall.

The maximum permissible relief amount includes all state aid for additional costs due to the exceptional increase in energy prices – and therefore also includes relief granted under the gas and heat price brake, for example.

The maximum limit is EUR 4 million (absolute amount) for regular companies, or 50% of crisis-related additional energy costs.

End consumers who are determined by a (federal) audit authority yet to be specified (likely the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle , “BAFA”)) to be particularly affected by high energy prices can receive support of up to EUR 100 million or 40% of crisis-related additional energy costs.

If the audit authority additionally determines that an end consumer is energy intensive , other arrangements apply.

In certain cases, support can total EUR 150 million or 80% of the crisis-related additional energy costs.

There are various obligations to cooperate with and notify suppliers and the audit authority that must be observed; non-adherence to these obligations is subject to fine.

How will the electricity price brake be financed?

The costs of the electricity price brake are to be financed by the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) as well by siphoning off windfall or excessive profits made on electricity markets. 

Excessive profits will be siphoned off as from 1 December 2022 until 30 June 2023, although this could be extended, by ordinance, until 30 April 2024 at the latest.

If the threshold of 1 MW (installed capacity) is exceeded, profits from plants that use renewable energy sources to generate electricity are siphoned off, as are profits from waste incineration plants, nuclear power plants, lignite-fired power plants and plants that recycle refinery residues.

For example, in addition to certain storage facilities, profits from hard coal and natural gas power plants as well as biomethane plants will not be siphoned off.

The surplus revenues will generally be calculated on the basis of spot market prices or energy source-specific monthly market values for wind energy and solar installations, and allow for profits from hedges (on the futures market) and sales from specific installations (especially PPAs) to be taken into account.

Technology-specific revenue caps will apply, with safety margins being introduced to protect plant operators against undue hardship.

90% of the difference between the revenue cap and the calculated surplus revenue amount will then be siphoned off, leaving 10% with the producer to create an incentive for effective market behaviour."
Gleiss Lutz,ELECTRICITY PRICE BRAKE: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"90% of the difference between the revenue cap and the calculated surplus revenue amount will then be siphoned off, leaving 10% with the producer to create an incentive for effective market behaviour.

What legal objections are there to the StromPBG?

From a legal point of view, the current structure of the StromPBG – and especially the mechanism for siphoning off surplus revenues – harbours the risk of violating both EU law and the GG .

There are various potential scenarios that will likely prove hard to reconcile with these laws.

For new contracts at existing plants, in particular, the “surplus revenue” will from 1 November 2022 onwards be calculated based on a fictitious spot benchmark revenue, which is in turn determined using the average spot benchmark price and a cap.

This means that especially operators with PPAs will find revenues being siphoned off that they never actually generated and that become ever higher as the prices on the spot market increase.

Any mechanism for siphoning off revenues must however meet the requirements of EU law, in particular the EU Emergency Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2022/1854), which specifies a cap for “market revenues” that applies to “realised market revenues” only.

The Federal Constitutional Court has also ruled that state levies may not amount to confiscation measures , as this would infringe the fundamental right to property under Article 14(1) GG.

The mechanism for siphoning off surplus revenues could therefore also be unconstitutional in some cases.

In addition to the objections to such a provision under EU and German constitutional law, plant operators using PPAs would increasingly have to choose a price mechanism that is tied to the spot market price.

This would harm green PPAs in particular, as they are unable to offer electricity customers long-term price stability.

Such a mechanism could also distort the European electricity market and would therefore have to be assessed in terms of Article 8(2), letter (d) EU Emergency Regulation as well.

Is additional official information available?

Further information on how the electricity price brake will work and be financed is available in German on the website of the Federal Ministry of Economics (see here , only available in German).

The legislation is available here , only in German).

What changes to the Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz , “EEG”) are set to enter into force together with the electricity price brake?

To accelerate the expansion of green electricity generation, a mechanism has been designed that will oblige property owners to tolerate power lines being laid between green electricity plants and network connection points.

Project developers or plant operators will be required to pay owners a one-time payment of 5% of the market value of the protected strip used.

Feed-in tariffs are to be increased by around 20% for certain plants within the meaning of the EEG – an increase over and above the already-increased figures set out in the EEG 2023, before this has even come into force.

The increase applies to both the maximum bids for plants participating in tenders and the values defined by law as well as the bonus for feeding in all the electricity generated.

Finally, a mechanism will be introduced for green electricity plants that will help the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) restrict tender volume to ensure that tenders at risk of undersubscription are still sufficiently competitive.

This arrangement has been made necessary by European state aid rules intended to ensure that tenders’ subsidy levels are appropriate under state aid law."
Gleiss Lutz,AMENDMENT TO THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES ACT – PROPERTY OWNERS OBLIGED TO TOLERATE CERTAIN MEASURES TO AID THE EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES,"With the bill to amend the Renewable Energies Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, “EEG”), the German Federal Government aims to further accelerate the expansion of renewable energies by requiring parties with property ownership or land use rights to tolerate certain measures.

In future, property owners and land users will be obliged to allow for cabling and grid infrastructure connecting renewable electricity generation installations to the electricity grid to be installed and operated on their property.

During the construction and dismantling phases of onshore wind energy installations, they will also be required to tolerate installations to be swung over the property as well as the siting of ways of access across the property for transporting the installations.

The bill provides for compensation in each case.

Background to the cabling and passage rights The EEG envisages a shift to an electricity supply that is greenhouse-gas neutral .

Electricity from renewable energies is to make up at least 80% of gross electricity consumption by 2030 (section 1(2) EEG).

This requires a much faster expansion of renewable energies – regarded as being in the prevailing public interest (section 2 EEG) – and a quicker connection rate for renewable energy installations (“EEG installations”).

The construction of new EEG installations has been delayed and become more expensive lately.

Project developers and EEG installation operators have indicated that it can be difficult to reach agreement with property owners whose property is needed for cabling or transport measures.

The amendment aims to remedy this situation for installation operators by requiring property owners to tolerate certain measures .

In return, installation operators are to pay a fixed amount of compensation for the loss of a land use opportunity to property owners.

Parties with rights of use of a property are to be treated the same as property owners, i.e. leaseholders, holders of a limited personal easement and others with rights to use and benefit from a property must also tolerate the measures.

Obligations of property owners to tolerate cabling wiring and grid connection infrastructure The “ right to lay cabling ”, granted to the cabling operator in section 11a Amendment to the Renewable Energies Sources Act ( EEG-Novelle , “E-EEG”), obliges property owners to tolerate certain measures.

An operator of cabling for connection of an EEG installation with more than 30 kW installed capacity is entitled to enter and access a property to lay, construct, maintain, repair, protect and operate the cabling .

According to the bill, cabling includes not only power cables but also control and communication cabling.

Technical installations required to connect EEG installations, i.e. in particular transformers, must also be tolerated.

The right holder is the entity that operates the cabling; this may or may not be the same party as the EEG installation operator.

In practice, connection cables are installed and operated either by the connection grid operator – enabling it to expand its grid – or by the EEG installation operator itself.

Where a number of EEG installations of different operators are to be connected to the grid, an infrastructure company is sometimes created to handle the connection; in these cases, the infrastructure company would be the right holder under section 11a E-EEG.

The bill also ensures that cabling does not become an essential part of the property (as defined in section 94(1) Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch )), meaning that the cables remain the property of the cabling operator (section 11a(1), E-EEG).

The property owner must refrain from all measures that endanger or adversely affect the existence or operation of the cabling (section 11a(3), sentence 1 E-EEG).

This includes not building on or introducing deep-rooted plants to the protected strip.

The width of the strip depends on the type of cabling laid."
Gleiss Lutz,AMENDMENT TO THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES ACT – PROPERTY OWNERS OBLIGED TO TOLERATE CERTAIN MEASURES TO AID THE EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES,"This includes not building on or introducing deep-rooted plants to the protected strip.

The width of the strip depends on the type of cabling laid.

Once cabling has been installed, the property owner can only require the cabling operator to relocate it if its location is unreasonable for the property owner.

The cabling operator is responsible for the costs of the relocation (section 11a(3), sentences 2, 3 E-EEG).

The operator must notify the property owner immediately if the cabling is taken out of service permanently .

The property owner must then tolerate the cabling and other installations for another 48 months (section 11a(4) E-EEG), unless it cannot reasonably be expected to do so.

Obligations of property owners in respect of wind energy installations The bill also introduces obligations for property owners and users regarding the construction and dismantling of wind energy installations: property owners must tolerate installations being swung over their property as well as passage of such installations across their property (section 11b(1), sentence 1 E-EEG).

They must also allow improvements to be made to the property prior to passage, which is defined as including any logistical operations during transport, e.g. entry, reloading and transportation-related interim storage .

Once passage is no longer required, the operator must immediately restore the property to its original condition at the operator’s own expense (section 11b (1), sentence 4 E-EEG).

Special cases, exemptions and compensation The two obligations above do not apply in every single case (sections 11a(1), sentence 3, 11b(1), sentence 3 E-EEG).

There is no obligation to tolerate such measures when doing so would unreasonably impair the use of the property.

The bill also exempts properties used for national or Alliance defence purposes, including those used to meet international obligations.

In practice, interpreting the provisions to establish whether impairment is unreasonable will be difficult, and disputes may arise between property owners and the operators of EEG installations or cabling infrastructure.

When property owners and operators are in dispute , injunctions (as defined in section 83(2) EEG) will be used to enforce operator rights.

But this does not relieve operators of their duty to obtain approvals required under other provisions (sections 11a(5), 11b(3) E-EEG, such as requests to Germany’s motorway agency ( Autobahn GmbH ) to permit the transports).

To compensate property owners for their obligation to tolerate cable-laying , operators must pay property owners 5% of the market value of the protected strip along the cable route (section 11a(2), sentence 1 E-EEG).

Making the market value the basis of the calculation is also intended to incentivise cable operators to use low-value properties for cables rather than building land.

The bill also stipulates compensation for tolerating the passage of wind energy installations across a property (section 11b(2), sentence 1, 2 E-EEG); payment must be made to any party that was directly restricted in its use of the property.

Compensation is set at EUR 28 per month and hectare affected.

Property owners do not have a right to compensation if installations are merely swung over their property.

Where property owners tolerate such measures, they will – notwithstanding any compensation – still be entitled to any claims for damages that arise.

These claims could include, for example, damage caused by laying cables or the passage of installations across the property (sections 11a(2), sentence 2, 11b(2), sentence 3 E-EEG).

Summary and outlook The obligations placed on property owners by the E-EEG are a further element in accelerating the expansion of renewable energy installations.

The current draft is complex, however, and will likely be subject to discussion and amendments during the parliamentary process."
Gleiss Lutz,AMENDMENT TO THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES ACT – PROPERTY OWNERS OBLIGED TO TOLERATE CERTAIN MEASURES TO AID THE EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES,"The current draft is complex, however, and will likely be subject to discussion and amendments during the parliamentary process.

The regulatory notion of an “obligation to tolerate” is not alien to German law in principle and can already be found, for example, in regulations governing the expansion of electricity cabling and broadband (section 12 Ordinance on the General Terms and Conditions for Connection to the Grid and its Use for the Supply of Electricity ( Verordnung über Allgemeine Bedingungen für den

Netzanschluss und dessen Nutzung für die Elektrizitätsversorgung in Niederspannung ); section 134 Telecommunications Act ( Telekommunikationsgesetz )).

Should this approach be widely accepted, there may well be changes particularly in connection with the provisions on compensation.

In practice, the use of property for cabling and passage is often a matter of price.

As the draft currently stands, however, the level of compensation would no longer be a matter of negotiation, but would follow directly from the law.

It should be noted that there is no compensation for swinging over property, that compensation for passage requires a party with rights of use of the property to be directly restricted in its use, and that the singular compensation amount of 5% for the construction and operation of cabling is significantly below the current market price.

On the other hand, any evaluation of the level of compensation should take into account that the proposed statutory obligation on the property owner to tolerate the measures would mean that the property would no longer have to be encumbered with an easement."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – COMMISSION’S PROPOSAL FOR THE DATA ACT,"The European Commission published its long-awaited draft regulation on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data (Data Act) at the end of February.

The aim of the Act is to provide a new regulatory framework for the European data economy and promote innovation and competition in this regard. 

This article provides an overview of the regulatory areas covered by the proposal.

Background The EU sees data as a core component of the digital economy and an essential resource to secure the digital transition.

The draft Data Act (hereinafter the “Draft Act”) is a key pillar of the European strategy for data of February 2020 and the second major initiative after the draft Data Governance Act.

There is at present no provision for ownership of or other exclusive rights to data in the EU.

Data protection law only regulates the handling of personal data and this only from the point of view of protecting the data subject’s right to privacy.

Answers to the question of who should be entitled to make commercial use of data can at best be derived indirectly from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws.

Therefore, until now, control over data has been vested in those who had factual access to the data.

In the case of devices connected to the Internet of Things (“IoT products”), this is usually the manufacturer ( see also our article on data pooling between companies ).

According to the EU Commission, this de facto control exercised by device manufacturers impedes fair competition when it comes to aftermarket services for IoT products.

This is because access to data generated by IoT products is essential for the development and provision of such services.

The Data Act now aims to change this.

The aim of the Draft Act is not only to ensure a fairer distribution of data, but also to promote access to and use of data.

The Draft Act does not create “data ownership”, but is instead geared towards making it easier for third parties to gain access to data.

The Draft Act addresses a large number of unresolved issues concerning the industrial use of personal and non-personal data.

In doing so, it deals with the following: Right of users of IoT products to access the data generated by the use of those products or related services Prohibition of “unfair” standard contractual clauses in data use contracts Right of public sector bodies to access data Facilitating switching between data processing services Requirements for interoperability between data processing services In cases where (also) personal data are involved, the Draft Act takes its place alongside the GDPR and other data protection laws and does not restrict their applicability and scope.

Stringent restrictions will therefore continue to apply to the commercial use of personal data even after the Data Act has come into force.

Right to access data generated by the use of products or related services (Articles 3 to 7 Draft Act)

According to Article 4 Draft Act, users who use a product that generates data can demand that the data holder grant them access to the data generated by the use of such product or any related service.

In this context, “data holder” means any legal or natural person who has the ability, through control of the technical design of the product and related services, to make data available.

“User” means any natural or legal person who owns, rents or leases a product or receives a service.

According to the broad definition of “user”, several persons can be considered as having a right to the data, especially in the case of multiple-person scenarios (e.g. car sharing services).

If the user is not at the same time the data subject as defined in data protection law, he or she may only be granted access to personal data if there is a legal basis for this under the GDPR as well (usually consent of the data subject or a contract between data subject and user)."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – COMMISSION’S PROPOSAL FOR THE DATA ACT,"The generated data must be made available without undue delay, free of charge and, where applicable, continuously and in real-time.

Although uninvolved third parties who are not users do not have a direct claim against the data holder for access to the generated data, users may, pursuant to Article 5 Draft Act, authorise such third parties to assert the right of access on their behalf.

This provision expands the existing right of data subjects to “data portability” under Article 20 GDPR, i.e. the right to demand that a controller hand over their personal data to another controller.

This means that the Data Act has enormous potential to open up the market for connected and aftermarket services to new market participants and promote competition.

For example, in the automotive sector third parties could in future access the data generated by connected cars via the cars’ users – data which has to date mainly been available to the manufacturer – and thus offer new services such as new types of insurance plans or repair services.

Third parties may only process the data transmitted by the data holder for the purpose agreed with the user and must delete the data when they are no longer required for that purpose.

This applies to both personal and non-personal data.

Chapter III Draft Act lays down the regulations governing the provision of data by data holders to third parties.

In particular, the data must be made available under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (Article 8 Draft Act).

The exact prerequisites for exercising the data access rights laid down in the Data Act as well as what this means for the economy will be examined in detail in a separate article in this series.

The user’s right of access goes hand in hand with the manufacturer’s obligation to design IoT products in such a manner that data are easily, securely and, where relevant and appropriate, directly accessible to the user (Article 3 Draft Act).

Some changes may be required as a result of this.

Before concluding a contract, customers must also be informed about the data generated by the device, how they may access the data and whether such data will be passed on to third parties.

This means that the obligation to provide information on the collection and processing of personal data, which already exists under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, will be extended to include non-personal data and expanded considerably.

Prohibition of “unfair” contractual terms in standard data licensing agreements with micro, small or medium-sized enterprises (Article 13 Draft Act)

Another key component of the Data Act is the prohibition of “unfair” contractual clauses in standard data licensing agreements with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

This is to ensure that smaller enterprises or start-ups can also develop innovative digital business models through the use of data, avoiding the “take-it-or-leave-it” situations in which such enterprises usually find themselves (recital 52).

Based on the law governing general terms and conditions, Article 13(2) Draft Act stipulates that a standard clause is “unfair” if its use grossly deviates from good commercial practice in data access and use.

In addition, Article 13 Draft Act distinguishes between standard clauses that are always considered unfair (Article 13(3)) and clauses that are presumed unfair (Article 13(4)).

The latter include clauses that allow the party that imposed the term to unilaterally access and use data of the other contracting party in a manner that is significantly detrimental to that party’s legitimate interests.

Similarly, a clause preventing the other contracting party from obtaining a copy of the data contributed or generated by that party during the period of the contract is presumed to be invalid.

The numerous requirements listed in Article 13 Draft Act to be met by contractual clauses may be of considerable importance for existing and future contracts in a data context."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – COMMISSION’S PROPOSAL FOR THE DATA ACT,"The numerous requirements listed in Article 13 Draft Act to be met by contractual clauses may be of considerable importance for existing and future contracts in a data context.

The EU Commission also plans to develop and provide non-binding model contractual terms on data access and use to assist parties in drafting and negotiating contracts (Article 34 Draft Act).

Right of public sector bodies to access and use data in cases of “exceptional need” (Articles 14-22 Draft Act) Moving away from a commercial context, the Data Act also stipulates that data holders must make their data available to a public sector body upon the latter’s request if exceptional need is demonstrated.

According to Article 15 Draft Act, such an exceptional need is deemed to exist where the data is necessary to respond to or prevent a public emergency or where the lack of available data prevents the public sector body from fulfilling a specific task in the public interest.

A further prerequisite for the right of access is that the public sector body was unable to obtain the data by alternative means, for example by purchasing the data on the market or by relying on other statutory provisions under which data can be obtained and there is no longer time to adopt new legislative measures in this regard.

This restricts the scope of application.

If a request is made for personal data to be made available, the public sector body should, according to the recitals of the Draft Act, demonstrate that the requirements under data protection law have also been met.

The Data Act also lays down the prerequisites for asserting and fulfilling this right of access as well as the legal remedies available to a data holder which has received a request for data.

The data holder is generally entitled to compensation for the technical and organisational costs incurred to make the data available.

Micro and small enterprises are to be exempt from the obligation to provide data in such cases.

Facilitating switching between providers of data processing services (Articles 23-26 Draft Act)

The Data Act further aims to facilitate switching between data processing services such as cloud and edge services to counter lock-in effects on this market.

Pursuant to Article 23 Draft Act, providers of data processing services must ensure that their customers can easily switch to another provider of the same service.

In particular, providers of data processing services must remove commercial, technical, contractual and organisational obstacles which inhibit customers from terminating the contract after a maximum notice period of 30 days; concluding a new contract with another provider; porting data, applications and other digital assets to another provider; maintaining functional equivalence with the previous service after switching to another provider.

Article 25 Draft Act bans the imposition of charges for the switching process; this ban is to apply after a transitional period of three years following the entry into force of the Act.

The provisions on facilitating switching may make it necessary for cloud and edge providers to change their business models and may at the same time strengthen competition in this area.

Interoperability requirements (Articles 28-30 Draft Act) Finally, the Data Act also deals with the interoperability of data processing services.

Article 28 Draft Act stipulates that operators of data spaces must fulfil a number of essential requirements (such as making information on the data formats used and the application programming interfaces required for data access publicly available) to facilitate interoperability of data and data sharing mechanisms.

The Commission is also empowered to further specify these essential requirements in legislation, to publish guidelines in this regard and to instruct European standardisation organisations to develop harmonised standards for interoperability."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – COMMISSION’S PROPOSAL FOR THE DATA ACT,"As far as the interoperability of data processing services and smart contracts is concerned, Articles 29 and 30 Draft Act provide for specific aspects to be addressed by future public interoperability specifications.

The aim of the otherwise general provisions in this context is to establish interoperability in various sectors and areas of application of the data economy on the basis of the law.

This could pave the way to unrestrictedly interoperable data services, making it possible to network different services in future and thus develop new types of data services.

Outlook

The response to the Data Act so far already points to a paradigm shift regarding access to and use of data.

The introduction of the Data Act could mean that manufacturers of networked products and providers of data processing services, in particular, will have to make significant changes to their business operations and models.

While the Data Act has not opted to introduce “data ownership”, it has strengthened the user’s power of disposition of the data generated by IoT products, regardless of whether such data are personal data, and at the same time restricted the rights of whoever has de facto control over the data (usually the manufacturer).

Although the Data Act could therefore promote innovation and competition in the data economy, it is not expected to enter into force before 2023."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTS KEY PROPOSALS PAPER ON CANNABIS LEGALISATION,"On 26 October 2022, the German government approved a detailed key proposals paper setting out its plan to legalise the consumption of cannabis for recreational purposes.

According to the paper, cannabis plants, cannabis resin and THC will no longer be classified as prohibited narcotics.

Recreational cannabis, medical cannabis and industrial hemp will no longer fall under the Narcotics Act ( Betäubungsmittelgesetz , “BtMG”) – instead, a new Act will lay down the legal provisions governing their use. 

The plan is now to be examined by the EU Commission, which will assess whether it is compatible with international law.

What the paper covers: I. Quantities and caps The possession and purchase of up to 20 to 30 grams of recreational cannabis is generally to be exempt from punishment for anyone over the age of 18.

In contrast to the key proposals paper leaked a few days ago, the THC content is no longer to be capped.

However, no decision has as yet been made on a THC cap for adults under 21 because of the increased health risks involved.

Such a cap is likely to be difficult to enforce in practice.

Home cultivation of up to three female cannabis plants per adult is to be allowed, provided that children and adolescents have no access to these.

The sale of seeds and seedlings will be regulated.

II.

Distribution structure for recreational cannabis The controlled sale of cannabis is to take place in officially licensed and supervised shops, which must be at least a minimum distance from schools and centres/facilities for children and young persons.

Shops selling recreational cannabis must have the necessary expertise and be able to advise customers appropriately, with each customer being offered a consultation.

Products containing THC are also to be accompanied by a leaflet containing explanatory information, which can also be accessed via a QR code on the packaging.

The possibility of allowing pharmacies to sell recreational cannabis – with the aim of curbing the black market in rural areas – is also being considered, although the paper does not specify that pharmacies must be included.

It is not yet clear whether and to what extent officially licensed shops will be able to sell recreational cannabis to private individuals online or by mail order.

Any online stores must in any event have the same level of security as brick-and-mortar shops.

III.

Licensed producers and distributors to cultivate cannabis in Germany The production, processing, storage, transport and sale of recreational cannabis are to be permitted only if a licensee has obtained a licence from the licensor – a Federal government or Federal state authority – to carry out the activity concerned.

Cannabis for recreational purposes may only be cultivated in Germany, with no provision being made for imports.

However, current production capacities are insufficient, so it is unclear how demand is to be covered without imports, at least during the transitional period until appropriate cultivation facilities have been established.

Licences are to be issued to natural and legal persons who meet the following requirements: Proof of the required reliability (similar to that laid down in trade and industrial law), Proof that the applicant or the person entrusted with the management of the shop has the necessary expertise, Proof that the beneficial owner has been entered in an EU company register, Proof of sufficient financial standing given the scope of the licence applied for.

The licence will be issued for a limited term, but can be renewed more than once upon request.

The licence will also only be issued for a specific quantity.

Recreational cannabis must be protected from unauthorised access by third parties at all stages of the supply chain.

IV.

Packaging and advertising Advertising cannabis for recreational purposes will continue to be prohibited."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTS KEY PROPOSALS PAPER ON CANNABIS LEGALISATION,"IV.

Packaging and advertising Advertising cannabis for recreational purposes will continue to be prohibited.

As with medicinal products, detailed information is to be provided on the packaging and the package insert.

V. Pricing/taxation The key proposals paper does not mention a standard sales price for specific cannabis strains in licensed shops.

It would appear that shops are to set their own prices.

VAT and a consumption tax are to be payable, with the ultimate aim being to achieve a retail price that comes close to the black market price.

The tax is to be levied on the basis of the THC content (x euros per gram of THC).

Vi.

Cannabis use and driving The government will enlist specialist committees to help it to decide whether the THC limit for driving under the influence of cannabis is to be increased.

The paper does not contain any information on this.

Notification procedure and estimated timeframe for liberalisation Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach explained at the press conference on 26 October 2022 that implementation of the key proposals would depend on the outcome of the discussions with the EU Commission.

The key proposals were therefore submitted to the Commission so that it could check them for compliance with EU law as part of an informal consultation process.

The discussion of the plan with the EU Commission is apparently proving to be difficult, as the Commission – despite the different legal situation in the Netherlands in particular – is said to have expressed considerable doubts as to whether the German plan complies with European law.

For this reason, the bill originally announced for the first quarter of 2023 has not yet been finalised.

Press reports maintain that, according to the latest plans, only some of the amendments will be submitted to the Commission, while the others will be implemented solely on the basis of German law.

However, the intent is apparently no longer the comprehensive commercial legalisation of cannabis for recreational use as envisaged in the key proposals paper (at least not for the time being):

In a first step, recreational cannabis will only be offered in certain model regions in individual certified shops, with developments in these regions being evaluated over several years.

Depending on the findings, the Commission would have to be consulted again before comprehensive liberalisation.

Liberalisation in the non-commercial sector will take place without the involvement of the Commission.

Thus, in future, anyone who possesses recreational cannabis for their own use or grows it on their balcony or in their garden will remain exempt from punishment.

A limit of 20 to 30 grams is being discussed.

One new idea – which has already been raised by the Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens in particular – is that “social clubs” could also be established.

These would be non-profit cooperatives formed by recreational cannabis users to grow and distribute cannabis for their own use.

Such cannabis clubs can be found, for example, in Portugal, the Netherlands and Spain.

Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ADOPTS TIGHTER MARKET COMMUNICATION RULES IN SUPPORT OF GREEN TRANSITION,"On 17 January 2024, the European Parliament adopted the Directive on empowering consumers for the green transition (COM(2022) 143).

The Empowering Consumers Directive contains new market communications requirements designed to support the green transition in the EU, particularly by means of unfair competition law.

With the European Council believed to be ready to give its approval, it’s worth taking an advance look at what changes the new Directive contains.

Background The new Empowering Consumers Directive is part of a comprehensive package of measures implementing the European Green Deal, and aims to strengthen the position of consumers – to whom the EU ascribes an active role in accelerating the green transition.

The Empowering Consumers Directive will limit the following practices in particular: Misleading environmental claims (“greenwashing”) Early obsolescence practices (i.e. the premature failure of goods) Unreliable and non-transparent sustainability labels and information tools The EU’s overarching goal is to promote competition in favour of more sustainable products and to reduce negative impact on the environment.

To this end, the role of unfair competition law is to be extended beyond its original function of ensuring undistorted competition to that of an instrument for enforcing political objectives.

Prohibiting misleading claims The Directive introduces strict requirements for environmental claims throughout the EU via the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (“UCP Directive”).

An “environmental claim” means any commercial communications (e.g. advertisement) not mandatory under the law that “states or implies that a product, product category, brand or trader has a positive or zero impact on the environment or is less damaging to the environment than other products, brands or traders, or has improved its impact over time” (Article 2(1), letter (o) Draft UCP Directive) – a very broad scope.

With consumers’ environmental awareness increasing, statements like these are often used as a marketing tool – and would be subject to the new Directive in future.

Generic environmental claims are generally prohibited – that is, without further review of their relevance to a consumer’s decision – if the trader is not able to provide evidence of the excellent environmental performance advertised (Annex I, point 4a Draft UCP Directive).

Such prohibition is a particularly blunt instrument, and will cover many terms used in advertising – including “green”, “natural”, “ecological”, “environmentally friendly”, “climate neutral”, “carbon neutral” and “energy efficient”.

Even using terms such as “conscious” or “responsible” to suggest particular environmental performance is prohibited – alongside advertising environmental performance that bases on offsetting environmental impacts, for example by acquiring emissions credits.

The planned tightening of environmental claims about future environmental performance will likely also have considerable practical impact.

The draft explicitly considers environmental claims made without clear, objective, publicly available and verifiable commitments to be misleading (Article 6(2), letter (d) Draft UCP Directive).

Such commitments must be set out in a detailed and realistic implementation plan that includes measurable and time-bound targets and other relevant elements necessary to support their implementation (for example, the allocation of resources and the regular verification by experts whose findings are made available to consumers).

Similarly strict requirements have previously only applied to advertising the results of independent product testing and to specific products with particular health implications (such as food and therapeutic products) – but even there, no comparable commitments are required for advertising.

The Directive also limits traders’ ability to advertise emissions advantages derived from offsetting."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ADOPTS TIGHTER MARKET COMMUNICATION RULES IN SUPPORT OF GREEN TRANSITION,"The Directive also limits traders’ ability to advertise emissions advantages derived from offsetting.

Traders are to be prohibited from advertising the “neutral, reduced, compensated or positive” impact of a product on the environment that is based on carbon offsetting (Annex I, point 4c Draft UCP Directive).

Carbon offsetting itself will continue to be allowed and traders will be able to continue to advertise it (in image advertising, for example).

However, products that are not carbon neutral across their entire lifecycles cannot be advertised as such.

The Directive also contains further additions and clarifications to the prohibition of misleading information: It emphasises individual aspects (“environmental and social impact”, “durability”, “reparability”, “reusability” and “recyclability”) as characteristics of potentially misleading business practices (Article 6(1) Draft UCP Directive).

However, this amendment contains few changes for Germany, as section 5 Unfair Competition Act ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb , “UWG”) is already worded broadly enough to cover these aspects.

Advertising a product’s adherence to statutory requirements that apply to all products in the category concerned is generally prohibited.

This is essentially advertising with self-evident facts, which German law already prohibits; European law also already contains individual prohibitions in specific areas (for example, Article 7(1), letter (c) Food Information Regulation for food).

The UCP Directive is now set to include advertising with self-evident facts as a generally prohibited business practice (Annex 1, paragraph 3, point 10a Draft UCP Directive).

Where advertising a product’s benefits does not meet statutory requirements, but does correspond to common practice in the relevant market, that advertising is also prohibited – but only if it could impact consumer decisions (Article 6(2), letter (b) Draft UCP Directive).

Environmental claims cannot be made about the entire product or the trader’s business when they actually concern only a certain aspect of the product or business (Annex I, paragraph 2, point 4b Draft UCP Directive).

Measures against early obsolescence The EU wants to restrict practices where products are intentionally designed to have a limited lifespan (early obsolescence) –

practices that would be detrimental to the consumer and have an overall negative impact on the environment in the form of increased material waste and increased energy and material consumption.

The Directive’s measures against early obsolescence include the following: Traders must not induce consumers to replace or replenish the consumables of a good earlier than is necessary for technical reasons (Annex I, paragraph 4, point 23i Draft UCP Directive).

As an example, the Directive cites the practice of asking users of printers to purchase new ink cartridges before the old cartridges are actually empty.

This provision conflicts with the consumer’s interest in being notified in good time about the need for a new ink cartridge.

Traders must provide information about the negative impacts of a software update on the use of goods with digital elements or certain features of those goods (Annex I, paragraph 4, point 23d Draft UCP Directive).

That obligation also applies if the software update improves other functions.

Software updates must not be presented as necessary if they only enhance functionality (Annex I, point 23e Draft UCP Directive).

These requirements raise difficult practical issues, such as how specific the information must be when describing the product’s technical functionalities and how they would (potentially) be impaired by the software update.

Introducing a feature that limits the durability of a good is generally prohibited (Annex I, point 23f Draft UCP Directive).

As an example, the Directive cites software that limits the good’s functionality to a certain period of time."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ADOPTS TIGHTER MARKET COMMUNICATION RULES IN SUPPORT OF GREEN TRANSITION,"As an example, the Directive cites software that limits the good’s functionality to a certain period of time.

Falsely claiming that a good has a certain durability or reparability (Annex I, point 23g and point 23h Draft UCP Directive) is also generally prohibited.

This creates an additional instrument for enforcing the durability and reparability requirements for goods under EU product law.

Traders must neither make false claims about the impairment of the functionality of a product when consumables, spare parts or accessories not supplied by the original producer are used, nor withhold information about such impairment (Annex I, point 23j Draft UCP Directive).

This intended to prevent superfluous products and thus superfluous flows of goods and repairs, and may restrict OEMs’ ability to recommend the use of original spare parts and accessories.

Restricting the use of sustainability labels Sustainability labels evoke positive associations about the ecological and/or social aspects of a product, process or company.

There are already a large number of different sustainability labels issued by various organisations and public authorities.

The certifications differ considerably in terms of requirements and subject matter.

The directive aims to authorise such seals only on the basis of strict criteria and after review by an independent body.

In future, a sustainability label may only be affixed if it is based on a certification system or has been established by public authorities (Annex I, point 2a Draft UCP Directive).

The certification scheme requires an independent third-party verification scheme, which is defined in more detail in the Directive (Article 2, letter (s) Draft UCP Directive).

Self-certification is prohibited.

This does not cover any mandatory labels required in accordance with EU or national law.

Additional information requirements The Directive is intended to help consumers make better informed decisions and stimulate the demand for, and the supply of, more durable goods.

Only informed consumers can play their part in promoting the EU’s green transition.

To this end, further information requirements are to be incorporated in both unfair competition law and general contract law: The Directive introduces stricter information requirements for providers of product comparisons that inform consumers about environmental and social impact, durability, reparability, reusability or recyclability.

They must also inform consumers about the method of comparison, the products compared and the suppliers of such products, and the measures employed to keep information up to date (Article 7(7) Draft UCP Directive).

Whereas German law already stipulates that consumers and other market participants must be provided with all essential information about a service offered (section 5b(1), no. 1 UWG), this requirement is now being further amended to include certain additional information.

In general contract law, the pre-contractual information requirements are extended to include information on the durability, reparability and availability of software updates (Articles 2, 5(1), 6(1) and 8(2)

Directive 2011/83/EU).

The European Commission is to develop a harmonised notice and a harmonised label.

In future, retailers will have to inform consumers about the availability of environmentally friendly delivery options, among other things.

However, they may only describe the delivery option as “environmentally friendly” if they can provide the requisite evidence for this generic environmental claim.

Outlook

If the European Council adopts the draft – as currently expected – the Directive will likely enter into force in spring 2024.

Member States then have two years to transpose the new requirements into national law."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ADOPTS TIGHTER MARKET COMMUNICATION RULES IN SUPPORT OF GREEN TRANSITION,"Member States then have two years to transpose the new requirements into national law.

At the same time, the EU is currently working on a directive on environmental claims ( Green Claims Directive ), which also aims to strengthen the role of consumers in accelerating the green transition and establishing green markets in the EU.

This will involve creating a complex system for assessing and reviewing explicit environmental claims.

The Green Claims Directive also contains extensive information requirements in the case of explicit environmental claims.

The two directives would generally apply side by side, with companies often having to meet the requirements of both.

The approval of an environmental claim under the Green Claims Directive’s assessment regime and the provision of the requisite information does not exempt businesses from complying with the aforementioned prohibitions on misleading statements under the Empowering Consumers Directive.

If the provisions of the two directives conflict, precedence is to be granted to the Green Claims Directive as the narrower norm (principle of lex specialis ).

The Green Claims Directive deals with “explicit environmental claims”, i.e. green claims that are in textual form or contained in an environmental label (Article 2, point (2) Draft Green Claims Directive).

By this definition, “explicit” environmental claims could include claims that are implicit.

In practice, the text form requirement is likely to merely exclude audio-only messages (for example on the radio) and videos without readable text on social media platforms such as YouTube and TikTok.

The European Commission did not choose the obvious route of a harmonised directive – apparently due to diverging responsibilities – and it remains to be seen how the directives will actually be implemented in Germany.

It is generally questionable whether such far-reaching restrictions on commercial communications about the environmental impact of products and services will really help promote the Green Deal as envisaged by the Commission.

Either way, companies will in future face complex requirements when they provide information on the environmental impact of their products – something that they will be legally obliged to do in future under these the directives and national transposition acts.

Companies should ensure they are ready for the new requirements."
Gleiss Lutz,Cannabis legalisation in Germany: What will change in the medical sector?,"After lengthy discussions, the Cannabis Act ( Cannabisgesetz , “CanG”) was approved by Germany’s Federal Council ( Bundesrat ) on 22 March 2024, with most of its provisions coming into force on 1 April 2024.

Not only does the Act partially legalise recreational cannabis, it also signifies important changes in the area of medical cannabis.

The two most important new features of the Medical Cannabis Act ( Medizinal-Cannabisgesetz , “MedCanG”) are as follows: The cultivation and distribution of medicinal cannabis are now regulated by a purely authorisation-based procedure rather than an award-based one, as previously.

The days of centralised purchasing by the Cannabis Agency are over.

Medicinal cannabis is being removed from the Narcotics Act ( Betäubungsmittelgesetz, “BtMG”) and will therefore be subject to fewer bureaucratic requirements.

This will present producers, doctors, pharmacies and patients with a number of new opportunities and challenges, which we take a look at in this article.

Cultivation of medicinal cannabis made easier Previously, commercial medicinal cannabis growers had to navigate an extensive and legally uncertain award procedure to obtain a licence from the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstituts für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte , “BfArM”).

The Cannabis Agency at the BfArM purchased the medical cannabis centrally from the producers who had been awarded the contract.

This time-consuming procedure was repeatedly challenged in court and in some cases delayed the supply of high-quality cannabis to patients.

The new law replaces the award procedure with a purely authorisation-based procedure that reduces the barriers to market-based cultivation in Germany and is likely to create equal opportunities for German growers when it comes to competing internationally.

To obtain a licence, growers must submit the necessary documents to the BfArM and prove that they meet the requirements for cultivating, producing, trading, importing, exporting, supplying, selling, otherwise placing on the market, procuring or acquiring medicinal cannabis for medical or scientific purposes.  

The Act clarifies the specific terms of the licence and sets out which documents must be submitted with the application.

Medicinal cannabis to be removed from Narcotics Act Another relevant change stems from the removal of medicinal cannabis from the BtMG.

This change affects doctors and pharmacies in particular and ensures that some of the effort involved in handling cannabis is eliminated.

Narcotics documentation and storage in a safe are no longer necessary.

Also, a normal doctor’s prescription – instead of a special narcotics prescription – will now suffice.

In future, medical cannabis will be treated like any other prescription medicine.

The Federal Government estimates that time savings of five minutes per prescription are realistic.

Extrapolating from this, pharmacies throughout Germany could save a total of over two million euros a year in staffing costs.

Removing medicinal cannabis from the BtMG will also make things easier for patients, as they will have fewer obstacles to overcome when obtaining a prescription for and picking up medicinal cannabis.

Pharmaceutical quality of medicinal cannabis guaranteed Medicinal cannabis still has to meet the same quality standards as other herbal medicinal products.

These include the requirements of “Good Agricultural and Collection Practice” (GACP), “Good Manufacturing Practice” (GMP) and the corresponding monographs from the German Pharmacopoeia ( Deutsches Arzneibuch ).

The purpose of these requirements is to guarantee the safety, efficacy and purity of medicinal cannabis and to enable product traceability.

New requirements for recreational cannabis The Act also lays down the requirements for the partial legalisation of recreational cannabis."
Gleiss Lutz,Cannabis legalisation in Germany: What will change in the medical sector?,"New requirements for recreational cannabis The Act also lays down the requirements for the partial legalisation of recreational cannabis.

Adults aged 18 and over are allowed to possess up to 25 grams of cannabis in public spaces and up to 50 grams in their residence.

In addition, up to three cannabis plants may be grown per adult per household, whereby the cannabis harvested may only be used for personal consumption and may not be distributed.

Private cultivation associations (“cannabis clubs”) with a maximum of 500 members (who are at least 18 years old and resident in Germany) will be allowed to grow cannabis for recreational purposes, but cannabis grown there may only be distributed to members for their own consumption – there must be no intention to make a profit.

Operating a cultivation association will require an official licence and be subject to monitoring by the competent state authorities.

The provisions governing cultivation associations will not enter into force until 1 July 2024.

According to recent press reports, the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture ( Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft ) is expected to issue an ordinance before the end of this legislative period that will contain further liberalisation, including the commercialisation of recreational cannabis (“coffee shops”) within the framework of regionally limited model projects.

While the details have not yet been made public, it remains doubtful that this step will be able to dispel concerns under EU and international law about the commercial legalisation of recreational cannabis.

You can also find information on the legal hurdles in our article of 24 August .

Conclusion The partial legalisation of cannabis also entails significant changes to the area of medical cannabis that are intended to make it easier to cultivate, sell, prescribe and obtain medical cannabis and to ensure its quality.

This will result in a number of new opportunities and challenges for producers, doctors, pharmacies and patients."
Gleiss Lutz,DEADLINE FOR TERMINATING EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS IN COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"In the context of compliance investigations, the Federal Labour Court has ruled that the two-week period during which an employee relationship can be terminated under section 626(2) Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, “BGB”) generally only begins to run when a final or interim report prepared by a compliance department is forwarded to the departments in the company authorised to give notice.

Federal Labour Court, judgment of 5 May 2022 – 2 AZR 483/21

Background The plaintiff was an employee of the defendant for many years.

The defendant is a defence company that was awarded numerous contracts by the Federal Ministry of Defence (Bundesverteidigungsministerium).

The defendant’s compliance department received a tip-off in July 2018 that employees of the company were in possession of confidential documents from the Federal Ministry of Defence.

In October 2018, the compliance department engaged a law firm to investigate the matter.

An interim report – which incriminated 88 persons in addition to the plaintiff – was prepared by the law firm and handed over to the defendant’s management on 16 September 2019.

After consulting the works council, the defendant terminated the plaintiff’s employment relationship without notice by letter dated 27 September 2019.

The plaintiff successfully argued before both the labour court and the higher labour court that the defendant had not complied with the two-week deadline under section 626(2) BGB since the compliance department had already been aware of the allegations against him for several months.

Federal Labour Court’s decision The Federal Labour Court ruled that the two-week period did not start until the managing directors authorised to give notice became aware of the reason for termination.

The Court pointed out that when the compliance team or the head of the compliance department became aware of the circumstances was irrelevant, as they were not authorised to give notice.

It stated that the two-week period could be considered triggered only by way of exception by the earlier knowledge of an unauthorised person if the forwarding of the information to the person authorised to give notice was delayed on purpose or at least due to an inappropriate and superfluous organisational risk created by the employer which impeded the flow of information.

In such cases, the employer was, according to the principle of good faith, precluded from relying on the two-week period having been observed.

However, the Court further stated that such an organisational failing did not result from the appointment of a supervisor who was not authorised to give notice, or from the establishment of a compliance department to handle internal investigations.

In addition, the person not authorised to give notice had to occupy such a prominent position and function in the company that he or she was actually and legally in a position to investigate the matter so comprehensively that the person authorised to give notice could make his or her decision solely on the basis of these findings.

It was essentially up to the employee to demonstrate and prove that there were circumstances establishing a breach of trust.

The Court stated that the employer’s decision as to whether it could be reasonably expected to continue the employment relationship was based not only on the finding that there had been an objective breach of duty, but also on its knowledge of the extent to which the employees in question were involved and their respective roles in the company.

It was only the interim report that contained all the facts that allowed such a decision to be made.

The Federal Labour Court referred the case back to the Higher Labour Court for further clarification of the facts.

Our assessment In order to avoid premature decisions being made on the termination of employment relationships, time-consuming investigations are needed to clarify complex compliance-related situations."
Gleiss Lutz,DEADLINE FOR TERMINATING EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS IN COMPLIANCE INVESTIGATIONS,"The Federal Labour Court has therefore rightly found that the time at which a person not authorised to give notice becomes aware of circumstances justifying termination can only be used as the start of the two-week period in exceptional cases.

This should give employers much-needed certainty when it comes to having their own compliance departments carry out internal investigations.

From a practical point of view, the decision clarifies two key points: Firstly, the right of termination under section 626 BGB is not forfeited even in the case of a protracted compliance investigation directed against a large number of potentially affected persons.

And secondly, it is generally left up to the compliance department to decide when the investigations are deemed completed and the management or other persons authorised to give notice are informed.

However, the Federal Labour Court has made it clear that the employer may not drag out compliance investigations at will.

It should in particular be possible to have the two-week period start earlier if the investigations are solely aimed at preventing violations."
Gleiss Lutz,GOING CONCERN FORECAST PERIOD UNDER INSOLVENCY LAW BACK TO TWELVE MONTHS AS FROM 1 SEPTEMBER 2023,"When examining whether a company is overindebted and consequently has to file for insolvency, the forecast period for which the company must prepare a liquidity plan plays an essential role. 

As from 1 September, directors who prepare such a liquidity plan (or have such a plan prepared) should – as a precaution – once again use a forecast period of twelve months to protect themselves from liability risks.

A number of other deadlines will also be changing, as the exemptions added to the Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung, “InsO”) and the Corporate Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework Act (Gesetz über die Stabilisierung und Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen, “StaRUG”) by the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate the Consequences of Crisis (Sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtliches Krisenfolgenabmilderungsgesetz, “SanInsKG”) expire on 31 December 2023.

This already affects going concern forecasts that extend beyond 2023.

1.

Current exemptions and transitional provisions relating to the going concern forecast expire on 31 December 2023

The legislator responded to the even greater economic challenges faced by many businesses in 2022 as a result of disrupted supply chains and (greatly) increased prices due to the Ukraine conflict by amending the SanInsKG (formerly the COVID-19 Insolvency Suspension Act (COVID-19-Insolvenzaussetzungsgesetz, “COVInsAG”)).

These amendments included: shortening the going concern forecast period pursuant to section 19(2), sentence 1 InsO from twelve to four months and shortening the period required for self-administration and restructuring plans from six to four months in each case.

According to section 4(2) SanInsKG, these transitional provisions apply from 9 November 2022 to 31 December 2023.

Although neither the wording of the provisions nor the explanatory memorandum clearly indicates whether the provisions also apply to forecast or planning periods that commence before 31 December 2023 but extend beyond the end of the year, the explanatory memorandum does assume that the expiry of the transitional provisions will have “a certain advance effect”.

However, whether this is correct and what this will actually involve is hotly debated in the legal literature.

2. Advance effect of termination of transitional provisions should be taken into account as a precaution Given that the legal situation is anything but clear-cut, it makes sense to go back to using a period of at least twelve months as a basis for the going concern forecast from as early as 1 September 2023 .

The length of the forecast period can make a difference when determining whether a company is overindebted and therefore insolvent.

If this is the case, the directors of the company concerned must file for insolvency without undue delay.

If they fail to do so or delay filing the petition, they expose themselves to claims for damages and possibly even the risk of criminal liability.

The risk of using too short a forecast period of four months when assessing whether a company is overindebted – and of liability claims being asserted against the directors because of this – should be avoided at all costs.

Ultimately, the same must – as a precaution – also apply to financial plans drawn up as part of an application for self-administration or a stabilisation order under the StaRUG.

Although it is true that different risks are associated with planning periods that may be too short and that, according to the explanatory memorandum, any advance effect relates exclusively to the going concern forecast under section 19(2), sentence 1 InsO, it is only prudent to start using the original planning period (of six months) again from 1 September 2023 onwards."
Gleiss Lutz,GOING CONCERN FORECAST PERIOD UNDER INSOLVENCY LAW BACK TO TWELVE MONTHS AS FROM 1 SEPTEMBER 2023,"3. Eight-week maximum period for filing for insolvency to remain in place for now There is also the question of when the current eight-week maximum period for filing an insolvency petition will cease to apply, i.e. when will directors have to observe a six-week period again.

Since the obligation to act only arises at the end of the period, there are good arguments for assuming that such an advance effect cannot arise before midnight on 31 December 2023.

But there are already legal commentators who argue that the six-week period should be applied before the end of the year to all cases where an eight-week period would expire after 31 December 2023.

This would mean that an insolvency petition due to overindebtedness would already have to be filed within six weeks in all cases where the filing period would start running from 6 November 2023 onwards (e.g. on 18 November 2023).

While it would be helpful if the legislator could clarify this point, this will in many cases be irrelevant, since directors generally do not wait until the end of the period to file.

4. Conclusion As a precaution, directors should return to using the old statutory forecast period of twelve months as a basis for going concern forecasts as from 1 September 2023 to avoid being held personally liable."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S PROPOSED DIRECTIVE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY DUE DILIGENCE,"On 23 February 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence.

The proposed directive provides for new European-level due diligence obligations for companies’ global value chains, tightening the existing requirements under the already-adopted German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz , “LkSG”) in a number of areas.

That means that the proposed directive will apply to a significantly wider range of companies: It requires full compliance with due diligence obligations at indirect supplier level, creates a new basis for civil liability for breach of due diligence obligations, and extends the list of protected objects.

Compared to the LkSG, the proposed directive contains significant additions in the following areas in particular:

1. Concept and scope of the value chain With regard to indirect suppliers , the LkSG provides for significantly reduced due diligence, applying the duty standard to the company’s own business and direct suppliers only when there is “substantiated knowledge” of a violation.

The proposed directive goes further : The value chain is defined as all activities related to the production of goods or the provision of services by a company, including the development of the product or the service and the use and disposal of the product as well as the related activities of upstream and downstream established business relationships of the company.

The due diligence obligations relate to the company’s own business activities, “controlled” subsidiaries, and direct and indirect contractors in the value chain with which the company has an established business relationship.

The extent to which the business relationship is classified as established must be assessed periodically, at least annually.

2. Scope of application Unlike the LkSG, the proposed directive does not apply to all companies irrespective of their legal form .

The proposed directive applies to companies that fall under its definition of company, particularly the explicitly specified legal forms and regulated financial undertakings: The legal forms of company covered vary depending on whether the company is incorporated under the laws of a Member State or a third country.

For Member State companies, a narrower definition applies, comprising corporations – in Germany, the Aktiengesellschaft (stock corporation), Kommanditgesellschaft (partnership limited by shares), and Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (limited company).

If the company is established under the laws of a third country, a different definition of company applies; in Germany, this definition covers the partnerships offene Handelsgesellschaft (general partnership) and Kommanditgesellschaft (limited partnership).

The LkSG applies to companies with at least 3,000 employees or 1,000 domestic employees irrespective of their turnover.

The proposed directive, however, significantly lowers these employee thresholds, but also incorporates cumulative turnover thresholds.

The proposed directive applies to companies established under the laws of a Member State if: They have more than 500 employees globally and net turnover of more than EUR 150 million ( Group 1 ) or more than 250 employees and global net turnover of more than EUR 40 million , of which at least 50% is generated in the textiles , agriculture, or minerals sectors ( Group 2 ).

Companies established under the laws of a third country that meet the Group 1 or Group 2 turnover thresholds are also covered as Group 3 .

The European Commission expects that the proposed directive will directly apply to around 13,000 companies in the EU and around 4,000 outside the EU.

It may also apply indirectly to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises below the thresholds."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S PROPOSED DIRECTIVE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY DUE DILIGENCE,"It may also apply indirectly to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises below the thresholds.

3. Due diligence required In many respects, the proposed directive is more differentiated than the LkSG in terms of implementing due diligence and narrows companies’ implementation discretion: Companies’ policies : Companies to which the proposed directive apply must integrate due diligence into their policies.

This includes writing a strategy for meeting the due diligence requirements and updating it annually.

The strategy must contain a description of the company’s approach, a code of conduct, and a description of both the processes implemented under the code of conduct and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the code of conduct internally and externally.

This goes further than the policy statement required by the LkSG.

Identify adverse impacts: Companies must identify actual and potential adverse environmental and human rights impacts.

The annex to the proposed directive lists the protected objects to be taken into account in more detail.

That list extends beyond the objects protected by the LkSG.

Companies in Group 2 and Group 3 only need to identify serious adverse impacts.

Prevent potential adverse impacts : Companies must prevent – or at least mitigate – adverse environmental and human rights impacts.

In particular, they must develop a prevention action plan with clearly defined timelines; this is also conceivable with indirect business partners.

In addition to a clearly defined timelines, the plan must also include meaningful indicators.

Direct business partners must contractually commit to companies’ codes of conduct, their plans for preventive measures, and to seeking corresponding contractual assurances in turn from their partners.

If necessary, companies must refrain from extending or temporarily suspend the relationship with the partner in question or terminate the business relationship with respect to the activities concerned if the potential adverse impact is severe.

End actual adverse impacts : Companies must bring to an end or minimise adverse impacts.

If necessary, persons affected must also be financially compensated.

Furthermore, a remediation mechanism with clearly defined timelines for action and indicators to measure improvements must be established; this is also conceivable for indirect business partners.

The aforementioned obligations of business partners as well as the measures for affected business relationships also apply here.

Complaints procedure : Companies must establish a complaints procedure that covers the entire value chain.

Access to the procedure must be provided to: a) persons who are affected or have reasonable grounds to believe that they might be affected, b) trade unions and other workers’ representatives representing individuals working in the value chain concerned, and c) civil society organisations active in the areas related to the value chain concerned.

Companies must also establish a procedure for dealing with complaints, and inform the relevant workers and trade unions of this procedure.

The complainant is entitled to request appropriate follow-up on the complaint and a right to meet with company representatives to discuss severe adverse impacts.

Monitoring : Companies must monitor the effectiveness of the due diligence policy and measures.

The effectiveness of the measures within the value chain must be assessed both annually and on an ad hoc basis using appropriate indicators.

The due diligence requirements are then updated based on the results of this assessment.

Communication : Companies must communicate publicly on their due diligence.

In particular, this includes publishing a statement on their website by 30 April each year.

The publication must report on the matters covered by the directive and relate to the previous calendar year."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S PROPOSED DIRECTIVE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY DUE DILIGENCE,"The publication must report on the matters covered by the directive and relate to the previous calendar year.

Authorised representative : Companies must designate a person authorised to receive notifications from the supervisory authorities.

The authorised representative must be provided with the necessary powers and resources to cooperate with the supervisory authorities.

This builds on the tasks of the human rights officer under the LkSG.

The European Commission’s proposal provides for further obligations for companies depending on their categorisation.

Group 1 companies and Group 3 companies that meet the Group 1 turnover thresholds need to have a plan to ensure that their business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with limiting global warming to 1.5°C in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

The fulfilment of this duty shall be reflected in a variable remuneration of the companies’ directors.

The proposal also explicitly requires directors of Group 1 and Group 2 companies to set up and oversee the implementation of due diligence.

The duty of directors to act in the best interests of the company is expanded to include consideration of the impact on sustainability concerns.

The EU Commission is expected to publish sector-specific guidance on due diligence compliance.

4. Sanctions and civil liability The proposed directive provides for turnover-based fines , with the amount of the sanction and the competent national authority still to be designated by the Member States.

Cooperation with the authorities as well as companies’ own remediation of adverse impacts will have a positive affect on possible sanctions.

Companies sanctioned may be banned from accessing state aid.

The LkSG does not create a new basis for civil liability for the breach of due diligence obligations , but it explicitly leaves any liability established independently of the LkSG unaffected.

The proposed directive, on the other hand, explicitly provides for civil liability for due diligence violations to prevent potential or bring to end actual adverse impacts.

Liability is not limited to the company’s own violations; it is also conceivable in the case of violations by subsidiaries and suppliers.

This requires that non-compliance with the designated due diligence obligations causes adverse human rights and environmental impacts which, had due diligence been exercised, should have been identified, avoided, mitigated, brought to an end or reduced in severity, and this results in damage.

In this context, a weakened liability standard applies to indirect business partners where the obligations regarding the contractual implementation of due diligence have been fulfilled.

However, this does not apply if it was unreasonable to assume that the measures were appropriate.

This new civil liability provision still needs to be transposed into national law by the Member States.

When the directive is implemented by the Member States, this liability is also to be mandatory in cases where the law applicable to corresponding claims is that of a third country.

5.

Timeframe and outlook The European Parliament and the Council have yet to approve the European Union’s proposal.

Member States have two years to implement the directive after it has been adopted.

Once adopted, the directive will apply directly to Group 1 and Group 3 companies that meet the Group 1 turnover threshold .

A further two years later rules will start to apply to Group 2 and Group 3 companies that meet the Group 2 turnover threshold.

Further European-level regulations have already been announced.

In the wake of this, a legislative proposal by the EU Commission to promote decent work and sustainable recovery worldwide is in the works, but the wording has not yet been published."
Gleiss Lutz,"THE GREEN DEAL AND EU STATE AID LEGISLATION: NEW COMMISSION GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY","Shortly before Christmas, on 21 December 2021, the European Commission published its new Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy 2022 (‘CEEAG’).

The College of Commissioners has approved the new guidelines and they are expected to be formally adopted before the end of January.

The long-awaited CEEAG and their annexes are initially only available in English.

Though official adoption of the document is therefore still pending, Member States and potential aid recipients would be well advised to take a closer look at the main new elements and possible effects on the way State aid is granted in future.

CEEAG vs. EEAG: structural changes As already discussed in our earlier article , the CEEAG bring with them many changes as compared to the previous Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (‘ EEAG ’).

The main body of the CEEAG is now 111 pages long, making it far longer than its predecessor.

The Commission has also introduced several new categories of aid into the CEEAG, including aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions (4.1), aid for clean mobility (4.3), and aid for resource efficiency and for supporting the transition towards a circular economy (4.4).

In addition, there are special provisions for energy-intensive users (4.11) and a new category of aid has been created for the closure of power plants (that burn coal, peat or oil shale) and also of mining operations (for coal, peat or oil shale) (4.12).

The CEEAG specifically do not apply to State aid for nuclear energy (point 13 (d)).

Structure-wise, the CEEAG are at least similar to the EEAG in that they still have a general section preceding the sections dealing with the individual aid categories.

This general section applies to all categories of aid unless the general criteria are narrowed down, amended or declared inapplicable in the more specific sections.

The CEEAG no longer contain any aid categories that are to be assessed solely on the basis of the general criteria, however.

The general criteria There are already signs in the general section of an increasing trend towards the grant of aid on the basis of competitive bidding processes (point 49).

While the Commission states that, as a general principle, the criterion will be the net extra cost (funding gap) necessary to meet the objective of the aid measure, which is to be determined by means of counterfactual analysis (point 48), this will not be required if aid is granted on the basis of a competitive bidding process that meets the requirements set out in point 49.

In certain cases, where a competitive bidding process is not used and future developments in costs and revenues are surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty and there is a strong asymmetry of information, the Commission now also explicitly points to the possibility of compensation models.

These models can consist of a mix of ex ante and ex post criteria, a claw-back mechanism or a cost monitoring mechanism (point 55).

It is also interesting to note that the strict thresholds for individual notifications to the Commission – as they were still referred to in Recital 20 EEAG and which, in the absence of a competitive bidding process, could lead to an individual notification being mandatory despite an aid scheme having been approved – are no longer to be found in the CEEAG. 

However, the CEEAG contain a general provision allowing the Commission to take into account “further factors” to determine the overall balance of certain categories of aid schemes in certain cases (point 76).

Here the Commission explicitly mentions the possibility of ex post evaluation or, in the absence of a competitive bidding process, of individually notifying support projects of a certain size or presenting certain characteristics, and a requirement that aid measures be subject to a time limitation."
Gleiss Lutz,"THE GREEN DEAL AND EU STATE AID LEGISLATION: NEW COMMISSION GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY","This means that aid schemes may be subject to an ex post evaluation even if they have already been approved by the Commission (see also point 455

et seq.

in section 5).

The Commission refers in particular to schemes with large aid budgets (more than EUR 150 million in a year or EUR 750 million over the total duration of the scheme).

However, an ex post evaluation is also conceivable in other cases (e.g. aid schemes with new features).

Member States must also submit an evaluation plan to the Commission.

The Commission can approve aid schemes on the basis of the CEEAG for a maximum period of 10 years (point 70).

The new CEEAG requirements are to apply to aid schemes and individual aid (whether they are based on an aid scheme or granted ad hoc) (point 18).

New is also the explicit mention that measures may not entail a violation of relevant Union law (point 33).

This comes as a consequence of recent case law.

The aid categories of the CEEAG – in particular aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions Section 4.1 (Aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions including through support for renewable energy) represents a significant new element.

This section covers aid measures for promoting energy from renewable sources (including aid for the production of renewable energy or synthetic fuels produced using renewable energy) and aid measures involving a wide range of other technologies primarily aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (point 78).

Alongside already familiar technologies such as carbon capture and storage , for example, section 4.1 now also includes carbon capture and use (point 83) as well as aid to support electrification using renewable electricity and/or low-carbon electricity and hence, explicitly, also support for industrial processes (point 88).

The Commission is making it clear that a range of different instruments can be used.

In addition to the possibility of grants, it explicitly refers to so-called contracts for difference, which can also take the form of what are known as carbon contracts for difference.

Operating aid is now explicitly mentioned as well (point 121).

One main change, which was already included in the draft version, is the new requirement for Member States to carry out a public consultation prior to notification (point 98 et seq.).

Depending on the amount of annual aid, this may take a minimum of four weeks or a minimum of six weeks.

The results of such a consultation process must also be published.

Exceptions to the mandatory public consultation process appear to be possible, however, under certain (stringent) conditions (see in particular point 100).

The Commission has now also clarified in the CEEAG that this section will only apply from 1 July 2023 (point 98).

The Commission also seems to assume that aid on the basis of section 4.1 should generally be granted through a competitive bidding process (point 103).

The bidding processes should, in principle, be open to all eligible beneficiaries (point 104).

Exceptions to the generally open nature of the bidding processes as well as to the requirement of a competitive bidding process per se are possible.

The exceptions to the latter requirement – of a competitive bidding process – concern specific smaller projects or cases where there is insufficient supply to ensure competition (point 107).

For potential aid recipients, this means that in future they must apply for aid in an open, transparent, non-discriminatory and ‘clear’ process in competition with other undertakings.

As already explained above, the CEEAG appear to no longer provide for an individual notification obligation for aid in excess of a particular amount despite an approved underlying aid scheme."
Gleiss Lutz,"THE GREEN DEAL AND EU STATE AID LEGISLATION: NEW COMMISSION GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY","As already explained above, the CEEAG appear to no longer provide for an individual notification obligation for aid in excess of a particular amount despite an approved underlying aid scheme.

For section 4.1, this is clarified insofar as an individual notification obligation (or some other measure mentioned in point 76) is only to be ordered in cases where measures are particularly novel or complex or the Commission identifies risks of additional competition distortions (point 131).

Other CEEAG aid categories – a brief description Section 4 of the CEEAG sets out many more categories of aid: Aid for the improvement of the energy and environmental performance of buildings (4.2): This primarily concerns aid to improve energy efficiency, Aid for clean mobility: Aid for the acquisition and leasing of clean vehicles and clean mobile service equipment and for the retrofitting of vehicles and mobile service equipment and aid for the deployment of recharging or refuelling infrastructure (4.3):

This covers aid for the acquisition and leasing of clean transport vehicles and aid for the deployment of recharging or refuelling infrastructure, Aid for resource efficiency and for supporting the transition towards a circular economy (4.4): This includes, among other things, aid for investments aimed at improving resource efficiency through a reduction in the resources consumed in the production of the same quantity of output or through the replacement of primary raw materials with re-used or recycled materials, Aid for the prevention or the reduction of pollution other than from greenhouse gases (4.5):

This section covers aid for undertakings which go beyond Union standards or comply with Union standards that are not yet in force or which increase the level of environmental protection in the absence of such standards, Aid for the remediation of environmental damage, the rehabilitation of natural habitats and ecosystems, the protection or restoration of biodiversity and the implementation of nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation (4.6),Aid in the form of reductions in taxes or parafiscal levies (4.7), Aid for the security of electricity supply (4.8):

This includes capacity mechanisms, for example; here too, the guidelines provide for a public consultation as of 1 July 2023, Aid for energy infrastructure (4.9), Aid for district heating or cooling (4.10):

This category relates to support for the construction or upgrade of energy efficient district heating and cooling systems, Aid in the form of reductions from electricity levies for energy-intensive users (4.11):

This section now makes explicit reference to energy-intensive users and deals with aid in the form of reductions from electricity levies.

The current EEAG already provide for a similar category of aid in section 3.7 (aid in the form of reductions in or exemptions from environmental taxes and in the form of reductions in funding support for electricity from renewable sources), but some of the details have changed: Section 4.11 includes levies financing support to renewable sources or to combined heat and power and levies financing social tariffs or energy prices in isolated regions (point 403).

Levies which reflect part of the cost of providing electricity (such as exemptions from network charges or financing of capacity mechanisms) are not covered, however.

Levies on the consumption of other forms of energy, in particular natural gas, are also not covered by this section (point 403).

The stipulation made in the draft that reductions from levies may only be granted where the overall cumulative level of these levies (before any reductions) exceeds a certain amount (point 356 of the then draft) was dropped.

There is therefore no such additional upper limit in the CEEAG.

Aid based on section 4.11 is to be limited to sectors that are particularly exposed."
Gleiss Lutz,"THE GREEN DEAL AND EU STATE AID LEGISLATION: NEW COMMISSION GUIDELINES ON STATE AID FOR CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY","There is therefore no such additional upper limit in the CEEAG.

Aid based on section 4.11 is to be limited to sectors that are particularly exposed.

These are characterised by two factors, their trade intensity at Union level and their electro-intensity.

The Commission has listed these sectors in Annex I CEEAG, where they are divided into sectors at significant risk and sectors at risk.

This distinction is also new compared to the previous Annex 3 to the EEAG.

The Commission generally considers the aid to be proportionate if the beneficiary pays at least 15% or 25%, as the case may be, of the levies covered by the aid scheme (see point 408 et seq.

for the details).

This strikes a balance between the former EEAG, which considered 15% to be sufficient in the context of aid in the form of reductions in the funding of support for energy from renewable sources (point 188 EEAG) and the draft of the CEEAG, which originally provided for a figure of 25% (see point 359 of the draft CEEAG).

Section 4.11 also provides that Member States must commit to verifying that the beneficiary complies with its obligation to conduct an energy audit.

Member States must also monitor whether these beneficiaries meet one or more of the additional requirements in point 415 (e.g. to reduce their carbon footprint so as to cover 30% of their electricity consumption from carbon-free sources, or to invest a significant share of at least 50% of the aid amount in projects that lead to substantial reductions of their installation’s greenhouse gas emissions).

Aid for the closure of power plants using coal, peat or oil shale and of mining operations relating to coal, peat or oil shale extraction (4.12):

This section includes two different measures - first, aid for early closure and, second, aid for exceptional costs resulting from a closure.

​ Outlook The CEEAG feature numerous new elements as compared to their predecessor, the EEAG, as well as changes from the draft published in advance for consultation.

Section 4.1 would seem to be the most striking change, and at the same time it shows where the Commission’s focus lies, namely on the decarbonisation of industrial production processes.

The Commission has also retained what are arguably the most significant new procedural steps, namely the focus on competitive bidding processes, and public consultation.

Putting these additional administrative hurdles in place could pose a challenge for some Member States, in particular, and jeopardise the swift implementation of potential aid measures.

The years to come will show whether at the end of the day these new procedural steps will simply prove to be a theoretical problem that the Commission will solve by exercising flexibility and pragmatism in interpreting the exceptions."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY TO LEAVE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY,"On 11 November 2022, MPs from Germany’s ruling coalition had announced that Germany would be leaving the Energy Charter Treaty as soon as possible. 

This was then followed on 30 November 2022 by the Federal Government’s official decision, making it possible for Germany to withdraw from the Treaty before the end of the year.

Germany is following the example of a number of EU Member States that recently also announced their intention to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty, including Spain, the Netherlands, France and Poland.

Italy already pulled out of the Energy Charter Treaty in 2016.

Background The Energy Charter Treaty came into force in 1998 and has more than 50 signatories, including the EU.

It protects investments related to economic activities in the energy sector in other contracting states or the EU and allows investors to request international arbitration and claim damages if their rights under the Treaty are violated.

The Energy Charter Treaty has increasingly come under fire in recent years for allowing companies to sue a host state for damages over changes in the law or administrative decisions, especially in connection with the energy transition.

The fear is that companies with investments in conventional power generation will file requests for arbitration before international arbitral tribunals that could potentially result in host states having to pay damages running into the billions.

Critics therefore argue that the Treaty is incompatible with effective climate protection.

Reform of the Energy Charter Treaty This criticism also led to negotiations to modernise the Energy Charter Treaty being launched in November 2017.

These came to an end on 24 June 2022, when the contracting states reached an agreement in principle, and the Energy Charter Conference was to vote on the proposal on 22 November 2022.

But after various EU Member States announced their withdrawal, the EU called off a vote scheduled for 16 November 2022 in the Permanent Representatives Committee – the risk of a blocking minority was apparently too high.

And it was indeed impossible to achieve the necessary qualified majority at the follow-up meeting of the EU ambassadors of the Member States scheduled for last Friday: Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands abstained, which is counted as a rejection.

The EU Commission then asked for the vote on the modernisation proposal to be removed from the agenda of yesterday’s meeting of the Energy Charter Conference – and its request was granted.

The modernisation proposal includes a “flexibility mechanism” that would allow contracting states to exclude protection for fossil fuel investments in their territory.

The EU and the United Kingdom had already indicated in the past that they may make use of this mechanism.

Other contracting states – now also including Germany – seem to no longer want to be part of the reform process and instead plan to withdraw from the Treaty.

It remains to be seen whether the reform process will be completed at a later point in time, but this seems doubtful.

Consequences of Germany’s withdrawal from the Treaty Politically speaking, the announcement by the governing parties in Germany that the country intends to withdraw from the Treaty is being justified as a necessary step towards climate protection and chalked up as a success, as it has been in France, for example.

But this assessment often fails to take account of the fact that there are of course a (growing) number of arbitration cases under the Energy Charter Treaty concerning investments in renewable energies, in addition to damages actions relating to conventional power production.

The “solar claims” against Spain are good examples of this.

The statistics on requests for arbitration under the Energy Charter Treaty show that these are by no means isolated cases and that at least the majority of arbitration proceedings under the Treaty concern investments in renewable energies."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY TO LEAVE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY,"In the long term, the withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty will deprive not only investments in conventional energies but also those in renewable energies of the protection under international law afforded by the Treaty.

A unilateral withdrawal by Germany could therefore have a negative impact on the investment climate for renewable energies in the future.

Protection for existing investments remains intact Withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty is unlikely to have an immediate impact on existing investments.

In order to withdraw from the Treaty, the contracting state in question must give written notification to the depositary (Article 47(1) Energy Charter Treaty).

The withdrawal will generally take effect one year after receipt of the notification by the depositary (Article 47(1), (2) Energy Charter Treaty).

Of particular importance in this context is the so-called “sunset clause”, according to which the provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty will continue to apply to existing investments for a period of 20 years as from the date on which the contracting party’s withdrawal from the Treaty becomes effective.

In other words, investments that were protected under the Treaty when the withdrawal became effective will remain so for another 20 years.

This means that the unilateral withdrawal by Germany or other contracting states from the Treaty is only likely to have a direct impact on investments made after the date on which the withdrawal took effect.

Protection for such investments can only be sought before the courts of the host state and in accordance with the respective applicable national laws.

Outlook Even if the planned exit from the Energy Charter Treaty is seen as a success for effective climate protection, this ostensible success will, according to the current state of affairs, not be fully realised until the end of 2043 at the earliest.

Until then, investments in conventional energies made before Germany’s withdrawal will also remain protected.

Germany can therefore expect claims for damages under the Energy Charter Treaty to be asserted against it in arbitration proceedings for many years to come.

At the same time it will miss the opportunity to play a decisive role in the reform process already initiated under the Treaty, and to further develop investment protection under international law in the form of a sustainable energy policy.

What is also overlooked in the discussions about possible unilateral withdrawals by European Member States is that the Energy Charter Treaty was concluded in the 1990s precisely against the background of Europe’s growing energy needs and the resources available in the post-Soviet countries.

The goal pursued at that time, i.e. securing supply, is more relevant today than ever.

The Energy Charter Treaty could – after the end of the war in Ukraine and if economic relations are resumed with Russia – be an important instrument for protecting German and European investments in Eastern Europe and Russia and contribute to restoring security of supply."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION DEFINES GREEN HYDROGEN,"On 13 February 2023 the European Commission (“Commission”) presented criteria for when hydrogen should be considered green in the EU.

The new definition will have a major impact on the EU’s entire legal framework for hydrogen, which includes rules on energy infrastructure investments and State aid.

The Commission’s aim is to create legal certainty for investors, with clear criteria and a certification scheme, in order to meet the ambitious goals of the European Green Deal and the REPowerEU plan.

Scope and purpose of the new rules European legislators have been paying increasing attention to hydrogen over recent years.

Hydrogen can be used to both carry and store energy, as well as for numerous other industrial and transport applications, and does not cause any CO2 emissions.

For these reasons, it plays a crucial role in the EU’s strategy for achieving a cost-effective energy transition.

This is evident from the Commission’s hydrogen strategy, published in 2020, which sets out hydrogen’s decisive contribution to decarbonising industry and heavy goods traffic.

The Commission has also put together the “Fit for 55” package, which creates incentives for hydrogen use, including binding goals for industry and the transport sector.

The REPowerEU plan, presented in 2022, also assigns an important role to hydrogen in freeing the EU from its dependency on fossil fuels from Russia.

To achieve this goal, the plan envisages producing 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen within the EU and importing the same amount into the EU by 2030.

The Commission presented two delegated acts on 13 February 2023 that form part of this regulatory framework.

They are based on Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II, the “Renewable Energy Directive”).

This Directive aims to increase the share of renewable energies in the electricity, heating and transport sectors by 2030, but does not regulate the matter exhaustively.

In particular, the Directive does not explicitly stipulate in what cases hydrogen should be considered renewable or how producers can prove its renewability.

The Commission was empowered to define criteria for this, and after a lengthy decision-making process, has now done so.

The two delegated acts propose criteria for determining what should be considered green hydrogen in the EU.

The Commission has explained that both acts are required so that fuels, including motor fuels, can count towards meeting Member States’ goals for increasing the share of renewable energies.

The first delegated act defines the requirements for classing hydrogen, hydrogen-based fuels or other energy carriers as Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (“ RFNBOs ”).

For this purpose, the principles of additionality and temporal and geographical correlation have been made more precise.

They have already been incorporated into the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive.

In other words, the first delegated act sets out the criteria for hydrogen to qualify as green in the EU, and defines how hydrogen producers can prove that these criteria have been met.

The second delegated act sets out the method for calculating the greenhouse gas emission savings that RFNBOs generate over their entire life.

This second act also defines a minimum threshold:

RFNBOs can only count towards the EU’s renewable energies goal if they generate greenhouse gas emission savings of more than 70% compared with fossil fuels.

What makes the new definition relevant?

How green hydrogen is defined will be primarily relevant in the context of the Renewable Energy Directive and its regulatory scope.

The definition determines whether hydrogen can count towards meeting the Member States’ goals for increasing the share of renewable energies in the transport sector."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION DEFINES GREEN HYDROGEN,"The definition determines whether hydrogen can count towards meeting the Member States’ goals for increasing the share of renewable energies in the transport sector.

This also means that the definition will be of major importance in the respective national systems for promoting renewable energy.

In Germany, this will be the case with the Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz , “ EEG ”) and Federal Immission Control Act ( Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz , “ BImSchG ”).

The Federal Environment Ministry has already announced that it will be transposing the delegated acts “in the very near future” in order to promote green hydrogen in the transport sector.

An amendment to Germany’s 37th Federal Immission Control Ordinance (“ BImSchV ”) is envisaged for this purpose.

Germany’s existing green hydrogen criteria will also be harmonised with European provisions by amending the EEG (cf.

Bundesrat document 162/22).

So the new definition will impact the national regulatory framework for hydrogen in the near future.

This will be of interest to hydrogen producers, as various rules in Germany confer privileges on them if the hydrogen qualifies as green or renewable.

Section 69b EEG, for example, exempts installations producing green hydrogen from the EEG surcharge completely.

In addition, section 39p EEG provides for auctions for installations generating power from green hydrogen.

Section 39q EEG stipulates special payment conditions for these installations.

But green hydrogen enjoys special privileges in other laws too, such as the Energy Financing Act ( Energiefinanzierungsgesetz , “ EnFG ”).

Section 25 EnFG, for example, exempts installations that come into operation before 1 January 2030 from a surcharge when producing green hydrogen.

The new criteria for green hydrogen are likely to increase in importance in future, and significantly so.

The Renewable Energy Directive is currently being revised on the European level, and the Commission has proposed that in conjunction with the updated Directive, the two delegated acts of 13 February 2023 become the central regulatory instrument for green hydrogen’s market ramp-up in all sectors.

When is hydrogen green or renewable?

Hydrogen produced by electrolysers is considered renewable if and only if it was produced using electricity from renewable sources.

This is the general principle.

So hydrogen producers must prove that the electricity they use comes from renewable sources.

The electricity can be obtained from an installation directly connected to the hydrogen production facility (mostly electrolysers), or else from the electricity grid.

For both scenarios, the Commission’s rules contain criteria that hydrogen producers can employ to prove that they have used renewable electricity.

The principles of additionality and temporal and geographical correlation are crucial here.

Additionality is intended to ensure that higher demand for hydrogen entails new capacity for power generation from renewable sources.

Temporal and geographical correlation is supposed to make sure that renewable hydrogen is only produced at times when and in places where sufficient renewable energy is available.

Member States have the option of setting additional criteria for geographical correlation.

Such criteria may affect what location is chosen for electrolysers, for example.

An electrolyser can be connected directly to a new installation generating electricity.

The hydrogen thus produced is considered renewable or green if the hydrogen producer can prove the following cumulative requirements have been met: The installation generating electricity generates electricity from renewable energy sources, is directly connected to the hydrogen production facility or is part of it, was commissioned no earlier than 36 months before the hydrogen production facility, and is not connected to the electricity grid, or if it is, has a smart metering system."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION DEFINES GREEN HYDROGEN,"This system must show that no electricity has been taken from the grid to produce hydrogen.

A special rule will apply where the capacity of a hydrogen production facility has been expanded.

If capacity is expanded at the same location no later than 36 months after the facility has come into operation, the 36-month deadline will be calculated from when the original facility started to operate.

Without this rule, creating new production capacity might mean that the hydrogen produced is not green.

But hydrogen producers can take the electrolysis current from the grid as well.

The hydrogen thus produced is considered green or renewable if the electricity used can be counted as fully renewable.

The Commission sets out four scenarios in which this will be the case: The electrolyser is located in a bidding zone in which the average share of electricity from renewable energies was more than 90% in the previous calendar year.

In addition, RFNBO production must not exceed a defined maximum number of hours proportionate to electricity from renewable energies in the bidding zone.

The delegated act stipulates how to calculate this.

The electrolyser is located in a bidding zone in which electricity emissions are lower than 18 gCO2eq/MJ.

The hydrogen producer must also conclude one or more power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewable energies under which at least as much power is generated as that stated to be fully renewable.

In addition to these two requirements, the conditions of temporal and geographical correlation must also be met.

The electricity used to manufacture hydrogen is consumed during an imbalance settlement period.

In this case, the hydrogen producer must provide certain proof based on information from the national grid system operator.

The producer will need to prove that installations generating electricity from renewable energy sources were redispatched and that the electricity used to produce RFNBOs has reduced the need for redispatching accordingly.

The electricity used can also be counted as renewable if none of these alternatives applies.

But the preconditions of additionality and temporal and geographical correlation must have been fulfilled.

The delegated acts specify what these principles require.

Hydrogen from nuclear energy can be green On the political level, controversy continues as to whether hydrogen from nuclear energy should qualify as green.

The two delegated acts are based on the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, which does not include nuclear energy as a renewable energy source.

According to the Commission’s new criteria, however, hydrogen produced using nuclear energy can still be classed as green under certain circumstances.

Grid power can be counted as green if it originates from a bidding zone where electricity is produced at less than 18 gCO2eq/MJ.

A grid with a high share of electricity from nuclear energy will have low CO2 emissions.

If this electricity is used for electrolysis, then the hydrogen thus produced can also be green, according to the new definition.

But further criteria must also be met, as set out above.

The decision that hydrogen from nuclear power is green under certain circumstances is in line with the EU’s Taxonomy Regulation, which classes nuclear energy as a green transitional activity if particular requirements are met.

Rules also apply to importers of hydrogen into the EU

The requirements for green hydrogen production will not only apply to producers within the EU.

Producers in third countries will also need to pay attention to them if they want to import hydrogen as a renewable fuel that can be counted towards the EU’s goals.

A new certification scheme is being introduced to allow hydrogen producers (both within and outside the EU) to prove their compliance with European Union rules.

This is intended to facilitate trade in renewable hydrogen on the internal market, making it as uncomplicated as possible for producers."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION DEFINES GREEN HYDROGEN,"This is intended to facilitate trade in renewable hydrogen on the internal market, making it as uncomplicated as possible for producers.

The certification scheme is based on “voluntary schemes”, which are already being used worldwide to certify biofuels and biomass.

The Commission will review and recognise voluntary schemes centrally.

A voluntary scheme will be certified by the Commission if the scheme ensures that legal requirements for producing renewable hydrogen are being duly verified.

Hydrogen producers will be subject to duties to provide detailed documentation and go through certification procedures.

If specific criteria (such as bidding zones) cannot be implemented outside the EU, then alternative rules will be introduced.

The Commission’s act already contains guidelines on this.

If a hydrogen producer presents evidence from a recognised scheme, then all Member States will have to accept it.

In Germany, the criteria for when non-EU hydrogen production is green will have particular relevance for the “H2Global” support scheme.

As part of H2Global, imports of green hydrogen produced outside the EU will be supported by a double auction mechanism.

For the hydrogen thus imported to count towards Germany’s targets under the Renewable Energy Directive, the financial support will need to be based on the criteria set by the European Commission.

Staggered introduction of rules The Commission’s acts provide that the new rules will be introduced in stages.

In parallel with the hydrogen industry’s planned development, regulations are being tightened to help stakeholders adjust to the new regulatory framework and to take account of existing investment commitments.

A transitional period for meeting additionality requirements is therefore envisaged.

This exemption applies to hydrogen projects that come into operation before 1 January 2028.

Hydrogen produced by such projects can also be green if long-term contracts for renewable electricity are concluded with existing installations.

The idea of the transitional period is to avert any delays in imports of electrolysers, as a great deal of time and effort is involved in planning, permitting and installing new facilities for generating additional renewable energy.

There will also be an introductory phase with regard to the temporal correlation, lasting up to and including 31 December 2029.

During this period, producers of renewable hydrogen will be able to match energy generation from renewable sources with renewable hydrogen production linked to that generation on a monthly basis.

In this introductory phase, therefore, electrolysers can be operated at any time as long as the aggregate volume of renewable electricity consumed corresponds to the aggregate volume of renewable hydrogen produced in that calendar month of the year.

But Member States have the option of issuing stricter rules on temporal correlation from 1 July 2027 (e.g. hourly matching).

The introductory phase will end on 1 January 2030, and from this date all producers of renewable hydrogen will have to match purchased electricity on an hourly basis.

Impact on financial support from EU and Member States From a business perspective, how green hydrogen is defined is of major importance when it comes to the options for financial support.

The definition is intended to guide national State aid approval and steer existing European funds towards renewable hydrogen.

It can therefore be assumed that qualifying as green hydrogen will be a key criterion when funds are awarded.

On the national level, the new criteria will have particular relevance for the H2Global support scheme, as mentioned above.

But many European funding requirements also refer explicitly to renewable hydrogen.

In 2021, for example, State aid rules were updated in the “Fit for 55” package, aiming to provide targeted support for the production of renewable hydrogen."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN COMMISSION DEFINES GREEN HYDROGEN,"In 2021, for example, State aid rules were updated in the “Fit for 55” package, aiming to provide targeted support for the production of renewable hydrogen.

In this connection, EUR 10.6 billion of Member State support has already been approved for two Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs) concerning hydrogen.

According to the Commission, moreover, the EU’s Innovation Fund will also be supporting fixed-premium auctions for renewable hydrogen from 2023.

An expected EUR 800 million will be available in the first pilot auction.

Qualifying as green hydrogen will also be relevant under the REPowerEU plan, whose guidelines the delegated acts will complement, the Commission states.

So the new definition will be crucial for whether hydrogen can count towards the European goal of producing 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen within the EU by 2030 and importing the same volume into the EU.

This is important from a business perspective, since the EU intends to offer financial support towards achieving this goal.

EUR 200 million, for example, are available for “Hydrogen Valleys” (regional ecosystems combining hydrogen production, transport and various end applications).

Summary and outlook The two delegated acts see the European Commission finally providing a definition of when hydrogen should be considered green in the EU.

This definition will have a major impact on the entire legal framework for hydrogen.

The Commission’s two delegated acts will now be notified to the European Parliament and the Council for approval, which have two months to review the proposals and to accept or object to them.

The review period can be extended by a further two months if requested, but neither body has the power to amend the proposals.

The legal acts are expected to be adopted no later than these deadlines.

The provisions will come into effect on the twentieth day following that of their promulgation in the Official Journal of the European Union.

But there remains political controversy (especially between France and Germany) as to whether hydrogen from nuclear energy should qualify as green.

Similar controversy occurred over the Taxonomy Regulation, in which ultimately the ECJ was seized of the matter, at Austria’s request.

Things could turn out the same way here."
Gleiss Lutz,EPBD amended to include ambitious new targets for the building sector,"The amendment to Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings (“EPBD”) has finally been adopted.

Approved by the Council of the European Union on 12 April 2024, the amendment fundamentally revises the 2010 Directive, bringing it into line with the EU’s climate protection targets through stricter energy performance standards for buildings.

Member States now have two years in which to transpose the amendment into national law.

Building owners and asset managers will then find themselves subject to increased requirements for the energy performance of buildings.

Objectives of the amended Directive The Commission initiated a revision of the EPBD, which was last amended as recently as 2018, as part of the EU’s “Fit for 55” legislative package.

Buildings sector energy use accounts for around 40% of the EU’s greenhouse gases and has an important role to play in the EU achieving its climate protection targets.

The previous version of the Directive contained very few stipulations on the energy efficiency of buildings, leaving this largely up to the Member States.

As a result, the annual EU-wide energy renovation rate for existing buildings has been below 1% in recent years.

The number of renovated buildings per year must increase significantly for the EU to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2050.

As such, the amendment also serves to help implement the Renovation Wave Strategy adopted as part of the European Green Deal, which aims to double the energy renovation rate of buildings by 2030.

The new provisions contain a large number of measures to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and promote the renovation of existing buildings in Member States.

Their focus is on buildings with the worst energy performance.

The main goals are for all new buildings to be zero-emission by 2030 at the latest and for existing buildings to become zero-emission by 2050.

Minimum requirements for energy performance One of the most important changes to the Directive is the introduction of minimum energy performance standards (“MEPS”).

Unlike in earlier drafts of the amendment, these apply to non-residential buildings only.

Article 9(1) provides that Member States must establish MEPS in the form of a maximum primary or final energy use to be met by all non-residential buildings by a specified date.

The MEPS are to be set so as to ensure that 16% of buildings with the poorest energy efficiency are renovated by 2030 and 26% by 2033.

Whilst exceptions can be made where there is an unfavourable cost-benefit ratio or other hardship, this is effectively a de facto renovation order for non-residential buildings that must be transposed into national law.

Member States have greater room for manoeuvre when it comes to the renovation targets for residential buildings .

Pursuant to Article 9(2), Member States must establish national trajectories to ensure a 16% decrease in energy consumption by residential building stock by 2030 and a 20-22% decrease by 2035, with at least 55% of the decrease to be achieved by renovating the worst-performing residential buildings.

However, even if MEPS do not apply to residential buildings and Member States therefore have somewhat more flexibility in implementing the targets, the outcome will also depend on renovating those residential buildings with the poorest energy efficiency.

Member States may exempt certain types of buildings from both MEPS and renovation targets (e.g. historic buildings, holiday homes, military buildings and industrial sites).

Energy performance classes, energy performance certificates and renovation passports Energy performance classes are to be harmonised across the EU to ensure uniform implementation of the Directive’s requirements.

Member States must introduce energy efficiency classes on a scale from A to G (with an optional class A+)."
Gleiss Lutz,EPBD amended to include ambitious new targets for the building sector,"Member States must introduce energy efficiency classes on a scale from A to G (with an optional class A+).

Only zero-emission buildings may be included in class A, and the remaining buildings are to be distributed appropriately among classes B to F. Class G is to include only the very worst-performing buildings in the national building stock when the scale is introduced.

The obligation to issue energy performance certificates has also been broadened.

An energy performance certificate must now be issued not only for new builds, sales or rentals, but also for the renewal of rental contracts, major renovations, and buildings owned or used by public bodies.

Building owners will be supported in renovation projects through voluntary renovation passports.

Renovation passports will be issued by certified experts and contain a roadmap for step-by-step renovation measures as well as information on financing options and the benefits of energy-efficient renovations.

Zero-emission: the standard for new buildings The zero-emission building is replacing the nearly zero-energy building as the standard for new buildings .

Zero-emission buildings are buildings whose energy demands are met entirely by renewable energies.

As from 1 January 2028, this standard will apply to new buildings owned by public bodies, and from 1 January 2030 it will apply to all other new buildings.

Prior to these dates, all new buildings should at least be nearly zero-energy.

Starting on 1 January 2028, the energy performance certificate for newly constructed buildings with a usable floor area of more than 1,000 m 2 will have to state the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP); for all other newly constructed buildings, this obligation will apply from 1 January 2030.

In addition, Member States will need to set limits for the maximum life-cycle GWP, which new buildings will have to comply with from 2030.

Switch to renewable energies The new EPBD does not ban fossil-fuel heating systems outright, whereas the draft version had envisaged an end to fossil-fuel heating systems by 2044.

Now, Member States merely have to strive to replace fossil fuel boilers in accordance with their respective national phase-out plan; for Germany, this means in accordance with the requirements in sections 71 et seq.

Buildings Energy Act ( Gebäudeenergiegesetz ).

As from 1 January 2025, however, Member States will have to discontinue any financial incentives for the installation of stand-alone fossil fuel boilers.

As from 1 January 2030, new buildings will in any case have to be heated entirely by renewable energies to qualify as zero-emission buildings.

At the same time, the use of solar installations will be increased:

In future, new buildings will need to be “ solar-ready ”, i.e. suitable for the installation of solar technologies.

Solar energy installations must be gradually installed on existing buildings, provided this is technically suitable and economically and functionally feasible.

The Directive provides for a staggered timeline from 2026 to 2030, according to which public buildings, non-residential buildings, residential buildings and roofed car parks will be equipped with solar installations depending on their floor area.

Infrastructure for sustainable mobility and inclusive design The existing measures to promote sustainable mobility solutions will be scaled up.

The number of pre-cabled parking spaces and the number of recharging points required will be increased for both residential and non-residential buildings.

In fact, the requirements already apply to non-residential buildings with five or more car parking spaces and residential buildings with three or more car parking spaces.

In addition to regulations for new and renovated buildings, the Directive now includes a requirement for existing buildings."
Gleiss Lutz,EPBD amended to include ambitious new targets for the building sector,"In addition to regulations for new and renovated buildings, the Directive now includes a requirement for existing buildings.

By 1 January 2027, it states, all non-residential buildings with more than 20 car parking spaces must either provide pre-cabling for at least 50% of their parking spaces or at least one recharging point for every ten parking spaces.

Requirements for bicycle parking spaces , including for cargo bikes, are also introduced.

Building technology Finally, the Directive specifies which building types must provide which kinds of technical building systems (including automatic temperature controls as well as measuring and control devices for monitoring and regulating indoor air quality).

Existing non-residential buildings with a particularly high level of energy consumption (exceeding 290 kW) have to be retrofitted with building automation and control systems by 31 December 2024.

New or renovated residential and non-residential buildings will also need to be equipped with certain measuring and control devices, provided this is technically, economically and functionally feasible.

Outlook Now that the amendments to the EPBD have come into force, it is up to the Member States to transpose the requirements into national law within two years of the Directive being published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

In so doing, the Member States can also make the regulations stricter than those in the Directive, but they are not allowed to water them down.

The Directive also retains a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the transposition, so it remains to be seen how the German legislator will implement the requirements of the EPBD into German law.

However, the legislator does not have much room for manoeuvre apart from establishing the requirements for renovating residential building stock and setting the targets in the national building renovation plans.

In the case of non-residential buildings, the German legislator will presumably have to put pressure on building owners to renovate their buildings so that the requirements of the Directive are complied with."
Gleiss Lutz,CBAM – NEW OBLIGATIONS AND PENALTIES UNDER THE EU’S CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM TO TAKE EFFECT ON 1 OCTOBER 2023,"As of 1 October 2023, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (“CBAM”) established under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 will apply to imports of certain goods such as cement, electricity, fertilisers, iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen and processed products from those goods into the customs territory of the European Union.

During a transitional period from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2025, EU importers will have to comply with reporting obligations for such imported goods or face severe penalties.

The EU has launched the CBAM as part of the European Green Deal to act as a counterpart to the existing European Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”).

Its aim is to prevent carbon leakage – i.e. the shift of greenhouse gas emissions to non-EU countries – paving the way for a climate-neutral future.

To achieve this goal, importers of goods from energy-intensive sectors are to pay the same carbon price as domestic producers under the EU ETS.

The relevant mechanisms will be progressively phased in.

Initial reporting obligations will apply for a transitional period that starts on 1 October 2023 and extends through 2025.

Once the permanent system enters into force on 1 January 2026, importers will need to be authorised as a CBAM declarant to import goods covered into the customs territory of the European Union.

I. Background Introduced in 2005, the EU ETS has been a key climate policy tool aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union by incentivising companies to burn less fossil fuels.

The EU ETS is a “cap and trade” scheme: The overall volume of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by stationary installations such as power plants and industrial plants in the European Union is subject to a cap (or limit) set by the European Commission, which corresponds to the sum of emission allowances.

To achieve the EU’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 this cap is gradually reduced each year.

Companies must acquire allowances for each tonne of carbon they emit either by purchasing them on the carbon market or through EU ETS auctions.

They can also trade emission allowances they do not need.

When it was introduced, the EU ETS already posed the risk of “carbon leakage”, a practice where companies move carbon-intensive production abroad to circumvent strict European emission standards and avoid having to acquire the necessary allowances.

Today, carbon leakage is addressed by allocating free certificates to producers in energy-intensive sectors.

However, to achieve climate targets, this system of free certificates will be gradually phased out until it is completely discontinued in 2034.

In order to prevent producers from circumventing the EU ETS by shifting production – and as a result greenhouse gases – to non-EU countries, the CBAM is designed to combat not only carbon leakage but also reduce global carbon emissions (Article 1(1)

CBAM Regulation).

Companies must therefore pay the same carbon price for the emissions of certain imported goods as they would under the EU ETS.

This is ultimately intended to level the playing field for European companies.

II. 

Which sectors does this affect?

The CBAM applies to imports of goods such as cement, electricity, fertilisers, iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen and processed products of those goods into the customs territory of the European Union (Article 2(1) CBAM Regulation).

The exhaustive list of goods covered is contained in Annex I, no. 1

CBAM Regulation, categorised by combined nomenclature codes (“CN codes”) (Annex I, no. 1

CBAM Regulation).

This standardised EU-wide tool for classifying goods is designed to meet the requirements the Common Customs Tariff.

Goods whose eight-digit CN codes are not listed in Annex I are excluded.

All importers of the goods are affected.

Those from developing countries, in particular, are not subject to exemptions or price reductions (cf."
Gleiss Lutz,CBAM – NEW OBLIGATIONS AND PENALTIES UNDER THE EU’S CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM TO TAKE EFFECT ON 1 OCTOBER 2023,"All importers of the goods are affected.

Those from developing countries, in particular, are not subject to exemptions or price reductions (cf.

Article 30(2), letter (f) CBAM Regulation).

The only exceptions apply to consignments not exceeding a value of EUR 150, for goods with a value of up to EUR 150 contained in the personal luggage of travellers coming from a third country, and for goods to be moved or used in the context of military activities (Article 2(3)

CBAM Regulation).

III. 

When does the CBAM take effect?

The obligations under the CBAM will be introduced step by step as from 1 October 2023 (Article 32 CBAM Regulation).

Importers are initially only required to prepare a report every quarter (Article 35(1) CBAM Regulation), which, according to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 (“Implementing Regulation”), must contain the following information: The total quantity of each type of goods , expressed in megawatt hours for electricity and in tonnes for other goods, specified for each installation producing the goods in the country of origin (Article 35(2), letter (a) of the Regulation) and – for identification purposes – the CN code of the goods pursuant to Article 3(1), letter (b) Regulation (EEC) 2658/87 (Implementing Regulation; Annex I CBAM Regulation);

The actual total embedded emissions in tonnes of CO2e emissions per megawatt hour of electricity or, for other goods, in tonnes of CO2e emissions per tonne of each type of goods (Article 35(2), letter (b) CBAM Regulation), specifying the country of origin of the imported goods, the installation in which they were produced, the production routes used, for steel products the identification number of the steel mill and the specific direct emissions of the goods, which are to be determined by converting the attributed embedded direct emissions of the production processes into emissions specific of the goods expressed as CO2e per tonne (Article 3(2)

Implementing Regulation)

;

The total indirect emissions (Article 35(2), letter (c) CBAM Regulation),

specifying the electricity consumption, whether actual emissions or default values are reported, the relevant emission factor, the amount of specific indirect emissions determined by converting the attributed embedded indirect emissions in the goods into CO2e emissions per tonne (Article 3(3) Implementing Regulation); the carbon price due in a country of origin for the embedded emissions in the imported goods, taking into account any rebate or other form of compensation available (Article 35(2), letter (d)

CBAM Regulation).

The reporting obligation only applies during the transitional period, which expires on 31 December 2025.

For each quarter from 1 October 2023 until 31 December 2025, the CBAM reports must be submitted to the CBAM transitional registry – specifically established to this purpose – no later than one month after the end of that quarter (Article 8(1), Article 10 Implementing Regulation).

As of 31 December 2024, companies can apply for the status of authorised CBAM declarant (Article 5(1)

CBAM Regulation).

Upon authorisation, the CBAM declarant will be granted access to its account in the CBAM registry (Article 16(2)

CBAM Regulation).

In addition, operators of an installation in a third country may apply for registration (Article 10(1) CBAM Regulation).

During the transitional period, CBAM certificates do not have to be surrendered until the end of 2025.

Financial compensation will therefore not be paid until the definitive (post-transitional) period commences on 1 January 2026, after which the goods listed may only be imported into the customs territory of the European Union by authorised CBAM declarants.

IV. 

How are CBAM certificates acquired in the definitive period and at what carbon price?"
Gleiss Lutz,CBAM – NEW OBLIGATIONS AND PENALTIES UNDER THE EU’S CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM TO TAKE EFFECT ON 1 OCTOBER 2023,"IV. 

How are CBAM certificates acquired in the definitive period and at what carbon price?

Each Member State will sell CBAM certificates to authorised CBAM declarants established within its territory using a common central platform set up and administered by the Commission (Article 20(1) CBAM Regulation).

Information on the certificates bought will be transferred to the declarant’s account in the CBAM registry.

The price of the certificates will be calculated as the average weekly price for EU ETS allowances and published by the Commission on the common platform (Article 21 CBAM Regulation).

As from 2027, by 31 May of each year each authorised CBAM declarant must surrender through the CBAM registry the number of certificates equal to the embedded emissions for its imported goods in the calendar year prior to the surrender (Article 22(1) CBAM Regulation).

“Embedded emissions” means direct emissions released during the production of goods and indirect emissions from the production of the electricity consumed during the production processes (Article 3, no. 22 CBAM Regulation).

Where a carbon price has been paid for the declared embedded emissions in the country of origin (in the form of a tax or levy or under an ETS (European Commission, Guidance document on CBAM implementation for installation operators outside the EU, section 6.10, p. 159

et seq.)

, the declarant can claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered (Article 9(1)

CBAM Regulation).

The declarant must show that the declared embedded emissions were subject to a carbon price in the country of origin and that this has been paid (Article 9(2)

CBAM Regulation).

The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts on conversion of the yearly average carbon price paid into a corresponding reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered, including conversion of foreign currency into euro (Article 9(4)

CBAM Regulation).

The number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered will also be adjusted to reflect the extent to which EU ETS allowances have been allocated free of charge (Article 31(1) CBAM Regulation).

The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts with detailed rules for calculating the adjustment, having regard to the various benchmarks used in the EU ETS for free allocation (Article 31(2) CBAM Regulation).

Finally, each authorised CBAM declarant must ensure that the number of CBAM certificates in its account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80% of the embedded emissions in all goods it has imported since the beginning of the calendar year (Article 22(2)

CBAM Regulation).

If excess certificates remain in a declarant’s account in the CBAM registry after the surrender date, the Member State where the authorised CBAM declarant is established must buy back the excess at the declarant’s request (Article 23 CBAM Regulation).

The repurchase price for CBAM certificates is the price paid at the time of purchase.

On 1 July of each year, the Commission will cancel without compensation all CBAM certificates purchased in the calendar year before last and still in the accounts of CBAM declarants (Article 24(1) CBAM Regulation).

Unlike under the EU ETS, importers cannot trade CBAM certificates.

This is to ensure that importers do in fact pay a fixed carbon price.

V. 

What other factors must be taken into account?

Only authorised CBAM declarants may import goods into the customs territory of the Union (Article 4 CBAM Regulation).

Importers (or their indirect customs representatives) must therefore apply for authorisation and may only import goods after receipt of authorisation (Article 5 CBAM Regulation).

The Commission must set up a CBAM registry of authorised CBAM declarants for this purpose and make the information in the registry available automatically and in real time to customs authorities and competent authorities (Article 14(1) CBAM Regulation)."
Gleiss Lutz,CBAM – NEW OBLIGATIONS AND PENALTIES UNDER THE EU’S CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM TO TAKE EFFECT ON 1 OCTOBER 2023,"This is to ensure that however many parties are involved in the importation process, each tonne of imported goods is reported only once, i.e. not reported twice nor omitted from reporting altogether (European Commission, Guidance document on CBAM implementation for importers of goods into the EU, section 4.3.1, p. 17).

From 2027, authorised CBAM declarants must use the CBAM registry to submit the CBAM declaration due from them by 31 May of each year (Article 6(1)

CBAM Regulation).

The declaration must contain the following information (Article 6(2)

CBAM Regulation): the total quantity of each type of goods imported during the previous calendar year, expressed in megawatt hours for electricity and in tonnes for other goods; the total embedded emissions, expressed in tonnes of CO2e emissions per megawatt hour of electricity or, for other goods, in tonnes of CO2e emissions per tonne of each type of goods; the total number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered after any reduction for a carbon price paid in a country of origin and adjustment to reflect EU ETS allowances allocated free of charge; copies of the verification reports issued by the accredited verifier.

VI. 

What penalties are in place and how will the CBAM be enforced?

During the transitional period, penalties of between EUR 10 and EUR 50 per non-reported tonne of embedded emissions apply.

The precise figure will be set taking into account the extent of unreported information, the unreported quantities of imported goods and the unreported emissions relating to those goods, the readiness of the reporting declarant to correct the situation and the (past) behaviour of the reporting declarant (Article 16(1) to (3) Implementing Regulation).

During the definitive period, authorised CBAM declarants will be liable for a penalty if they fail to surrender their certificates by 31 May of each year (Article 26(1) CBAM Regulation).

These penalties do not release the declarant from the obligation to surrender the outstanding number of CBAM certificates retrospectively (Article 26(3) CBAM Regulation).

Penalties will also be imposed on persons other than authorised CBAM declarants should they introduce goods into the customs territory of the Union.

The penalty for authorised CBAM declarants for excess emissions is EUR 100 per tonne of CO2e emitted by the installation for which the operator has not surrendered allowances (Article 26(1) CBAM Regulation in conjunction with Article 16(3) Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC).

The penalty for persons other than authorised CBAM declarants is three to five times this amount, depending on the duration, gravity, scope, intentional nature and repetition of the non-compliance and on the level of cooperation of the person with the competent authority (Article 26(2)

CBAM Regulation).

Penalties are enforced by the competent national authorities.

The Commission will take action against practices circumventing the CBAM Regulation.

These practices include slightly modifying affected goods in order to bring them under CN codes not covered by the CBAM Regulation but without altering their essential characteristics, or artificially splitting shipments into consignments with an intrinsic value that does not exceed the EUR 150 threshold (Article 27 CBAM Regulation).

VII. 

What needs doing?

Businesses first need to establish who is responsible for fulfilling any authorisation, declarative and other CBAM obligations and whether an indirect representative should be appointed for this."
Gleiss Lutz,CBAM – NEW OBLIGATIONS AND PENALTIES UNDER THE EU’S CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM TO TAKE EFFECT ON 1 OCTOBER 2023,"Businesses first need to establish who is responsible for fulfilling any authorisation, declarative and other CBAM obligations and whether an indirect representative should be appointed for this.

They must also identify and calculate the (embedded) emissions in relevant goods (European Commission, Guidance document on CBAM implementation for installation operators outside the EU, section 6.4.1, p. 105) in order to comply with the reporting obligation starting on 1 October 2023.

Attention should be paid in particular to whether a different emissions trading instrument already applies to the goods and whether this falls under the CBAM.

Finally, it is important to consider whether there may be any economically reasonable ways of avoiding or minimising liability risks under the CBAM for a product line and the supply chain.

For example, whilst hydrogen is within the scope of the CBAM, this is only the case for synthetic gases and e-fuels if they are produced using hydrogen that is subject to the inward processing procedure and thus in-scope as a processed product, cf.

Article 2(1)

CBAM Regulation (the inward processing procedure pursuant to Article 256 Regulation (EU)

No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code allows non-Union goods to be used in processing operations in the customs territory of the Union without being subject to duties or commercial policy measures).

If, in contrast, the inward processing procedure is not relevant, i.e. if the synthetic gases or e-fuels are produced in a non-EU country and only imported after production, the CBAM will not apply.

This opens up opportunities through changes in production.

Given the extensive reach of the CBAM, focussing on the products it does not cover may be beneficial."
Gleiss Lutz,"FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU, UK AND U.S. ADOPT FRESH SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA","On 6 October 2022, the EU again tightened economic sanctions against Russia in response to its illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory based on sham “referenda”, its partial mobilisation, and its renewed threat to use weapons of mass destruction.

The eighth package – which the EU again calls a sanctions package – builds on the “maintenance and alignment” package of measures of 21 July 2022 ( newsletter of 28 July 2022 ) and the sanctions packages of 3/4 June 2022 ( newsletter of 9 June 2022 ), 9 April 2022 ( newsletter of 12 April 2022 ), 16 March 2022 ( newsletter of 18 March 2022 ), 28 February/2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) and 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ).

The eighth sanctions package is designed – as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen put it – to “make the Kremlin pay” for escalating the conflict, and both introduces additional import and export bans and further expands the list of personal sanctions.

The geographical scope of the sanctions has also been extended to cover the four Ukrainian territories annexed by Russia:

Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

In addition, the eighth sanctions package lays the groundwork for the introduction of the G7’s “oil price cap”.

The EU is not alone in significantly tightening its sanctions: The U.S. and UK also expanded their measures – and Russia its countermeasures – before the EU’s sanctions package came into force.

EU sanctions The EU’s latest sanctions package (Regulations (EU) 2022/1903, 2022/1904 and 2022/1905 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/1906) tightens and modifies the existing sanctions against Russia – in particular, the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and the financial and trade sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 .

Personal sanctions The EU has added 30 individuals and seven entities to the list of personal sanctions, which now has more than 1,300 entries.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons listed in Annex I to the Regulation.

No funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of these persons.

The natural persons listed are also banned from entering or transiting through EU territory (see our newsletters of 7 March 2022 , 12 April 2022 and 9 June 2022 ).

In the package of measures adopted on 21 July 2022 ( newsletter of 28 July 2022 ), the EU expanded these personal sanctions to include a reporting requirement for listed persons, entities or bodies; these parties are now required to report any assets they have in the EU to ensure that these are frozen and to prevent circumventions.

The current sanctions package adds the persons and entities involved in ordering and organising the illegal referenda in the occupied regions of Ukraine – including political decision-makers and members of the Central Election Commission (and the Commission itself) – to the list in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014.

A number of new names on the list come from the Russian defence sector, including Alan Lushnikov (the largest shareholder of arms manufacturer JSC Kalashnikov Concern), several defence companies, and certain members of the Russian Armed Forces.

Finally, the list now includes individuals who have deliberately spread disinformation about the war, such as prominent singer Yulia Chicherina and well-known “philosopher” Aleksander Dugin.

Financial and trade sanctions The EU also adopted extensive further measures expanding and tightening financial and trade sanctions : Comprehensive new import and export restrictions have been added to the goods-related sanctions .

The expansion of these export restrictions is primarily aimed at curbing Russia’s access to goods that can aid its military and technological capabilities or its defence, security or industrial sectors."
Gleiss Lutz,"FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU, UK AND U.S. ADOPT FRESH SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA","To this end, export bans on coal, specific electronic components, technical items used in the aviation sector, certain chemicals, and small arms have been imposed or tightened.

Import restrictions (Article 3i Regulation (EU) 833/2014) have been vastly broadened to include a wide variety of goods which, from the EU’s perspective, contribute to substantial revenues for the Russian Federation.

While the new import restrictions on certain steel products, machinery and vehicles come as no surprise, the same cannot be said for the inclusion of other products.

Oddities such as “mica”, “beauty preparations” or “pouffes” and even toilet paper and buildings have made it onto the list in Annex XXI.

However, the EU has also created further exemptions from the import restrictions:

According to the newly introduced paragraph 3a of Article 3i Regulation (EU) 833/2014, the import restrictions now no longer apply if the goods are necessary for diplomatic purposes or for the personal use of nationals of Member States and their immediate family members.

Furthermore, import licences can be issued for goods related to the civilian use of nuclear power.

The import restrictions laid down in Article 3g Regulation (EU) 833/2014 on the iron and steel products listed in Annex XVII have also been expanded.

On the one hand, the import bans now also cover certain steel products processed in third countries using products originating in Russia as listed in Annex XVII.

On the other, various new transitional arrangements apply to different iron and steel products.

The services bans set out in Article 5n Regulation (EU) 833/2014 have also been expanded.

In addition to prohibiting the provision of auditing, business and management or public relations services to the Russian government or to legal persons, entities and bodies established in Russia, these now also prohibit the provision of IT consultancy, legal advisory, architectural and engineering services to these institutions.

This is intended to further weaken Russia’s industrial capacities because they are highly dependent on services from EU states.

Services that are strictly necessary for the termination before 2 January 2023 of contracts concluded before 7 October 2022 or of ancillary contracts necessary for the execution of such contracts will however be exempt from these service bans for a limited transitional period.

Furthermore, these bans do not apply to certain services necessary to ensure access to the judicial system.

The exemption for Russian subsidiaries of EU companies still applies.

Finally, the ban in Article 5b(2)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 on providing crypto-asset wallet, account or custody services to Russian natural or legal persons has also been tightened by removing the previous threshold of EUR 10,000 and applying the ban irrespective of value.

Energy sector sanctions The new measures on crude oil and petroleum are a key part of the eighth sanctions package.

In particular, the EU has paved the way for the much-publicised “ oil price cap ” agreed by the G7 countries.

While the exact price limit still has to be negotiated by the EU and the G7 countries, the basic oil price cap mechanism has been laid down.

In addition to the prohibition already in force under Article 3n(1) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 on providing technical assistance, brokering services or financing or financial assistance related to the maritime transport to third countries of crude oil or petroleum products which originate in or are exported from Russia, there is now also a prohibition on the transport itself, including through ship-to-ship transfers.

According to the new Article 3n(4) Regulation (EU) 833/2014, the transportation of crude oil (from 5 December 2022) and of certain petroleum products (from 5 February 2023) originating in or exported from Russia to third countries, including through ship-to-ship transfer, will be prohibited."
Gleiss Lutz,"FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU, UK AND U.S. ADOPT FRESH SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA","However, according to paragraph 5, this prohibition will only come into force once the price cap has been set.

According to the new provision on the oil price cap in Article 3n(6)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014, European companies are to be allowed to export crude oil and petroleum products by ship to third countries despite the aforementioned prohibitions if the price remains below a predefined price cap.

The aim is to strike a balance between the conflicting interests of reducing Russia’s revenues and keeping global energy markets stable.

It should also limit inflation and the rise in energy prices.

The price cap will be set by the Price Cap Coalition and then reflected in Annex XXVIII of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

In practice, the price cap mechanism will be implemented through an attestation process, which will enable operators in the supply chain to provide proof of the purchase price they have paid.

The EU intends to issue guidance on the complex questions surrounding the price cap as soon as possible in order to facilitate uniform application and enable a level playing field in the EU and globally.

The nuclear energy sector continues to be exempt from restrictions.

The EU explicitly points out that none of the envisaged measures seeks to undermine the safety of civil nuclear capabilities or civil nuclear cooperation, in particular in the field of research and development, or to undermine the planning or construction of new nuclear facilities or the maintenance or fuel supply of existing facilities.

This includes allowing services and commercial activities to continue that are aimed at maintaining the safety of the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.

Another exemption has also been added to the transaction ban under Article 3k Regulation (EU) 833/2014, specifying that the authorities can approve a transaction if it is necessary for the maintenance and expansion of nuclear power plants.

New sanctions categories A completely new aspect of the complex web of sanctions is the possibility to add persons who circumvent existing sanctions or who facilitate or support circumvention by others to sanctions lists.

This also applies to circumvention by EU citizens.

One form of circumvention, for example, is purchasing goods in the EU, initially delivering them to third countries and then, after that, to Russia.

The EU hopes this will have a deterrent effect.

Finally, the EU has also prohibited nationals of its Member States from holding positions on supervisory boards and other governing bodies of certain state-owned companies in Russia after 22 October 2022 (Article 5aa(1a)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

As a result, persons who already hold such positions will likely be obliged to resign.

This regulation supplements existing bans on transactions with the Russian state-owned companies concerned.

The German government in particular had advocated for this step in view of ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s many years of work on the supervisory board of Russian oil company Rosneft, for which he had been harshly criticised.

UK sanctions On 26 September 2022, the UK also imposed new sanctions on Russia – some of which match the new EU sanctions – in response to the annexations and sham “referenda”.

These are mainly personal sanctions against the individuals and entities involved in carrying out the sham “referenda”, as well as against decision-makers of various state-controlled companies, including Gazprombank, Sberbank and Sovcombank, and “Putin’s favourite PR agency”, IMA Consulting.

As a result, more than 1200 individuals and 120 entities are now also subject to UK sanctions.

The United Kingdom additionally prohibits the provision of IT and legal advisory services, as well as architectural and engineering services.

Finally, export restrictions have also been imposed on some 700 other goods that Russia needs for its industrial and technological capabilities."
Gleiss Lutz,"FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU, UK AND U.S. ADOPT FRESH SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA","Finally, export restrictions have also been imposed on some 700 other goods that Russia needs for its industrial and technological capabilities.

U.S. sanctions On 30 September 2022, the U.S. also tightened its sanctions.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“ OFAC” ) has now added around 300 new entries to its specially designated nationals and blocked persons list (“ SDN List” ), including members of the Russian armed forces and Russian legislative bodies (for more on the legal consequences of the listing, see our newsletter of 7 March 2022 ).

Similar to the new EU regulation – under which EU citizens must also fear being listed themselves if they circumvent the sanctions or assist in such circumventions – the U.S. has also announced that any support for the war of aggression in Ukraine will also lead to comparable consequences in the U.S.

The U.S. has once again stressed that the OFAC sanctions do not apply to the sale or transport of Russian crude oil, petroleum products, LNG and coal products of Russian origin, except if such products are imported into the U.S.

On 15 September 2022, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (“ BIS” ) also tightened export controls under the Export Administration Regulations (“ EAR” ), by listing additional items affecting many industrial sectors, and extending the scope to Belarus.

Russia’s response Russia has responded to the comprehensive sanctions imposed by the EU and U.S. by taking further countermeasures and extending existing measures.

It has already enforced measures to preserve financial stability for some time, including a ban on cash exports exceeding USD 10,000 that it introduced on 2 March 2022.

No cash or financial instruments in foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of USD 10,000 may be taken out of the country.

This measure has now been extended until 9 March 2023.

It has also banned transfers abroad from Russian accounts by non-resident natural and legal persons from those states that have levied sanctions against Russia – a measure that will apply until 31 March 2023.

This means that Russia now has a wide range of capital controls in place.

In addition, Russia has ordered further export restrictions in the form of export quotas for sulphur (which is needed for fertiliser production), recycled paper, cardboard and precious metal waste.

Russia has also extended its personal sanctions, which primarily comprise bans on entering the Russian Federation, to cover other military personnel, politicians and actors from Western countries.

Moreover, a presidential decree entered into force on 8 September 2022 making legal transactions that directly or indirectly concern the establishment, modification or termination of rights to own, use or dispose of shares in Russian limited liability companies (Russian: OOO) subject to approval by the Government Commission on Monitoring Foreign Investment with immediate effect.

This will make it more difficult for Western companies to sell their Russian subsidiaries and stop doing business in Russia.

Conclusion and outlook: Response to the sanctions The EU believes that its sanctions have had a positive effect so far, arguing that Russia’s economy is clearly suffering as a result, with its capacity to manufacture and maintain weapons and other means of war having been weakened, in particular.

Yet for some Member States, such as Lithuania, the sanctions still don’t go far enough, especially given the numerous exemptions from certain prohibitions.

In some cases, however, these were specifically introduced due to pressure from other Member States that had made their consent to the sanctions packages contingent on such exemptions because of concerns about their own sources of supply and economies.

Contrary to the demands by some Member States and Ukrainian President Zelensky, the EU has largely exempted the Russian nuclear industry from sanctions."
Gleiss Lutz,"FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU, UK AND U.S. ADOPT FRESH SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA","Contrary to the demands by some Member States and Ukrainian President Zelensky, the EU has largely exempted the Russian nuclear industry from sanctions.

Russian uranium and nuclear technology may still be imported into the EU.

Considered by some as a major gap in the sanctions structure, others see it as a reasonable step given that the EU continues to be dependent on Russia in these areas and would be “shooting itself in the foot” if it were to impose sanctions here.

Practical consequences and outlook The import and export bans are now so wide-ranging and complex – also covering “unlikely” goods (for example, under Article 3i or the related Annex XXI) – that particular caution is required.

Companies that have business dealings with Russia should reclassify their goods and materials from scratch based on the new lists of goods.

Unfortunately, the EU has only added a very limited number of exceptions to existing import bans.

This has done little to alleviate the problem – already addressed in our last newsletter of 28 July 2022 ) – of critical infrastructures and industries within the EU being affected by the import restrictions.

Businesses also need to be wary of the Russian government’s new approval requirements for shares in limited liability companies, which have so far (unlike stocks) been freely transferable, when contemplating reorganisation or withdrawal from business dealings with Russia.

There is currently no end in sight to the war of aggression – or to the resulting sanctions.

The EU has in the meantime extended its sanctions until 15 March 2023.

Companies need to monitor the complicated web of EU and U.S. sanctions as well as Russian countersanctions, and adapt their business operations accordingly.

We will continue to keep you posted on future developments.

Update on EU criminal sanctions law After the EU had already laid the groundwork for the introduction of uniform EU criminal sanctions legislation on 7 July 2022 ( see our newsletter of 28 July 2022 ), the Bundestag adopted a corresponding bill on 29 September 2022.

Once the Bundesrat approves this bill and the law enters into force, the Council Decision extending EU criminal law powers to cover violations of sanctions can also be adopted, opening the way for an EU harmonisation directive.

We will continue to report on further developments in this area."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF THE NEW GERMAN ANTITRUST ACT,"On 26 September 2022, less than two years after the last material changes to the German Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen, “GWB” ) entered into force, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz ) published the draft of the new German Antitrust Act (the so-called “11th Amendment to the GWB, or “Competition Enforcement Act”, Wettbewerbsdurchsetzungsgesetz ).

Although the timetable for the legislative process has not yet been finalised, initial consultations on the draft are set to take place as early as October, meaning that the legislative process is likely to move quickly.

According to the Ministry, the aim of the amendment is to strengthen competition “ where the market structure impedes competition

[...] ” – providing better remedies for significant disruptions of competition that are not based on antitrust violations or abusive practices of a dominant company.

1.

Key new provisions of the draft: Introduction of new British-style intervention mechanisms (sections 32e and 32f of the draft): New intervention mechanisms will allow the Federal Cartel Office ( Bundeskartellamt ) to follow up on a sector inquiry by quickly and effectively remedying significant disruptions of competition.

In future, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to impose remedies following sector inquiries in order to enforce effective competition.

These remedies will primarily include behavioural or quasi-structural measures , such as obligations regarding access to interfaces or data, the setting of common standards, requirements for certain forms of contracts, including contractual provisions on the disclosure of information as well as obligations regarding the organisational separation of company divisions.

As a measure of last resort , the Bundeskartellamt can even impose a divestiture of parts of the company or its assets – regardless of whether or not a company engaged in anti-competitive practices – to eliminate a significant, ongoing or repeated disruption of competition.

In addition, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to force companies in certain markets to notify practically any merger – regardless of whether or not it meets the relevant thresholds – after a sector inquiry has been completed.

This new regime would replace and tighten the existing provisions of section 39a GWB.

Simplified disgorgement of benefits derived from antitrust violations (section 34 of the draft):

Benefits derived by companies from antitrust violations are to be disgorged more easily and effectively in future.

The draft introduces a (rebuttable) presumption that a company has obtained a benefit amounting to 1% of its domestic turnover with the product or service relating to the proven antitrust violation.

A cap of 10% of the total annual group turnover worldwide in the year prior to the authority’s decision is intended to alleviate hardship.

Disgorgement will not require culpability .

Amendment of the procedural provisions for enforcement of the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”):

At the same time, the draft will create the legal basis for the Bundeskartellamt ’s support of the European Commission in enforcing the DMA.

It also aims at ensuring effective private enforcement of the DMA in German courts.

2. 

Specifically: Sector inquiries (section 32e of the draft) In future, sector inquiries under section 32e of the draft may have more serious repercussions.

So far, the Bundeskartellamt ’s sector inquiries have largely been without consequences, with most of them merely resulting in final reports (for example, the final reports on the fuel sector (2011), on electricity generation and wholesale markets (2011), on buyer power in the food retail sector (2014) or most recently on hospitals (2021) as well as on the collection of household waste (2021)."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF THE NEW GERMAN ANTITRUST ACT,"It was only the sector inquiries into rolled asphalt (2012) and cement and ready-mixed concrete (2017) that led to an extensive unbundling of joint ventures; this was, however, based on administrative proceedings initiated on the basis of the German equivalent to Article 101 TFEU.

Under the new provisions, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to intervene on competition concerns without having to prove any specific antitrust violations.

Under section 32e(3) of the draft, sector inquiries are to last a maximum of 18 months .

This is intended to strengthen effectiveness and enable intervention in markets before circumstances have changed.

Section 32e(4) of the draft will obligate the Bundeskartellamt to publish interim, or at least final, reports (so far only voluntary).

These reports may include recommendations to the German Government regarding competition policy.

In future, it will also be possible to carry out seizures as part of sector inquiries.

At the heart of the new market structure intervention mechanism – a major change – is the new section 32f of the draft , which grants the Bundeskartellamt far-reaching powers to intervene following publication of a final sector inquiry report.

Under section 32f(3) and (4) of the draft, this power can be exercised if there is “ significant, ongoing or repeated disruption of competition in at least one market or across multiple markets ”.

Section 32f(5) of the draft further provides for a list of definition criteria .

Depending on the scenario, they are intended to be considered either in isolation or cumulatively as part of an overall assessment determining whether there is significant disruption of competition.

They partially draw upon the same factors as those that are relevant to determine market dominance, but also include market outcomes and behaviours that negatively affect competition in the overall assessment.

Section 32f(3) of the draft provides for the general power to use all necessary behavioural or structural measures in order to remedy the identified disruption of competition.

Behavioural remedies will generally take precedence.

This creates a new tool for an ongoing control of the market following the imposition of behavioural remedies – which is very different from the preventive intervention on the market structure by merger control.

The ultimate structural measure, i.e. a divestiture of parts of the business (section 32f(4) of the draft), is to be used as a remedy of last resort , i.e. only where the disruption of competition cannot be remedied or significantly reduced by other means.

If a company offers (voluntary) commitments, the Bundeskartellamt may use its discretion and refrain from exercising its powers under section 32f(3) and (4) of the draft.

Section 32f(7) of the draft specifies that remedies under section 32f must be generally ordered within a period of 18 months , in order to ensure swift action by the Bundeskartellamt .

According to the explanatory memorandum, remedies pursuant to section 32f of the draft can also be considered for sector inquiries that are already underway and that are only completed after the new provisions come into force.

This could apply, for example, to the current sector inquiry regarding online advertising.

As indicated in its recently published interim report, the Bundeskartellamt is already considering the possible need for far-reaching regulatory intervention.

Expanded merger control by way of individual orders Under the existing rules (section 39a), the Bundeskartellamt can already order companies in specific industries to notify concentrations – even if these fall below the German thresholds – for a period of three years if the respective industries were previously the subject of a sector inquiry.

According to the draft, this only recently introduced provision is to be moved – in a stricter form – to section 32f(2)."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF THE NEW GERMAN ANTITRUST ACT,"According to the draft, this only recently introduced provision is to be moved – in a stricter form – to section 32f(2).

The key triggers are objectively verifiable indications that competition will be significantly impeded by future concentrations combined with minimum domestic turnover thresholds that have to be met: EUR 50 million for the acquirer and EUR 0.5 million for the target company .

As per the current rules, the notification obligation and therefore the prohibition to implement a concentration before clearance is to apply for three years from the date of service of the order and may be extended by three years multiple times .

The 18-month period will also apply to merger control orders based on section 32f(2) of the draft.

A relatively easy to overlook provision in section 187(11) of the draft stipulates that the merger control provision of section 32f(2) will have retroactive effect for sector inquiries already completed when the new rules come into force, if the final report was published less than a year before.

This is to enable the Bundeskartellamt to launch further sector inquiries before the new draft comes into force and to use these as the basis for merger control orders under the new law.

Simplified disgorgement of benefits The explanatory memorandum to the draft points out that the current legal hurdles for the disgorgement of benefits are too high and that the relevant provisions are therefore not applied in practice.

As things currently stand, the Bundeskartellamt must, for example, carry out complex calculations of the economic benefit and prove that a company acted intentionally or negligently.

According to the new section 34(4) of the draft, culpability is to have no bearing on whether benefits must be disgorged.

According to the explanatory memorandum, it is sufficient if the benefit has been derived from an objective violation of antitrust law.

The draft also lays down a blanket presumption that a company has derived a benefit amounting to 1% of its domestic turnover with the product or service relating to the proven antitrust violation over the entire period of the violation.

This is, however, capped at 10% of the total annual group turnover worldwide in the year prior to the authority’s decision.

The explanatory memorandum refers to the Federal Court of Justice’s rulings on cartel damages actions under civil law as regards the type and extent of such blanket presumptions.

The presumption can only be rebutted if the company proves that neither the legal entity directly involved in the violation nor the company as a whole achieved a profit in the relevant amount during the period concerned.

The draft does not comment on whether the 1% rule also applies to violations committed before its entry into force, which is likely to lead to some legal uncertainty in this regard.

Finally, section 34(5) of the draft extends the formal deadline for ordering the disgorgement of benefits from seven to ten years from the end of the violation.

Amendment of the procedural provisions relating to the DMA

The amendments relating to the DMA essentially entrust the Bundeskartellamt with the power to start investigations in connection with possible violations of Articles 5, 6 and 7 DMA (see section 32g of the draft).

In addition, private enforcement options are to be strengthened.

Basically, the provisions for facilitating private enforcement in antitrust proceedings are also declared applicable in the DMA context where appropriate, and some of the simplifications for private antitrust actions are also to apply.

In particular, a final decision of the European Commission finding that the obligations pursuant to Articles 5-7 DMA have been violated is to have binding effect in follow-on damages proceedings before German courts.

This will considerably strengthen Germany’s position as the place of jurisdiction for such lawsuits."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT OF THE NEW GERMAN ANTITRUST ACT,"This will considerably strengthen Germany’s position as the place of jurisdiction for such lawsuits.

Also, jurisdiction is to be centralised so that the court divisions responsible for antitrust matters will also have jurisdiction as far as DMA-related disputes are concerned (sections 87, 89(1) of the draft).

Finally, the Bundeskartellamt gets the right to take part in court proceedings relating to the DMA. 3.

Assessment The draft significantly bolsters the Bundeskartellamt ’s powers by adding new intervention mechanisms.

The planned market structure control, which will not be based on violations or abuses, is intended to provide antitrust law with a fourth pillar alongside the prohibition of cartels, abuse control and (preventive) merger control.

The proposed amendments reflect the recent debate on competition policy.

The intervention powers of the competition authorities are considered insufficient in the case of a disruption of competition that lacks a demonstrable infringement and could have causes related to market structure.

In such cases, the Bundeskartellamt will not only be able to prevent negative structural changes (merger control), it will also be able to actively promote what it considers preferable structures.

The explanatory memorandum to the draft refers to the ideas developed in the now discarded New Competition Tool of the European Commission and the DMA as well as to the UK practice of sector inquiries.

The memorandum does not single out any specific sectors, but the Ministry’s press release refers – by way of example – to the situation at the “ petrol stations ” and to sectors such as construction materials, airport, transport, finance, and food retail, in which, based on a similar mechanism in the UK, competition has supposedly been boosted by the CMA.

There are conflicting assessments as to whether the described gap in the law actually exists.

The debate will be continued in the legislative process.

The planned intervention powers signal a paradigm shift for antitrust law: In future, even internal growth, efficiency and economic success in fair competition could be grounds for intervention.

Therefore, these new mechanisms will have to be carefully scrutinised from a constitutional law perspective on the basis of Article 12 and Article 14 of the German constitution ( Grundgesetz ).

The new rules also allow the Bundeskartellamt to further expand preventive merger control below the current thresholds.

This is also consistent with parallel developments at European level, as shown by the European Commission’s new stance on referrals under Article 22 EU Merger Regulation, including from Member States that did not have original jurisdiction.

This significantly reduces legal certainty for mergers and acquisitions.

The constitutional standards will also have to be carefully re-examined in the case of the simplified disgorgement of benefits.

There are currently no provisions governing the relationship with antitrust damage claims or allowing for any privileged treatment of leniency applicants.

Amendments in this respect could be useful.

Please note, that the draft is merely intended to implement the first part of the Ministry’s competition policy agenda of February 2022, which sets out ten points for achieving sustainable competition and fleshing out what was agreed in the coalition agreement.

Further elements of the ten-point agenda – such as more legal certainty for co-operations between companies aimed at greater sustainability and stronger consumer protection – are to be addressed in the next amendment before the end of this legislative period (i.e. 2025).

The Ministry will therefore likely want to implement this current draft as quickly as possible."
Gleiss Lutz,DRAFT DIRECTIVE ON PLATFORM WORK,"At the beginning of December 2021, the EU Commission presented a draft directive on improving working conditions in platform work.

The aim of the draft is to ensure legal certainty and transparency for the roughly 28 million platform workers currently working in the EU.

Background Digital labour platforms seem to be the trend.

They offer their customers – usually via an app – various services “at the push of a button”, e.g. the delivery of goods or the provision of cleaning or care services.

Currently, over 28 million people in the EU work via digital labour platforms.

This number is expected to increase to 43 million by 2025.

Many of these platform workers are self-employed.

However, it is estimated that up to 5.5 million people who provide services via digital labour platforms could be classified as “false self-employed”.

Digital labour platforms also often use automated systems.

Tasks are assigned to platform workers and the performance of the tasks is monitored or evaluated based on algorithms.

The EU Commission considers the transparency of such systems to be insufficient.

New rules The key aspects of the draft directive are legal certainty regarding the legal employment status of platform workers as well as greater transparency in the use of algorithms by platform operators.

1.

Legal employment status With regard to the legal employment status, a rebuttable presumption of the existence of an employment relationship shall apply if at least two of the following criteria are met by the relevant digital labour platform: It sets the amount of, or an upper limit for, the level of remuneration; It determines specific binding rules with regard to appearance and conduct; It supervises the performance of work, including by electronic means; It restricts possibilities to freely choose one’s working hours or periods of absence, to accept or to refuse tasks or to use subcontractors or substitutes; It restricts the possibility to build a client base or to perform work for any third party.

If the presumption applies, the platform operator must prove that the contractual relationship in question does not actually qualify as an employment relationship.

2. Transparency in the use of algorithms In order to increase transparency in the use of the platform for the persons concerned, information rights are to be created.

Platform workers will also be given the right to have automated decisions reviewed by a real person if the decision in question has a significant impact on their working conditions.

For decisions by the platform regarding the restriction, suspension or termination of the platform worker’s account, the refusal of remuneration for work performed by the platform worker, the contractual status of the platform worker or for any decision with similar effect, the draft provides that the person concerned must be given a written statement of reasons.

The platform worker concerned may request a review of such decisions.

The transparency rules apply to both employed and self-employed platform workers.

Gleiss Lutz comments It will be interesting to see how the situation evolves based on the draft directive.

The next step would be for the legislator to transpose the directive into national law.

Here it seems conceivable that the introduction of a rebuttable presumption could also serve as a template for the legal employment status of workers in other industrial sectors.

Depending on how the criteria for determining whether the presumption applies are set up, this could be a way to increase legal certainty for the important issue of differentiating between employees and freelancers and to minimise the associated risks – under social insurance and criminal law – of having to make retroactive contributions on pay."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLANS: GERMAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TAX BREAKS,"The Federal Government plans to make the tax treatment of employee share purchase plans (ESPPs) more attractive as part of the new Future Financing Act (Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz).

A recent first (ministerial) draft act provides for a number of tax concessions: ESPPs: tax exemption increased to EUR 5,000 Employees’ monetary benefits from shares in their employer company awarded free or acquired at a discount are subject to income and wage tax to the extent the tax exemption is exceeded.

This tax exemption, which was already raised to EUR 1,440 per calendar year in 2021, is to be increased to EUR 5,000 under the (ministerial) draft act.

For the exemption to apply, the shares must still generally be offered to all employees and granted in addition to the salary already owed.

Although this increase would not match similar tax exemptions in other European countries with a pronounced employee ownership culture, it still significantly boosts the attractiveness of share-based compensation plans.

Start-ups: special provision for ESPPs expanded A special provision for the taxation of ESPPs in start-ups already stipulates that monetary benefits from the award or discounted acquisition of shares are generally only subject to income and wage tax when the employee leaves the company, sells the shares, or after a period of 12 years has lapsed – provided that the start-up itself meets certain criteria.

The draft act aims to increase the number of start-ups that can benefit from the special provision by raising the companies’ maximum age from 12 to 20 years.

It also doubles the size-dependent thresholds and extends their duration: Under the draft act, the special regime will apply to companies that have (i) less than 500 employees and (ii) annual sales of no more than EUR 100 million or total assets of no more than EUR 86 million, each in the year in which the equity compensation is granted or in one of the six preceding calendar years.

The maximum deferral of taxation is to be extended from 12 to 20 years.

If an employer additionally assumes liability for any wage tax, taxation will even be deferred indefinitely until the shares are sold and thus also beyond the employee’s exit from the company.

The draft act also provides for the possibility of lump-sum wage taxation of monetary benefits from ESPPs; under this option, a reduced tax rate of 25% applies as opposed to the employee’s personal tax rate of up to 45% (in each case plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, where applicable).

In a next step, the Federal Cabinet will discuss the draft Future Financing Act, before it is submitted to parliamentary procedure; pursuant to the draft act, the Future Financing Act is to enter into force this year.

Equity-based compensation plans are a popular and effective tool for long-term staff retention and incentivising top performers.

Gleiss Lutz,PROHIBITION OF MANIFESTING RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS IN THE WORKPLACE,"A provision in an undertaking’s terms of employment which prohibits workers from manifesting their religious or philosophical beliefs in any way does not constitute direct discrimination and is compatible with EU law.

ECJ, judgment of 13 October 2022 – C-344/20 Background

The defendant in the main proceedings, which were conducted before a Belgian labour court, lets and operates social housing.

It has issued a neutrality rule for its undertaking, applicable to all of its workers, that prohibits them from manifesting religious, philosophical or political beliefs through clothing or in any other way.

The applicant applied to the defendant for a six-week unpaid internship as part of her vocational studies.

She is of the Muslim faith and wears a headscarf as a manifestation of her belief.

The defendant was prepared to employ the applicant subject to the condition that she comply with the neutrality rule and remove her headscarf at work.

Since the applicant refused to do so, an internship agreement was not concluded.

In her opinion, the defendant’s decision not to hire her was directly based on her religious belief.

In the main proceeding, she sought a declaration that the defendant thereby infringed the provisions of Belgium’s General Anti-Discrimination Law.

Since it was adopted in order to transpose Directive 2000/78/EC, it must be interpreted in conformity with the Directive in the main proceedings.

The Belgian court had stayed the proceedings and referred a number of questions on the interpretation of Directive 2000/78/EC to the ECJ.

ECJ’s decision The ECJ held that “religion” and “belief” are two different facets of a single ground of discrimination.

This is to be distinguished from “political or any other opinion” cited in the defendant’s terms of employment which comprise a separate ground of discrimination.

However, these aspects are not mentioned in the Directive and therefore do not fall within its scope.

The ECJ then addressed the question of whether the defendant’s terms of employment have the effect of directly discriminating against those employees who wish to manifest their religious or philosophical beliefs externally.

In this connection, it made reference to the distinction drawn in its previous case law, namely that such direct discrimination exists if the requirement of neutrality only applies to certain forms or types of expression which are inextricably linked to a specific religion or belief, while a prohibition that applies in an undifferentiated way to all workers and all forms of expression does not constitute direct discrimination.

But this could lead to indirect discrimination if the apparently neutral obligation actually puts persons adhering to a particular religion or belief at a particular disadvantage.

Such indirect discrimination, however, could be objectively justified by a legitimate aim.

If an employer’s aim is to project an image of political, religious and philosophical neutrality to its customers and the general public, and it has an understandable need to do so, then this aim is to be regarded as legitimate.

Finally, the ECJ addresses a provision of national law that treats “religious belief” and “philosophical belief” as two separate grounds of discrimination.

The court in the main proceedings referred to the ECJ the question of whether such a law could be regarded as a provision that was more favourable than the standard in the Directive, which would be permitted by Article 8 of Directive 2000/78/EC.

The ECJ held that this was not the case and considered the splitting of a single ground of discrimination into several grounds to be contrary to European law.

It found that this approach is not covered by the fundamental right of a Member State – when balancing diverging interests – to ascribe greater importance to a specific ground of discrimination due to factors specific to that Member State."
Gleiss Lutz,PROHIBITION OF MANIFESTING RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS IN THE WORKPLACE,"Our assessment The ECJ thus upholds its previous case law on general neutrality rules of an employer which discriminate against workers based on a manifestation of their religious or philosophical beliefs, making reference to its previous judgments in the Bougnaoui, WABE and MH Müller Handel cases.

It remains the case that such internal company rules must apply to all employees in a general and undifferentiated way.

Any indirect disadvantaging that might be associated with this can be justified by the employer’s understandable need to project a politically, religiously and philosophically neutral image.

This position of the ECJ can now be described as settled case law."
Gleiss Lutz,THE DIGITAL ACT: A BOOST FOR DIGITALISATION IN GERMAN HEALTHCARE,"Now that both houses of the German parliament have passed the new Digital Act ( Digital-Gesetz , “DigiG”), the German healthcare system has certainty regarding the substance of the Act.

The DigiG will be promulgated in the Federal Law Gazette within the next few days, and will have a major impact on the introduction and functionality of both the electronic patient record ( elektronische Patientenakte, ePa ) and the standardised e-prescription, on digital health applications ( Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen, DiGAs ), and on the range of telemedicine services on offer.

In tandem with the Health Data Use Act ( Gesundheitsdatennutzungsgesetz ) ( article of 13 February 2024 , German only), passed at the same time, the DigiG is another milestone towards achieving the Federal Government’s goal of making Germany’s healthcare system more digital, more user-friendly and more efficient.

1. Obligatory e-prescription of pharmaceuticals in Germany Electronic prescriptions (“e-prescriptions”, E-Rezepte ) were introduced back in 2022.

But their obligatory use across Germany failed until now on account of the e-prescription’s technical requirements and due to data protection concerns.

The e-prescription is undergoing further development on the basis of the DigiG, and has been the binding standard in pharmaceutical supply since 1 January 2024.

How e-prescriptions work Physicians issue an e-prescription digitally, signing it electronically with their health professional card.

It is then stored and encrypted in the telematics infrastructure, where pharmacies can access it later.

On the technical side, practices need an electronic health professional card, a link to the telematics infrastructure with a corresponding connector, and a practice management system that meets e-prescription requirements.

Patients receive an access code (known as an e-prescription token) that they then give the pharmacy for the prescription to be filled.

Pharmacies are obliged to fill e-prescriptions.

There are various technical ways of sending the token to the patients and of having the prescription filled by the pharmacy: The e-prescription app is available as a digital solution.

The token can also be printed out on paper and given to the pharmacy as before.

Since 1 July 2023 it has also been possible to have the e-prescription filled using the electronic health card, which needs to be inserted into a corresponding reader at the pharmacy.

A new option became available on 1 January 2024: all private and statutory health insurance (SHI) funds may now include a function in their electronic patient record apps enabling e-prescriptions to be received and filled.

Integrating e-prescriptions into the electronic patient record With regards to integrating e-prescriptions into the electronic patient record, the DigiG provides for more than merely showing an e-prescription on the app’s user interface.

Unless the patient objects, further data will be sent to the electronic patient record, including the drugs dispensed, their batch number, and their dosage (“dispenser information”).

So here as well, legislators have gone for an opt-out procedure that reverses the previous concept based on patient consent.

In future, data transfer will form one of the pillars of a digitally supported medication process.

Together with further information on allergies, intolerances, pregnancies etc., the data will be made available to practices (unless the patient objects) and taken into account when prescribing drugs.

For effective therapy, the interplay of e-prescription and electronic patient record promises added value in avoiding double prescriptions and improving drug safety, as physicians can better judge interactions with drugs already prescribed or with existing conditions.

But that is not all.

Germany’s healthcare telematics body, gematik, has been given new powers and taken on new tasks in shaping the e-prescription and developing the electronic patient record."
Gleiss Lutz,THE DIGITAL ACT: A BOOST FOR DIGITALISATION IN GERMAN HEALTHCARE,"But that is not all.

Germany’s healthcare telematics body, gematik, has been given new powers and taken on new tasks in shaping the e-prescription and developing the electronic patient record.

E-prescriptions have only covered prescription drugs to date It is likely that e-prescriptions will cover all medicinal products in future.

Currently, only prescription drugs fall under the scope of e-prescriptions, but this scope is to be gradually expanded.

Section 360 Social Security Code, Book V ( Sozialgesetzbuch (SGB) Fünftes Buch , “SGB V”) is the main statutory provision on e-prescriptions and sets deadlines for this expansion.

As the obligatory introduction of the e-prescription was delayed, however, the deadlines have been revised yet again and the DigiG amended in line with the new section 360 SGB V.

The following overview shows the schedule for extending e-prescriptions to other benefits: The e-prescription’s likely impact E-prescriptions will simplify how prescriptions are issued, sent and filled in everyday practice.

But online pharmacies and pharmacy platforms are also likely to benefit, as will logistics service providers that offer prompt delivery to patients directly on pharmacies’ behalf.

Thus far, e-prescriptions have played barely any practical role in this regard.

For this reason, they have not yet made a tangible contribution to modernising the provision of pharmaceuticals in line with customer needs.

These improvements in the use of telemedicine applications will further stimulate this industry, which is still in its infancy.

2.

Digital health applications (DiGAs) and telemedicine The DigiG will also significantly transform the regulatory requirements for “prescription apps”, and the following section discusses the most important planned changes for patients and digital health app developers.

There are several regulatory improvements for telemedicine applications, too.

Digital health apps as an innovative component of standard care The introduction of the Digital Healthcare Act ( Digitale-Versorgungs-Gesetz , “DVG”) in 2019 laid the groundwork for the integration of digital health apps into standard care in Germany.

An innovative industry of digital medical device manufacturers has since emerged, with 56 apps currently listed in the official digital health applications directory of the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte , “BfArM”).

Six applications (provisionally) authorised as digital health apps have been removed from the list either at the request of the manufacturer or because no positive healthcare effect could be demonstrated.

The following provisions in the DigiG are aimed at increasing still further the role digital health apps will play in healthcare.

Digital health apps on par with other remedies and aids Digital health apps are now treated the same way as other remedies and aids under the law, with patients now having a right to use these apps.

Availability for use within two working days Aside from in a number of tightly restricted cases, SHI funds must ensure that digital health apps are available for use by patients within two working days of receipt of the prescription.

There is no requirement for SHI approval, nor may SHI funds create de facto approval requirements, as such requirements would jeopardise prompt provision of care.

Digital health apps in higher risk classes Under current legislation, only digital medical devices in risk class I (according to the classification rules of Annex VIII to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR)) may be prescribed as digital health apps.

The DigiG extends statutory entitlement to such apps to include higher risk classes – specifically those in risk class IIb.

In future, therefore, it will also be possible to use digital health applications in more complex therapeutic processes, for remote patient monitoring for example."
Gleiss Lutz,THE DIGITAL ACT: A BOOST FOR DIGITALISATION IN GERMAN HEALTHCARE,"In future, therefore, it will also be possible to use digital health applications in more complex therapeutic processes, for remote patient monitoring for example.

This opens up completely new opportunities for digital health app developers.

Approval of digital health apps in such risk classes logically requires proof of direct medical benefit ( “medizinischer Nutzen” ) to the patient (such as an improvement in the state of health), and not just proof of a structural or procedural improvement in medical care that has a positive effect for the patient ( “positiver Versorgungseffekt” ).

“Companion apps” not covered The DigiG does, however, limit the scope of what constitutes a digital health app: Approval will not be granted for apps that are used only to manage therapeutic products or are (permanently) linked to very specific medical aids or medicinal products.

Performance-based pricing to become mandatory The way digital health apps are priced will change, with performance-based criteria playing a greater role.

The DigiG stipulates, for example, that performance-based price components must comprise at least 20 percent of the remuneration amount.

Transitional periods will apply to apps with an existing price agreement.

Exactly how prices will be structured in future remains an open question.

DigiG no longer stipulates expiry of remuneration claim if patient declares non-use The DigiG’s initial draft provided that a digital health app developer’s claim to remuneration would lapse if the patient indicated within 14 days of using the app for the first time that he/she would not use it on a permanent basis.

This new provision, which would have caused considerable uncertainty for digital health app developers, was removed in the course of the legislative process after severe criticism.

Expansion of ban on referrals and agreements The existing ban on referrals and agreements will be expanded.

Developers of digital health apps will no longer be permitted to enter into legal transactions or agreements with medicinal product or medical aid manufacturers that are likely to restrict a patient’s freedom to choose specific products or aids.

The Federal Government sees this as a way of preventing lock-in effects.

It will therefore become unlawful to design digital health apps tailored to accompany treatment involving only one particular medicinal product or medical aid.

Technical equipment to become available on loan In some cases digital health app developers will have to allow patients to borrow the technical equipment required to use their apps.

By making it possible to borrow expensive accompanying hardware, the Federal Government hopes to reduce costs and increase sustainability.

However, it is not yet clear in which cases this will apply.

Digital health apps during pregnancy The aim is to treat digital health apps the same as any other remedies and aids offered to pregnant women and new mothers.

This means that women will have the right to use relevant digital health apps both during and after pregnancy.

Patient authentication Patients will be able to decide for themselves what level of authentication is required for access to a digital health app and may even opt for less stringent access requirements.

Monitoring digital health apps The performance of all digital health apps listed in the directory must be assessed and the results reported to the BfArM on an ongoing basis.

The results are also to be published in the directory from 1 January 2026 onwards.

As already mentioned, part of a digital health app developer’s remuneration will in future depend on these results.

Breakout moment for telemedicine In future, telemedicine apps will be part and parcel of healthcare, which is why the DigiG has lifted the previous restrictions on volumes."
Gleiss Lutz,THE DIGITAL ACT: A BOOST FOR DIGITALISATION IN GERMAN HEALTHCARE,"Breakout moment for telemedicine In future, telemedicine apps will be part and parcel of healthcare, which is why the DigiG has lifted the previous restrictions on volumes. 

Once the German medical profession’s self-governing bodies have implemented the Act, SHI-accredited physicians will have greater flexibility and scope in offering video consultations.

Assisted telemedicine in pharmacies will also provide low-threshold access to healthcare, it is hoped.

In addition, the DigiG enables telemedicine services to be performed by outpatient clinics linked to universities and psychiatric institutions as well as by psychotherapists as part of their consultation hours.

This will benefit both patients and telemedicine providers overall."
Gleiss Lutz,Prohibition of products made with forced labour,"Companies are in future to be prevented from placing or making available on the Union market or exporting from it any products that are made with forced labour.

This is the aim of the proposed Forced Labour Regulation (the “Regulation”) adopted by the European Parliament on 23 April 2024 subsequent to trilogue negotiations in Brussels on the European Council’s proposal of 26 January 2024, itself a response to the European Commission’s initial proposal of 24 September 2022 and the European Parliament’s response of 8 November 2023.

The Regulation has not yet been formally approved by the Council of the European Union.

The Regulation extends the EU’s much-discussed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“ CS3D ”) to include the goal of abolishing forced labour by 2030.

This is to be achieved by a specific prohibition on products made with forced labour, rather than via corporate due diligence as a “best efforts” obligation.

The prohibition is to apply to all economic operators , regardless of size, legal form and production location.

If the Council approves the Regulation, it will enter into force 36 months (Article 39 Regulation) after publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Pursuant to Article 11, the Commission plans to provide implementation guidelines within 18 months of the Regulation’s official publication.

l. Objective of the proposal The international community aspires to abolish forced labour by 2030.

The fact that forced labour remains an issue is highlighted by figures from the International Labour Organization (“ ILO” ) which show there to be 27.6 million people worldwide who perform forced labour , with marginalised groups, especially children , at particular risk of exploitation.

The proposal aims to counter this via the indirect approach of a system to investigate, identify and end human rights violations in the value chain of products.

ll.

What is to be prohibited?

Article 3 Regulation prohibits products made with forced labour from being placed or made available on the Union market and from being exported.

“Forced labour”, including forced child labour, is all work or service exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily (Article 2(a) Regulation in conjunction with Article 2 of the ILO’s Convention on Forced Labour, 1930 (No. 29)).

The same definition of forced labour can be found in the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ).

The prohibition is aimed at all economic operators with no differentiation by company size , location or legal form (see Article 2(i) Regulation).

lll.

What products are affected?

The Regulation covers any product that can be valued in money and, as such, is capable of forming the subject of commercial transactions (Article 2(f) Regulation).

Whether a product is extracted, harvested, produced or manufactured is irrelevant, and any working or processing related to a product at any stage of the supply chain is included in the provision’s scope.

The Regulation therefore encompasses all products (including their components) in all sectors of industry and irrespective of their origin.

lV. How are possible violations identified?

Whether a product has been made with forced labour is determined by way of investigations by the lead competent authorities , cf.

Article 17 Regulation.

Which authority acts as lead depends on whether the forced labour is suspected on the territory of an EU Member State or outside the EU (Article 15 Regulation).

If forced labour is suspected outside of the EU, the Commission takes the role of lead, in all other cases an authority based in the respective Member State.

In future, therefore, the Commission will play a key role in identifying violations of the Regulation."
Gleiss Lutz,Prohibition of products made with forced labour,"In future, therefore, the Commission will play a key role in identifying violations of the Regulation.

A full investigation of the products and economic operators concerned will only be launched by the respective authority once a preliminary investigation has indicated a substantiated concern of a violation, meaning that it is the preliminary investigation that determines whether a main investigation will be initiated and a potential violation will be examined in detail.

A central Union Network consisting of representatives of the Commission and the Member States, including representatives of customs authorities where necessary, is to be set up to coordinate the fight against forced labour across the EU (Article 6 Regulation).

The Commission will be in charge of coordinating this network.

The network’s tasks will include gathering information, setting priorities in the fight against products made by forced labour, and coordinating investigations.

1.

Likelihood assessed on a risk-based approach The authorities are to follow a risk-based approach in assessing the likelihood of a violation (Article 14(1) Regulation), taking account of all the available information (Article 14(3) Regulation) including Information and decisions encoded in the information and communication system for market surveillance , including any past cases of (non-)compliance by an economic operator (letter a); The database established by the Commission pursuant to Article 8 Regulation listing forced labour risks with respect to certain products and geographic areas (letter b); Risk indicators and other information pursuant to Article 11(e) Regulation, including reports from international organisations , in particular the ILO, civil society, business organisations, trade unions and experience from implementing Union legislation, setting out due diligence requirements with respect to forced labour (letter c); Submissions of information on alleged violations , pursuant to Article 9 Regulation (letter d); Information received by the competent authority from other authorities relevant for the implementation of the Regulation, such as national due diligence, labour, health or fiscal authorities, on the products and economic operators under assessment (letter e); Consultations with relevant stakeholders such as civil society organisations and trade unions (letter f).

When initiating a preliminary investigation, competent authorities are to focus on those points in the supply chain where the forced labour is most likely to occur and with the greatest leverage in terms of reducing and stopping forced labour, cf.

Article 14(4) Regulation.

The authorities will be required to take into account the economic operators’ size and resources (in particular, whether the operator is an SME), the quantity of products concerned, the extent of suspected forced labour, and the share of that forced labour in the final product.

2. Information from economic operators During the preliminary investigation, the competent authorities must ask the economic operator for information about the actions it is currently taking to identify, prevent, mitigate or bring to an end the risk of forced labour in its operations and supply chains (Article 17(1) Regulation).

The economic operator has 30 working days in which to respond (Article 17(3) Regulation).

Within 30 working days of receiving the economic operator’s response, the competent authorities must close the preliminary investigation by deciding whether there is a substantiated concern of a violation or not (Article 17(3) Regulation).

3. (Un-) Substantiated concern Where the competent authorities consider there to be no substantiated concern, no main investigation is to be instigated and the economic operator(s) concerned are to be informed accordingly (Article 17(6) Regulation)."
Gleiss Lutz,Prohibition of products made with forced labour,"Where a substantiated concern is found, the competent authority that leads an investigation into the products and economic operators concerned starts this investigation by communicating their decision through the information and communication system (Article 18(1), (2) Regulation).

V.

How does the main investigation work?

The lead competent authority notifies the economic operator(s) concerned within three working days of the decision’s issue date about the initiation of the investigation and its possible consequences (letter a), the products subject to the investigation (letter b), the reasons for the initiation of the investigation, unless this puts the investigation’s outcome at risk (letter c), and the possibility of submitting further documents and information to the competent authority (letter d) (Article 18(1) Regulation).

Should the competent authorities so request, the economic operator(s) concerned are to submit any information relevant and necessary for the investigation (Article 18(3) Regulation), including information identifying the products under investigation, the manufacturer or producer of such products and the product suppliers .

To this end, the competent authorities are to set a deadline of between 30 and 60 days (Article 18(4) Regulation).

An extension of this deadline can be requested if justification can be provided.

In this respect, too, the competent authorities are to prioritise the economic operators involved at those points in the supply chain where the forced labour is most likely to occur (Article 18(3) Regulation).

The prioritisation is based on the following criteria: the size and economic resources of the economic operators, the quantity of the products concerned and the scale of the suspected forced labour (Article 18(3)(b) Regulation).

The competent authorities may also decide to conduct field inspections where needed (Articles 18(6) and 19 Regulation).

If there is a risk of forced labour in a third country , the Commission may request the government of the third country to conduct an inspection , provide relevant information or verify evidence provided by economic operators (Article 19(3) Regulation).

The economic operator’s permission is required for this.

In the end, the European Parliament’s proposal to reverse the burden of proof for the non-existence of forced labour in high-risk products and to transfer it to the economic operators in order to relieve the authorities in their investigative work was not included in the version of the Regulation adopted by the European Parliament.

Vl.

What decision must be taken?

The decision whether there has been a violation of the ban on products made with forced labour is to be taken by the Commission after reviewing the information and evidence obtained by the competent authority (Article 20(1) Regulation).

Should an operator or the authority of a non-EU country refuse to cooperate, the decision may be made on the basis of the available information (Article 20(2) Regulation).

A finding that there has been no violation will end the investigation, of which the economic operator must be informed (Article 20(3) Regulation).

Where a violation is found, however, the lead competent authority must immediately adopt a decision in accordance with Article 20(4) Regulation containing: A prohibition to place or make the products concerned available on the Union market and to export them (letter a); An order for the economic operators concerned to withdraw from the Union market the products or parts thereof concerned that have already been placed or made available on the market and to dispose of them (letters b, c); Article 25 Regulation states that disposal may be undertaken by recycling the products, making them inoperable, or – in the case of perishable products – donating them for charitable purposes."
Gleiss Lutz,Prohibition of products made with forced labour,"Decisions are to be published as non-confidential summaries in a publicly accessible “forced labour single portal” (Article 12(f) and (g) Regulation).

Should an economic operator fail to comply with a decision, the competent authorities must ensure its content is implemented (Article 23(1) Regulation), including with customs authority assistance in identifying and stopping the relevant products at the EU’s external borders (Articles 26 to 28 Regulation).

Pursuant to Article 21(1) Regulation, the economic operators concerned may have any decision taken under Article 20 Regulation reviewed at any time if the request includes significant new information that was not yet available to the lead competent authority at the time of the investigation.

Vll.

What penalties are there and how will they be enforced?

The Member States are responsible for laying down the rules on penalties for non-compliance with a decision pursuant to Article 20 Regulation and for taking all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented in accordance with national law (Article 37(1) Regulation).

The penalties provided for must be effective , proportionate and dissuasive (Article 37(2) Regulation).

Insofar, they must have due regard to the gravity and duration of the infringement (letter a), any relevant previous infringements by the economic operator (letter b), the degree of cooperation with the competent authorities (letter c), and all other mitigating or aggravating circumstances of the individual case, such as the financial benefits gains or losses avoided as a direct or indirect result of the infringement (letter d).  

Under Article 37(4) Regulation, financial penalties are to be determined according to the Commission’s corresponding guidance (still to be drawn up) pursuant to Article 11(i) Regulation.

The European Parliament had also proposed a provision requiring economic operators to provide financial and non-financial compensation to those affected (defined as “ remediation ”).

This is reflected in recital 36, but a mandatory provision has not been agreed.

Under Article 17(1) Regulation, however, the competent authorities may ask the economic operator during the preliminary investigation to provide information on any remedial measures it has taken.

Recital 36 Regulation includes compensation among remedial measures.

Apparently, therefore, it cannot be ruled out that economic actors will face the expectation that they offer compensation to those affected by forced labour, even if the Regulation does not make this a legally binding rule."
Gleiss Lutz,BUNDESTAG DEBATES GOVERNMENT BILL ON MEDICINES SHORTAGE,"In a move to tackle the severe shortage of medicines, the German Federal Government has adopted the draft Act to Improve the Supply of Medicines and Avoid Shortages (Arzneimittel-Lieferengpassbekämpfungs- und Versorgungsverbesserungsgesetz, “ALBVVG”).

The draft bill – which sets out numerous changes, particularly to reference prices, discount contracts and the supply of paediatric medicines – was debated by the Bundestag on 24 May 2023.

I. Draft bill to combat supply shortages The bill contains the following changes: Pricing rules for paediatric medicines are to be relaxed, with reference prices and discount contracts abolished.

Pharmaceutical entrepreneurs will be able to make one-time increases to their prices by up to 50% of the most recently applicable reference price or moratorium price.

Health insurance funds will assume the additional costs of prescribed medicines.

In future, reference price groups will no longer be permitted to include paediatric medicines.

The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, “BfArM”) will compile a list of medicines that are necessary for the treatment of children up to the age of twelve.

The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband) will remove any reference prices in effect for these medicines within six weeks.

Antibiotics with active ingredients produced in the European Union and the European Economic Area must also be given (preferential) consideration in statutory health insurance tenders – a fundamental change to the relevant procurement requirements.

This is intended to diversify suppliers.

It will be possible to relax price instruments for supply-critical medicines if the market tightens.

If there are too few suppliers, the reference price or moratorium price will be able to be raised once by 50%.

Three-month stockpiling of discounted medicines is to become mandatory for discount contracts.

This is intended to prevent temporary shortages and ensure that supply always meets demand.

Existing medicine shortage prevention frameworks are to be strengthened: BfArM will receive broadened rights to information, for example from manufacturers and hospital pharmacies.

An early warning system will also be set up to identify emerging shortages.

BfArM is to publish an up-to-date list of medicine shortages with supply-relevant and supply-critical active substances on its website.

Improvements to the supply of medicines by hospital pharmacies and by pharmacies that supply hospitals: Stockpiling obligations for parenterally administered medicines and for antibiotics for intensive care are to be made stricter.

Availability of new last-resort antibiotics: Pricing rules are to be modified to increase financial incentive for pharmaceutical entrepreneurs to develop new last-resort antibiotics.

Price pressure from co-payment exemption rules is to be reduced: The co-payment exemption threshold will be lowered to 20%, down from 30% today.

That means that if the price of a medicine is more than 20% below the reference price, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds can make that medicine exempt from co-payment – easing pressure on reference prices.

Simplification of substitution rules for pharmacies: If a medicine is not available, pharmacists will be able to substitute a medicine with the same active substance.

Pharmacies and wholesalers are to receive an additional payment of EUR 0.50 for each substitution.

If the medicines prescribed can only be dispensed in small packages or a smaller quantity must be taken from a package in order to dispense it, the insured person’s co-payment is limited to the quantity prescribed.

II.

Reactions to the bill Reactions to the bill have been mixed, making it likely that there will be amendments during the bill’s passage through parliament."
Gleiss Lutz,BUNDESTAG DEBATES GOVERNMENT BILL ON MEDICINES SHORTAGE,"II.

Reactions to the bill Reactions to the bill have been mixed, making it likely that there will be amendments during the bill’s passage through parliament.

The Bundesrat issued an opinion on 12 May 2023 calling for the future supply of medicines to patients to be secured in particular via the development of a long term strategy in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry.

It pointed out that strengthening and promoting domestic production and research had to play a key role, and that the legislative process should be used to consider whether stocks of supply-relevant medicines could be increased at all trade levels, especially at pharmaceutical wholesale level.

Health insurance funds have complained that the solution is solely directed at (increasing) remuneration, arguing that a sustainable supply of medicines also requires: improvements in information and data flows, e.g. in the form of an automated database with daily updates on the availability of medicines, greater stockpiling obligations throughout the trade, including by pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies supplying hospitals, sustainable diversification of production and supply chains in areas critical to supply.

III.

Next steps The Bundestag debated the bill when it was first read on 24 May 2023.

The Committee on Health is now expected to consult with experts in a public hearing in the second week of June, when professional associations will also have a further opportunity to voice their concerns to MPs.

The health experts within the parliamentary groups are then likely to table amendments.

The Act is to be passed by the Bundestag as early as the third week of June during its second and third readings.

The Bundesrat’s second round of deliberations could then follow in the first week of July, meaning that the Act could enter into force as early as around 1 August 2023, although this is hard to predict at this stage."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: MORE NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"The EU has imposed further economic sanctions on Russia in light of the continuing attacks on Ukraine as well as on Belarus for its support of Russia:

On 3/4 June 2022 the EU’s sixth package of sanctions came into force.

The new sanctions package builds on those of 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ), 28 February/2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ), 16 March 2022 ( newsletter of 18 March 2022 ) and 9 April 2022 ( newsletter of 12 April 2022 ).

It includes a series of measures designed to effectively thwart Russia’s ability to continue its military attacks.

In particular, a gradual import ban on Russian oil as well as a ban on the provision of accounting, public relations and consulting services have been added to the list of previous sanctions.

The EU has also expanded the list of personal sanctions and the list of individuals and entities that have been denied export privileges for dual-use goods.

It has also extended the list of goods and technologies that may not be exported to Russia as they might contribute to its military or technological enhancement.

In addition, Sberbank and other Russian and Belarusian banks have now also been excluded from the global banking communications network SWIFT.

Three major Russian state broadcasters are no longer allowed to broadcast their content in the EU, and are banned from advertising products or services.

The U.S. has also expanded its personal sanctions and sanctions targeting the provision of certain services.

In addition to further tightening regulations on intellectual property rights, Russia has introduced a far-reaching ban on business with persons sanctioned by Russia, as well as restrictions on trading in certain foreign securities on the Russian stock exchange and on the supply of gas to EU states.

EU sanctions In its sixth sanctions package (Regulations (EU) 2022/877 and 2022/879 as well as Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/876 and 2022/878) of 3/4 June 2022 , the EU has again amended and tightened Regulations (EU) 765/2006, 269/2014 and 833/2014.

It has added a further 83 entries to the list of personal sanctions , bringing the current total to 1,158 individuals and 98 entities.

The new Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014 now also lists officers of units operating in Bucha and Mariupol, those involved in collaborating with the Russian occupation in Kherson Oblast, as well as further politicians, propagandists, leading businesspersons and family members of already sanctioned individuals.

The newly listed entities also include a number of companies that directly or indirectly support the Russian Federation’s armed forces or government, including Russia’s largest securities depository, the National Settlement Depository.

As already explained in our newsletter of 7 March 2022 , the listed persons are banned from entering and transiting EU territory, and all their assets are being frozen.

The rule banning European companies from providing funds or economic resources to listed persons continues to apply.

In addition, twelve pro-government individuals and eight pro-government entities from Belarus have been added to the list of natural and legal persons, entities and bodies subject to restrictive measures contained in Annex I to Regulation (EC) 765/2006.

The EU has expanded the list of persons and entities subject to export restrictions on dual-use goods and technologies to include further Russian and Belarusian entities.

The focus of the sanctions is once again the amendment of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 , adding further financial and trade-related sanctions: Article 3m of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 now prohibits the direct or indirect purchase, import or transfer of crude oil or petroleum products as listed in Annex XXV if they originate in or are exported from Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: MORE NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"It is now also prohibited to provide, directly or indirectly, technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance, or any other services related to the ban.

However, there are a number of exemptions to these prohibitions.

For example, they do not apply until 5 December 2022 or 5 February 2023 to one-off transactions for near-term delivery or the execution of contracts concluded before 4 June 2022.

These periods may be extended in Croatia and Bulgaria under certain circumstances (but the goods imported under such exemptions may not then be sold on to buyers located in another Member State or in a third country).

In addition, the prohibitions do not apply to the purchase, import or transfer of seaborne crude oil and of petroleum products listed in Annex XXV where those goods originate in a third country and are only transiting through Russia, provided that the owner of those goods is non-Russian.

Furthermore, the prohibition does not apply to crude oil falling under CN 2709 00 which is delivered by pipeline from Russia into Member States.

However, the transfer or sale to other Member States (except for average volumes to Czechia until 5 December 2023) or third countries is prohibited.

Under the newly introduced Article 3n of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, it is prohibited to provide, directly or indirectly, technical assistance, brokering services or financing or financial assistance, related to the transport , including through ship-to-ship transfers, of such goods to third countries .

This ban does not apply until 5 December 2022 to the execution of existing contracts concluded before 4 June 2022.

Nor does it apply where such goods originate in a third country and are only transiting through Russia, provided that the owner of those goods is non-Russian.

The new paragraph 2a of Article 5aa of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (see our newsletter of 18 March 2022 ) makes it clear that the exemption from the ban on transactions for contracts concluded before 16 March 2022 also includes the receipt of payments due under these contracts.

Further exemptions have been introduced for transactions required for the wind-down of joint ventures or related to the provision of electronic communication services, data centre services or call centre services.

According to the new Article 5n of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, it is now also prohibited to directly or indirectly provide auditing services, including statutory audit, bookkeeping and tax consulting services, or business and management consulting or public relations services to the Russian government or to entities or bodies established in Russia.

However, exemptions apply in particular to the provision of services for the termination by 5 July 2022 of contracts concluded before 4 June 2022 (wind-down period) and of services intended for the exclusive use of legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia that are owned by, or solely or jointly controlled by, a legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State.

The bans on imports into the EU pursuant to Article 3i of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (see our last newsletter of 18 March 2022 ) have also been extended to further products.

The new Annex XXI to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 includes additional foodstuffs and semi-luxury goods, cement, potassium chloride, fertilisers, further wood products, etc.

The export ban in Article 2a in conjunction with Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has also been extended to goods and technologies which might contribute to the technological enhancement of the Russian defence and security sector .

The additions include 80 chemicals that can be used to produce chemical weapons.

The EU has suspended the broadcasting activities of three further Russian state-owned media outlets in the EU: Rossiya RTR/RTR Planeta, Rossiya 24 / Russia 24 and TV Centre International."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: MORE NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"The EU has suspended the broadcasting activities of three further Russian state-owned media outlets in the EU: Rossiya RTR/RTR Planeta, Rossiya 24 / Russia 24 and TV Centre International.

The new Article 2f(3) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 also prohibits advertising products or services in any content produced or broadcast by these media outlets.

The EU has extended the existing ban on the provision of special payment services (SWIFT ) to three more Russian credit institutions – Sberbank as the largest Russian bank , the Credit Bank of Moscow and the Russian Agricultural Bank.

The Belarusian Bank for Development and Reconstruction is also now excluded.

Suspension of import duties on Ukrainian exports to the EU In the meantime, the EU has also adopted a regulation allowing for temporary trade liberalisation and other trade concessions with regard to certain Ukrainian products.

This means that for one year no import duties will be due on Ukrainian exports to the European Union.

U.S. sanctions Already on 8 March 2022, the U.S. imposed a ban on the import of Russian crude oil, petroleum, petroleum fuels, including their distillation products, liquefied natural gas, coal and coal products, which entered into force on 22 April 2022 (see newsletter of 18 March 2022 ).

The U.S. also already expanded the sanctions that had been imposed on Sberbank since 2014 in both February (see newsletter of 18 March 2022 ) and April 2022 (see newsletter of 12 April 2022 ) .

Since our last foreign trade law update on the Ukraine sanctions ( newsletter of 12 April 2022 ) , the U.S. has tightened and expanded its sanctions regime essentially as follows:

On 8 May 2022, the U.S. extended its personal sanctions list (SDN list), adding individuals who the U.S Treasury Department believes are critical to Russia’s ability to wage war.

These include the board members of Gazprombank and Sberbank, as well as the Russian state-owned Moscow Industrial Bank and ten of its subsidiaries.

A state-supported arms manufacturer (Limited Liability Company Promtekhnologiya) and three of Russia’s state-owned television stations (Channel One Russia, NTV Broadcasting Company and Russia-1) have also been added to the list. 

On 2 June 2022, the U.S. once again extended the SDN list with the aim of degrading the key networks used to attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions and anonymously make use of luxury assets around the globe.

An airline, a yacht brokerage serving Russian oligarchs, and companies that have provided yachts to President Putin were among those listed.

Certain yachts and aircraft were identified as (partly) owned by the listed persons.

Other prominent Russian government officials were also added to the SDN list, as well as the custodian of President Putin’s offshore wealth.

As described in our newsletter of 7 March 2022 , inclusion on the list entails the blocking of all assets of the listed persons that are located in the U.S. or controlled by a U.S. person as well as a transaction ban.

The U.S. Department of Commerce also added another 71 companies based in Russia and Belarus to the Department of Commerce's Entity List, with the aim of cutting off their access to militarily significant goods and technology of U.S. origin.

The U.S. also extended its sanctions to various consulting services .

This is intended to block Russian persons from accessing services used to circumvent the sanctions.

This means that as from 7 June 2022, U.S. companies will generally no longer be allowed to offer or carry out accounting, trust and corporate formation or management consulting services in Russia.

Necessary clearing and settlement transactions will still be permitted until 7 July 2022.

As things currently stand, U.S. auditors and credit rating agencies may continue to conduct their Russian business on the basis of a general licence until 20 August 2022."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: MORE NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"As things currently stand, U.S. auditors and credit rating agencies may continue to conduct their Russian business on the basis of a general licence until 20 August 2022.

Assets located in the U.S. or controlled by U.S. persons and belonging to persons to be individually identified who operate or have operated in the auditing, trust and corporate formation, and management consulting sectors of the Russian economy will be blocked.

The general exemption (General License 9A), which still permitted certain transactions involving Russian financial institutions (including VTB Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia, Alfa-Bank) as well as the Russian Central Bank, the National Property Fund of the Russian Federation and the Russian Ministry of Finance for a wind-down period, expired on 25 May 2022 or 1 June 2022, depending on the financial institution.

However, notwithstanding the ban on transactions with the Russian Central Bank, the National Property Fund and the Russian Ministry of Finance, U.S. persons will still be entitled to pay taxes, fees or import duties and to acquire or obtain permits, licences, registrations or certifications in the course of their day-to-day business, in any case up to 30 September 2022 (General License 13A).

Further Russian countermeasures Russia’s counter-sanctions concerning the IP rights of right holders from “unfriendly states” have again been tightened (see our newsletter of 18 March 2022 and 12 April 2022 ) .

For example, Presidential Decree No. 322 “on the temporary procedure for the performance of obligations to certain creditors” entered into force on 27 May 2022:

Accordingly, Russian debtors are required to make payments for the use of IP rights to a specific group of foreign right holders in roubles only to a special O-type bank account opened in the name of the right holder.

It will not be possible to make payments without using a special O-type bank account in future.

This regulation affects: Foreign right holders associated with foreign states that commit “unfriendly actions” against the Russian Federation and Russian legal and natural persons.

Right holders who publicly support or have publicly called for restrictive measures by foreign states.

Right holders who have prohibited the use of IP rights in Russia or the manufacture or supply of goods, the provision of services and/or the export of goods from Russia after 23 February 2022 due to compliance with sanctions or for other reasons unrelated to economic feasibility.

The authorised banks where the right holders concerned may open a special O-type account will be determined by the government of the Russian Federation.

This will be a rouble account.

The right holder may agree to the debtor making corresponding payments to the special account.

If the right holder does not agree to this, the debtor may refuse to make payment without infringing its contractual obligations towards the right holder.

Obligations in a foreign currency will be deemed duly and properly fulfilled if a payment in roubles is made corresponding to the value of the obligations in the foreign currency at the official exchange rate applicable at the time.

The amounts received in the right holder’s special O-type account may only be transferred to an account at another bank in Russia or abroad if this is authorised by the Government Commission for the Control of Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation.

The Decree specifies a number of contracts to which it does not apply.

These involve the granting of IP rights for: the import or manufacture of medicinal products, medical devices, industrial and agricultural products and foodstuffs, the provision of communication services and the creation and/or use of computer programs, databases, information systems and data processing centres."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: MORE NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"Payments to right holders made by natural persons in the course of using IP rights for purely personal, non-business purposes and not exceeding RUB 100,000 continue to be exempt from the provisions of the Decree.

Nor do the restrictions of the Decree apply to payments to right holders who are subject to the Decree but who duly fulfil their contractual obligations with the debtors.

Russia has also adopted the following additional countermeasures : Whilst real estate transactions between Russians and foreigners with ties to “unfriendly states” have required official approval since March 2022, Presidential Decree No. 252

“on the use of retaliatory special economic measures in response to unfriendly acts by certain foreign states and international organisations”, which entered into force on 3 May 2022, and its Implementing Regulation No. 851, which entered into force on 12 May 2022, have introduced sweeping new measures.

These provisions prohibit all Russian authorities and persons subject to Russian jurisdiction from conducting business with the sanctioned persons listed in the Implementing Regulation, from conducting financial transactions for the benefit of such persons, and from exporting products manufactured or mined in Russia via or to such a person.

The sanctioned persons currently include companies in the energy sector in particular, for example Gazprom Germania GmbH, Gazprom NGV Europe GmbH, Astora GmbH, WIBG GmbH, WIEH GmbH, WINGAS GmbH, WINGAS Sales GmbH, WINGAS Holding GmbH and Industriekraftwerk Greifswald GmbH. Whilst the Implementing Regulation makes it possible to obtain permission for an individual transaction that would otherwise be prohibited, it contains no details of the relevant procedure.

The Russian Central Bank opted to restrict trading on the Russian Stock Exchange from 30 May 2022 for foreign securities whose purchase or sale is no longer handled by international clearing and settlement institutions.

Exceptions apply to securities of foreign issuers that manufacture products and carry out their economic activities mainly in Russia.

Russia’s second largest stock exchange, SPB, subsequently announced that it would transfer up to 14% of the U.S. shares held by its clients to a blocked securities account.

Whilst SPB’s clients will retain ownership of their respective shareholdings, the new restrictions mean that they will not have access to their shares in companies such as Apple or Tesla and therefore cannot sell them.

Russia is also expanding the group of countries or gas suppliers to which gas will no longer be delivered due to their refusal to pay their bills in roubles.

Deliveries to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands have already been halted.

Most recently, Russia announced that it would also stop exports to the Danish utility Ørsted and to Shell Energy Europe.

Conclusion and outlook: piecemeal expansion of existing sanctions; end of existing sanctions not yet foreseeable The EU’s sixth sanctions package and the further sanctions imposed by the U.S. show that “the West” is still prepared to take drastic steps to target Russia’s sources of income.

After lengthy negotiations, the EU Member States have now agreed on a partial oil embargo (imports) in addition to the ban on coal imports from Russia and the ban on importing certain mineral products, including oil and gas, from Belarus.

The embargo is limited to seaborne oil deliveries and is expected to stop more than two-thirds of previous oil imports from Russia by the end of this year.

Although pipeline deliveries are not covered by the sixth package of sanctions, Germany and Poland have signalled that they no longer wish to purchase oil via the Druzhba pipeline in future.

In this case, EU oil imports could be reduced by 90% by the end of the year.

It remains to be seen how strongly the provisions in the sixth sanctions package will affect the Russian – and also the EU – economy."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: MORE NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"It remains to be seen how strongly the provisions in the sixth sanctions package will affect the Russian – and also the EU – economy.

The trend of extensive Russian counter-sanctions continues and should be borne in mind by companies doing business in Russia.

An end to this spiral is not yet in sight.

In any event, the existing sanctions will likely remain in force for some time."
Gleiss Lutz,European Parliament gives green light for regulation on standard essential patents,"On 28 February 2024, the European Parliament approved the EU Commission's proposal (COM(2023)0232) for a Regulation on standard essential patents (SEPs).

The Regulation is intended to improve transparency in the licensing of SEPs and provide an institutional and organisational framework that can help all parties involved with the licensing of SEPs.

The legislative proposal is to be welcomed.

Due to the paramount importance of interconnectivity in IoT and Industry 5.0, more and more companies require SEP licences.

This includes companies that are active in markets and industries in which SEP licensing has previously not played a major role, and that therefore have not yet had to deal with this complex special issue.

The planned Regulation will not be able to solve all SEP licensing problems.

However, it lays the right foundation.

To which patents should the Regulation apply?

The Regulation shall only apply to standard-essential patents.

In this regard, the only decisive factor shall be whether the patent has been declared essential to a technical standard by its holder (Article 2(1), no. 1 of the draft SEP Regulation).

Whether the patent actually is standard essential is irrelevant in this context.

Nor shall it matter whether the SEP holder has made a FRAND declaration for the patent, i.e. has undertaken to license the SEP on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

In terms of timing, the Regulation shall apply to all standard versions published by a standardisation organisation after the Regulation comes into force (Article 1(2) of the draft SEP Regulation).

The Regulation shall only apply to a standard published before the Regulation enters into force if the EU Commission identifies a distortion of the internal market due to significant difficulties or inefficiencies in connection with the licensing of SEPs for this standard.

More transparency due to an SEP register and database The fundamental problem with SEP licence negotiations is the asymmetry of information between SEP holders and implementers.

Up to now, it has been difficult for implementers to obtain information on key SEP licensing issues from independent sources and without having to rely on SEP holders: which patents are essential to which standard, which SEP holders are to be addressed, which royalty rates apply to which SEP portfolio, what proportion of the total number of relevant SEPs is accounted for by a particular SEP portfolio, how should different SEP portfolios be weighted in relation to each other, etc.?

Innovative companies are confronted with such questions already at an early stage in the development of new products that make use of standards (e.g. because they are WLAN capable).

This is because the subsequent burden of licence fees must be taken into account in the company's own pricing."
Gleiss Lutz,European Parliament gives green light for regulation on standard essential patents,"This is because the subsequent burden of licence fees must be taken into account in the company's own pricing.

In order to improve transparency, the draft Regulation provides for the establishment of a central electronic SEP register and a central electronic database (Article 4 et seq. draft SEP Regulation), which shall contain, among other things, information on: the respective patent declared essential (including patent number, country of registration), its holder and the holder’s legal representative in the EU; the relevant technical standard (including the relevant version of the standard, details of the respective sections of the standard that are to be covered by the scope of protection of the patent) and the FRAND declaration of the SEP holder; established licensing practices (such as the existence of any publicly available standard terms and conditions, including royalty, royalty-free and discount policies, and the aggregate royalty rate where available); the availability of licences via patent pools, where applicable; whether essentiality checks has been performed and the result of such checks; and any court proceedings concerning SEPs (on questions of infringement, validity, non-enforceability, standard essentiality, abuse of a dominant position and determination of FRAND terms and conditions).

The register and database are to be managed by a competence centre at the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).

SEP holders shall have six months after a new standard is entered in the register to register their SEPs there.

Anyone who fails to register shall not be able to bring a claim for infringement of the non-registered SEP in relation to the implementation of the relevant standard until the registration has taken place (Article 24 of the draft SEP Regulation).

In the EU, the registration of the SEP in dispute will therefore become a prerequisite for the admissibility of certain SEP-based infringement claims.

This will not affect claims based on agreements (e.g. licence agreements) that were concluded before the Regulation came into force and provide for a licence fee for the unregistered SEP.

Patent pools are also subject to new obligations under the Regulation.

Among other things, the Regulation obliges pools to provide information on their website about the patents managed, including the standard licence agreement, royalties, any discounts, a possible aggregate royalty rate and a complete list of licensees for each implementation (Article 9 of the draft SEP Regulation).

These new information sources planned by the EU legislator will be beneficial for all parties interested in transparent and speedy SEP licence negotiations.

Aggregate royalty Currently, the appropriate aggregate royalty for a standard-compliant product – information that is important for SEP licence negotiations in many respects – is generally not known by the parties involved in SEP licensing.

This is also the case where patent pools have been formed for the licensing of SEPs, as they often do not cover all the SEPs required.

It is therefore to be welcomed that the draft regulation provides for an aggregate royalty rate to be determined for the use of a standard.

The persons involved in the standardisation (i.e. in particular the SEP holders) shall, in addition to the technical coordination, determine an appropriate aggregate royalty for the use of the entire standard and report this royalty to the EUIPO competence centre for inclusion in the register and database.

If they fail to determine and allocate the aggregate royalty , it shall be possible to commission an expert to prepare a non-binding proposal.

A corresponding application can be submitted by SEP holders (with at least 20% of the relevant SEPs) or SEP users (with a combined EU market share of at least 10%, alternatively ten SMEs or start-ups).

These thresholds are likely to be discussed further in the course of the legislative process."
Gleiss Lutz,European Parliament gives green light for regulation on standard essential patents,"These thresholds are likely to be discussed further in the course of the legislative process.

Independent and out-of-court review of standard essentiality One of the central points of discussion, both in out-of-court SEP licence negotiations and in court infringement proceedings, is the question of whether the teaching protected by the patent is actually necessarily implemented by a standard-compliant product (i.e. whether the patent is actually ""standard-essential"").

Experience shows that a considerable number of patents declared to be standard essential are in fact not standard essential (e.g. as a result of changes in the patent application procedure or changes to the technical specifications in the standardisation process).

Under the new Regulation, it shall be possible to carry out an independent check of the essentiality of a patent without having to conduct court proceedings.

On behalf of the competence centre, independent evaluators are to carry out random checks of the patents entered in the central register (

Article 28 et seq. draft SEP Regulation).

In addition, SEP holders can voluntarily submit their SEPs to the competence centre for an essentiality check (Article 4a of the draft SEP Regulation).

The check is to be completed within six months.

Although the result of the examination shall not be legally binding, it will nevertheless be entered in the central SEP database and can be used in SEP licence negotiations or in court proceedings as an indication of the existence or non-existence actual essentiality, which can reduce points of contention, effort, time and costs.

New method for determining FRAND terms and conditions To answer the key question of SEP litigation, i.e. which terms and conditions are to be considered FRAND, SEP holders and SEP users shall be provided with a conciliation procedure (FRAND determination procedure) (Article 34 et seq. of the draft SEP Regulation).

Professionally experienced and independent conciliators shall submit a proposal for FRAND terms and conditions to the parties after nine months at the latest.

The EU Commission assumes that an out-of-court resolution of FRAND disputes by way of the new FRAND determination procedure is on average eight times more cost-effective than corresponding court proceedings.

Such a conciliation procedure for determining specific FRAND terms and conditions will be a significant step forward, particularly compared to court proceedings in Germany.

This is because courts in Germany have so far refused to determine which contractual conditions and, in particular, which royalty rates are to be regarded as FRAND.

With the new procedure, the parties involved in SEP licensing will be able to obtain an indication of the amount of licence fees from an objective and independent third party relatively quickly .

According to the draft, the courts of an EU Member State or the Unified Patent Court (UPC) shall not rule on an infringement action as long as the FRAND determination procedure has not been completed.

However, "" provisional injunctions of a financial nature "" remain possible at all times (Article 34 draft SEP Regulation), which in Germany, for example, is likely to mean a provisional seizure of assets, but not a preliminary injunction.

The parties are free to decide whether to recognise the outcome of the dispute resolution procedure as binding.

The report to be prepared by the conciliator with an assessment of the FRAND terms and conditions is always made publicly available - in its non-confidential parts - in the electronic database and can be taken into account in court proceedings.

Conclusion With its vote of 28 February 2024, the European Parliament supports the SEP licensing reform initiated by the European Commission."
Gleiss Lutz,European Parliament gives green light for regulation on standard essential patents,"Conclusion With its vote of 28 February 2024, the European Parliament supports the SEP licensing reform initiated by the European Commission.

Despite the stark criticism of the draft Regulation – particularly from the SEP holders – the European Parliament is not proposing any fundamental changes, but is instead leaving the core of the European Commission’s proposal unchanged.

The draft Regulation is now being reviewed by the Council of the European Union.

If the Council requests further changes to the draft, the interinstitutional negotiations between the EU Commission, Council and EU Parliament (""trialogue"") will follow, in which the final text will be agreed upon (provided an agreement can be reached at all).

The overall duration of the further legislative process is difficult to estimate and also depends on whether the Council decides on the legislative proposal before the EU elections in June 2024.

In the case of the EU Data Act adopted last year, there were only around nine months between the European Parliament's vote and publication in the Official Journal.

It would be good if the SEP Regulation could become law at a similar speed."

Gleiss Lutz,SUPPLY CHAIN AWARENESS CHECK,"The Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains was recently enacted by the German parliament (Bundestag) and will enter into force on 1 January 2023.

Contrary to what politicians and the media have sometimes stated, not only large companies but also small and medium-sized enterprises based in Germany and abroad are at least indirectly affected.

For the first time, the law introduces a comprehensive duty of effort for one's own business and supply chains, regardless of the type of product or industry involved.

Violations can be punished with severe fines, and there is a threat of considerable civil liability risks.

We would like to help you with a kind of quick test to get a first impression of whether the far-reaching changes will also have an impact on your business practice.

Gleiss Lutz,ECJ ON RIGHT OF ACCESS UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAW: COMPANIES MUST DISCLOSE DATA RECIPIENTS’ NAMES,"In its decision of 12 January 2023 (C-154/21) the European Court of Justice stated its position on the extent to which companies must disclose the identity of recipients of personal data when the right of access pursuant to Article 15(1), letter (c) GDPR is exercised.

For many companies, this may mean they need to modify how they respond to requests for access.

Background A customer of Österreichische Post , the Austrian postal service, requested information on how his personal data had been processed, in particular the identity of any recipients of that data.

Österreichische Post replied that it uses personal data in the course of its activities as a publisher of telephone directories and that it offers those data to trading partners for marketing purposes.

This use is within the bounds of what is legally permissible, it told the customer.

In its response to the request, Österreichische Post did not state the names of these trading partners.

The customer then brought proceedings, invoking Article 15(1), letter (c) GDPR.

In his view, this provision gave him a right of access to information on the specific recipients.

Both the court of the first instance and the appellate court dismissed the claim; the claimant then appealed on points of law.

Austria’s Supreme Court of Justice referred the matter to the ECJ, asking whether the right of access pursuant to Article 15(1), letter (c) GDPR is limited to information on recipient categories where specific recipients have not yet been defined in the case of planned disclosures, but includes information on specific recipients where personal data has already been disclosed to them.

ECJ’s decision The ECJ ruled that pursuant to Article 15(1), letter (c) GDPR, companies generally have an obligation to state recipients’ identity when providing information to those seeking it.

This applies both to recipients to which the company has already disclosed the relevant personal data as well as to future recipients of the data.

In this regard, the company has no leeway.

The only cases in which the recipients must not be named are where it is impossible to identify the recipients, or naming them would be manifestly unjustified, disproportionate or excessive, within the meaning of Article 12(5) GDPR.

The company must prove this, the ECJ stated.

In such cases, it is sufficient to state recipient categories only.

Interpreting Article 15(1), letter (c) GDPR differently would fail to satisfy the aim and purpose of the right of access, the ECJ held.

This right forms the basis of further data subject rights including the rights to rectification and erasure as well as the right to object to processing.

In the ECJ’s view, the recitals, the principle of transparency, and Article 19 GDPR support this interpretation, which helps data subjects realise their right to data protection ( effet utile ).

Our assessment Although Article 15(1), letter (c) GDPR is broadly worded (“recipients or categories of recipients”), companies must generally provide information on specific recipients should data subjects seek this in their requests.

If companies fail to do so, they may have infringed data protection law and face an administrative fine (Article 83(5) GDPR).

The data subject who filed the request might also assert a claim for damages (Article 82 GDPR).

The right of access is not unlimited, however.

It must be weighed up against other legal concerns enjoying protection, and these concerns may restrict it.

The ECJ makes explicit mention of exceptions where it is impossible to meet the request for access or the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

In addition to the exceptions the ECJ explicitly cites, other rights may limit the right of access.

Depending on the individual case, company and third party interests in confidentiality may impose such limits (cf.

Article 15(4) GDPR)."
Gleiss Lutz,ECJ ON RIGHT OF ACCESS UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAW: COMPANIES MUST DISCLOSE DATA RECIPIENTS’ NAMES,"Depending on the individual case, company and third party interests in confidentiality may impose such limits (cf.

Article 15(4) GDPR).

The right of access may also be limited by EU or national law (in Germany’s case, sections 27(2), 28(2), 29(1), 34(1) Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, “BDSG”) – for example, to protect whistleblowers.

The ECJ decision makes no mention of whether specific recipients must be identified by name in information provided pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, i.e. data protection statements or privacy notices.

Although these provisions’ wording resembles that of Article 15 GDPR, a duty to provide information and a right of access differ in key points.

The recitals relating to information do not explicitly refer to “recipients” (cf. recitals 39, 63 GDPR); moreover, Articles 13 and 14 GDPR do not confer subjective rights.

Last but not least, it is doubtful what purpose the right of access serves if privacy notices have to contain all the information that needs to be provided anyway.

It remains to be seen whether the ECJ will nevertheless apply its ruling to Articles 13 and 14 GDPR.

In practice To be able to identify specific data recipients and not mere categories when requests are made, companies should ensure they have all relevant information available before they receive requests for access – or at least that they can obtain it before the standard one-month deadline for providing information expires (Article 12(3) GDPR).

This makes it necessary to collect recipients systematically (known as data mapping) and update information regularly.

Records of processing activities can be used to organise this, as recipients outside of the EU have to be recorded here anyway (Article 30(1), letter (d) GDPR).

To pre-empt any requests for access, companies can also list relevant recipients in their privacy notices, weighing this course of action up against interests that may conflict with it.

For some recipients, this is already the case in employee privacy notices (e.g. affiliates and payroll providers).

Here too, some companies will be able to build on existing processes.

If a company has standard processes for responding to requests for access (especially in e-commerce), these processes may need to be modified to ensure that the information provided complies with both the request and the law."

Article"
Gleiss Lutz,TELEMEDICINE ON THE RISE – THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT,"The events of 2020 have accelerated supply and demand for telemedicine services, and exponentially so. 2021 brought crucial changes to telemedicine healthcare in Germany: the obligatory electronic patient record (ePA), an increasing number of prescribable digital health applications (DiGAs), the new category of “digital care applications” as well as video consultations for non-physician therapists such as physiotherapists and ergotherapists as well as midwives.

In 2022, patients and physicians have continued to connect by means of digital medical devices as well as real-time health data.

This has expanded the treatment options using telemedicine without reducing quality compared with physical visits to a practice.

Enno Burk and Dilara Puls from the Gleiss Lutz Berlin Office, who focus on digital healthcare topics, summarize the current legal situation in Germany and look ahead to planned developments.

I. Online consultation hours now a fixed part of physicians’ work in Germany Seldom performed in Germany prior to 2018, online consultation hours have since become a fixed part of the healthcare offered by physicians.

Several providers have now established certified portals enabling physicians to conduct consultations with patients insured under either statutory health insurance or private schemes.

Since 2018, the Model Professional Code for Physicians in Germany (MBO-Ä) has allowed patients to be treated remotely only , without prior initial contact in person between physician and patient, though subject to certain conditions.

Such treatment must be medically justifiable, physicians must continue to take due care, and the patient must be informed of how consultation and treatment only via communication media differ from conventional approaches (section 7(4) of the Code).

Physicians may provide both private and SHI-accredited consultation hours online across Germany.

Fifteen of Germany’s sixteen medical associations have implemented the provision from the Model Professional Code.

Only Brandenburg’s medical association continues to limit remote treatment to cases where patient and physician have had initial contact in person beforehand.

Since 1 April 2019, consultations conducted online have also been billable to the SHI funds.

Currently, SHI-accredited physicians primarily bill their basic charge and flat charge per patient for video consultations.

Depending on whether the relevant prerequisites are met, surcharges and further billable services may also be applied (e.g. for providing technical equipment or verifying the identity of new patients).

Video case conferences, where physicians with different specialities discuss a case, have also been widely facilitated in SHI-accredited healthcare (section 87(2a) sentences 14 to 15 German Social Security Code, Book V).

On 1 October 2020, the Committee for Rating SHI-Accredited Physicians' Services (Bewertungsausschuss) decided to include and remunerate video case conferences in all medical areas in the Uniform Evaluation Scale (EBM), with patients attending such conferences in some cases.

Since 7 October 2020, it has also been possible for patients to obtain a doctor’s certificate via video consultations.

Where certificates of incapacity to work are then issued, SHI-accredited physicians have had to send such certificates to health insurance funds digitally since 1 October 2021.

At some point in the future, the health insurance funds will be sending the relevant data direct to employers.

A further option now provided for is prescribing digital health applications (DiGAs: digital medical devices in Classes I and IIa).

Private health insurance schemes frequently conclude cooperation agreements with individual telemedicine portals, enabling their insurees to consult physicians free of charge by means of these portals (without requiring them to make later claims for reimbursement of costs).

The diagram behind this link shows the main milestones in telemedicine to date."
Gleiss Lutz,TELEMEDICINE ON THE RISE – THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT,"The diagram behind this link shows the main milestones in telemedicine to date.

II.

Focus remains on-site healthcare by SHI-accredited physicians in independent practice Like out-patient healthcare on site, rendering telemedicine services within the SHI system depends on SHI accreditation (section 95 German Social Security Code, Book V).

So for investors or telemedicine service providers who want to provide more than merely software, an online platform or corresponding technical services, the only remaining option will usually be to acquire a legal entity entitled to establish an ambulatory healthcare centre (MVZ), for example a certified hospital included in the Regional Hospital Plan (Plankrankenhaus).

On 09 June 2021, the Digital Healthcare and Nursing Care Modernisation Act (Digitale-Versorgung-und-Pflege-Modernisierungs-Gesetz) came into effect.

For SHI-accredited physicians, telemedicine will remain a secondary activity even after this.

If more than 30 % of consultation hours billed in the SHI system are online consultations , then these will no longer be eligible for remuneration, pursuant to section 87(2a), sentence 30 German Social Security Code, Book V. So the SHI-accredited physician’s work will continue to be centred around patient care on the spot, in the physician’s practice.

During the coronavirus pandemic, there was no limit to the number of online consultation hours that could be performed, as the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians (Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung) and the health insurance funds had suspended the relevant restrictions.

Since April 2022, however, the number of cases and volume of services have again been capped at 30 % .

Purely online practices do not exist at the current time, nor will they exist in the foreseeable future either.

III.

Minimum technical requirements for telemedicine portals Entry into the new market of telemedicine as a video consultation provider is also contingent on compliance with specific technical requirements: Video service providers who facilitate video consultations as well as communication service providers who transmit data for physicians to confer on findings must be certified in accordance with the requirements of Annex 31a and 31b Federal-level Master Agreement on Physicians (Bundesmantelvertrag-Ärzte).

Among other things, they must comply with data protection and data security requirements .

Requirements are also placed by the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband) and the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians.

Independent certifying bodies verify whether these requirements have been met, checking the relevant pieces of proof that must be provided.

Currently, there are 62 certified video service providers (as of 16 May 2022).

IV.

How likely is competition between the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians and private telemedicine portals?

For SHI-insured patients, the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians is to set up a new portal for assigning online consultation hours with SHI-accredited physicians, as provided by section 370a German Social Security Code, Book V.

The private portals thus far established on the markets currently receive information directly from cooperating physicians.

In future, however, they will only be able to access this information via the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians and will be charged for doing so.

SHI-accredited physicians may object to the Federal Association transmitting data to third parties.

As far as we currently know, they need not pay a fee for offering their telemedicine consultation hours on the Federal Association’s new portal.

In 2022, the Federal Association is expected to present a concept for its own telemedicine portal.

This may have a fundamental impact on private competitors.

Germany’s federal government itself is active in digital health information."
Gleiss Lutz,TELEMEDICINE ON THE RISE – THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT,"This may have a fundamental impact on private competitors.

Germany’s federal government itself is active in digital health information.

On 1 September 2020, the national health portal https://gesund.bund.de/en was set up.

The portal provides information on health and nursing care, is worded in easily understandable language, is available to people with disabilities, and can be accessed via both the internet and the telematics infrastructure (section 395(1) German Social Security Code, Book V).

V. Advertising telemedicine treatment in public In general, there is a ban in Germany on advertising for remote treatment (section 9, sentence 1 Health Products and Services Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz).

Telemedical treatment is exempted from this, however, where generally recognized professional standards do not dictate that a physician and patient meet in person (section 9, sentence 2 of the Act).

To date, higher regional courts have interpreted this new provision unnecessarily strictly (see for example Munich Higher Regional Court, judgment of 9 July 2020 – 6 U 5180/19; Hamburg Higher Regional Court, judgment of 5 November 2020 – 5 U 175/19).

In a judgment of 9 December 2021 (I ZR 146/20), the Federal Court of Justice defined criteria for “generally recognized professional standards” in accordance with the requirements of section 9, sentence 2 Health Products and Services Advertising Act, thus setting Germany’s first standard for whether it is permissible to advertise remote treatment.

The latter includes video consultations.

For section 9, sentence 2 of the Act to be applied in a legally sound and consistent way, the Federal Court of Justice ruled, interpretation of the “generally recognized professional standards” must draw on the identical term in section 630a(2)

German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) as well as the principles developed with regard to this term and a physician’s duties under their contract with the patient for medical treatment (Behandlungsvertrag).

In the Federal Court of Justice’s view, drawing on section 630a(2)

German Civil Code also facilitates recourse to extensive case law when interpreting the term.

This, the Court holds, will enable the requirements of section 9, sentence 2 Health Products and Services Advertising Act to be applied in a consistent and legally sound way.

By contrast, the Court continued, section 9 of the Act does not depend on whether advertising for remote treatment is permissible under Germany’s laws governing physicians as a profession.

The Federal Court of Justice rejected the provisions of laws governing physicians as a profession as a basis for determining what constitutes “generally recognized professional standards”.

Legislators, the Court held, intended to set an abstract and general standard for the permissibility of advertising remote treatment.

The decisive rule in section 7(4) Model Professional Code for Physicians in Germany (MBO-Ä), new version, does not offer this abstract and general standard, however, but merely instructs the treating person with reference to a specific case.

A further reason why the Model Professional Code for Physicians in Germany is unsuited to a standardized interpretation of section 9 Health Products and Services Advertising Act across Germany is that the country’s various regional states do not implement the Code in a standard way.

The Federal Court of Justice stressed that remote-only consultation has only recently become permissible and has been limited to individual cases.

Only in a few cases, therefore, do remote treatment guidelines exist.

But the Court also pointed out that legislators wish to further develop telemedical opportunities, and left the impression that as long as professional standards are complied with, it would not oppose such developments.

VI."
Gleiss Lutz,TELEMEDICINE ON THE RISE – THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT,"VI.

Giving demand for telemedicine services a booster Introducing video consultation hours directly enables telemedicine services to be rendered and remunerated.

As part of digitalizing the German healthcare system, there are also a number of further projects to improve both information for physicians as well as prescribable treatment from the patient’s perspective.

Closer networking between physician and patient enables a wider range of services to be offered than in the past.

The following measures are noteworthy:

1.

The electronic patient record The electronic patient record constitutes a core element of digital networked healthcare and the telematics infrastructure.

Since 1 January 2021, SHI funds have been obliged to offer their members the electronic patient record.

Since 1 July 2021, all physicians and psychotherapists have been obliged to have the necessary equipment to transmit data to the electronic patient record via the telematics infrastructure.

Digital patient data is now to be collected at one central point.

Currently, medical information is stored in the electronic patient record.

From 2022, it will also be possible to implement certificates of vaccination, and from 2023 nursing care data and certificates of incapacity to work.

Currently, patients have the right to decide on how and for how long their electronic patient record can be accessed.

By 2023, insurance representatives are to be provided with access accordingly.

Insured patients are to be given the opportunity to make data from their electronic patient record available for research purposes as well.

To strengthen cross-border patient safety, the National Contact Point for e-health is to be established by mid-2023.

This will enable insured persons to provide physicians in other EU countries with their health data, securely and in translation (section 219d(6)

German Social Security Code, Book V).

2. E-prescription to be introduced across Germany Obligatory use of the electronic prescription when prescribing drugs to SHI-insured patients was originally planned for 1 January 2022.

It has, however, been postponed again, and this time indefinitely.

Technical availability remains insufficient to meet the quality criteria agreed with the medical profession’s self-governing bodies.

A pilot phase has been running in Berlin and Brandenburg since July 2021, recently extended until the end of November 2021 by gematik (Germany’s certification body for healthcare cards).

This phase has now been extended again and extended to cover the whole of Germany.

On 3 November 2021, the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians issued a new guideline for SHI-accredited physician services.

According to this guideline, the existing “Type 16” blank forms (used to prescribe drugs, surgical dressings and most medical aids) may continue to be used for a transitional period until 30 June 2022 as an alternative to the e-prescription format if physicians do not have the technical means to employ e-prescriptions.

The same applies to the electronic certificate of incapacity to work.

In the light of current e-prescription developments, the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians has called upon gematik gmbH to fulfil its statutory responsibility in the approval process and ensure that the components of the telematics infrastructure are in working order at SHI-accredited physicians’ practices.

To use e-prescriptions, physicians must be linked to the telematics infrastructure and be in possession of an electronic health professional card, to enable an electronic signature.

Patients need the e-prescription app to use e-prescriptions.

Pharmacists must also be linked to the telematics infrastructure.

A diagram of the e-prescribing process can be found here .

The obligation to use e-prescriptions will not apply to private insurees."
Gleiss Lutz,TELEMEDICINE ON THE RISE – THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT,"Pharmacists must also be linked to the telematics infrastructure.

A diagram of the e-prescribing process can be found here .

The obligation to use e-prescriptions will not apply to private insurees.

Since 2020, however, Germany’s Association of Private Health Insurers (PKV-Verband) has been a shareholder in gematik GmbH.

Together with SHI players, the Association has been working to introduce a unified digital infrastructure for the healthcare system that links to the telematics infrastructure, thus providing patient and healthcare providers with the electronic patient record and prescriptions.

Looking ahead, it can be assumed that private insurees and healthcare providers will also be able to use the telematics infrastructure in the near future.

3. Increasing number of prescribable digital health applications (DiGAs) and medical devices Since Autumn 2020, digital health applications have been available under statutory health insurance as a new benefit package.

These applications are Class I or IIa medical devices whose main function is based on digital technologies (see “Medical apps to become part of standard healthcare”).

Before they become prescribable in statutory health insurance, digital health applications must be included in the directory of digital health applications by Germany’s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM), pursuant to section 139e German Social Security Code, Book V. This directory currently lists 30 digital health applications (as of 31 March 2022).

The various areas of application range from treating depression to diabetes and multiple sclerosis through to migraines.

According to a report issued in March 2022 by the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds, over 51,000 digital health applications were prescribed between 1 September 2020 and 30 September 2021.

SHI insured patients are entitled to be provided with digital health applications.

These can be prescribed by physicians and psychotherapists, and reimbursed by the health insurance fund.

Insured persons who present proof of a corresponding indication to their health insurance fund receive the digital health application requested.

This may also be possible without a physician’s prescription if the health insurance fund’s statutes provide for this.

In addition to purely digital health applications, health insurance funds also offer chronically ill insured patients the option of treating their illness by networking with their physician.

This is done on the basis of agreements for special care .

The physician remains informed of the patient’s state of health at all times, using digital measuring devices, for example.

The law also enables public healthcare entities to invest in digital health.

Such entities include SHI funds, regional associations of SHI-accredited physicians, the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians and the Federal Association of SHI-Accredited Dentists.

Pursuant to section 68a et seq.

German Social Security Code, Book V, these are entitled to promote digital innovations by assuming some or all of the costs.

Digital innovations include telemedicine/networked healthcare and digital medical devices.

Health insurance funds may also support or commission development by external providers.

For this purpose, health insurance funds may invest up to 2% of their financial reserves as venture capital for developing digital innovations (section 263a German Social Security Code, Book V).

In the development and shaping of digital healthcare, this gives health insurance funds and regional associations of SHI physicians considerably more scope for cooperation with both established providers and start-ups in telemedicine services and digital medical devices.

VII.     Conclusion and outlook The foundation stones for the overdue expansion of telemedicine infrastructure in Germany have been laid since 2018.

A large number of special rules continue to remain in force."
Gleiss Lutz,TELEMEDICINE ON THE RISE – THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT,"A large number of special rules continue to remain in force.

Nevertheless, the electronic patient record, e-prescriptions, increasing digital treatment options through networked medical devices and increased opportunities for third-party payers to invest in and promote digital innovations mean that telemedicine’s share in healthcare in Germany will continue to rapidly rise over the next few years."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYEE STOCK PARTICIPATION PLANS: TAX EXEMPTIONS INCREASED,"The Future Financing Act (Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz) was passed by the German Bundestag on 17 November 2023, and received consent from the Bundesrat on 24 November 2023.

The act aims to – among other things – enhance employee participation in equity.

But while the new act delivers a number of tax incentives, it does not fully implement the more ambitious approach proposed in the draft legislation.

Employee participation plans: Tax exemption increased to EUR 2,000 Employees’ monetary benefits resulting from acquiring free or discounted shares in their employer company or another group company are subject to wage tax to the extent the tax exemption amount is exceeded.

The tax exemption, which was increased to the current amount of EUR 1,440 per calendar year in 2021, will now be further increased to EUR 2,000.

However, this exemption is contingent – among other things – on the condition that the employee shares are offered to all employees who have been with the company for at least one year.

This requirement will not be changed.

The aforementioned tax exemption can also be applied in full (as is the case under the current law) to equity participation by means of deferred compensation (Entgeltumwandlung).

The original bill provided for a higher exemption of EUR 5,000, but required (i) that the employee shares under certain circumstances be financed from additional compensation not originally owed by the employer – and under certain circumstances excluded the application of the tax exemption for deferred compensation – and (ii) provided for a three-year holding period (which was dropped in the final bill).

Although the increased exemption does not reach the size of similar exemptions in other European countries and in particular is not being increased as much as the government bill had proposed (EUR 5,000), it still further contributes to the attractiveness of share-based compensation plans.

The increased exemption will apply to shares granted from 1 January 2024.

Start-ups: special provisions for ESPPs expanded Applicable law already contains a special provision for the taxation of employee participation plans at start-ups that monetary benefits from the award or discounted acquisition of shares are generally only subject to wage tax when (i) the employee leaves the company (ii) the employee sells the shares or (iii) after a period of 12 years has lapsed since the transfer of shares – provided that the start-up itself meets certain criteria (“deferral of taxation”).

The aforementioned tax exemption also applies when determining such monetary benefits, provided the respective requirements are met.

As before, these special provisions for start-ups will not apply to deferred compensation.

Both the current and new laws cover only shares issued in addition to the salary owed.

More start-ups to qualify The act aims to increase the number of start-ups that can benefit from the special provision by raising the companies’ maximum age from 12 to 20 years.

Furthermore, the applicable thresholds and the period during which such requirements must be fulfilled will also be amended: Under the new legislation, the special regime will apply to companies with (i) less than 1,000 employees and (ii) annual sales of no more than EUR 100 million or total assets (on their balance sheet) of no more than EUR 86 million, in each case for the year in which the equity compensation is granted or in one of the six preceding calendar years.

Deferred taxation The taxation of the monetary benefit derived from receiving free or discounted shares can be deferred by up to 12 years.

This period will now be extended to 15 years.

In addition, if the employer voluntarily and irrevocably declares to assume liability for the wage tax to be withheld, only the subsequent “sale” will be taxable even if this sale occurs later than 15 years after receipt of shares or even after the employee has left the company."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYEE STOCK PARTICIPATION PLANS: TAX EXEMPTIONS INCREASED,"Tax reduction for (bad) leavers Wage tax is generally assessed based on the value of the shares at the time they are granted or the value of the shares at sale or other taxable event, whichever is lower.

However, if the employee is required to transfer the shares back to the employer at an amount below market value when they leave, only the lower amount is subject to wage tax.

Maximum volume of stock option programmes Additional leeway for structuring employee participation programmes is also provided by an increase of the permissible volume of conditional capital for funding stock option plans.

Such conditional capital – which must be linked to an exclusion of subscription rights – could previously only comprise up to 10% of share capital; this limit has now been increased to 20%.

It can be assumed that conditional capital will be an alternative sourcing option particularly for young companies that may not yet be listed on the stock exchange.

Application

The new rules for start-ups will enter into force on 1 January 2024 and will be first applied to the 2024 assessment period and to wage tax deductions for 2024.

Gleiss Lutz,A NEW FORM OF MERGER CONTROL – EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION FORMALLY ADOPTED,"Today, the EU has formally adopted its Regulation on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market (“Foreign Subsidies Regulation”).

The final version of the text, which was politically agreed upon already end of June this year, remains very close to the Commission’s initial proposal of May 2021.

The new rules will have a major impact on M&A transactions and will significantly increase the costs and the administrative burden for many EU and non-EU companies doing business in the EU internal market.

The Regulation is supposed to close a “regulatory gap” resulting from the fact that the EU State Aid rules strictly limit the ability of EU Member States to subsidize companies active in the EU without the Commission’s approval, whereas no similar limitation and control mechanism exists for subsidies granted by third countries.

Under the new rules, the Commission will have three far-reaching instruments to tackle distortions caused by foreign subsidies in the internal market.

A notification-based merger control regime to investigate certain M&A transactions A notification-based tool to investigate certain bids in public procurement procedures A general tool to investigate on ad hoc basis all other market situations on the Commission’s own initiative.

Even though the new rules are focused on foreign companies, they will also lead to more red tape for EU companies.

New rules will apply soon and must be taken into consideration already now The Regulation will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the EU’s Official Journal, so potentially still before the end of the year.

Most of the new rules will start to apply 6 months after the entry into force, so most likely around mid-2023 .

This date of application is important, because the new rules will not apply to transactions for which the agreement was concluded, nor to public procurement procedures that have been initiated before that date.

Moreover, the new notification requirements for certain M&A transactions and public procurement procedures will only apply 9 months after the date of application, i.e. most likely starting from Q4 2023.

Importantly, once the new rules apply, the Commission will also be able to scrutinize foreign subsidies granted within the last three to five years prior to the date of application.

The new rules must clearly already be taken into account now when planning M&A transactions, or considering to apply for third-country subsidies.

Far-reaching notification obligations for M&A transactions and bids submitted in public tenders The Regulation introduces new notification obligations based on certain turnover and value thresholds, namely: An obligation to notify certain M&A-transactions , i.e. acquisitions of joint or sole control and the creation of full-function joint ventures (“concentrations) where the acquired undertaking or the joint venture is established in the EU and generated in the last financial year an aggregate turnover in the EU of at least EUR 500 million; and all undertakings (i.e. corporate groups, including the seller group) involved in the concentration were granted from third countries combined aggregate financial contributions in the three financial years prior to notification of more than EUR 50 million.

An obligation of undertakings participating in public procurement procedures (“PPP”) to notify foreign financial contributions, where the estimated total value of that public procurement is equal to or greater than EUR 250 million; and the economic operator participating in such public procurement procedure was granted aggregate financial contributions in the three financial years prior to notification or equal to or greater than EUR 4 million per third country.

If this threshold (b) is not met, the bidder has to submit a declaration listing all foreign financial contributions received and confirming that the foreign financial contributions received are not notifiable."
Gleiss Lutz,A NEW FORM OF MERGER CONTROL – EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION FORMALLY ADOPTED,"In addition, the Commission is entitled to request the ad hoc-notification of concentrations or PPP participations even if they do not meet these thresholds.

In such a case, the relevant concentration or public tender bid is treated in the same way as a notifiable transaction/financial contribution meeting the above thresholds.

„EU Merger Control II“ Both notification obligations are accompanied by standstill obligations : notifiable M&A-transactions cannot be closed, and public tenders cannot be awarded to bidders that had to notify foreign financial contributions, before the Commission has concluded its foreign subsidies review.

A failure to notify or to respect the standstill obligations can be sanctioned with substantial fines (i.e. up to 10% of aggregate global turnover of the undertakings concerned).

The notification and review procedures are independent from potential other reviews , e.g. under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR), with the result that companies may have to prepare and file parallel notifications and cope with parallel proceedings under different legal instruments with different timelines and standstill obligations.

The review of notifiable concentrations is closely modelled after merger control procedure under the EUMR:

There will be a preliminary investigation (“phase I”) lasting 25 working days, potentially followed by an in-depth investigation (“phase II”) of additional 90 working days (with possible extensions upon request and in case of a submission of commitment proposals).

In addition, there will be an informal pre-notification stage prior to the formal notification which may easily take 6 months or more in complex cases.  

The review of notifiable PPP participations is subject to different timelines: the preliminary investigation can last up to 30 working days, and the in-depth investigation can last up to 130 working days from the receipt of the complete notification.

The investigation measures which will be at the Commission’s disposal (in particular RFIs and dawnraids) are also largely inspired by the instruments available under the EUMR.

Importantly, the Regulation provides for far-reaching alleviations of the Commission’s burden of proof in case the undertaking under investigation and/or the third country concerned fail to cooperate with the Commission.

Notification requirement may apply even in the absence of any foreign subsidies The notion of “ third party financial contributions ” that determine the notification obligations are extremely broad and include many types of transactions and measures that ultimately may not be “subsidies” at all: Relevant financial contributions include the transfer of funds or liabilities, such as capital injections, grants, loans, loan guarantees, fiscal incentives, setting off of operating losses, compensation for financial burdens imposed by public authorities, debt forgiveness, debt to equity swaps or rescheduling, but also any foregoing of revenue that is otherwise due and even the mere provision or purchase of goods or services, regardless of whether these transactions are conducted at market terms or not.

Relevant “third country” originators of “foreign financial contributions” are not only foreign government authorities, but also all public and even private entities whose actions can be attributed to the third country.

Importantly, all such “financial contributions” from all third countries granted in the last three years prior to notification have to be taken into account, regardless of whether they are directly or even indirectly linked to the transaction/PPP participation at issue.

The relevant “financial contributions” are not confined to contributions received by the legal entities directly participating in an M&A-project or PPP."
Gleiss Lutz,A NEW FORM OF MERGER CONTROL – EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION FORMALLY ADOPTED,"The relevant “financial contributions” are not confined to contributions received by the legal entities directly participating in an M&A-project or PPP.

Rather, all financial contributions received by any member of the corporate group of the participating entity have to be added together for the purpose of assessing whether the notification thresholds are met.

Given the broad scope of the notion of “financial contribution”, the identification of all such relevant contributions alone will be difficult and burdensome .

In addition, it is likely that a very large number of transactions by international players will have to be notified and reviewed under the new regulation.

It remains to be seen whether and how the Commission will be able to cope with this additional workload.

Ex officio tool may allow Commission to investigate M&A transactions even after closing In addition to the two notification based instruments, the Commission will be able to investigate also on its own initiative potential distortions arising from foreign subsidies, and to adopt redressive measures.

This includes even foreign subsidies granted in the last 5 years prior to the start of the application of the Regulation to the extent they continue to have distortive effects.

Under this so-called ex-officio instrument, the Commission may even decide to carry out a review on its own initiative of already implemented concentrations or awarded public contracts , notably in cases where no prior notification was required because the notification thresholds were not reached.

If the distortion is substantial and cannot be remedied by behavioural or structural measures or by the repayment of the subsidy, the Commission could even decide to remedy the distortion by ordering the undertakings to unwind the concentration.

Substantive test leaves many questions open In terms of substance, the Regulation empowers the Commission to examine whether foreign financial contributions constitute “ foreign subsidies” that “distort the internal market” , and to ensure that such distortions are remedied by commitments, or by “redressive measures” imposed by the Commission.

The Commission may also prohibit notifiable transactions or tender awards to subsidized undertakings if no appropriate commitments are offered by the undertakings concerned.

Foreign subsidies shall be deemed to exist where a financial contribution of a third country (i) confers a “benefit” to an undertaking engaging in an economic activity in the internal market; and (ii) is “selective”, i.e. limited to one or more specific undertakings or industries.

These notions are very similar to the well-established concepts of “advantage” and “selectivity” under EU State Aid law and will likely be interpreted in line with the case law and Commission practice on the EU State Aid law concepts .  

Broadly speaking, this means that a “foreign subsidy” will be deemed to exist if an undertaking/industry obtains a financial contribution from foreign state resources (or resources/entities attributable to the foreign state) at terms that the undertaking could not have obtained from private actors on the market, and if that financial contribution is not made available to all other undertakings/industries in a similar situation.

If a foreign contribution constitutes a foreign subsidy, the Commission will further assess whether this subsidy “distorts the internal market” , i.e. whether it is liable to improve the competitive position of the undertaking concerned in the internal market and thus actually or potentially negatively affects competition on the internal market.

The Regulation contains a non-exhaustive list of indicators factoring into this assessment, such as the amount and nature of the subsidy, the economic and competitive situation of the undertaking and the markets concerned, the purpose and conditions attached to the foreign subsidy, as well as its use on the internal market."
Gleiss Lutz,A NEW FORM OF MERGER CONTROL – EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION FORMALLY ADOPTED,"In addition, the Regulation specifies certain categories of foreign subsidies that will “most likely” be deemed to distort the internal market, i.e. Foreign subsidies granted to an ailing undertaking in absence of a viable restructuring plan; Unlimited guarantees for debts/liabilities of beneficiary undertakings; Export financing measures that are not in line with the OECD Arrangement on officially supported export credits; Subsidies directly facilitating a concentration or the submission of an “unduly advantageous tender” that would enable the undertaking concerned to win a public contract.

On the other hand, the Regulation clarifies that certain types of foreign subsidies should benefit from a more benevolent treatment: A foreign subsidy shall not be considered to distort the internal market if its total amount does not exceed the amount of a de minimis aid as defined in Regulation 1407/2013 – i.e. EUR 200,000 – per third country over any consecutive period of three financial years.

A foreign subsidy is unlikely to distort the internal market if its total amount does not exceed EUR 4 million over any consecutive period of three financial years.

A foreign subsidy may be considered not to distort the internal market to the extent that it is aimed at making good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences.

If the Commission finds that a foreign subsidy distorts the internal market, the Commission will further assess whether the distortive effects may be counterbalanced or possibly even outweighed by positive effects “on the development of the relevant subsidized economic activity on the internal market, while considering other positive effects of the foreign subsidy such as broader positive effects in relation to the relevant policy objectives, in particular those of the Union” .

Regrettably, the Regulation does not contain any guidance as to how the “balancing test” shall actually be applied in practice.

The Commission seems to be left with almost unlimited discretion in weighing the negative and positive effects of the foreign subsidy and in deciding on the redressive measures or commitments it deems appropriate.

It is likely that the Commission will use the “balancing test” and its power to request commitments or impose redressive measures to shape foreign subsidies in a way that would ensure the equal treatment of recipients of foreign subsidies and recipients of State Aid granted by EU Member States.

However, this is not guaranteed, and there remains a significant risk that foreign subsidies and their recipients may be held to stricter standards than the ones applicable under EU State Aid law.

Red tape and legal uncertainty There is no question that the new regulation will lead to significantly more red tape for any company doing business or willing to invest in the EU.

The notification procedure for planned acquisitions and PPP participations will be costly and time-consuming.

The new system is to run in parallel to the merger control systems at EU and national level, as well as the national rules of foreign trade law and investment control which will also continue to apply.

The standstill obligations, as well as the potential risks and uncertainties – including the possibility of ex officio investigations in cases in which the notification thresholds are not met, potentially even after closing – will also have to be addressed in M&A deal documentations.

From the perspective of a foreign investor, all these parallel regimes with different requirements and objectives create a complicated maze that will be increasingly difficult – if not impossible – to navigate without highly specialized legal advice of practitioners experienced not only in M&A-deals and merger control, but also in EU State Aid law and national FDI regimes."
Gleiss Lutz,A NEW FORM OF MERGER CONTROL – EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION FORMALLY ADOPTED,"The Commission has announced that it will issue draft implementing acts including notification forms by the end of the year or early 2023, with a view to be able to adopt them before the Regulation starts to apply.

The Commission is also planning to adopt a simplified procedure for unproblematic transactions, but is unlikely that the simplified notification procedure will already be available from the beginning.

Detailed guidelines on the application of the new rules will probably not become available until three years after the entry into force.

However, the Commission has committed to provide initial clarifications regarding the concept of a distortion on the internal market and the application of the balancing test at the latest 12 months after the date of application.

Until such guidance will enter into force and will consequently bind the Commission when exercising its discretion, undertakings active in the EU and benefitting from foreign subsidies (or undertakings acquiring EU-based recipients of such subsidies) will be exposed to significant legal uncertainty when investing and/or competing in the EU.

Conclusion The new rules will have a major impact on M&A transactions and will significantly increase the costs and the administrative burden for many EU and non-EU companies doing business in the EU internal market.

The practical relevance of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation in the longer term will largely depend on the reaction of Non-EU countries.

The Regulation explicitly stipulates that international agreements concluded by the EU take precedent over the proposed new regulation.

The very far-reaching and ambiguous content of the Regulation may also work as a bargaining chip and a strategic attempt of the EU to demonstrate to third countries that there is a need for bilateral or multilateral trade agreements with clear rules for a fair and predictable foreign investment regime.

It remains to be seen whether this strategy will succeed."
Gleiss Lutz,UPDATE ON CANNABIS LEGALISATION: BILL FINALISED,"On 16 August 2023, the Federal Cabinet introduced a bill on the partial legalisation of cannabis.

The draft implements the first pillar of the key proposals paper on the legalisation of cannabis for recreational purposes that was already presented on 12 April 2023 (see our article of 12 April ).

The bill in detail – implementation of the first pillar of legalisation Along with amendments to existing laws such as the Criminal Code ( Strafgesetzbuch ), the Narcotics Act ( Betäubungsmittelgesetz ) and the Medicinal Products Act ( Arzneimittelgesetz ), the bill provides in particular for the introduction of a Recreational Cannabis Act ( Konsumcannabisgesetz , “KCanG”) and a Medical Cannabis Act ( Medizinal-Cannabisgesetz , “MedCanG”).

Recreational Cannabis Act The KCanG includes the following regulations: Adults will be able to legally possess up to 25 grams of cannabis for their own consumption.

Non-profit associations (“cannabis clubs” or cultivation associations), with a maximum of 500 members 18 years of age and older, may collectively cultivate cannabis for recreational purposes and supply it only to members for their own consumption.

These clubs will be under the supervision of the state authorities.

A maximum of 25 grams of cannabis per day and 50 grams per month may be dispensed to each member.

People under 21 years of age may only receive a maximum of 30 grams per month.

Consumption will not be permitted in the club rooms (the consumption of alcohol will also be prohibited).

The clubs will have to maintain a minimum distance from schools and day-care centres, and the consumption of cannabis will be prohibited within a 200m radius of schools, day-care centres and the cultivation associations themselves.

Consumption of cannabis in pedestrian zones before 20:00 will not be allowed.

In the future, each adult will be allowed to have three cannabis plants for home cultivation.

For this purpose, cultivation associations may provide their members with a maximum of seven seeds or five cuttings per month.

Appropriate measures and safety precautions will have to be taken to ensure that home-grown cannabis is not accessed by children, adolescents or third parties.

Contrary to original plans, providing home-grown cannabis to other adults for direct consumption in their own homes will remain prohibited.

The law will be reevaluated after four years.

Medical Cannabis Act (MedCanG)

The new MedCanG is intended to make an even clearer distinction between medical cannabis and non-medical (recreational) cannabis.

For this reason, the regulations on medical cannabis will be set out in a separate new law.

This means that regulations that were previously scattered throughout various laws will now be consolidated in one place.

Other than that, however, there are hardly any material changes compared to the current legal situation.

It will still be the case that only companies commissioned and licensed by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte ) may cultivate medicinal cannabis.

The most important change is that a special narcotic prescription form will no longer be required and a normal doctor’s prescription will be sufficient.

Timetable

The bill now adopted by the Federal Cabinet essentially incorporates the previously-announced key points of the first pillar, and is expected to be presented to the Federal Parliament (Bundestag) for discussion after parliament’s summer recess.

The governing coalition’s parliamentary groups in the Federal Parliament have already announced the need for changes in some areas.

We will report on further developments.

Second pillar of cannabis legalisation: Commercial model projects (draft bill expected in autumn 2023)

The second pillar is expected to result in an initial draft in autumn 2023 and will involve the testing of “commercial supply chains” in model projects in districts and cities of several federal states."
Gleiss Lutz,UPDATE ON CANNABIS LEGALISATION: BILL FINALISED,"For five years, companies are to be allowed to produce, distribute and sell to adults in licensed specialist retail stores.

The model will be scientifically monitored and the findings will be provided to the European Commission.

The possibility of permitting distribution of edibles (e.g. biscuits or cakes containing cannabis) subject to strict conditions is currently being reviewed.

Consequences for cannabis distribution in Germany In view of the bill and the future plans, the cannabis distribution situation in Germany looks as follows:

In contrast to what is stipulated in the coalition agreement, there will be no full-scale legalisation.

Nevertheless, cannabis will become more available in the population as a whole which, from a purely objective standpoint, is also likely to have an impact on law enforcement.

It remains to be seen whether the new possession limits, etc. will actually lead to less bureaucracy and criminal prosecution.

For the time being, commercial production and distribution of cannabis will still only be possible for medical purposes.

However, it is also conceivable that for chronically ill patients, membership in a “cannabis club” will eliminate their need to obtain prescriptions for medical cannabis.

It is very likely that it will only be possible to dispense commercially produced/imported cannabis in licensed shops in the course of implementing the model projects involved in the second pillar.

It is unclear when these model projects will commence.

According to Federal Health Minister Lauterbach, a corresponding bill is planned for autumn 2023.

Next steps In the course of implementing the new two-pillar model, the Federal Government will, by its own account, invoke the interpretive declaration made in 1993 upon ratification of the 1988 UN Convention and issue a statement declaring the project to be compatible with the purpose and legal requirements of the UN Conventions.

Moreover, the Federal Government has announced that alongside the national implementation, it will continue with its efforts to persuade European partners to align with the more liberal approaches of the original (more far-reaching) key proposals paper, while assessing the possibility that a sufficient number of EU Member States will take the initiative to make the EU legal framework more flexible and develop it further.

Recently, the Research Services of the Federal Parliament also published a (further) expert report on the scope for legalisation under EU and international law.

Even though the 43-page study does not explicitly deal with the bill for the CanG, it has numerous implications for the Federal Government’s proposed legalisation.

The report concludes, among other things, that full legalisation would likely contradict applicable EU law.

However, according to the Research Services, partial legalisation in the private sector (pillar 1) as well as scientifically monitored model projects (pillar 2) could in principle be compatible with EU and international law.

The report also concludes that a final assessment of the proposed legalisation can only be carried out by the ECJ, which must resolve questions concerning the interpretation of EU law.

The question of whether the Federal Government’s proposed legalisation is lawful therefore cannot be answered definitively – at least not yet."

Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYER OBLIGED TO PAY THE COSTS OF WORKS COUNCIL TRAINING COURSES,"As a general principle, the employer must bear the equipment-related and personal costs associated with the activities of the works council and both parties must at all times work together in a spirit of trust and proportionality.

The Federal Labour Court has now provided further details of the scope of the employer’s duty to pay the costs of works council training courses.

Federal Labour Court, decision of 17 November 2021 – 7 ABR 27/20 Facts

The parties were in dispute about whether the employer was obliged to reimburse the works council for training costs associated with a works council member’s participation in an introductory seminar.

The works council had been billed EUR 831.81 in seminar fees plus a further EUR 233.98 in flat-rate day charges and parking costs.

Seminar participants had received a “starter set” comprising, among other things, a tablet for works council activities, a legal commentary on the Works Constitution Act and a calculator (so called “seminar extras”), and had also been able to have a free initial consultation with a lawyer.

There had been no option to book the seminar with the selected provider without the starter set and free initial consultation.

The prices for equivalent seminars from organisers not including comparable extras were not significantly lower.

The employer had refused to cover the costs of the works council member’s participation.

The works council claimed that it had chosen the selected seminar provider because it was familiar with it and had expected – and received – high quality training from it.

The employer claimed that the starter set alone had a value of EUR 442.90.

It considered the costs disproportionately high and unnecessary.

Both Darmstadt Labour Court and Hessen Higher Labour Court had confirmed that the employer was responsible for the costs.

Decision of the Federal Labour Court The Seventh Civil Panel also ruled in the works council’s favour.

Pursuant to section 40 Works Constitution Act, the employer was obliged to pay the costs arising from the works council’s activities.

This included the costs in connection with a work council member’s participation in a training event pursuant to section 37(6) Works Constitution Act, provided that the knowledge imparted was necessary for the participant’s works council activities.

According to the Court, the works council had a margin of discretion when deciding whether training was necessary, and this discretion extended to the content of the training event.

As the obligation to bear costs was subject to the requirement of cooperation in a spirit of trust as set out in section 2(1) Works Constitution Act however, the works council must only burden the employer with costs that the works council considered reasonable.

The works council must not consider participation in a training event necessary if comparable knowledge could reasonably be obtained for a lower price elsewhere.

Based on these considerations, the Federal Labour Court held that the works council had taken sufficient account of the principle of proportionality.

The price for the seminar had been within the range of what was customary in the market.

The works council could have been found to have overstepped its margin of discretion had the seminar extras significantly influenced the cost of the seminar, but there was no evidence of this given the moderate price of the seminar.

One could instead assume that the works council member would have participated in the training even without the seminar extras.

The Federal Labour Court expressly left open the question whether the promise of the free seminar extras meant that the works council member had been unlawfully favoured pursuant to sentence 2, section 78 Works Constitution Act.

However, even if this promise were null and void, this did not invariably mean that the entire contract for training was null and void."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYER OBLIGED TO PAY THE COSTS OF WORKS COUNCIL TRAINING COURSES,"However, even if this promise were null and void, this did not invariably mean that the entire contract for training was null and void.

In the case in dispute, it must instead be assumed that participation would have occurred even without the promised extras.

The works council had also provided sufficient proof of the – refundable – seminar fee.

There was no need for itemisation of the costs for participation in the training event.

The submitted invoices basically needed to show the services provided by the training organiser that were covered by the employer’s obligation to bear costs and the prices charged for these.

Should seminar fees be invoiced as a lump sum, however, it was generally sufficient to state the agreed amount and indicate the flat rate.

Gleiss Lutz comments This decision of the Seventh Civil Panel fleshes out current established case law on the employer’s obligation to pay.

Provided that the costs of works council training measures are necessary and reasonable, the employer is required to reimburse them.

The works council has a margin of discretion with respect to the decision on costs.

Any seminar extras, even on a larger scale, do not necessarily exclude the employer’s obligation to reimburse.

It is instead the circumstances of the individual case, and in particular any comparable training offers, that are relevant to the requisite assessment of proportionality."
Gleiss Lutz,CRYPTOASSETS AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING,"The metaverse opens up new spaces and opportunities for virtual content, in particular the use of virtual assets – whether these are cryptocurrencies or other tokens such as NFTs.

The widespread use of cryptoassets brings with it considerable challenges for obliged entities in terms of the anti-money laundering rules.

And it is not only financial service providers who make it possible to trade in cryptoassets that are faced with increased due diligence obligations.

Increasing importance and regulation Recent years have seen cryptoassets become increasingly relevant of in the context of anti-money laundering law.

In 2020 alone, the Financial Intelligence Unit (“ FIU ”) received around 2,050 suspicious activity reports, with the obliged entities pointing to “irregularities in connection with cryptocurrencies” as the reason for reporting.

Cryptocurrencies have become a focus of anti-money laundering legislation, not least on the back of the implementation of the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5).

The aim of legislators is to adjust existing anti-money laundering measures so as to target cryptoassets more specifically; these measures include the German Regulation on Enhanced Due Diligence for the Transfer of Cryptoassets ( Verordnung über verstärkte Sorgfaltspflichten bei dem Transfer von Kryptowerten , the “ KryptoWTransferV ”) as well as the planned revised version of a European regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain cryptoassets.

This concerns obliged entities under anti-money laundering law who have direct contact with cryptocurrencies, e.g. cryptocurrency bureau de change companies, cryptocurrency exchanges or financial service providers, but also non-financial companies that have to deal with the challenges anti-money laundering legislation poses regarding the use of cryptocurrency in their business.

Potential risks of cryptoassets?

Using blockchain technology, assets in crypto form can be transferred on the internet just as quickly and safely as (other) information.

Transfers of cryptoassets can be performed without involving traditional (central) intermediaries.

It is not essential for the parties to the transaction to be identified or authenticated.

This allows decentralised and pseudonymous transfer of digital tokens  as part of financial transactions.

It is precisely this somewhat anonymous transfer that makes it more attractive to criminals, allowing them to abuse virtual currencies for money laundering and related offences.

The reason why cryptocurrencies lend themselves so well to money laundering is essentially down to three characteristics of the virtual payment system: It is (i) decentralised, (ii) pseudonymous and (iii) global.

Transfer of cryptoassets and application of the travel rule The aim of the Wire Transfer Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/847) is to ensure full traceability, thereby countering the risk of funds being transferred largely anonymously.

To achieve this goal, it imposes verification and monitoring obligations on the payment service providers of both the payer and the payee and on intermediary payment service providers.

So far, the list of obligations only applies to transfers of funds in the form of “banknotes and coins, scriptural money or electronic money” and as a result not to virtual assets.

The EU Commission is however planning to revise the Wire Transfer Regulation (proposal COM (2021) 422 final) so that it treats transfers of virtual currencies in the same way as transfers of traditional monetary assets, because the former equally involve money laundering risks.

What is known as the “travel rule” will also apply to virtual asset service providers (“ VASPs ”).

This rule stipulates that VASPs must also record, store and transmit full and complete information about the sender and the recipient at both ends of the transfer whenever virtual assets are transferred."
Gleiss Lutz,CRYPTOASSETS AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING,"They must ensure, in particular, that the name and account number (if any) of the payee are transmitted.

The scope of the Regulation extends to cryptoasset transfers from or to payment service providers, virtual asset service providers or intermediary payment service providers established in the European Union.

In introducing the KryptoWTransferV, the German legislator already ordered that the scope of application of the Wire Transfer Regulation be extended to include transfers of cryptoassets in order to bridge the time until the EU legislative procedure has been completed.

The KryptoWTransferV applies exclusively to German credit and financial service institutions as well as branches and subsidiaries of foreign institutions located in Germany, and lays down enhanced due diligence obligations for these.

If these entities act as cryptoasset service providers within the meaning of section 2, no. 5 KryptoWTransferV for both the sender and the recipient, the requirements of the Wire Transfer Regulation must be observed: The cryptoasset service provider acting on behalf of the payer must provide the payee’s cryptoasset service provider with the name, address and account number (e.g. the public key) of the payer and the name and account number of the payee.

Before transferring funds, the payer’s cryptoasset service provider must also verify – on the basis of documents, data or information it obtains from a reliable and independent source – the accuracy of the information provided by the payer (Articles 4 and 6 Regulation (EU) 2015/847).

The cryptoasset service provider for the payee must ensure that it receives and stores the information about the payer and the payee and that effective procedures are put in place to make sure that this is done.

In addition, it must also introduce effective risk-based procedures to determine whether a transfer for which information about the payer and/or the payee is missing or incomplete, can be executed, rejected or suspended and whether the transfer is a reportable, suspicious one (Articles 7 and 8 Regulation (EU) 2015/847).

If not all parties acting on either side are cryptoasset service providers, e.g. if “unhosted wallets” are being used, the obliged entities must ensure that information on the payer and the payee (name and address) of the transfer is collected to ensure the transfer is traceable.

The obliged entities must identify and assess the risk of abuse associated with the transfer in terms of money laundering and terrorist financing , and take risk-appropriate measures (section 4 KryptoWTransferV).

Non-financial companies It is not only obliged entities which handle cryptoassets by virtue of the very nature of their business that must comply with the obligations in this regard under money laundering law.

Even for non-financial companies such as goods traders, some of whom enjoy exemptions, the use of virtual assets can give rise to (further) obligations under anti-money laundering law.

While the use of cryptocurrencies does not automatically render a transfer suspicious or result in relevant obligations, the presence of further risk factors can easily lead to identification requirements under anti-money laundering law due to the (latent) increased risk potential of cryptoassets.

The pseudonymity of cryptoasset transactions may mean that obliged entities face significant challenges, especially when it comes to meeting their identification obligations.

If the obliged entities do not sufficiently comply with their identification and reporting obligations, the transaction cannot proceed; a violation of the identification and reporting obligations can result in significant fines.

Non-financial companies that use/accept cryptoassets must also put systems in place to prevent abuse."
Gleiss Lutz,CRYPTOASSETS AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING,"Non-financial companies that use/accept cryptoassets must also put systems in place to prevent abuse.

If transfer are carried out through a regulated cryptoasset service provider in accordance with the KryptoWTransferV (or the future revised version of Regulation (EU) 2015/847), the travel rule would mean that obliged entities would be in a closed system (loop) and therefore largely be able to rely on the information already within that system.

If transfers from unhosted wallets are to be accepted, then this would (most definitely) require the implementation of suitable verification procedures.

Conclusion It is not only because of the technical innovations that cryptoassets pose challenges for obliged entities under anti-money laundering legislation.

German and European legislators are also pushing ahead with plans for stricter regulation, in order to keep abreast of developments.

Due to the money laundering risks posed by cryptoassets, further changes to the law can be expected in the future.

In particular, companies that facilitate trading in cryptoassets and those that use or intend to use virtual currencies should therefore determine whether they are subject to special government anti-money laundering regulations in relation to cryptoassets, comply with legal requirements that apply specifically to cryptoassets, and adapt their own risk-based procedures, to bring them in line with both the legal and technical requirements for cryptoassets.

Gleiss Lutz,PROCESSING EMPLOYEE DATA IN THE METAVERSE,"Once employees start working in the metaverse, employers face the question of how and to what extent they can process employee data.

While metaverse interactions generate a wide variety of data, any associated processing requires a legal basis.

Recording data in the metaverse Information on facial expressions, gestures and other physiological reactions to content and events in the metaverse as well as data on productivity and resilience can be logged in the metaverse or determined by linking data together.

Speech can be recorded, and it is even possible to log employees’ pulse, blood pressure or ECG readings – and check on their health in the process.

This could enable employers to take measures to counter burnout and other health issues at an early stage.

The Federal Data Protection Act Section 26 Federal Data Protection Act ( Bundesdatenschutzgesetz , “BDSG”) applies to processing data generated in the metaverse.

Under this provision, employee data from the metaverse may be processed if that processing is necessary, in particular, to perform or terminate the employment relationship (section 26(1), sentence 1 BDSG) or to detect criminal offences (section 26(1), sentence 2 BDSG).

Article 88(1)

GDPR lists the performance of the employment contract, the planning and organisation of work, health and safety at work and the protection of the employer’s or customers’ property as examples of possible processing purposes.

Such purposes also include monitoring employees’ behaviour and performance.  

Following one of the fundamental principles of data protection law, personal data may also be processed in the context of employment based on the employee’s consent pursuant to section 26(2) BDSG.

Data processing in individual cases Storing data for the purpose of documenting virtual meetings may be deemed necessary for the performance of employment relationships within the meaning of section 26 BDSG.

Data processing is legally justified if it is necessary and the intended aim of the processing cannot be achieved by other equally appropriate means.

It can be argued that such processing is necessary if the metaverse offers additional benefit – which is easy to substantiate if employees use the metaverse to discuss 3D models of development and construction work, for example.

Meetings that could also be held via conference call or video conference and do not offer such added value could come under scrutiny from a data protection perspective.

Meetings in the metaverse can, however, be deemed to offer additional benefit if participants who don’t speak the same language – or at least not at the same level – can communicate using speech recognition and translation functions.

In contrast, section 26(3) BDSG specifies that health data can only be processed if this is necessary to exercise rights or fulfil obligations arising from employment, social security or social protection law.

The employer’s duty to ensure employees’ health and safety could be one reason for recording health data in the metaverse.

But employers need to be cautious about recording private conversations – section 201(1), no. 1 Criminal Code ( Strafgesetzbuch , “StGB”) makes it clear that recording privately spoken words is generally a criminal offence unless consent has been granted.

If there is no legal basis and the employee has not granted consent or this consent is legally invalid, the employee not only has a cease-and-desist claim but might also have a claim for damages against the employer.

Works council’s co-determination rights The co-determination right set out in section 87(1), no. 6 Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz , “BetrVG”) gives the works council the power to shape and restrict the use of employee monitoring technology."
Gleiss Lutz,PROCESSING EMPLOYEE DATA IN THE METAVERSE,"While the legal requirements for employee data protection are tied to data processing operations, the works council’s co-determination right under section 87(1), no. 6 BetrVG relates to the introduction of technical devices.

This means that the works council can oppose the introduction of virtual meeting rooms.

Even though the BetrVG only grants the works council information and monitoring rights when it comes to data protection compliance, this co-determination right actually gives it the power to veto the introduction of technical devices until a conciliation board procedure has been completed.

It is therefore in a company’s interest to check whether proposed systems comply with data protection requirements and to collate information documenting that the use of employee data is necessary and the processing thereof proportionate.

The introduction of such systems can then be negotiated on this basis and any joint assessment of data protection compliance documented where necessary.

Conclusion Before establishing a presence in the metaverse, employers must check what data can be recorded under the BDSG – bearing in mind both that different areas of activity are likely to be subject to different requirements and that works councils have a co-determination right under section 87(1), no. 6 BetrVG."
Gleiss Lutz,THE BMWK’S ELECTRICITY STORAGE STRATEGY – A REGULATORY BOOST FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE,"The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz , “BMWK”) presented its electricity storage strategy on 8 December 2023.

The strategy, which is aimed at supporting the current expansion of electricity storage and at optimising the integration of storage systems into the electricity system, identifies numerous areas for action.

Industry associations had until 16 January 2024 to comment.

The strategy provides a valuable insight into the Federal Government’s future framework for the operation of electricity storage systems and the issues that remain open.

Background Germany’s electricity supply is to be practically climate-neutral by 2035.

Integrating the rapidly increasing volumes of electricity generated from wind and solar into the electrical power system will demand a high degree of system flexibility.

Electricity storage systems – which can not only store energy, but due to their quick response times can also stabilise the grid frequency by absorbing sudden surges and meeting sudden peaks in demand– are destined to play a key role in the electricity grid of the future.

Market-driven growth Electricity storage units can be divided into large-scale storage units (pumped storage power plants, large-scale battery storage systems) and small-scale storage units (commercial storage, home storage and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-home or vehicle-to-grid capabilities).

While increasing numbers of pumped storage power plants and large-scale battery storage systems are under construction, the majority of the battery storage systems currently registered are home storage systems.

The BMWK sees the growth of storage deployments as a market-driven development which both should be encouraged and which demonstrates the current economic viability of electricity storage systems.  

The published strategy analyses the current situation and accompanying legal framework and identifies specific areas for action to support the trend, with some measures already under implementation.

Industry associations remain sceptical about the economic viability of electricity storage systems, arguing that their current profitability is largely due to their use for supplying balancing energy and the sufficiently high prices for primary balancing energy that have existed to date.

This could be counteracted by a further liberalisation of the electricity markets so as to allow high prices for a limited period of time, which could ensure the necessary basis for the economic viability of storage systems in arbitrage trading.

What areas for action have been identified?

Improvements to information and models The BMWK has set itself the general task of identifying and removing obstacles to the growth of the electricity storage market.

It also aims to put the discussion on a more fact-based and specific footing, removing the various conflicting assumptions and figures about the need for storage capacities currently in circulation.

These improvements are to provide a basis for developing battery growth models and storage statistics, which makes it clear that the BMWK’s electricity storage strategy is a long-term one and that support for the market will be ongoing.

The BMWK also sees a specific need for reform and has plans to further develop the legal framework.

Changes to subsidies under the EEG The BMWK plans to examine whether the conditions for subsidies under section 19 Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Eneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz , “EEG”) could be improved to allow systems to store not only electricity from renewable energy plants (green electricity) but also electricity from the grid generally (grey electricity) without losing their subsidy for the proportion of green electricity stored.

The strict separation of these two types of electricity under the current legislation causes valuable storage potential to be lost."
Gleiss Lutz,THE BMWK’S ELECTRICITY STORAGE STRATEGY – A REGULATORY BOOST FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE,"The strict separation of these two types of electricity under the current legislation causes valuable storage potential to be lost.

There are already technical solutions with which to deal with the measurement-related issues of distinguishing between grey and green electricity stored simultaneously, and these have been provided for in section 21(1) and (4) Energy Financing Act ( Energiefinanzierungsgesetz ).

This experience can be called on in adapting section 19 EEG.

Since every megawatt-hour stored reduces the peak power required from fossil fuels, which will become increasingly expensive in the future, amending section 19 EEG also has macroeconomic benefits.

Support for electricity storage co-located with renewable energy plants The BMWK welcomes the energy industry’s plans to routinely equip solar parks with battery storage and intends to examine whether further incentives are required for the construction of other co-located storage systems, in particular at wind farms and existing solar installations.

Linked to this, the BMWK will also examine options for the further development of innovation tenders.

There are also issues with the redispatch rules for storage systems operated together with renewable energy plants.

At present, the electricity produced by plants of this kind is not permitted to be fed into the storage system if the plant is required to reduce its output due to congestion.

This needs to be improved as soon as possible, such as by integrating storage into the framework of contracts for difference.

That aside, present practice for the dimensioning of grid connection points for renewable energy plants with electricity storage systems contravenes the interests at stake.

For example, it is not useful to require that they be able to handle the total maximum load that the renewable energy plant and the storage system can produce together, given they are often used anti-cyclically.

More appropriate dimensioning requirements are needed.

Overall, grid-connection-point use is most efficient where they can be used by both renewable energy and storage installations (hybrid grid connection points).

Moreover, the discussion should not only be about equipping new renewable energy plants with storage systems but should also look at plants scheduled to be retrofitted.

Grid fee reforms The BMWK is considering talks on extending the grid fee cancellation for large-scale storage facilities under section 118(6) Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , “EnWG”) that applies until 2029.

As regards small storage installations, the BMWK recognises that the unit prices in the current system of low-voltage-related grid fees encourage an own use of self-generated electricity wherever possible and that, as a result, the flexibilisation potential of small storage systems is lost.

According to the BMWK, the Federal Network Agency’s ( Bundesnetzagentur ) stipulations on controllable consumption devices will change this by enabling small storage facilities such as home storage systems and heat pumps to benefit from reduced grid fees.

The BMWK’s comments lack further proposals on incentives for small storage systems.

For example, consideration could be given to extending the exemption to mobile storage systems and other important technologies that improve flexibility within the grid (power-to-heat and electrolysers).

This would allow the time-variable grid charges under the stipulations on controllable consumption devices to be developed into dynamic grid charges.

Adjustments to building cost subsidies and contributions to grid connection costs The BMWK identifies the major regional differences in the cost of electricity storage projects, and hence the difficulty in calculating project costs, as a further obstacle.

The Bundesnetzagentur is therefore to examine whether binding provisions on construction cost subsidies and contributions to grid connection costs may help counteract these differences."
Gleiss Lutz,THE BMWK’S ELECTRICITY STORAGE STRATEGY – A REGULATORY BOOST FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE,"The Bundesnetzagentur is therefore to examine whether binding provisions on construction cost subsidies and contributions to grid connection costs may help counteract these differences.

Introducing a waiver or at least a discount for network-benefiting storage systems would also be desirable.

Reductions in bureaucratic hurdles Bureaucratic hurdles are to be addressed, especially overly slow grid connections and overly long and complicated authorisation procedures.

Turning to insufficient grid connection speeds, the BMWK prioritises four topics, namely standardising technical connection conditions, simplifying the grid connection procedure, utilising grid capacities and cost transparency.

It holds out the prospect of a quick implementation (or start in implementing) the industry’s proposals and plans to examine whether the grid connection priority for green electricity storage systems under section 8(1)

EEG should be extended to all energy storage systems.

The authorisation procedures for large-scale storage installations are also to be made shorter and simpler.

Increasing local acceptance The storage strategy also addresses societal obstacles, i.e. local acceptance issues.

Since local political resistance can jeopardise large electricity storage projects in particular, the BMWK plans to consider whether and how far improved municipal financial involvement may aid local acceptance of electricity storage installations.

Firstly, the BMWK is considering an amendment to section 29 Trade Tax Act ( Gewerbesteuergesetz ) by the Federal Ministry of Finance ( Bundesfinanzministerium ) in order to extend the trade tax standards currently applicable to companies that operate electricity-generating plants to also include storage facility operators.

Secondly, the BMWK plans to examine whether it is possible and sensible for municipalities to contribute financially to electricity storage systems under section 6 EEG.

The measures already implemented, such as classifying electricity storage systems as in the overriding public interest, are also helpful in this context as it gives them a suitably high weighting in planning and approval decisions.

Market-based procurement systems to increase system stability The BMWK recognises a need for electricity storage to play a greater role in system stability going forward, meaning that the technical properties of electricity storage systems and procurement processes must be developed further.

Three ways to secure a greater contribution from electricity storage are identified: via mandatory technical requirements under the grid connection rules, by voluntary market-based procurement, and as a component of the grid operating resources of grid system operators.

The Federal Network Agency has already made provision for market-based procurement systems for non-frequency-based ancillary services within the framework of section 12h EnWG.

Market-based procurement systems are currently being developed for voltage stability / reactive power and system inertia, to which electricity storage systems are very well suited, with stipulations on these planned for 2024.

In general, the BMWK intends to look at the extent to which the framework conditions can be improved (through stipulations or authorisation procedures) so that electricity storage systems can provide more balancing services in future.

This highlights the grid-stabilising role that electricity storage systems will play going forward.

A further step forward would be if grid operators could include battery storage systems as grid operating resources in their future planning since in certain circumstances battery storage can be a more favourable alternative to grid expansion.

Evaluation of “grid booster” installations Sections 11a and 11b EnWG already permit grid operators to install and operate battery storage systems for purely grid-related purposes under certain conditions."
Gleiss Lutz,THE BMWK’S ELECTRICITY STORAGE STRATEGY – A REGULATORY BOOST FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE,"The BMWK is awaiting a report from the operators of two grid-booster pilot plants to evaluate the associated possibilities.

New areas of business will open up if these reports are positive.

It is crucial to the evaluation that the criteria are transparent and that cost-benefit analysis plays a central role.

In the meantime, the framework conditions for the procurement of additional storage capacities can continue to be developed close to market.

Capitalising on the potential of bi-directional charging The BMWK wishes to capitalise on the potential of bi-directional electric-vehicle charging and points to recent, successful projects – for example, the National Centre for Charging Infrastructure has developed specific recommended actions to remove obstacles to bidirectional charging.

The BMWK also holds out the prospect of proposals on future improvements to the national and European legal framework, but without outlining any specific measures.

Given that electric vehicles offer large electricity storage capacities that already exist, expanding bidirectional charging makes sense.

However, this potential will only be ever available to a limited extent and on a small scale, meaning that bidirectional charging will not be able to replace large stationary battery storage systems.

Moreover, tapping this potential will require the rapid ramp-up of smart metering systems, especially home energy management systems with the ability to automatically react to price signals from the grid or market.

Better flexibility through energy storage The BMWK wishes to strengthen electricity storage as a way to provide flexibility on the market and in the grid, taking into account the discussions within the Climate-Neutral Electricity System Platform and giving consideration to a variety of sources of revenue.

The position of electricity storage could also be improved by approving electricity storage systems to be used within the framework of section 13k EnWG (“utilisation before curtailment”).

Electrolysers and heat accumulators can also be flexibly controlled to in a way that benefits the grid.

Consideration should therefore be given to whether these systems should be treated in the same way as battery storage systems.

Overall, regulations that restrict storage systems to one or a few functions are a hindrance to flexibility.

Promotion of research and development of production capacities Last but not least, the BMWK states its intention to continue to keep a close eye on ways to promote innovation and research and points to its activities in building up production capacities in battery cell production and the entire battery value chain.

Other aspects Criticism of the transposition of the EU definition of energy storage into German law The BMWK’s view that electricity storage systems should continue to be treated as consumers or producers under energy law despite the transposition of the EU definition of energy storage into the EnWG must be seen critically.

This view is not in line with the EU provision defining the activity of energy storage, and nor does it do justice to the role of electricity storage in the electricity grid because it puts electricity storage systems at risk of double charges, i.e. as producers and consumers (for example, where they have to pay grid fees, levies and surcharges for stored electricity as their “fuel”, which producers of primary energy do not have to pay).

Outcomes like this are not in line with the interests involved.

Lack of technology neutrality Overall, the electricity storage strategy lacks technology neutrality.

In addition to battery storage and pumped-storage power plants, individual cases require consideration to be given to other technologies capable of storing energy in a different medium and converting it back into electricity.

There is insufficient discussion of long-duration energy storage, for example."
Gleiss Lutz,THE BMWK’S ELECTRICITY STORAGE STRATEGY – A REGULATORY BOOST FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE,"There is insufficient discussion of long-duration energy storage, for example.

Outlook The BMWK’s electricity storage strategy clearly demonstrates the importance it attaches to electricity storage technology for the future and also that it recognises the key issues and problem areas. 

However, although it focusses on the correct topics and outlines initial approaches, it currently offers only few specific measures.

This also applies to the question of the precise functions storage systems should fulfil in the electricity system of the future.

To date, there has been no detailed analysis of the various market segments, such as home storage systems, commercial and industrial storage systems, grid storage systems, and large-scale storage systems co-located with solar and wind parks.

There may also be relevant potential in electromobility storage systems.

As such, the electricity storage strategy is currently primarily a status report.

The BMWK must hone and develop its electricity storage strategy further if it is to meet the practical needs of the market and effectively promote the growth it intends to promote."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTERS INTO FORCE,"A year into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU has introduced further economic sanctions against Russia.

What is now the tenth sanctions package took effect on 25 February 2023, and toughens the sanctions adopted on 16 December 2022 ( newsletter of 22 December 2022 ), 6 October 2022 ( newsletter of 10 October 2022 ), 21 July 2022 ( newsletter of 28 July 2022 ), 3 and 4 June 2022 ( newsletter of 9 June 2022 ), 9 April 2022 ( newsletter of 12 April 2022 ), 16 March 2022 ( newsletter of 18 March 2022 ), 28 February / 2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) and 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ).

The aim of the European Union’s tenth sanctions package is to further increase the economic and financial pressure on Russia while further restricting its military and technological warfare capabilities.

To this end, it has imposed more import and export bans and again expanded the list of personal sanctions.

It is worth noting that restrictive measures have also been imposed on Iranian manufacturers who have been supplying Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles (drones).

At the same time the European Union is continuing its policy of making it easier for European companies to wind down their business activities in Russia and withdraw completely from the Russian market.

EU sanctions In its tenth sanctions package (Regulations (EU) 2023/426 and 2023/427, Implementing Regulations (EU) 2023/428, 2023/429, 2023/430) the EU continues to tighten and modify the existing sanctions against Russia.

The measures affect in particular the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and the trade sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 .

I. Personal sanctions The EU has added 87 individuals and 34 entities to the list of personal sanctions since its last package, and the list now has more than 1,600 entries .

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons listed in Annex I to the Regulation.

No funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of these persons.

The natural persons listed are also banned from entering or transiting through EU territory (see our newsletters of 7 March 2022 , 12 April 2022 and 9 June 2022 ).

The tenth sanctions package mainly adds persons and entities working in the Russian military and defence sector, in particular members of the Federation Council, members of the Duma, officials in executive positions as well as representatives of the Russian defence sector to the list in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 269/2014.For the very first time, some of the additions are Iranian individuals and entities involved in developing and supplying drones and components to support the Russian military.

Sanctions have also been imposed on members of Russian mercenary group Wagner.

The European Union is also taking action against activities of the Wagner mercenary group in other countries such as Mali and the Central African Republic.

Implementing Regulations (EU) 2023/7428 and 2023/430 impose personal sanctions on an additional 16 (Russian but also non-Russian) individuals and organisations linked to the activities of the group in Africa.

Since the package of measures introduced on 21 July 2022 ( newsletter of 28 July 2022 ), third parties, i.e. non-listed individuals, entities and bodies, have been obliged to report information concerning assets located in the European Union that belong to individuals subject to personal sanctions (Article 8 Regulation (EU) 269/2014).

Legal entities and natural persons whose registered office or place of residence is in Germany must submit this report to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control.

Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/426 further clarifies this reporting obligation."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTERS INTO FORCE,"Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/426 further clarifies this reporting obligation.

In addition, increased obligations apply to central securities depositories within the meaning of (EU) Regulation No 909/2014 that operate a securities settlement system.

To allow for necessary adjustments to implement these changes, the new requirements will not apply until 26 April 2023.

Specifically: The reporting obligation now also retroactively applies to certain past events .

Those impacted by the obligation must report, in particular, any asset movements, transfers, alterations or uses that have taken place in the two weeks preceding the inclusion of the respective individual, entity or body in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014.

The deadline for reporting assets located in the European Union is two weeks from receipt of the relevant information.

A new Article 8(1a) Regulation (EU) 269/2014 regulates the minimum information that a report must contain (including name, address and VAT or tax identification number, amount or market value and type of relevant assets).

Stricter requirements apply to central securities depositories .

In addition to information relating to assets located in the European Union, these entities must also provide information on extraordinary and unforeseen losses and damage in connection with the assets in question.

In addition to the ad-hoc reporting obligation within the specified two weeks (see above), they must also report to the competent authority every three months and immediately to the Commission.

II.

Trade sanctions The EU also adopted extensive further measures expanding and tightening trade sanctions : Extended export restrictions primarily apply to goods that can aid the Russian Federation’s military and technological capabilities or its defence and security sectors.

To this end, export restrictions have been imposed or tightened, particularly with regard to rare earths and their compounds, electronic integrated circuits and thermal imagers.

In order to create legal certainty in the treatment of exports, the extended export restrictions on the vast majority of newly listed items will not apply to contracts concluded before 26 February 2023 until 27 March 2023.

To minimise the risk of the restrictive measures being circumvented, the transit of dual-use goods and technology and of arms exported from the Union via the territory of Russia has been prohibited.

The European Union does allow exceptions (subject to authorisation) to this ban on transit, but only within narrow limits, such as for humanitarian purposes, health emergencies or in connection with intergovernmental cooperation on space programmes.

Import restrictions (Article 3i Regulation (EU) 833/2014) have again been comprehensively extended to include a wide variety of goods which, in the view of the European Union, contribute to substantial revenues for the Russian Federation, thereby continuing its war of aggression against Ukraine.

In order to create legal certainty in dealing with imports, the extended import restrictions will not apply to contracts concluded before 26 February 2023 until 27 May 2023.

Import quotas will also be created for certain products, and will apply until 30 June 2024.

III.

Reporting obligations in relation to assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia Regulation (EU) 2023/427 introduces a new reporting obligation in relation to assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia: Natural and legal persons, entities and bodies with registered office in European Union, explicitly including the European Central Bank, national central banks and financial sector entities will be required to report certain assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia that they hold or control, or to which they are counterparty (

Article 5a(4a) Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

Reports must be sent to the national authorities and the Commission."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTERS INTO FORCE,"Article 5a(4a) Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

Reports must be sent to the national authorities and the Commission.

A deadline of two weeks as from 26 February 2023 applies for reports to be submitted.

The report must include certain information at minimum (name, address and VAT or tax identification number, amount or market value and type of relevant assets).

The information provided is to be updated every three months.

IV.

Sanctions in the energy sector and in the area of critical infrastructures Entirely new restrictions are contained in Article 5o Regulation (EU) 833/2014, introduced with the tenth sanctions package to protect critical infrastructures, and Article 5p Regulation (EU) 833/2014, introduced to safeguard the security of gas supply: Pursuant to Article 5o(1)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014, it will be prohibited from 27 March 2023 to allow Russian nationals and residents to hold positions on the governing bodies of the owners or operators of critical facilities and/or infrastructures under the CER Directive (Directive (EU) 2022/2557) or the EPCIP Directive (Directive 2008/114/EC).

Only those nationals or residents of Russia who are (at the same time) nationals of an EU Member State, a country belonging to the EEA or Switzerland are exempt from the prohibition in Article 5o(1)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

According to the wording of the Regulation (“enable ... to hold ”), it is not entirely clear whether this is merely a ban on new appointments or whether positions in governing bodies already held by Russian nationals or persons resident in Russia before 27 March 2023 must also be terminated by 27 March 2023.

To safeguard the security of gas supply in the European Union, the new Article 5p Regulation (EU) 833/2014 now bans the provision of gas storage capacity (excluding storage capacities of liquefied natural gas facilities) to Russian nationals; natural persons residing in Russia; legal persons, organisations or bodies residing in Russia; or legal persons, organisations or bodies in which one of the aforementioned persons directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the shares or that act at the direction of one of the aforementioned persons.

In this respect, too, a transitional period until 27 March 2023 will apply, within which contracts for the provision of gas storage capacities covered by the ban must be terminated.

V. Further sanctions Now that the existing air embargo has been expanded, aircraft operators are obliged to report non-scheduled flights between Russia and the EU 48 hours before departure (Article 3d(5) Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

The purpose of this expansion is to ensure compliance with the prohibition under Article 3d(1)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 on any non-Russian-registered aircraft owned, chartered or otherwise controlled by any Russian natural or legal person, entity or body from landing in, taking off from, or overflying, the territory of the EU.

The package also extends the suspension of broadcasting licences of Russian media outlets in the EU under the permanent control of the Russian leadership and the prohibition against broadcasting their content to further stations.

The prohibition in Article 2f Regulation (EU) 833/2014 is intended to prevent the distribution of Russian war propaganda and now also covers Russian state media for Arabic-speaking countries, namely RT Arabic and Sputnik Arabic.

VI.

Further facilitation of withdrawal from the Russian market and disengagement from “listed” shareholders The tenth package does more than merely tighten sanctions, however.

The EU is also making it easier to withdraw from the Russian market in compliance with sanctions, in particular with regard to support services.

And the window in which to disengage from sanctioned shareholders has been extended again: The ninth sanctions package introduced Article 12b Regulation (EU) 833/2014, and a new paragraph 2a has now been added."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTERS INTO FORCE,"Under this paragraph, competent authorities may continue to authorise the performance of services specified in Article 5n

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 until 31 December 2023 if these services (i) are strictly necessary for the divestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia, (ii) such services are provided to and for the exclusive benefit of the legal persons , entities or bodies resulting from the divestment; and (iii) the competent authorities deciding on requests for authorisations have no reasonable grounds to believe that the services might be provided, directly or indirectly, to the Government of Russia or a military end-user or have a military end-use in Russia.

After an authority has issued authorisation, this provision will enable companies to continue offering IT services , for example, that were previously performed on behalf of an EU company’s Russian subsidiary after that subsidiary has been sold , though no later than 31 December 2023.

The EU has also extended the period in which frozen shareholdings in European companies held (directly or indirectly) by persons listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 269/2014 can be released in order to be sold.

The shareholdings can still be unfrozen if they are sold by 31 May 2023 (Article 6b(3)

Regulation (EU) 269/2014).

The requirement that revenue generated by such sales must stay frozen remains in force.

U.S. sanctions The U.S. has also announced new sanctions on the “anniversary” of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“ OFAC ”) has added numerous entries to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (“ SDN List ”) in recent weeks, which now encompasses more than 2,500 targets.

The latest entries include, in particular, additional Russian banks and financial services institutions as well as companies in the technology, electronics and metals and mining sectors.

The new U.S. sanctions are in particular aimed at preventing circumvention of the sanctions , e.g. by providing weapons or financial resources.

The U.S. therefore recently listed 30 additional persons and companies suspected of engaging in (or aiding and abetting) circumvention – including German citizens and Chinese companies.

The aforementioned listing of additional Russian financial institutions was also done for this purpose, among others, i.e. to prevent sanctioned parties from turning to smaller banks and continuing to gain access to the international financial market.

The G7 countries are also planning to introduce a coordination mechanism to enforce sanctions.

According to information from the White House, the U.S. wants to chair the new committee – which will share information on and coordinate further sanctions – for the first year.

Practical consequences and outlook The measures included in the tenth sanctions package – new significant expansions of personal sanctions and the lists of goods underlying the import and export restrictions, on the one hand, and further facilitation of complete withdrawal from the Russian market, on the other – make it clear: European companies that continue to do business in Russia will face more and more risks under sanctions law.

Conversely, the EU is trying to reduce the obstacles to a complete withdrawal from the Russian market – including those created by sanctions.

At present, there are no signs of this situation (withdrawal of restrictions or impediments to withdrawal) being reversed.

European companies that continue to maintain business relations with Russia (whether they import or export products) should carefully check whether the additions to the lists of goods in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 are relevant for their business.

Otherwise, “surprises” may be lurking, especially in Annexes XXIII (export) and XXI (import), which need to be ruled out – particularly in view of the penalties for possible infringements."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTERS INTO FORCE,"Otherwise, “surprises” may be lurking, especially in Annexes XXIII (export) and XXI (import), which need to be ruled out – particularly in view of the penalties for possible infringements.

The provision in Article 5n of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 is proving to be very problematic in daily practice, not only for consulting firms but also for service providers (especially in the IT sector).

Considerable uncertainties persist in this area, including with respect to the question of when services are provided to Russian companies indirectly.

Strict caution is also necessary here, and, in case of doubt, the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA) should be consulted.

Finally, on the positive side, it must be noted that even after one year, the EU sanctions, on the one hand, and the U.S. and UK sanctions, on the other, are largely consistent.

Unlike the sanctions against Iran, the Western countries are essentially united in their approach, so there is no problematic tension for EU companies in this respect."
Gleiss Lutz,VIRTUAL REALITY – THE LEGAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE METAVERSE,"Many companies around the world are exploring the potential of the metaverse and the opportunities Web3 unlocks.

Businesses are opening flagship stores and branch offices in the metaverse, establishing gaming environments or marketing products using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – blockchain-based tokens that refer to a unique digital item and cannot be reproduced.

The list of applications is long and constantly growing.

Although still in its infancy, there is much to suggest that – in the medium term – our interaction with others on metaverse platforms will replace at least parts of the internet as we know it today.

This is an exciting development from a legal perspective – and will see much new legal ground broken.

Gleiss Lutz has been advising clients on metaverse issues for some time, and is now also the first leading business law firm in Germany to have an office in the metaverse .

With more and more companies contemplating moving parts of their business to the metaverse, we have compiled a brief overview of the main legal considerations.

Our expert Digital Economy group is happy to help assess specific plans, discuss individual aspects in depth or answer any questions you may have.

1.

What is the metaverse?

The metaverse is a virtual, three-dimensional environment accessible via the internet.

In this virtual world, users can actively engage in economic, social and cultural activities with the help of customisable avatars.

There are already a broad range of virtual assets and services being traded in significant volumes around the world on metaverse platforms such as Decentraland and Sandbox.

The structure and organisation of metaverse platforms depends heavily on whether they are centralised or decentralised.

Centralised platforms are owned by a single legal entity whereas decentralised ones are run by a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO).

DAO-based structures themselves can present legal challenges, as they do not fit into standard legal categories or forms, but instead use smart contracts stored in the blockchain.

This gives all members of a DAO joint and equal control over fundamental aspects such as governance policies and voting, meaning there is no single decision maker in the traditional sense.

2.

Applicable law The question of which law applies is often not easy to answer in the context of metaverse platforms.

There is no uniform regulatory regime as yet, and some even claim the metaverse exists in a legal vacuum.

However, in Germany at least, this is likely incompatible with the German state’s far-reaching right to claim application of German law – which is why the law that applies in any given case must be determined individually under the principles of private international law.

Platforms’ terms of use – where they contain jurisdiction and choice-of-law clauses – may help elucidate this.

However, the other contributing factors based on the provisions of private international law must also be considered.

What will also be decisive is whether the legal relationship is between a user and the operator of a metaverse platform or between users.

At EU level, the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act are the first steps towards regulating the online market and providing consumer protection.

There is still no regulation of the metaverse specifically.

3. Areas of law to consider It’s impossible to provide an exhaustive list of the relevant fields of law here.

Nevertheless, we’d like to draw attention to the following particularly important areas to keep an eye on if you’re operating on metaverse platforms:

Commercial: The trade in digital items such as clothing for avatars, digital real estate, and advertising space raises fundamental legal issues around the ownership of cryptoassets, the liability risk associated with the use of Web3 applications, and the structure of smart contracts."
Gleiss Lutz,VIRTUAL REALITY – THE LEGAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE METAVERSE,"Corporate/M&A: Given the significant role that DAOs play in the metaverse and in Web3, there are a number of legal challenges associated with their establishment and management.

For example, these decentralised organisations need governance structures and token-based incentive systems.

Investing in metaverse and Web3 companies – usually via cryptocurrencies and tokens – also requires navigating new legal complexities.

Tax: Tax law is a key consideration when trading digital assets, and special attention needs to be paid to the issue of when and on what basis taxes are levied on their sale and lease.

Cryptocurrency taxation and accounting obligations are crucial issues for businesses – especially DAOs.

Data protection/privacy:

The new technical possibilities mean new data protection requirements.

For example, using a VR headset to access the digital environment makes it possible to more accurately collect a wider range of personal data – including facial expressions, gestures, eye movements, and other non-verbal communication.

The question of who the data controller is also arises, particularly when using the metaverse through a DAO.

Competition/antitrust: Even metaverse platforms cannot do without a regulatory framework for market behaviour.

While these platforms have not yet been specifically regulated, the EU Digital Markets Act takes a first step towards regulating platform-like metaverse and Web3 applications.

Antitrust issues such as the exchange of competitively sensitive information and collusion between competitors also pose challenges for companies.

Intellectual property: The countless ways to interact with digital assets mean that copyright, trademark and patent law have an even greater role to play than previously.

The greater freedom that the metaverse affords therefore presents companies with new challenges when it comes to the use of trademarks and cross-border access to copyrighted works.

Criminal law: Prosecuting online criminal offences is already difficult enough – this will present even more challenges in the metaverse given the three-dimensional environment and the use of avatars leading to new twists on traditional crimes that can go beyond the verbal level (for example through comments or tweets).

4. Mechanisms for resolving potential disputes In the event of a dispute, the parties generally have access to the known dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitral tribunals or national courts.

Nevertheless, it is often not easy in practice to determine which tribunal or court has jurisdiction.

Automated forms of dispute resolution are also conceivable, but their outcomes may be difficult to enforce.

5. Conclusion Moving into the metaverse is no longer a thing of the future – and many have already made the leap.

But to minimise compliance and liability risks and avoid uncertainty, you’ll need to consider the legal aspects from the very beginning.

Obtaining external legal advice on how to approach your expansion into the metaverse is therefore crucial.

Gleiss Lutz,IT SECURITY ACT 2.0 – PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SECURITY,"The Second Act to Increase the Security of Information Technology Systems ( Zweite Gesetz zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit informationstechnischer Systeme , “IT Security Act 2.0”) came into force at the end of May 2021 ( BGBl.

I 2021, S. 1122 and Bundesrat document 324/21 ).

The new legislation will make it possible to prohibit the use of certain IT components by operators of critical infrastructures if it is to be assumed that the use of these components is likely to adversely affect Germany’s public order or security.

1.

Background With an ever-increasing rate of digitalisation and the resulting dependency on information technology, the use of IT as part of governments’ foreign and security policies has become a hot topic in recent years.

It is becoming ever more apparent that there is a risk of foreign governments gaining indirect control of particularly important infrastructures such as the financial system, the energy supply network or the telecommunications network.

In light of this, the use of IT components from the manufacturer Huawei and other Chinese companies for the expansion of the 5G network in Germany was the subject of criticism in particular, as the possibility cannot be excluded that these companies might design their components in such a way that the Chinese government and its security agencies could, if need be, control them.

The amendment to the IT Security Act is aimed at countering this risk by increasing the requirements to be met for the use of IT components in areas of critical infrastructure.

The IT Security Act also strengthens the current system of investment protection controls, which aims to prevent dependency on foreign governments resulting from the acquisition of infrastructure.

2. Current legal situation Certain restrictions already applied to operators of critical infrastructures when purchasing IT components even before the amendment came into force.  

Since 23 December 2020, operators of telecommunications networks are obliged to use certified critical components based on the new list of security requirements under section 109 Telecommunications Act ( Telekommunikationsgesetz ).

In addition, operators of public telecommunications networks and providers of publicly available telecommunications services with an increased level of criticality (5G networks) must check that the sources from which they obtain their components – not only manufacturers but also, where applicable, sellers or suppliers – are trustworthy.

Components are considered to be critical if they wholly or partially fulfil critical functions.

A list of critical functions is still being drafted.

According to this, a function is critical in particular if, when technically compromised, it may result in significant data protection violations, systematic analysis of telecommunications or substantial security breaches pursuant to section 109(5) Telecommunications Act (i.e. especially unauthorised access or restrictions in availability).

In relation to certain function categories the draft provides very precise definitions of their criticality. 

Critical components are to be identified and documented by operators within one year of the list being published.

Components used from 31 December 2025 onwards must be certified by a recognised certification body and reviewed by a recognised IT review body.

Should the certification schemes required for this not be available, other suitable and appropriate measures to avert risks must be taken.

Previously used components must be replaced by no later than 31 December 2025 if they are not certified.

However, if two suitable, correspondingly certified products from different manufacturers become available on the market prior to this, it must be documented, with accompanying substantiation and proof, that the continued use is not expected to lead to any risks or relevant security breaches.

Otherwise, the components must be replaced by the alternative models that are available."
Gleiss Lutz,IT SECURITY ACT 2.0 – PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SECURITY,"Otherwise, the components must be replaced by the alternative models that are available.

Operators must ensure that their sources of supply are trustworthy by obtaining a self-declaration from the supplier in question.

This declaration includes obligations relating to information security, cooperation, transparency, and reviewing the security of the product and the production process.

In addition, the operator must be able to check the integrity of the components at any time after having taken delivery of the product concerned.

3. Expansion of critical infrastructures and introduction of the term critical component First of all, the amendment slightly expands the list of critical infrastructures.

In addition to the previous sectors, energy, information technology and telecommunications, transport and traffic, health, water, food, as well as finance and insurance, municipal waste management is now also included.

The exact requirements are further specified in the Critical Infrastructures Ordinance ( KRITIS-Verordnung ).

The term “critical components” has now also been introduced into the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security ( Gesetz über das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik ) (section 2(13)).

Critical components are IT products used in critical infrastructure in respect of which malfunctions can lead to significant impairments of the functionality of the critical infrastructure or to threats to public security.

Furthermore, they must have been designated as critical components on the basis of a law with reference to the new section 2(13) Act on the Federal Office for Information Security or realise a function that has been designated as critical on the basis of a law.

In this regard, the list of security requirements can be used for the area of telecommunications.

The list of critical functions is however currently still in the draft stage (see 2.).

Further provisions on critical components “on the basis of a law” do not exist yet.

Moreover, critical components need not necessarily be identified in all sectors.

4. Introduction of a review procedure In future, any use of critical components by operators of critical infrastructures must be notified to the Federal Ministry of the Interior and such critical components may not be put into use before the expiry of a review period of in principle 2 months, which can be extended to a maximum of 4 months, unless the use of a component of the same type had already been notified in the past and was not prohibited

(section 9b(1) Act on the Federal Office for Information Security).

The notification must be accompanied by a manufacturer’s guarantee in which the manufacturer must provide information on its organisational structure and describe how it has ensured that the component does not have technical features that specifically make it susceptible to misuse for the purpose of sabotage, espionage or terrorism.

The details of the guarantee are yet to be determined by way of general decree by the Federal Ministry of the Interior.

The Federal Ministry of the Interior will take into account in its examination whether the first-time use of the component is likely to affect public order or security, in particular: whether the manufacturer is directly or indirectly controlled by the government of a third country, whether the manufacturer has already participated in activities that had an adverse effect on public security in Germany, an EU Member State or a NATO member, or whether the use conflicts with security policy goals of the Federal Republic of Germany, the EU or NATO.

This review applies in addition to and in principle independently of the certification requirements based on the list of security requirements that came into force on 23 December 2020 (see 2.)."
Gleiss Lutz,IT SECURITY ACT 2.0 – PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SECURITY,"This review applies in addition to and in principle independently of the certification requirements based on the list of security requirements that came into force on 23 December 2020 (see 2.).

5. Possibility of subsequent prohibition The further use of critical components can also be subsequently prohibited if the manufacturer proves to be untrustworthy (section 9b(4) and (5) Act on the Federal Office for Information Security).

The subsequent determination that a manufacturer is untrustworthy can be based in particular on a false guarantee or violations of obligations contained therein, insufficient security checks on the component, non-transparent communication of vulnerabilities or the component’s susceptibility to misuse.

Instead of the prohibition, which may be accompanied by an appropriate transitional period and which may also refer to further critical components of the manufacturer, it is also possible, as a milder means of enforcement, for the Federal Ministry of the Interior to issue subsequent orders with regard to the critical components in question.

Where a manufacturer is deemed to be extremely untrustworthy, the use of all its critical components may be prohibited (section 9b(7)

Act on the Federal Office for Information Security).

6.

Significance for companies The amendment of the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security may have significant consequences not only for foreign manufacturers of IT components, but also for the operators of critical infrastructures as their customers, even leading to a ban on the use of these components.

This affects the entire telecommunications sector.

The newly introduced review procedure, which must now be carried out before each new use of a critical component (see 4 above), must be taken into account in this regard.

Added to this is the possibility that use can be prohibited subsequently (see 5 above).

This far-reaching consequence of the legislative changes gives rise to considerable uncertainty about the use of critical components from foreign, and especially Chinese, manufacturers for a large number of important network expansion projects in Germany.

The fact that the use of components may be prohibited even after they are already being used – theoretically, even if the relevant components themselves do not give rise to any security risks – creates the significant risk that operators may at any time find themselves having to replace components within an extremely tight timeframe.

Should this risk arise, it may result in the disruption of business processes as well as significant costs, including for the procurement of replacement components."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: THE LATEST – ONLY MINOR CHANGES TO INITIAL DRAFT BILL,"On 27 July 2022, the German Federal Cabinet adopted the draft bill for an “Act to Improve the Protection of Whistleblowers and Transpose the Directive on the Protection of Persons who Report Breaches of Union Law” ( Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz or “Draft Whistleblower Act”).

The Draft Whistleblower Act essentially has the same scope and content as the initial draft bill published in April 2022 ( see our newsletter of 13 April 2022 ).

The only change in the Draft Whistleblower Act concerns how anonymous reports are handled.

Although still not mandatory, the Draft Whistleblower Act requires that anonymous reports “should” be processed if there is sufficient capacity to do so.

This directory requirement reflects best practice for how to deal with anonymous tips, and implements our recommendation to lower inhibitions when it comes to reporting violations.

A similar directory requirement will likely allow whistleblowers to file anonymous reports through centralised federal and state reporting channels, which will presumably comply with this requirement.

If internal reporting channels do not allow for anonymous reporting, there is a chance that the authorities will be notified immediately – depriving the company of the opportunity to review the matter internally right away and giving the authorities a head start on the investigation.

Another positive aspect is that the Draft Whistleblower Act continues to provide for the possibility of a uniform group-wide reporting channel , making it easier for companies to implement.

The revised bill merely adds that central reporting channels may not create any additional hurdles for whistleblowers.

The question of whether this group exemption is compatible with the requirements of EU law, which is already being discussed, means we can expect preliminary ruling proceedings before the ECJ in the short term.

There are also practical transposition issues concerning how groups with international operations will reconcile the different national requirements.

The adoption of the revised bill removes the last obstacle to national transposition of the EU Whistleblowing Directive.

The clock is ticking: The deadline for national Member States to transpose the EU Whistleblowing Directive expired on 17 December 2021.

With parliament on summer recess until the end of August, formal adoption is not expected before autumn.

The companies that will be affected by the upcoming changes need to take action now.

They should also review and take into account the obligation to implement a complaint mechanism from 2023 onwards, as stipulated in the German Supply Chain Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ).

Gleiss Lutz,Partial victory at Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court – construction cost contributions levied on the battery storage industry are discriminatory,"In its decision of 20 December 2023 (VI-3 Kart 183/23), Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ruled that electricity grid operators are not permitted to levy a construction cost contribution under the capacity price model for connecting net-bound battery storage systems to the grid.

Although this ruling could significantly reduce the investment costs of project developers and operators of battery storage systems, it has also created legal uncertainty as to whether and how construction cost contributions will be determined in future for battery storage systems.

The complainant had asked the competent grid operator to connect a net-bound battery storage system to the electricity grid.

Such a system stores electricity from the grid and releases it back into the grid when needed.

It does not use the electricity itself.

The operator of the battery storage system initially complained to the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) about the construction cost contribution demanded by the grid operator to connect the system to the grid, but without success (decision of 6 December 2022 – BK6-22-242).

The appeal against the Bundesnetzagentur’s decision has now been partially successful at the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court.

Construction cost subsidies Section 17(1) Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , “EnWG”) forms the basis for construction cost contributions above the low-voltage level and stipulates that systems must be connected to the grid on fair and reasonable terms.

The aim of the construction cost contribution is to prevent grid customers from overestimating their connection needs.

The grid connection should correspond to the connection capacity actually used, in order to avoid unnecessary grid expansion.

Primarily, therefore, the construction cost contribution functions as a means of guidance and control.

Only grid customers on the “exit side”, i.e. consumers, are obliged to pay construction cost contributions, while no subsidy is levied for power generation plants feeding into the grid.

What sets net-bound battery storage systems apart is that they operate on both the “exit” and “entry” sides, as they not only draw electricity from the grid, but also feed it back into the grid when necessary.

The amount of the construction cost contributions is usually calculated according to the capacity price model proposed by the Bundesnetzagentur in a 2009 position paper.

This involves multiplying the capacity supplied by the published capacity price.

In the case of large storage facilities, this calculation method means that the construction cost contribution can account for a considerable part of the investment costs.

Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court’s decision In its decision from December 2023

, Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court found that levying construction cost contributions for net-bound battery storage systems was permissible in principle, but that the special nature of these systems had to be taken into account when calculating the contributions.

It stated that the continued application of the capacity price model as before would be discriminatory and therefore unlawful.

The Court ruled that, contrary to a widely held view in the legal literature, the levying of construction cost contributions was also permissible in principle for net-bound battery storage systems .

Specifically, such contributions did not run counter to section 118(6), sentence 1 EnWG, which exempted storage facilities from paying grid access fees for a specified period.

The Court took the view that the construction cost contribution was not a grid fee within the meaning of this provision.

Furthermore, although it followed from both EU law and section 118(6) EnWG that storage facilities play an important role in connection with renewable energy expansion, this did not generally preclude the levying of contributions."
Gleiss Lutz,Partial victory at Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court – construction cost contributions levied on the battery storage industry are discriminatory,"However, the Court did state that calculating the construction cost contribution without making changes to the capacity price model was discriminatory within the meaning of section 17(1), sentence 1 EnWG and abusive within the meaning of section 31(1) EnWG.

In this case, the discrimination arose from treating substantially different situations equally without objective justification.

The operator of a net-bound battery storage system differed significantly from an end consumer .

Unlike an end consumer, a net-bound storage facility could not continuously draw its connected capacity from the grid.

The Court pointed out that once the storage facility was fully charged, it could not draw any more electricity, but had to first feed it back into the grid.

Finally, the Court also stated that the construction cost contribution did not function as a means of guidance and control in the same way for net-bound storage facilities as it did for normal end consumers.

Instead, its primary effect was to influence site selection, as storage facilities tended to be located in areas where they had to pay the lowest construction cost contribution.

Battery storage systems did not affect the size of the grid in the same way as typical grid customers on the “exit side” as they could also be operated in a manner benefitting the grid.

Outlook

In its judgment, Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court did not specify how the construction cost contribution should be levied for net-bound battery storage systems, but rather entrusted this task to the Bundesnetzagentur.

Furthermore, the judgment is not yet final and binding, as the Bundesnetzagentur has lodged an appeal against the Higher Regional Court’s decision with the Federal Court of Justice.

This means that the battery storage industry’s partial victory at the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court is currently clouded by significant legal uncertainty.

It is unclear whether and, if so, how the construction cost contribution will be calculated in future for net-bound battery storage systems.

Contributions paid before the Federal Court of Justice’s decision might then have to be reversed.

In addition, construction cost contributions should only be paid subject to the proviso that they may need to be reimbursed at a later date."
Gleiss Lutz,PFAS restriction proposal on the EU level,"On 7 February 2023 the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) published a comprehensive dossier concerning a ban on around 10,000 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”).

PFAS are used in many industries and present in many consumer goods.

The restriction proposal aims to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market and use of substances harmful to human health and the environment, and to limit their associated risks.

The ban is to be implemented under Regulation (EU) No 1907/2006 (“REACH”).

An initial open consultation has been completed, and ECHA’s scientific committees are now examining the potential impacts of the restriction proposal.

Background Because of their material properties, PFASPFAS have many different applications, such as in aerospace, for military purposes in the automotive sector, and in the manufacture of semiconductors.

They are also present in everyday products such as mobile telephones, rainwear, cosmetics and cooking utensils.

PFAS are especially important in industries relevant to the energy transition: they are used to manufacture membranes for hydrogen production, for solar panels, in water electrolysis to generate green hydrogen, and in semiconductor manufacturing.

Many of the approx.

10,000 substances subsumed under the term PFAS are harmful to human health and the environment.

People can absorb PFAS primarily through foodstuffs (especially drinking water).

PFAS can be detected in soil, animal feed and consumer goods.

They are suspected of harming the hormone and immune systems and of being carcinogenic.

Their chemical stability has led to them being dubbed “forever chemicals”.

Once released they will remain present in the environment for decades.

“Restriction dossier” on PFAS In view of these issues, experts from public authorities in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have assessed the risks that PFAS pose for humans and the environment.

In their assessment, these authorities concluded that the manufacture, use and placing on the market of PFAS entail significant risks, as does their disposal.

The findings have been set out in a “restriction dossier” and submitted by the authorities to ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency.

ECHA published the restriction dossier on 7 February 2023 with minor changes.

The ban it envisages covers over 10,000 different PFAS.

ECHA itself describes the restriction dossier as the “ broadest restriction proposal under REACH so far ”.

The restriction dossier formed the basis of a public consultation from 22 March 2023 to 25 September 2023.

ECHA’s scientific committees (the Committee for Risk Assessment (“RAC”) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (“SEAC”)) are currently formulating their opinions on the restriction dossier.

RAC had previously checked the restriction dossier for feasibility.

In October 2023, RAC published a statement indicating that parts of the restriction dossier were still too vague, making the restrictions’ application and feasibility problematic in practice.

In addition to the restriction dossier, a related proposal is currently on the table, namely to regulate fire-fighting foams that contain PFAS.

De facto , this would constitute a ban on all PFAS in fire-fighting foams except where their use is essential for society.

RAC and SEAC have already given this proposal a positive assessment, especially as suitable alternatives are available.

It is now up to the European Commission to propose a corresponding regulation and decide on transposition across the EU together with the Member States.

A decision is expected in 2025.

Broad scope of application The PFAS ban is to be implemented under REACH, the EU’s chemicals regulation."
Gleiss Lutz,PFAS restriction proposal on the EU level,"A decision is expected in 2025.

Broad scope of application The PFAS ban is to be implemented under REACH, the EU’s chemicals regulation.

According to the restriction dossier, the best way to limit the risks outlined above is to impose a general ban on manufacturing, placing on the market (including imports) and using PFAS as such or as part of other substances, in mixtures or products (above a specified concentration), doing so within the framework of the REACH Regulation.

Only in this way can the import of products containing PFAS be regulated, the dossier argues.

The aim is to regulate PFAS in their entirety, including precursors, so the restriction will cover all substances that contain at least one fully fluorinated methyl group (-CF3) or methylene group (-CF2-) without any further H, Cl, Br or I atoms.

All PFAS that fall within the scope of application are either non-degradable themselves or decompose into non-degradable PFAS.

This broad definition means that the restriction will include substances that have yet to be developed but contain the same structural elements.

The restriction dossier therefore aims to make future use of alternative substances with similar chemical properties impossible.

Derogations Tightly defined derogations are planned for certain substances, but the restriction does not provide for any general derogation on the grounds of “essential use”.

A few substances that fall within the definition’s scope are more easily degradable and do not fall under REACH’s persistence standards, the dossier states; these are to be exempted from the restrictions proposed.

In certain areas, general derogations will apply to PFAS used as an active substance but not as a co-formulant in plant protection products, biocidal products or in human or veterinary medicinal products.

These PFAS will instead be addressed in their respective special regulations and subject to reporting requirements over a 13.5 year period as regards their placing on the market.

These special regulations will also be directed at the manufacturers and importers of PFAS substances, so as to gather data on PFAS use in these sectors and monitor any changes.

Further derogations are envisaged for the semiconductor industry; these are currently under review.

Timeframe for implementation The restriction dossier basically assumes that alternatives to PFAS either are or will be available in good time.

The dossier sees two different ways a complete ban on all PFAS can be effected.

One option contemplated is a complete ban with an 18-month transition period after the restriction takes effect.

Another option under evaluation is a ban on all PFAS bar some mostly temporary, defined and application-specific derogations for a five- or twelve-year period after the 18-month transition period.

There is also a plan for the legislation to include an unlimited derogation from implementation in certain areas of application (such as HVACR systems in buildings with security relevance).

Will the ban put companies at a competitive disadvantage?

Industry has voiced concerns that European producers may face a competitive disadvantage.

While competitors in non-EU countries will continue to use PFAS and may thus achieve competitive advantages, European producers would have to do without PFAS.

To minimise such competitive disadvantages, the EU intends to ensure that all products brought onto the EU market by third countries comply with the same rules applicable to European producers.

Outlook RAC and SEAC are currently evaluating the restriction dossier (since March 2024).

The evaluation started after reviewing the majority of the numerous comments from the public consultation and is to be carried out on the basis of the sectors of use described in the dossier and new sectors identified during the public consultation."
Gleiss Lutz,PFAS restriction proposal on the EU level,"In parallel, the five national authorities that developed the restriction dossier are updating the dossier based on the information obtained from the consultation.

In the coming months, RAC and SEAC committee meetings will be held on various sectors affected by the restriction dossier: Consumer mixtures, cosmetics, ski wax in March; Metal plating and manufacture of metal products in June and Textiles, upholstery, leather, clothing, carpets food contact materials and packaging petroleum and mining in September.

RAC and SEAC will then each deliver a final opinion on the restriction dossier.

Concluding the process, the European Commission will then decide on ECHA’s restriction dossier.

If the restriction dossier is indeed implemented in a formal act, the restrictions envisaged are likely to apply from 2026 or 2027 at the earliest.

As things stand, this would still affect companies in the following sectors, in particular: textile industry; kitchen utensil manufacturers (products intended for consumer use are to be produced PFAS-free as soon as possible); packaging industry; metalworking industry (especially as regards coatings) and cosmetics industry.

For medical technology and vehicle manufacturers, the restriction dossier recognises that PFAS can only be replaced in the long term.

But this does not rule out the possibility that the restriction dossier will (i) directly prohibit individual applications in these industries or (ii) stipulate that companies in these industries must research alternatives in the years to come and start using them as soon as possible.

So companies should first check what products they use PFAS in.

Depending on their respective industry, they will then need to prepare for the fact that manufacturing such products in the EU or placing them on EU markets will no longer be possible in this form, and that this change will take place in a comparatively short timeframe.

Companies should then check whether they can modify their products such that these no longer rely on PFAS, and whether suitable alternatives are available on the market.

There is likely to be another consultation phase as soon as SEAC has published its report on the restriction dossier’s socio-economic impacts.

This phase would enable companies to refocus attention on possible deficiencies in the restriction dossier.

Companies affected should use this opportunity to ensure that European legislators can take due note of their concerns.

For these reasons, companies that use PFAS in their products or production processes should keep a close eye on developments in connection with the restriction dossier."
Gleiss Lutz,HEALTHCARE IN THE METAVERSE: THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE USE OF MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE MEDICAL EXTENDED REALITY,"The metaverse is where the digital world fuses with the real world – and that is certainly true in the realm of healthcare.

Of course, you can’t cure patients by treating their avatar.

Nevertheless, according the view shared by most industry observers, medical extended reality (MXR) is able to offer fundamentally new ways for doctors to treat their patients using software-assisted medical devices in a virtual setting.

Providing healthcare in the metaverse raises a host of legal questions, especially questions about differentiations that need to be made: What treatments does the metaverse make possible, and how can existing, non-virtual treatments be combined with MXR?

Which law governs cross-border MXR treatments?

What medical interactions between avatars in the metaverse have to be performed by doctors?

When is the software used in the metaverse to treat patients via avatars considered a medical device?

How can MXR applications be integrated into Germany’s statutory health insurance system?

Dr. Enno Burk and Dr. Xiao Chen from our Berlin office, who specialise in advising on the digitalisation of healthcare, offer answers to these questions.

I. Medical extended reality 1.

Inpatient medicine in the metaverse Companies are already opening “health cities” in the metaverse in which doctors and hospitals lease space and set up clinical pathways for virtual patients to get real treatment – where medically necessary – at real-world practices or hospitals.

In August 2022, Essen University Medical Centre presented its Avatar Hospital pilot project, a virtual hospital with personalised avatars, which aims to save patients from travelling to the hospital and waiting a long time to be seen – all for short, hectic appointments.

Instead, patients can interact with doctors through their avatars.

Doctors can use a patient’s digital twin – an exact, three-dimensional model of the patient – not only to practice a surgical procedure before performing it, but also to ascertain what treatment has the greatest chance of success for a given patient.

Surgical teams can run through procedures in advance from different locations using VR headsets.

Patients can also be present to gain better insight into the procedure – allowing them to base their consent to the procedure on broader understanding.

However, the procedures themselves still have to take place in physical hospitals.

2. Outpatient medical treatment in the metaverse The metaverse provides a new platform for outpatient interaction between doctor and patient – for example, in psychotherapy, where virtual reality (VR) technology provides a greater sense of being in the same room, and therefore familiarity, than regular video calls; conversely, the anonymity of VR avatars may also provide a greater sense of security.

MXR also enables simulations that can be used in exposure therapy, for example, where patients face fear-inducing situations through their avatars without actually endangering themselves.

For post-surgical care and physiotherapy, MXR can be used to better monitor recovery without requiring the patient to travel – and with artificial intelligence, using fewer personnel and at lower cost.

The “gamification” of medical treatment achieved with the help of avatars is already being used with success in pain management.

3.

Medical devices in the MXR As a virtual space, the MXR offers ample opportunity to use digital medical devices and medical device software.

Software applications have previously been considered medical devices if they are “intelligent”, i.e. they use the vital data measured to provide therapeutic recommendations on which the user can base medical decisions, and the manufacturer offers them for this intended purpose.

Whether an MXR application qualifies as standalone medical device software likely depends on whether the intended medical purpose is treatment outside the metaverse."
Gleiss Lutz,HEALTHCARE IN THE METAVERSE: THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE USE OF MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE MEDICAL EXTENDED REALITY,"Whether an MXR application qualifies as standalone medical device software likely depends on whether the intended medical purpose is treatment outside the metaverse.

That means that if the device being used in the MXR has therapeutic or diagnostic impact on the patient’s real-world treatment, the metaverse application would be considered a medical device.

In future, hardware components (e.g. networked measuring devices on the human body) will be connected to the components in the metaverse, which may then have to undergo conformity assessment as a single unit.

Given the large number of treatments and associated products that are possible in the metaverse, each MXR application will need to be evaluated separately to establish whether it can be classified as a medical device or as a lifestyle product.

For example, a VR headset that is not advertised using healthcare-related claims – but instead using only references to its VR functions – does not become a medical device simply because doctors and patients can use it to interact for medical purposes.

If medical device software requires a VR headset to access the metaverse, however, the integration of this headset and its suitability must also be considered in the software’s conformity assessment.

Advertising claims about MXR applications addressing the German market must be supported by reliable scientific studies (strict standard for health-related advertising).

Please find the overview in high resolution here .

II.

Which law applies in the MXR?

Even if the setting in which doctor and patient avatars interact is a global one, there are restrictions on the choice of law applicable to medical treatment contracts.

The mandatory provisions of German civil law concerning patient protection also apply to such contracts between patients residing in Germany and doctors based abroad – and cannot be waived.

While foreign law on medical treatment contracts generally applies if doctors based in Germany offer treatment to foreign patients, it does not apply if the level of protection afforded by the foreign law in question (e.g. regarding medical liability) is lower than that under German law.

III.

Are only doctors allowed to provide treatment to avatars?

In Germany, only licensed doctors may practise medicine and treat patients – but what about patients’ avatars?

Outside the metaverse, medical care must be provided by a doctor if it requires a doctor’s/medical expertise and if the treatment – generally and typically – could be harmful to the patient’s health.

This means that not every “treatment” of an avatar is considered medical care that only a doctor can provide.

But making diagnoses or therapy recommendations in the metaverse with the aim of having the avatar’s user actually apply these to treat illnesses in real life does qualify as practising medicine; accordingly, only doctors can do this.

Following the liberalisation of the professional code for doctors, treatment is however allowed in the metaverse if it meets medical standards of care and patients are informed about the specifics of MXR-only medical advice.

IV.

Integrating MXR components into Germany’s statutory health insurance system One way of integrating MXR components into statutory outpatient care is via special healthcare contracts under section 140a Social Security Code, Book V ( Sozialgesetzbuch, Fünftes Buch , “SGB V”).

For this to work, both patients and doctors must have the technical means to interact in the metaverse.

Special healthcare contracts involving digital medical devices can however also be executed without doctors as contracting parties.

An MXR application that enables a patient’s avatar to communicate with an AI doctor in the metaverse – for example to describe their symptoms and receive suggestions for treatment (section 140a (4a) SGB V) – is therefore already conceivable.

Fundamental diagnoses, however, must still be made by real-life doctors."
Gleiss Lutz,HEALTHCARE IN THE METAVERSE: THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE USE OF MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE MEDICAL EXTENDED REALITY,"Fundamental diagnoses, however, must still be made by real-life doctors.

Digital health applications – i.e. digital medical devices approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut für Arzneimitel und Medizinprodukte , “BfArM”) for use in statutory healthcare, normally as smartphone apps – can also be combined with MXR components (see here for the BfArM’s Digital Health Applications Directory).

Under section 68a SGB V statutory health insurance funds can support the development of digital innovations, especially MXR applications, by cooperating with third parties on content and technical aspects and by acquiring shares in innovation investment projects.

The health data exchanged in the metaverse must be protected, however.

The German healthcare system has particularly strict requirements for the protection of social data, for example in telemedicine.

While these requirements cannot be directly applied to MXR components, specific security requirements will be developed as these applications gain importance – as was the case when telemedicine platforms began to be certified for the German healthcare system a few years ago."
Gleiss Lutz,FIELD-TESTING THE NEW EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION,"The new EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) has been in force since last October.

While the verdict on the Commission’s application of the FSR has been mixed, what is certain is that the new rules have increased administrative burden and costs for business.

New instruments for the Commission The FSR plays a prominent role in transactions, and gives the European Commission new, far-reaching powers to address market distortions caused by subsidies from non-EU countries.

It focuses on new notification and standstill obligations for M&A deals that are subsidised by non-EU countries, and although the rules are primarily aimed at non-EU companies, EU companies may also be affected if they receive foreign financial contributions (FFCs).

The FSR is intended to close a “regulatory gap” resulting from the fact that the EU State Aid rules place strict limits on the extent to which Member States can subsidise companies operating in the EU, whereas no comparable control exists for subsidies granted by third countries.

The new rules provide the European Commission with three powerful tools to tackle foreign subsidies: The most important of these is the so-called “M&A tool”, also known as “merger control 2.0”, which requires additional notification of M&A deals to the Commission.

A standstill obligation then applies until clearance of the transaction.

The “procurement tool” requires that bidders for high-volume public contracts notify the Commission of FFCs.

Beyond these notification obligations, the Commission can investigate foreign subsidies ex officio using the third instrument (“ex officio tool”).

Forms, forms, and more forms The FSR Implementing Regulation specifies a series of detailed forms that must be completed when notifying concentrations using the M&A tool and bids in public procurement procedures using the procurement tool.

The notification obligations also apply independently of other regulatory procedures, for example under the EU Merger Regulation or the FDI Screening Regulation.

Companies therefore often have to prepare more than one notification simultaneously and manage multiple regulatory tracks with different deadlines and standstill obligations at the same time.

The time-consuming FSR procedure can lead to delays in a deal’s timeline.

Above all, it includes an informal but de facto mandatory pre-notification procedure, often lasting several weeks.

In addition, even in simple cases, the official part takes a minimum of 25 working days, with no possibility of expediting that timeframe.

Mixed bag of positive and negative Stakeholders have criticised the original draft of the Implementing Regulation, in particular for its unrealistic FFC disclosure requirements.

The Commission took the concerns seriously and at least partially addressed them; now, significantly less information has to be disclosed than originally planned.

However, the legal and factual complexity of the information gathering process has increased.

The numerous references to complex legal concepts and the multi-layered system of exceptions and counter-exceptions for FFCs make it even more challenging for companies to apply the FSR in some respect.

In particular, notifiable FFCs cover a large number of measures that, for example, lack any selective preferential treatment and therefore do not involve any subsidy elements at all.

FFCs include grants, loans, guarantees, capital injections, fiscal incentives, setting off of operating losses, debt write-offs, debt restructuring measures, debt/equity swaps, tax waivers, and even the mere provision or purchase of commodities or services.

With regard to their origin, “state” benefits covered by the FSR include both those from third country authorities and all public and even private entities whose actions can somehow be attributed to the third country, such as transactions by development banks or certain measures by public companies."
Gleiss Lutz,FIELD-TESTING THE NEW EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION,"All financial contributions from third countries that have been granted to a corporate group over the past three years are aggregated, regardless of whether they are directly or indirectly related to the relevant M&A transaction or the public procurement procedure.

Practice so far It remains to be seen how the Commission will manage this tremendous additional workload.

After just a few months, the number of cases has already exceeded the original forecast of 30 per year, although the past few months have not seen a wave of mergers.

So far, the Commission has shown a surprising interest in the ownership and financing structure of companies, for example.

In the case of private equity funds in particular, it wants to know exactly what links there are to third countries.

This can be time-consuming, as the numerous investors often include those with state backing (sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, universities and state-affiliated funds, etc.).

Conversely, suspicions that the Commission has certain countries on its radar – China and Russia, for example – have not yet been confirmed.

By all accounts, these countries are not treated more strictly than others.

Likewise, non-EU countries that are not suspected of particularly lavish subsidy practices are no less closely monitored, either.

Notifying transactions preceded by competitive bidding processes is particularly demanding: In such cases, the Commission wants details about the various bids and bidder universe to be able to find out whether the successful bidder has gained advantage by receiving subsidies.

Inconveniently for EEA members and Switzerland, they all count as third countries and are therefore subject to the FSR control.

This applies even if they have concluded a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU that includes provisions on state aid control – meaning that the countries most closely aligned with the European Union are subject to double subsidy control.

The real test is yet to come: The Commission has yet to initiate an in-depth investigation into a merger or acquisition.

However, it did open its first such investigation under the “procurement tool” on 16 February 2024 against Chinese train manufacturer CRRC, where it is investigating whether subsidies enabled CRRC to submit an unduly advantageous tender.

When there are such proceedings in an M&A case, they will test the resources of both the Commission and the companies involved and reveal just how far into this highly sensitive political arena the Commission intends to venture.

Private-sector response The process of gathering the information required for notification is time-consuming and complex.

Comprehensive data needs to be collected on a global, group-wide basis for the past three years.

As this is not possible in the short term, many larger companies have decided to establish permanent monitoring systems – which need to be updated regularly to ensure that the information they contain is ready at the push of a button should a notifiable transaction arise.

This additional burden for businesses bears little semblance to the “deregulation” often touted."

Gleiss Lutz,M&A DEALS UNDER THE NEW EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGIME – A TASTE OF WHAT TO EXPECT,"The EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR; available here: EUR-Lex - 32022R2560 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu) ) came into force on 12 January 2023, and will apply from 12 July 2023 onwards.

Under the new regime, the EU Commission will be able to scrutinize subsidies granted by third (non-EU) countries to players which are active in the EU.

The FSR is a mix of state aid rules and merger control.

It is supposed to close a “regulatory gap” resulting from the fact that the EU State Aid rules limit the extent to which EU Member States can subsidize “their” companies, whereas no similar limitation and control mechanism exists for subsidies granted by third countries.

Spoiler alert!

This week, the EU Commission invited stakeholders to give feedback on the draft Implementing Regulation which complements the FSR (available here: Distortive foreign subsidies – procedural rules for assessing them (europa.eu) ). 

Interested parties can submit their comments by 6 March 2023.

With the new package, which consists of roughly 60 pages, the EU Commission presented the legal community with a limited preview of what is going to unfold.

The draft provides insight into how the application of the FSR will look like in practice.

The message seems pretty clear: it might not be pleasant – neither for the parties nor for their advisors.

A short recap From 12 October 2023, the new notification obligations for M&A deals is going to apply.

The scope of the new rules is extremely broad.

Parties of a transaction are under an obligation to notify M&A-deals, i.e. acquisitions of joint or sole control and the creation of full-function joint ventures (“concentrations”) where the target/joint venture (or one of its subsidiaries) is established in the EU and generated in the last financial year an aggregate turnover in the EU of at least EUR 500 million; and the undertakings (i.e. corporate groups) involved in the concentration were granted from third countries combined aggregate financial contributions in the three financial years prior to the conclusion of the agreement of more than EUR 50 million.

Notifiable M&A transactions cannot be closed before clearance is granted by the EU Commission (“stand-still obligation”).

A failure to notify or to respect the standstill obligation (“gun jumping”) can be sanctioned with substantial fines.

Despite the instrument’s focus on third countries, both non-EU and EU companies will be caught by the new rules.

Needless to say, the new system comes on top of other regulatory work streams, such as traditional merger control, FDI and export control.

For more details see A new form of merger control – EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation formally adopted | Gleiss Lutz and Entry into force of new EU-Foreign Subsidies Legislation – impact on upcoming M&A Transactions | Gleiss Lutz More red tape: “EU Merger Control II” First, the draft Implementing Regulation contains some procedural details (investigation tools, time limits, procedure for commitments, submissions of observations, access to the file, confidentiality etc.).

As expected, the EU Commission has heavily relied on the EU merger control rules (EUMR), in particular on the Implementing Regulation 802/2004.

The centerpiece of the package is the forms for the notifications with some introductory explanations.

Again, the EU Commission has drawn a lot of inspiration from the (notorious) Form CO which applies in EU merger control.

It seems clear that the new FSR quasi-merger review will place significant burden on the parties in international M&A transactions.

Some highlights: As a principle, companies will have to disclose all “foreign financial contributions” received from non-EU countries over the last three years.

This can become a monumental task, given that the notion of “financial contributions” is extremely broad and includes many types of measures that ultimately may not qualify as “subsidies” at all."
Gleiss Lutz,M&A DEALS UNDER THE NEW EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGIME – A TASTE OF WHAT TO EXPECT,"This can become a monumental task, given that the notion of “financial contributions” is extremely broad and includes many types of measures that ultimately may not qualify as “subsidies” at all.

The form provides a detailed template (table) with information to be filled in about receiving entity, granting authority, type of financial contribution, award procedure, amount, date, conditions, rationale of measures in question, sector concerned, etc.

The new draft form provides for some (limited) exceptions from notification.

Financial contributions below EUR 200,000 do not have to be notified.

The same applies if “the total amount of contributions per third country and per year” remains below EUR 4 million.

This exception is however of limited help.

It only relieves the parties from including such (smaller) amounts in the list, but not from the internal compliance check, i.e. whether the notification thresholds are met.

Given the substantive fines for non-compliance under the FSR for failure to notify or supply of incorrect information, a diligent party would always closely verify all possible state support in order to ensure that the FSR rules are fully respected.

The general spirit of the draft forms is very much in line with the EU Commission’s established model under the EUMR.

Parties will have to provide vast amounts of paper and data, such as transactional documents, legal and economic details of the measures in question, financial data on the recipient, turnover figures in all variations, contact details of other players, “analyses, reports, studies, surveys, presentations and any comparable documents discussing the purpose and economic rationale of the foreign financial contribution”, recent annual accounts or reports, etc.

If these documents are not in an official EU language, they have to be translated.

The EU Commission’s hunger for facts is extensive and occasionally appears somewhat bizarre.

As an example, in case the “concentration occurs in the context of a structured bidding process”, the parties have to provide, inter alia, details on how many other candidates were contacted, which candidates expressed an interest or submitted an offer, the profile of each candidate, which bidders withdrew at what stage of the process, whether an advisor assisted the notifying party, copies of all due diligence reports, the contact details of all other candidates, etc.

This is usually impossible.

A bidder does not have this kind of information because these procedures are, also for reasons of competition law, highly confidential.

Parties may request a waiver, i.e. ask the EU Commission to dispense a requesting notifying party with the obligation to provide certain information when the EU Commission considers that this “is not necessary for the examination of the notification.”

The same applies concerning information that is not “reasonably available” to them.

Although the draft form is based on the EU merger control rules (Form CO), which ensures convergence as far as jurisdictional questions are concerned (notion of concentration, control, ownership, notifying parties, etc.), potential synergies between the two tracks seem to be rather limited.

Both regimes have different objectives and the questions are also quite different in terms of substance.

As under the EUMR, the parties are “encouraged” to have pre-notification discussions on the basis of a draft notification.

It is to be expected that this will become the de facto rule.

Such contacts will always take some extra time – at least a few months – which has to be added to the timeline.

What the package does not tell us In terms of substance, the package gives only little guidance about the future application of the FSR: Since it is a purely procedural document, the draft does not deal with the key concepts of the FSR, such as “subsidy”, “distortion on the internal market” and the application of the “balancing test”."
Gleiss Lutz,M&A DEALS UNDER THE NEW EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGIME – A TASTE OF WHAT TO EXPECT,"Since these notions are very similar to those under Article 107 TFEU, they are likely to be interpreted in line with the case law and the EU Commission’s decision-making practice on EU State Aid law.

Unlike the section on “financial contributions” the section on “possible positive effects” is extremely short.

The draft does not give any concrete example as to which effects could be taken into account.

The EU Commission seems to take the view that this is left to the imagination of the parties and that the burden of proof lies entirely with them.

A missed opportunity: The draft does not deal with the relationship between the FSR and free trade agreements concluded with non-EU countries (FTAs).

Article 44 (9) FSR, however, provides that the FSR tools shall not be applied where this would be contrary to the EU’s obligations under international law.

It would therefore have seemed obvious to set up a “safe harbor list” excluding the FSR application vis-à-vis those third countries which have entered into a comprehensive FTA with some substantive provisions on state aid.

The EU Commission however did not provide such a “white list”.

Next steps: How to prepare yourself The new draft regulation confirms what many observers had already expected: The new system will have a major impact on M&A transactions and will significantly increase the costs and the administrative burden for many EU and non-EU companies.

There are several steps that potential dealmakers can take now to prepare themselves for the new regime: Take part in the consultation process : Stakeholders can submit comments on the draft until 6 March 2023.

All interested parties should, possibly via trade associations, take advantage of this opportunity.

Without any meaningful feedback, the EU Commission is likely to adopt the draft in its current form.

Monitoring and compliance: Establish an internal monitoring process to systematically collect and review information regarding financial contributions (who, what, when, who from, amount, conditions, type?) on a group-wide basis for the last three years.

Preparation of transactional documents: In addition to the usual closing conditions, the SPA/APA should include an FSR clause which could be modelled on the customary language used for merger control (condition precedent, obligation for purchaser to prepare and file notification in consultation with the seller, offer commitments, hell-and-high-water clause, etc.).

Work out the timeline: FSR procedures take time, e.g. preliminary investigation of 25 working days, potentially followed by an in-depth probe of additional 90 working days, with possible extensions.

In addition, the parties have to factor in the need for pre-notification contacts, which can take a few months.

Prepare your case : Finally, parties should prepare their substantive arguments.

This should be done on three levels:

First, the parties can argue that the financial contributions in question do not amount to a “subsidy”.

In many cases they will be able to show that the measures in question do not entail any economic benefit.

Such a line of argumentation should be based on the case law of the EU Courts in the field of EU State aid and the EU Commission’s own decision-making practice.

In addition, it could be corroborated with economic expertise (consultants, etc.).

Second, even if the measures qualify as “subsidies”, the parties can prepare potential arguments as to why they are not distortive.

Again, such a reasoning could be supported by the existing rich body of EU State aid law, in particular the EU Court’s case law, the EU Commission’s own decision-making practice and economic arguments.

Third, one could argue that the potential benefits of the subsidies outweigh any distortions."
Gleiss Lutz,M&A DEALS UNDER THE NEW EU FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGIME – A TASTE OF WHAT TO EXPECT,"Third, one could argue that the potential benefits of the subsidies outweigh any distortions.

In this regard, the EU Commission’s own “soft law” (guidelines, frameworks, communications, block exemption regulations, etc.) which exists for multiple types of State aid (energy, environment, R&D&I, risk finance, guarantees, semiconductors, airports, transport, broadband, etc.) can play a key role.

Gleiss Lutz,NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DIGITAL SERVICES LAW: THE DRAFT DIGITAL SERVICES ACT,"As of February 17, 2024, Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, better known as the Digital Services Act (""DSA"") will be fully applicable in all EU member states (for particularly large providers of intermediary services such as Facebook and TikTok, many obligations already apply since August 2023).

Although the DSA itself already comprehensively regulates the provision of so-called intermediary services ( see article of 27 October 2022 ), there is still room for maneuver as well as a need for implementation regulations at the member state level.

To that end, the German government has recently presented a draft bill on implementation of the Digital Services Act (Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz, ""DDG-E"").

The draft contains some noteworthy points: Federal Network Agency as essential competent authority Pursuant to Section 12(1) DDG-E, the Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway is to be designated the essential competent authority for the enforcement of the DSA within the meaning of Art. 49(1) DSA.

On the one hand, this highlights the importance of a safe online environment, which thus assumes a similar significance to traditional utilities.

Compared to the federally fragmented supervision in the area of data protection, this centralization of enforcement powers at the federal level is likely to ensure a relatively forceful supervision and hopefully a higher degree of legal certainty.

With regard to certain regulations,  12(2), (3) DDG-E also assigns responsibilities to the Federal Agency for the Protection of Children and Young People in the Media and the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information .

Differentiated fines and amounts of fines Within the framework of the maximum amounts stipulated by the DSA, Section 25 DDG-E provides for a differentiated concept: A fine of up to EUR 50,000 may be imposed in the event of unlawful concealment of the commercial nature of a message and the violation of certain information and disclosure obligations, such as the obligation to provide an imprint (in future Section 5 DDG) and the obligation to provide information to the authorities (Section 25(1), (2), (5) No. 3 DDG-E).

Up to EUR 100,000 may be due for certain violations of Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 on the promotion of fairness and transparency for commercial users of intermediary services as well as for violations of certain transparency and information obligations of the DSA (e.g. to designate a contact point).

If the annual turnover of the company that has violated these obligations is more than EUR 10 million, the fine can also be up to 1% of the worldwide turnover in the year prior to the authority's fining decision.

A fine of up to EUR 300,000 may be imposed for other violations of the above-mentioned Regulation (EU) 2019/1150, as well as for other breaches of the DSA.

With regard to the DSA, this may in particular be breaches of obligations in connection with the notice and action mechanism and complaint handling system to be established under the DSA and violations of the prohibition of personalized advertising based on sensitive personal data.

For companies with an annual turnover of more than EUR 5 million, the maximum limit is instead 6% of the previous year's global turnover.

The explicit provision that the period prior to the authority's decision is decisive for the calculation of the fine (not the period prior to the infringement) may become relevant in particular in the case of investments in start-ups , which may commit infringements in their ""wild"" founding phase.

Even if these are remediated during the growth phase (e.g., under pressure from the investor), the authority could impose fines after the fact, which are then calculated on the basis of the turnover that the ""mature"" start-up achieves after it has been ""kick-started"" by the investment."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DIGITAL SERVICES LAW: THE DRAFT DIGITAL SERVICES ACT,"Repeal of the NetzDG as well as the TMG/Imprint As of February 17, 2024, the Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz, TMG) as well as the Network Enforcement Act ( Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG) are to be repealed (cf.

Article 37 DDG-E).

Section 5 DDG-E continues the general information obligations (so-called "" imprint obligation "") previously contained in Section 5 TMG.

Even if the content of the provisions does not differ from each other, many websites citing the provision will have to be adapted in this respect.

Accord (Einvernehmen) with data protection supervisory authorities Section 20 DDG-E stipulates that the authority responsible for implementing the DSA must make decisions in accord (Einvernehmen) with the competent data protection supervisory authority , insofar as its performance of duties affects the review of compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection regulations.

This is intended to ensure that the data protection supervisory authorities continue to play the primary role in monitoring of compliance with data protection regulations.

The Court of Justice of the European Union recently imposed a similarly vague duty of cooperation on the Federal Cartel Office’s review of activities relevant under data protection law (judgment of 4 July 2023 - C-252/21).

Next steps The draft must now go through the legislative process.

Entry into force by 17 February 2024 is ambitious, but not impossible.

In parallel to the efforts of the legislator, companies offering intermediary services in the EU should start preparing for the new regulations of the DSA and the DDG now at the latest in order to avoid fines and claims for damages."
Gleiss Lutz,PAYMENT IN LIEU OF VACATION AND CONTRACTUAL CUT-OFF PERIODS,"The Federal Labour Court has ruled that the entitlement to payment in lieu of vacation, as a purely monetary claim under section 7(4) Federal Vacation Act ( Bundesurlaubsgesetz , “BUrlG”), is subject to a cut-off period and may therefore expire.

This decision also follows the Federal Labour Court’s case law where, under the law governing general terms and conditions, the requirements for transparency and exclusion clauses must meet the test of reasonableness and fairness.

Federal Labour Court, judgment of 24 May 2022 – 9 AZR 461/21 Background

The plaintiff worked as a paralegal for the defendant lawyer.

Under the employment contract, a two-stage exclusion clause was agreed according to which all claims arising from the employment relationship would be forfeited if they were not asserted within a cut-off period of three months.

This did not include claims for intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty or claims under the Minimum Wage Act ( Mindestlohngesetz , “MiLoG”).

The defendant terminated the employment relationship with effect as of 19 July 2019.

Five months later the plaintiff then filed an action, served on 23 January 2020, demanding payment for 24 days of vacation in lieu of her annual vacation, arguing that her entitlement to such payment had not expired.

According to the plaintiff, this did not conflict with the cut-off period stipulated in her employment contract since the relevant clause lacked transparency and was invalid.

In particular, she said, claims arising from negligent injury to life, limb or health as well as claims expressly recognised or undisputed had not been explicitly excluded.

In contrast, the defendant based its statement of defence on the argument that the provision on the cut-off period did stand up to legal scrutiny.

Both the labour court and the higher labour court dismissed the action.

Decision The Federal Labour Court agreed with the decisions handed down in the previous instances and dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal.

It rejected any entitlement to payment in lieu of vacation on the grounds that such entitlement had already expired at the time the action was filed.

Given that it was a purely monetary claim, an employee’s entitlement to payment in lieu of vacation could – so the Court – generally be subject to cut-off periods.

This conflicted neither with the indispensable protection of statutory minimum vacation nor with Article 7 of Directive 2003/88/EC, as interpreted and laid down by the European Court of Justice.

The provision on the cut-off period stipulated in the employment contract was not invalid for the mere reason that it did not clearly exclude the claims referred to in section 309, no. 7, letter (a) Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , “BGB”).

Given the special provisions of section 104 et seq.

Social Security Code, Book VII ( Sozialgesetzbuch , “SGB”), covering the typical liability scenarios encountered under labour law, the scope of application and hence the practical relevance of section 309, no. 7, letter (a) BGB in the employment relationship was clearly limited.

In addition, no lack of transparency and therefore invalidity could be derived from the fact that recognised or undisputed claims were not explicitly excluded from the cut-off period.

In order to comply with the requirement of transparency, possible waivers did not need a provision clarifying that an employee was not required to assert his or her claims within the cut-off period if the employer had waived them.

Nor did the provision on the cut-off period ultimately lack transparency, the Court said, because it did not explicitly exclude vacation entitlements in the existing employment relationship.

A careful and attentive employee would realise that it was not necessary to claim annual vacation in the first three months of the vacation year in order to prevent it from expiring."
Gleiss Lutz,PAYMENT IN LIEU OF VACATION AND CONTRACTUAL CUT-OFF PERIODS,"A careful and attentive employee would realise that it was not necessary to claim annual vacation in the first three months of the vacation year in order to prevent it from expiring.

Our assessment We welcome the fact that the Federal Labour Court is staying its course regarding the requirements placed on exclusion clauses.

It rightly emphasised the fact that employees may not always be spared thinking for themselves but that their exercise of care is the criterion by which the transparency of a regulation is assessed.

It is precisely where exceptions to the forfeiture of claims are set out in excessive detail that such clauses risk becoming confusing and intransparent.

Nevertheless, particular care must be taken when drafting and selecting exclusion clauses, as employers may face substantial payments to employees if these clauses turn out to be invalid.

The Federal Labour Court has set out specific requirements for the validity of exclusion clauses in its established case law, which is further supported by this decision."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: ELEVENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"To address shortcomings in enforcing sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine, the European Union adopted an eleventh package of sanctions on 23 June 2023.

The eleventh sanctions package tightens and clarifies the existing sanctions from the previous ten packages, most recently from 25 February 2023 ( article of 1 March 2023 ).

The EU believes that while the sanctions are having an impact, their effectiveness is being undermined by various means of circumvention.

Countering that circumvention – whether identified or suspected – is therefore one of the main objectives of its latest set of sanctions.

In particular, the eleventh set of sanctions foresees a new schedule of measures of varying severity that will allow the EU to ban the export of certain goods to third countries as a last resort.

Trade-related sanctions have also been expanded, including sanctions on the sale, license or transfer of intellectual property and the trade and transport of oil.

Other existing sanctions have also been clarified.

EU sanctions The EU’s eleventh package of measures (Regulations (EU) 2023/1214 and 2022/1273 and Implementing Regulations (EU) 2023/1215 and 2023/1216) further tightens and adapts the existing sanctions against Russia.

The measures affect in particular the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and the trade sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 .

I. Personal sanctions The EU has added 71 individuals and 33 entities to the list of personal sanctions since its last package, and the list now has more than 1,800 entries.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons and entities listed in Annex I to the Regulation.

No funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of these persons and entities.

The natural persons listed are also banned from entering or transiting through EU territory (see our articles of 7 March 2022 , 12 April 2022 and 9 June 2022 ).

The eleventh sanctions package expands the sanctions list in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 269/2014 to include those persons and entities linked to the information warfare conducted by Russia as part of its attack on Ukraine.

It also targets individuals and organisations that circumvent or undermine restrictions.

To this end, the criteria for including persons and entities to the sanctions list in Article 3h of Regulation 269/2014 have been adapted and expanded to allow listing of (non-Russian) legal persons, entities or bodies “otherwise significantly frustrating” the EU’s sanctions against Russia.

An example of such frustration can be an economic operator from a third country whose main activity is purchasing goods listed in the EU, which subsequently enter Russia.

Recently established businesses that purchase listed goods in the EU which subsequently enter Russia, as well as the dramatic increase in sales of a third-country economic operator involved in such activities, can also be indications of sanctions circumvention.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 has been supplemented to include further exemptions to the asset freeze and to providing listed persons with funds or economic resources.

This is aimed at allowing EU companies to withdraw investments from Russian companies and to divest certain types of securities.

II.

Trade sanctions

The EU’s eleventh sanctions package also includes new trade sanctions measures: A further 87 entities have been included in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

The persons, entities and bodies listed (now 593 in total) are, in the legislator’s assessment, military end-users, supporters of Russia’s military and industrial complex or, in any event, commercially or otherwise associated with the Russian security and defence sector ."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: ELEVENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"In addition to the Russian and Iranian companies already listed, the EU has now also included companies from China, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Armenia.

The inclusion of a person, entity or body in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has direct consequences under this Regulation (no possibility of obtaining authorisation to bypass certain trade restrictions).

In addition, when supplying unlisted dual-use goods to persons, entities or bodies included in Annex IV, European companies should check with particular care whether they are subject to any authorisation requirements under Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2021/821.

The import restrictions on iron and steel products processed in a third country using iron and steel products originating in Russia listed in Annex XVII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014, which were already introduced with the tenth package of sanctions but will not take effect until 30 September 2023, have been supplemented by an obligation to provide proof : as of 30 September 2023, when importing iron and steel products listed in Annex XVII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 from a third country, an importer must provide proof of the country of origin of the iron and steel inputs used for the processing of the product in a third country.

New or expanded transit bans now also apply to the goods listed in Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (Article 2a(1a) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014), to the firearms and other weapons listed in the new Annex XXXV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (Article 2aa(1a) in conjunction with paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) 833/2014) and to the goods and fuels for the aerospace industry listed in Annexes XI and XX to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (Article 3c(1a) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

Companies that trade in the goods listed there should check their supply routes.

The eleventh package once again expands or reorganises the various lists of sanctioned goods in the relevant annexes.

These include Annex VII (Goods and technology which contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement), Annex XVII (Iron and steel products), Annex XVIII (Luxury goods), Annex XXI (Goods which generate significant revenues for Russia) and Annex XXIII (Goods which could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities).

Companies should carefully review the new versions to check which goods have been affected.

III.

Expansion of goods-related sanctions to include intellectual property rights The eleventh package introduces entirely new measures restricting intellectual property rights as part of the goods-related sanctions under Articles 2, 2a, 3, 3b, 3c, 3f, 3h and 3k of Regulation (EU) 833/2014:

Up to now, the sale, supply, transfer and export bans laid down in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 have generally been accompanied by prohibitions on the provision of technical assistance, brokering and other services as well as financing and financial assistance.

The EU has now added an explicit ban on the sale, license or transfer in any other way of intellectual property rights or trade secrets, as well as the granting of rights to access or re-use any material or information protected by means of intellectual property rights or constituting trade secrets, related to the listed goods and technology, to a person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia.

It is not entirely clear whether this entails an expansion of the sanctions framework or merely clarifies the legal position that already applies.

In the FAQs published on Regulation (EU) 833/2014, the European Commission had previously taken the view that the licensing of intellectual property rights in connection with listed goods and technology was already covered by the respective prohibition as the provision of “other services” .

The new measure will eliminate any legal uncertainty.

IV.

New rules to combat sanction circumvention"
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: ELEVENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"The new measure will eliminate any legal uncertainty.

IV.

New rules to combat sanction circumvention

The regulations of the eleventh sanctions package aim primarily to improve the overall effectiveness of the sanctions against Russia by refining the existing sanctions and, in particular, combating circumvention.

The EU strongly suspects that certain third countries (including Armenia, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates) are hubs for transactions geared towards circumventing, for example, export bans by supplying or transiting goods via third countries.

In addition to tightening individual provisions, the package also introduces a new instrument to combat sanction circumvention.

This involves a graduated approach: First, third countries that are strongly suspected of being linked to circumvention are to be supported within the framework of multilateral and bilateral cooperation through diplomatic engagement and the provision of increased technical assistance in order to minimise the incentives for such circumvention transactions.

In cases where this is not effective, appropriate individual measures may be taken against the third-country companies involved in circumvention (e.g. inclusion in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014 or Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

It is only if these measures are not sufficient – given the systemic nature of the ongoing circumvention via the third country concerned – that the sale, supply, transfer or export of certain goods to third countries may be restricted as a “last resort” by including both the goods and third countries in the new Annex XXXIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

There are no such goods or third countries listed in Annex XXXIII as yet, which means that the prohibition specified in Article 12f of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 does not actually apply to anything at present.

It is difficult to say whether this will change in the coming months, given the various steps that must be taken before entries can be added to the list.

V. Sanctions in the energy and transport sector The strategy to prevent circumventions also foresees the tightening of various sanctions in the (energy) transport sector:

Access to ports and locks within the territory of the EU will be further restricted.

The modified and extended access ban under Article 3eb of Regulation 833/2014 now also applies to ship-to-ship transfers if the competent authorities have reasonable cause to suspect that a vessel is in breach of the prohibitions on the import of seaborne Russian crude oil and petroleum products into the EU imposed by the tenth sanctions package (see our article of 1 March 2023 ) or is transporting Russian crude oil or petroleum products that were purchased at a price above the price cap.

This access ban is accompanied by various measures supporting enforcement including, in particular, notification obligations for planned ship-to-ship transfers.

There are exemptions which authorise access for reasons of maritime safety, including environmental concerns, for saving life at sea and for humanitarian purposes.

VI. 

Other additions and changes Five additional media organisations have been included in Annex XV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and are thus targeted by the broadcasting restrictions of Article 2f of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

The prohibition to transport goods under Article 3l of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, which previously only applied to road transport undertakings established in Russia, has been extended to carriage by road transport undertakings with trailers or semi-trailers registered in Russia .

It has thus been made explicitly clear that this also applies if such trailers are hauled by trucks registered in other countries."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: ELEVENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"It has thus been made explicitly clear that this also applies if such trailers are hauled by trucks registered in other countries.

The prohibition under Article 5f of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 on selling transferable securities to Russian nationals or persons, entities or bodies resident or established in Russia will in future no longer apply solely to securities denominated in an official currency of an EU Member State.

Irrespective of the currency in which they are denominated, securities issued after 6 August 2023 may no longer be sold to the recipients referred to in Article 5f.

Article 6b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 introduced a new obligation to supply any information to the competent authorities which would “facilitate” the implementation of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 .

A similar provision can already be found in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 269/2014.

While the tenth sanctions package provided a catalogue of examples of which types of information qualify under Article 8 ( article of 1 March 2023 ), such guidance is lacking in Article 6b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

In the absence of such clarification, it seems questionable whether the obligation to provide information under Article 6b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 is sufficiently precise for violations thereof to be punished as an administrative offence pursuant to section 19(5), no. 

1 Foreign Trade and Payments Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz).

Moreover, it is unclear whether “information that would facilitate the implementation” of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 also includes information about violations of this Regulation, i.e. whether Article 6b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 is intended to introduce a kind of whistleblowing obligation.

VII.

Authorisations The deadline for the authorisations provided for in Article 12b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 for otherwise prohibited transactions that are strictly necessary for the divestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia has been extended.

Authorisations under Article 12b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 can now be granted until 31 December 2023 (and in some cases until 31 March 2024).

An authorisation possibility has been added for the provision of legal advisory services otherwise prohibited under Article 5n(2) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, provided that such services are legally required for the completion of a sale and/or transfer of shares in an EU company.

This is likely to include, in particular, issues of notarial involvement in the sale of companies in which undertakings established in Russia are involved as parties.

Switzerland has been added to the list of partner countries (Annex VIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014); Swiss companies and Swiss diplomatic missions therefore now also benefit from the possible authorisations in Article 2(4), Article 2a(4), Article 2d(4), Article 3h(3) and Article 3k(4) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

US and UK sanctions The United States and the United Kingdom last imposed new sanctions against Russia in May 2023, just before the G7 summit.

Among other things, these sanctions expanded the goods-related export restrictions and “blacklisted” additional entities and individuals from Russia and third countries.

The UK sanctions included in particular a ban on Russian diamonds and the import of metals such as copper, aluminium and nickel from Russia.

Outlook

The eleventh sanctions package marks the first time that the EU has decided to effectively extend its sanctions to non-EU companies in order to prevent circumvention by third countries.

As a result, the EU sanctions are more in line with the extraterritorial approach of US secondary sanctions, which have been the subject of much criticism from Europe.

Whether this new approach is practicable has yet to be proven.

There is still no end in sight to the sanctions.

Rather, the EU and its Western partners are determined to maintain and even further intensify the “collective pressure” on Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: ELEVENTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"There is still no end in sight to the sanctions.

Rather, the EU and its Western partners are determined to maintain and even further intensify the “collective pressure” on Russia.

Yet Russia, for its part, has also responded with more and more entry bans for not just Europeans, but also Australians.

Where transactions or other business ventures involving foreign countries are concerned, it remains important to stay abreast of the latest developments in the complex and constantly changing web of sanctions and to react quickly to changes in the law."
Gleiss Lutz,WHITE PAPER ON THE PLANNED MODERNISATION OF GERMAN ARBITRATION LAW - AN OVERVIEW,"On 18 April 2023, the Federal Ministry of Justice (Bundesministerium der Justiz, “BMJ”) published a white paper on the modernisation of German arbitration law ( BMJ | Pressemitteilungen | Modernisierung des deutschen Schiedsverfahrensrechts: Bundesjustizminister legt Vorschläge vor ).

The paper identifies issues that are to be brought in line with international developments in arbitration law.

The BMJ would also like to take an open-ended look at four additional issues.

The white paper contains starting points, in particular, for making arbitration law more competitive internationally by simplifying formal requirements in commercial transactions and modernising procedural regulations; strengthening specialisation, reliability and transparency in arbitration law by making adjustments to the competence of higher regional courts and introducing a new legal remedy, as well as urging arbitral tribunals and parties to publish arbitral awards; increasing legal certainty in arbitration law by adjusting and fleshing out legal remedies before state courts and laying down provisions on the appointment of arbitrators; and making interim relief more effective in the context of arbitration law.

Informal, English and digital The aim is for Germany to become more competitive internationally as an arbitration location.

To this end, the white paper calls for, among other things, a simplification of formal requirements and modernisation of procedural regulations: It should be possible to conclude arbitration agreements informally in commercial transactions.

In particular, this is intended to dispel doubts regarding electronically agreed arbitration agreements, which may become relevant in connection with “smart contracts”, for example.

This would also make it possible to conclude oral arbitration agreements under German law.

In the case of consumer arbitration agreements, the current strict requirements in section 1031(5) Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung , “ZPO”) are to remain in place.

In future, it should be possible to submit the arbitral award as well as documents from the arbitral proceedings in enforcement or annulment proceedings in English .

The same would apply in the context of court assistance in taking evidence (section 1050 ZPO).

This would not only save time, but also translation costs.

In addition, the paper aims to make clear that hearings in arbitral proceedings may be conducted by way of a video conference unless the parties have agreed otherwise.

Until now the question of whether the arbitral tribunal has discretion to order that a hearing be conducted by way of a video conference, even if one party opposes this, has been subject to debate.

Specialisation, reliability and transparency The white paper also aims to promote specialisation, reliability and transparency of state courts in the context of arbitration.

The BMJ would like to enable Federal States which have commercial courts to declare such courts competent, at least for requests for a declaration of enforceability or for the setting aside of arbitral awards, even if the parties have not explicitly agreed on this.

It would be possible to conduct the entire proceedings before the commercial courts in English.

If necessary, it would also be possible for Federal States to establish inter-state joint divisions of higher regional courts in arbitration matters.

Combining expertise in this way would likely have a positive effect on the quality and predictability of decisions as well as on the speed of proceedings.

In addition, the paper proposes examining whether court assistance in taking of evidence or the performance of other judicial acts pursuant to section 1050 ZPO, for which the local courts have so far been competent, should also be transferred to the higher regional courts which are otherwise competent for arbitration matters."
Gleiss Lutz,WHITE PAPER ON THE PLANNED MODERNISATION OF GERMAN ARBITRATION LAW - AN OVERVIEW,"Given that the higher regional courts have jurisdiction in various other arbitration matters, this would seem to be a logical approach.

Another proposal in the white paper is the introduction of a legal remedy for setting aside arbitral awards that would be based on actions for a retrial pursuant to section 580 ZPO.

For example, it should be possible for final domestic arbitral awards to be set aside if they have been obtained through bribery or perversion of justice.

This would improve the reliability of Germany as an arbitration location.

Provided that the parties agree, arbitral tribunals should in future be enabled by law to publish arbitral awards .

This would increase transparency in arbitral proceedings and promote the further development of the law.

It remains to be seen whether this regulation will be accepted in practice.

Legal certainty Another aim of the white paper is to increase legal certainty by adjusting and clarifying existing legal remedies and provisions in the ZPO as well as by introducing rules on the appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitral proceedings: A request for a declaration of the (in)admissibility of arbitral proceedings (section 1032(2) ZPO) should be amended in such a way that the court seized of the matter can, at the same time, decide on the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement.

Procedural economy would be improved in that the decision on the existence of the arbitration agreement would become res judicata .

In addition, there are plans to enable state courts to set aside negative decisions on jurisdiction by arbitral tribunals .

Whereas a positive decision on jurisdiction can be challenged before the state courts either under section 1040(3), sentence 2 or section 1059 ZPO, courts can only set aside negative decisions on jurisdiction pursuant to section 1059 ZPO on the basis of the reasons stated therein; however, these do not include the grounds that the arbitral tribunal, contrary to its own view, does in fact have jurisdiction.

This will promote party autonomy.

Moreover, it should be clarified that where a request for a declaration of enforceability is rejected and, at the same time, the arbitral award is set aside pursuant to section 1060(2), sentence 1 ZPO, the state court may, upon request of one of the parties, refer the matter back to the arbitral tribunal Otherwise, the decision setting aside the award would cause the arbitration agreement to be revived with respect to the subject matter of the dispute.

So far this has only been regulated for annulment proceedings (section 1059(4) and (5) ZPO), whereby, under the existing legal situation, section 1059(4)

ZPO already applies to section 1060 ZPO by analogy according to the prevailing opinion.

Finally, the white paper addresses dissenting opinions by an arbitrator.

The BMJ is examining whether a legal clarification is required in this regard.

The creation of rules for the appointment of arbitrators in complex multi-party arbitral proceedings is intended to create more legal certainty.

Only in urgent cases should the presiding arbitrator be able to issue orders pursuant to section 1063(3), sentence 1 ZPO in the context of compulsory enforcement or the execution of provisional/protective measures of the arbitral tribunal, without having previously heard the opposing party.

Interim relief Finally, interim relief under arbitration law should be enhanced as part of the modernisation of arbitration law.

It has thus far been the case that interim relief measures by arbitral tribunals can at any rate be declared enforceable in Germany if that is the place of arbitration (cf. sections 1041(2), 1025(1) ZPO).

Reformed arbitration law should in future also explicitly allow for decisions of arbitral tribunals seated abroad to be declared enforceable.

At the same time, German courts should be authorised to make a corresponding admission of enforcement contingent on the provision of security."
Gleiss Lutz,WHITE PAPER ON THE PLANNED MODERNISATION OF GERMAN ARBITRATION LAW - AN OVERVIEW,"At the same time, German courts should be authorised to make a corresponding admission of enforcement contingent on the provision of security.

In addition, in the further course of the legislative process it should be examined whether it would make sense for an emergency arbitrator to also be introduced into the 10th Book of the ZPO.

This is already provided for in the arbitration rules of several institutions.

According to Article 29 of the Rules of Arbitration of the Arbitral Institution of the International Chamber of Commerce, the emergency arbitrator may be called upon, for example, even before the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, to order such interim measures whose issuance cannot wait until the arbitral tribunal is constituted.

Conclusion The white paper is a welcome step towards modernising German arbitration law and strengthening Germany’s position as a judicial centre in international competition.

We eagerly await the BMJ’s draft bill, which will set out the reform efforts in more detail."

Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: 13TH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING 12TH PACKAGE,"Two years into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU has adopted further economic sanctions against Russia that took effect on 24 February 2024.

The 13th sanctions package tightens the existing sanctions from the previous packages, most recently from 18 December 2023 ( article of 21 December 2023 ).

The main aim of the new measures is to make it even harder for Russia to procure the unmanned aircraft and drones crucial to its war effort.

Alongside expanding some of the trade-related restrictions, the new package adds considerably to the list of persons and entities sanctioned.

Compared with the last set of sanctions, this package is relatively small in scope and has more of a symbolic significance given that it was adopted on the second anniversary of the invasion.

There have also been developments regarding two much-discussed changes introduced by the 12th sanctions package.

Firstly, the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA) has issued its General Export Authorisation No. 42, which allows services and business software to be provided to EU subsidiaries based in Russia.

Secondly, the European Commission has published its long-awaited interpretation of Article 12g Regulation (EU) 833/2014 – including proposed wording for the “No Russia clause”, whose practical implementation has been controversially discussed following its introduction by the 12th sanctions package.

I. New EU sanctions The EU’s 13th sanctions package (Regulation (EU) 2024/745 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/753) further tightens and adapts the existing sanctions against Russia.

The measures affect in particular the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and the trade-related sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 .

New rules on handling income from frozen Russian funds already came into force in the shape of Regulation (EU) 2024/576 of 12 February 2024.

1.

Personal sanctions

The sanctions list of 18 December 2023 has been extended to include a further 106 individuals and 88 entities, making this the EU’s most extensive package of personal sanctions against Russia yet.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons and entities listed in Annex I to the Regulation.

The Regulation remains unaltered in substance: It continues to prohibit the provision (including indirect provision) of funds or economic resources to sanctioned individuals or entities (see our articles of 7 March 2022 , 12 April 2022 and 9 June 2022 ).

The individuals and entities added to the sanctions list , which now has over 2,000 entries, include the following: 140 companies and individuals from within Russia’s military-industrial complex account for the largest share of additions.

The focus here is on companies that trade various key components for drones .

Companies and individuals that help circumvent sanctions or otherwise support the Russian war effort have also been included.

Judges and public officials in the occupied Ukrainian territories are also among the persons added to the list.

2. Making it harder for certain companies to procure drones As part of the trade-related restrictions , Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has been extended to include 27 more Russian and third-country companies.

This Annex lists persons, entities and bodies within Russia’s military-industrial complex or which otherwise support the Russian defence and security sector, making them “military end-users”.

The added companies supply the Russian arms industry with important components for drones or have been linked to drone procurement.

Until now, Annex IV listed mostly Russian persons and entities and only a few individuals or companies from Iran, Uzbekistan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, China (Hong Kong) and Singapore.

Ten further companies have now been added, from China, Kazakhstan, India, Serbia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Turkey."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: 13TH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING 12TH PACKAGE,"Ten further companies have now been added, from China, Kazakhstan, India, Serbia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Turkey.

In some cases, dual-use goods and goods and technologies listed in Annex VII which could contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector can be granted exemptions for export to non-military end-users in Russia for non-military purposes, or for use there.

If the end-user is listed in Annex IV, however, such an authorisation generally does not apply.

3. UK as new partner for importation of iron and steel The UK has been added to the list of partner countries for importation of iron and steel, as were Switzerland and Norway under the 12th sanctions package.

These partner countries have implemented import restrictions on iron and steel similar to those in the EU.

For listed iron and steel products, therefore, no proof of the country of origin is required when they are imported from the UK ( article of 21 December 2023 ).

4. Income from interest on frozen Russian funds Between its 12th and 13th sanctions packages, the EU also introduced new rules on handling the income from interest on frozen Russian funds to little media attention on 12 February 2024.

Regulation (EU) 2024/576 makes it clear that balance sheet management transactions linked to frozen assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia are permitted.

The income such transactions generate must be registered separately by central security depositories holding total assets in excess of EUR 1 million, and may not be distributed to shareholders or third parties.

This new rule is a first step towards the EU’s goal of making the income from frozen Russian funds available to Ukraine .

Given the mass of funds frozen in the EU (over EUR 200 billion), this could generate income running into single-figure billions.

The statutory changes needed for this, however, have not yet been adopted.

II.

Update following 12th sanctions package

Although the 13th sanctions package has already entered into force, last week saw the publication of new information relating to changes introduced by the 12th package on 19 December 2023.

1.

New General Export Authorisation to provide services to EU companies’ Russian subsidiaries On 20 February 2024, the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (“ BAFA ”) published General Export Authorisation No. 42 concerning the bans on providing certain services and business software under Article 5n

Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

A general Export Authorisation is a special form of export licence which automatically authorises all exports that meet its requirements.

Article 5n Regulation (EU) 833/2014 constitutes a general ban on rendering certain services (auditing, bookkeeping, business and management consulting, IT consulting etc.) and supplying software for the management of enterprises or software for industrial design and manufacture to legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia.

To date, however, a “ subsidiary privilege ” applied, under which an exemption was made for the services and software listed if they are used solely by the Russian subsidiary of an EU company or a company from a partner country.

The new General Export Authorisation only became necessary when the 12th sanctions package took effect, as this abolished the privilege with effect from 20 June 2024.

From this date on, a licence must be obtained to provide services and software to the Russian subsidiaries of EU companies.

The BAFA sees no need to monitor the provision of services and software to Russian subsidiaries of EU companies or companies from partner countries by licencing them individually, hence its issuance of the new General Export Authorisation No. 42.

This also applies where the services are needed for the work of diplomatic or consular representations of the EU, its Member States or partner countries."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: 13TH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING 12TH PACKAGE,"This also applies where the services are needed for the work of diplomatic or consular representations of the EU, its Member States or partner countries.

The General Export Authorisation covers all services, software and activities listed in Article 5n(1) to (3b) Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

The General Export Authorisation only specifies few exceptions where it does not apply and an individual licence is required, such as where the software itself is subject to export restrictions, the recipient of the services is on a sanctions list, or the recipient manufactures certain weapons or armaments.

Companies that wish to make use of the General Export Authorisation must register with the BAFA as users of General Export Authorisation No. 42 upon first use or within thirty days thereof.

They can register using the ELAN-K2 online portal or by e-mail.

Notification must only be made the first time a service or piece of software is provided , which further simplifies the procedure.

Subsequent services or software provided to the same recipient need not be reported, even if the services or software are different.

2. FAQ and proposed wording for “No Russia clause” Article 12g was also added to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 as part of the 12th sanctions package, requiring exporters to contractually prohibit their customers from re-exporting certain particularly sensitive goods and technology to Russia or for use in Russia.

Because this is a new export control measure and the wording of Article 12g leaves considerable room for interpretation, there was much uncertainty as to how this provision should be handled in practice.

On 22 February 2024, the European Commission published its FAQ on Article 12g Regulation (EU) 833/2014, which also contains proposed wording for the “No Russia clause”.

In this respect, it is positive to note that the European Commission explicitly references EU exporters in its guidance.

The Commission’s FAQ is a further indication that the obligation to include a “No Russia clause” only applies to contracts for the export of goods from the EU to third countries – and not, for example, to non-European supply relationships governed by Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

However, the Commission’s proposed wording is very broad, requiring, for example, the counterparty to use its best efforts to ensure that other companies further down the commercial chain do not re-export the goods to Russia or for use in Russia.

To that end, the counterparty should obtain monitoring mechanisms so as to verify whether companies along the commercial chain are meeting this obligation, it says.

By way of example, the Commission specifies the right to terminate and contractual penalties as “adequate remedies” for breach of the re-export ban. 

It remains to be seen how contractual partners in third countries will react to the prospect of incorporating such a far-reaching clause.

Nonetheless, the Commission’s FAQ makes clear that where it is not possible to agree a “no Russia” clause, no contract should be entered into.

Despite these clarifications by the Commission, there is still room for interpretation .

The wording proposed by the Commission is explicitly recommended for contracts with contractual partners who pose a high risk of circumvention.

This suggests that the Commission’s proposed wording may not need to be fully implemented in less risky circumstances.

The minimum requirements for a “No Russia clause” in such lower-risk circumstances remain unclear, even following publication of the Commission’s FAQ.

In its FAQ, the Commission further reiterates its view that, depending on the inherent risks of a company’s business model, a clause banning the re-export of goods to Russia or for use in Russia may be required beyond the scope of Article 12g Regulation (EU) 833/2014 to ensure sanctions compliance.

III.

U.S. sanctions"
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: 13TH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING 12TH PACKAGE,"III.

U.S. sanctions

The United States also announced further sanctions against Russia on 23 February 2024, prompted by both the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the death of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

Some of the new sanctions therefore target individuals connected to Navalny’s death.

This latest U.S. sanctions package is also aimed at further preventing circumvention, which is why some measures also target companies in third countries.

IV.

Outlook The 13th package of sanctions requires less action on the part of companies than previous packages did.

It introduces no new sanctions instruments, but instead expands the instruments that already existed.

That means that companies only need to check the new lists of sanctioned persons and companies and the limited additions to sanctioned goods.

The new General Export Authorisation represents a major simplification for all EU companies that have Russian subsidiaries and provide them with services or business software.

Instead of applying for multiple individual licences for the various services they provide, they will now only be required to perform one-off registration.

In contrast, the implementation of the requirements for the “No Russia clause” will continue to require a great deal of effort.

While the proposed wording does provide guidance on the interpretation of the statutory requirements, EU companies will still be left to make difficult risk assessments – in particular in lower-risk circumstances where potential counterparties are likely to oppose the incorporation of such broad wording.

Compliance with EU sanctions against Russia will continue to pose challenges for companies in future.

The sanctions must be observed not only for exports to Russia, but for any transactions involving foreign countries.

With no end in sight to Russia’s war of aggression, further sanctions packages and thus further changes to the legal situation are to be expected."
Gleiss Lutz,THE IMPACT OF THE EU HTA REGULATION: “BOOSTER” FOR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN EUROPE?,"On 11 January 2022, the EU’s Health Technology Assessment Regulation (2021/2282) came into effect following years of negotiating European rules for health technology assessment (HTA).

The EU hopes that the new rules will give patients broad, timely access to vital and innovative health technologies, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It also believes this will lead to efficiency gains for both health technology developers and Member States – largely through joint clinical assessments coordinated by a body known as the Coordination Group that are to be carried out for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical decides from January 2025 at the earliest.

Despite that date still being three years away, it is already worth taking a look at the key elements of the HTA Regulation and its implementation in German medical device and social insurance law.

I. Assessing health technologies Simply put, health technology assessment is a process for systematically and transparently collecting, classifying, analysing and assessing information about a specific health technology, the way it works, and its impact on a healthcare system.

The term “health technology” is used very broadly to cover not only medicines, medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, but also surgical procedures, disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

HTAs typically examine: medical or clinical aspects (in particular the relative effectiveness and relative safety compared to other technologies), health economic aspects (in particular the costs and savings compared to other technologies), legal aspects (e.g. approval; liability; patient autonomy; data protection), social aspects (e.g. access barriers for certain groups of people), ethical aspects (e.g. stigmatisation issues; prioritisation of resources) and/or organisational aspects (e.g. integration of the technology with existing structures; training of healthcare staff).

With the exception of the medical aspects, these areas are also referred to as “non-clinical assessment”.

The resulting HTA report is used as a basis for developing healthcare policies and assisting healthcare decision-makers in choosing whether to provide the health technology as a part of standard care and on what terms.

II.

New, joint framework for HTA process in the EU To date, these HTA processes have been commissioned and conducted at national level – in the case of Germany, by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) and the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG).

However, the individual processes themselves and the requirements for scientific evidence that health technology developers need to submit for the HTA has been able to vary greatly between Member States.

The industry has therefore faced the difficulty of designing studies – for medicinal products, starting with marketing authorisation – that promise to deliver the best results.

Regulation (EU) 2021/2282 establishes a new, EU-funded framework upon which to operate an HTA process at European level and avoid duplicate effort by health technology developers and Member States, providing a formal upgrade to the voluntary, project-based cooperation of past decades.

Key elements of the HTA Regulation include the establishment of a coordination group and a stakeholder network, conducting joint clinical assessments and joint scientific consultations, and supporting voluntary cooperation beyond those elements.

1. Establishment of a coordination group (Article 3) Alongside the Commission, the central actor of the HTA Regulation is the body known as the Coordination Group, which is defined in Article 3.

Its members – generally national HTA bodies akin to the Federal Joint Committee and Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care – are designated by the Member States."
Gleiss Lutz,THE IMPACT OF THE EU HTA REGULATION: “BOOSTER” FOR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN EUROPE?,"Its members – generally national HTA bodies akin to the Federal Joint Committee and Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care – are designated by the Member States.

The tasks of the Coordination Group and its subgroups include joint clinical assessment and joint scientific consultations, identifying emerging health technologies (known as horizon scanning), and supporting voluntary cooperation between Member States.

The Coordination Group is also responsible for developing and adopting the methodological guidance, procedural steps, and timeframes on the basis of which the joint assessments and consultations are performed (Article 3(7), letter (d)-(g)).

The Regulation itself lays down only rudimentary requirements in this respect.

The Coordination Group has a transitional period of three years for this step; under Article 36(2), the Regulation will not apply until 12 January 2025.

The Coordination Group will be supported in its activities by the Commission, which will act as its secretariat.

The first meetings are scheduled to take place in June 2022.

Here you can find a graphical overview of the different tasks and subgroups of the HTA Coordination Group at EU level .

2. Joint clinical assessment (Articles 7-15) At the heart of the HTA Regulation is the joint clinical assessment (JCA) of certain health technologies.

The “clinical” assessment is limited to the description of the health problem and the identification/description of current health technology, the examination of the technical characteristics of the health technology under assessment, the examination of its relative safety, the examination of its relative clinical effectiveness.

This means that other, non-clinical aspects – in particular the health economic issues and any added value related to pricing and reimbursement – will continue to be analysed and assessed by national bodies.

The HTA Regulation applies to medicinal products authorised using the centralised marketing authorisation procedure according to a staggered schedule (Article 7(1), letter (a), (b), Article 7(2)), starting with medicinal products with an oncological indication and advanced therapy medicinal products (2025).

Orphan drugs will follow in 2028, then all other medicinal products in 2030.

For medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices , there are various filters restricting the HTA Regulation’s application (Article 7(1), letter (c)): Only particularly high-risk, novel, and/or likely high-impact implantable medical devices from class III and active devices from class IIb within the meaning of Regulation 2017/745 on Medical Devices (Medical Device Regulation, “MDR”) are clinically assessed at European level.

Here you will find a graphic overview of the limited scope of application of the HTA procedure to specific medical devices .

Similar restrictions apply to in vitro diagnostic medical devices.

Only certain class D devices within the meaning of Regulation 2017/746 on In Vitro

Diagnostic Medical Devices (IVDR) are covered by the HTA Regulation.

Here you will find a graphic overview of the limited scope of application of the HTA procedure to specific in vitro diagnostic medical devices .

Overview of process steps The joint clinical assessment is performed by a subgroup of the Coordination Group, which appoints an assessor and a co-assessor from different Member States from among its members.

This is to ensure expertise and independence.

The process starts with the definition of the assessment scope by the subgroup, taking into account the needs of the Member States and involving patients, clinical experts and other experts (Article 8(6)).

The Commission then asks the developer to submit a dossier (Article 10(1)), the content of which – in the case of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices – is determined in more detail by Annex II of the Regulation and in Commission implementing acts."
Gleiss Lutz,THE IMPACT OF THE EU HTA REGULATION: “BOOSTER” FOR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN EUROPE?,"It is important that health technology developers do not submit evidence at national level that has already been submitted at Union level (Article 10(3)).

Conversely, Member States may not request this evidence (Article 13(1), letter (d).

The assessors then prepare drafts of a purely analytical assessment report and a summary report (JCA Report; Article 11(1)), which are limited to the relative effects of the health technology and the degree of certainty of the relative effects and may not contain any value judgement on the overall clinical added value (Article 9(1)).

The assessment must take into account comments from patients, clinical experts and other experts, as well as from the other members of the subgroup (Article 11(3) and (4)).

The company itself is only granted the right to report any purely technical or factual inaccuracies; comments on the results of the draft report are not allowed (Article 11(5)).

The draft is then reviewed by the entire Coordination Group (Article 12(1)), endorsed by consensus, if possible (Article 12(2)) and, following procedural review by the Commission (Article 12(3)), published on an IT platform (Article 12(4)).

Timeline Because the deadlines for the individual process steps in the assessments of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices are largely left to the Coordination Group, it is difficult to estimate the total duration of the joint clinical assessment.

The Coordination Group’s procedural rules should contain more information on the timeframe.

Pain point: (Non-)binding nature of the assessment report becomes political Unlike the Commission’s draft (COM (2018) 51 final), the HTA Regulation makes the clinical health technology assessment report non-binding .

This issue was at the heart of the lengthy and contentious legislative process and prompted several Member States to raise subsidiarity complaints, including Germany.

When carrying out national HTA, national bodies must now only give due consideration to the assessment report (Article 13(1), letter (a)).

Moreover, the Regulation emphasises multiple times that the Member States’ competence to draw their own conclusions on the overall clinical added value and to make their own decisions on pricing and reimbursement on their own responsibility remains unaffected (Article 13(1), letter (a); recitals 14, 26, 28, 31).

Complimentary clinical analyses required for the general national HTA process and as non-clinical assessments by the Member States that are not covered by the HTA Regulation from the outset also remain permissible (cf. recital 15).

Member States can also request additional evidence within this scope.

3. Joint scientific consultations (Articles 16-21) For health technologies that are likely to be the subject of joint clinical assessments and where the clinical studies and investigations are still at the planning stage, health technology developers may request a joint scientific consultation with the Coordination Group.

For example, the design of studies can be discussed with regard to patient populations, interventions, comparators and health outcomes (Article 16(1); cf. PICO process).

Developers of medical devices may also request that the consultation take place in parallel with the process of obtaining scientific advice from the expert panels under Regulation 2017/745 on Medical Devices (MDR) (Articles 16(5) and 17(2)).

4. Voluntary cooperation (Article 23)

There will also be continuing support for voluntary cooperation between Member States on HTA and, thanks to the HTA Regulation, it will be embedded in a new organisational and financial framework."
Gleiss Lutz,THE IMPACT OF THE EU HTA REGULATION: “BOOSTER” FOR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN EUROPE?,"There will also be continuing support for voluntary cooperation between Member States on HTA and, thanks to the HTA Regulation, it will be embedded in a new organisational and financial framework.

This most notably concerns the following: non-clinical assessments of health technologies under economic, legal, social, ethical and/or organisational aspects, clinical assessments on other medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices that do not already come under the HTA Regulation in accordance with Article 7, HTAs for health technologies that are not medicinal products, medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices (e.g. surgical procedures, disease prevention, or diagnosis and treatment).

5. Stakeholder network (Article 29)

The main opportunities for medical technology industry players to bring their influence to bear on European HTA exist through participation in what is known as the stakeholder network.

This is being set up by the Commission from patient associations, consumer organisations, NGOs in the field of health, developers and health professionals.

There is likely to be an open call for applications in the near future for this purpose.

Applicants will be required to meet transparency obligations as regards sources of funding and other interests in the health technology development industry.

The names of network members, and their transparency statements, will be made publicly available on an IT platform.

It remains to be seen how intense the exchange between the stakeholder network and the Coordination Group and its subgroups turns out to be in practice.

The intention is simply for regular meetings to be held “at least once each year” (Article 29(5)).

In addition, the Coordination Group will consult with the stakeholder network regarding the preparation of the annual work programme (Article 6(3), letter (d))

and as part of what is referred to as horizon scanning Article 22(2), letter (e)).

Otherwise, the Coordination Group or its subgroups, as the case may be, will only consult with the stakeholder network upon request (Article 29(1)).

The Coordination Group is also free to invite members of the stakeholder network to attend its meetings as observers (Article 29(6)).

III.

Significance of the HTA Regulation for the reimbursement of medical devices under the German Social Security Code, Book V The HTA Regulation assessments will have to be factored in at various stages of the decision-making processes on access and assumption of costs within the German healthcare system, most notably the following: Reimbursement for products classified as medical aids and the updating of the register of medical aids :

This is based on the requirements set out in sections 33, 126 et seq.

German Social Security Code, Book V (Sozialgesetzbuch, Fünftes Buch, “SGB V”) and directives on medical aids issued by the Federal Joint Committee.

The register of medical aids (section 139 SGB V) lists medical aids for which, in the opinion of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband), reimbursement of costs is mandatory.

One possible requirement for inclusion in the register may be evidence of medical benefit.

New examination and treatment methods in panel medical and dental care (section 135(1), sentence 1 SGB V) and reimbursement based on a new German Uniform Evaluation Standard (Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab, “EBM”) number: These methods are only reimbursable by the statutory health insurance funds if, upon application, the Federal Joint Committee has issued recommendations in the form of directives according to section 92(1), sentence 2, no. 5 SGB V, among other things regarding recognition of the diagnostic and therapeutic benefit of the new methods and their medical necessity and cost-effectiveness."
Gleiss Lutz,THE IMPACT OF THE EU HTA REGULATION: “BOOSTER” FOR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN EUROPE?,"The evaluation of hospital examination and treatment methods (section 137c(1) SGB V), which are verified by the Federal Joint Committee to determine whether they are necessary for the adequate, appropriate and cost-effective care of patients, taking into account the generally recognised state of the art as regards medical knowledge.

New hospital examination and treatment methods using high-risk medical devices (section 137h(1) SGB V) and additional payment for them: Where first-time requests are made for additional payment under section 6(2), sentence 3 Hospital Fees Act (Krankenhausentgeltgesetz, “KHEntgG”) to the Reimbursement Institute (Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus, “InEK”) for a new examination or treatment method whose technical application is based largely on the use of a medical device that is classed as high-risk (known as NUB requests (NUB = “neue Untersuchungs- und Behandlungsmethode”, new examination and treatment method)), the hospital submitting the request, in agreement with the manufacturer of the medical device, must at the same time provide the G-BA with information on the state of scientific knowledge on this method for evaluation purposes.

IV.

Outlook

The HTA Regulation is an important step towards a uniform assessment of innovative high-risk medical devices in the health insurance systems of the Member States, though it is ultimately up to the Member States to decide whether to assume the costs.

The fact that – contrary to the Commission draft – joint clinical assessments do not have binding character does not mean that the HTA Regulation will not create real added value because the national HTA bodies are directly involved in clinical assessment at European level via the Coordination Group.

In practice, therefore, as far as the reimbursement procedures at Member State level are concerned, it will require considerable persuasion to call a positive EU-level HTA assessment into question at national level, perhaps even acting contrary to other Member States in the process.

The Federal Joint Committee is already assumingthat the joint clinical assessment at European level must be factored into the early assessment decision on the basis of SGB V on added value for patients, even if this does not formally pre-empt the reimbursement decision.

From the point of view of the manufacturers of medical devices, the possibility of consultation – which ties in with the Medical Device Regulation – also represents an option to obtain, at an early stage of development, a preliminary assessment of products that are still in development, much in the same way as is already possible for pharmaceuticals.

Though this does not mean formally that the HTA assessment calls into question the sovereignty of the Member States, acceptance of the EU HTA among the Member States can be expected to grow as the HTA Regulation gradually gains traction."
Gleiss Lutz,FORMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKS COUNCIL ELECTIONS,"The period for rectifying formal defects in candidate nomination lists is three working days.

This period is mandatory.

The Federal Labour Court found a works council election held during the last election period to be invalid and commented on this and other formal aspects.

The ruling will likely also be applicable to the new election regulations.

Federal Labour Court, decision of 20 October 2021 – 7 ABR 36/20 Facts

The parties were in a dispute over the validity of a works council election held in May 2018.

In preparation for the election, the election committee issued an election notice, which the works council then announced by posting it on the notice board and via e-mail.

The election committee stated that candidate nominations had to be submitted by 15:30 on Tuesday, 3 April 2018.

Three nomination lists were submitted, two of which were admitted by the election committee.

The admitted nomination lists were then posted on the notice board.

The third nomination list only included a copy of the candidate’s declaration of consent even though an original signed version is required.

The designated list representative ( Listenvertreter ) was then informed that the candidate nomination would be invalid if the original was not received by 15:30 on Monday, 9 April 2018.

The original was not received until after the deadline, so the third nomination list was disregarded for the purposes of the election.

The candidates on the rejected nomination list then sought to have the election declared invalid.

They cited the rejection of their list and the failure to announce the lists via e-mail as grounds for invalidity.

Both Oberhausen Labour Court and Düsseldorf Higher Labour Court declared the election to be invalid.

Decision of the Federal Labour Court

The Federal Labour Court confirmed that the election was invalid.

According to the Court, even though the election committee had correctly rejected the nomination list due to the failure to provide an original signed version of the consent, the next steps taken by the committee had constituted an error in law: First of all, the election committee should have announced the admitted lists in the same way it had announced the election notice.

If the works council initially opts to also announce the election notice by e-mail, the election committee must then also announce the admitted nomination lists by e-mail.

The Court pointed out that the voters – to whom the election notice had been announced by means of the information and communication technology available at the establishment – generally relied on the fact that they would also receive all of the additional information relevant for the election by the same means that they had been informed about the initiation of the election.

According to the Court, the time limit given for rectifying the mistake constituted a material error that could have influenced the outcome of the election.

The election regulations stipulate a period of three working days for rectifying mistakes.

Therefore, this lime limit already ended on Friday, 6 April 2018.

The Court asserted that the deadline of Monday, 9 April 2018 had been incorrectly calculated and therefore constituted an error in law.

It stated that, by operation of law, the time limit was started by the objection and was not optional, and that it could neither be shortened nor extended by the election committee.

By communicating an incorrect deadline to the designated list representative, the election committee had violated its obligations under the election regulations.

This violation could have influenced the election result, as the special urgency may not have become sufficiently clear to the representative.

Conclusion This decision, we are happy to say, clarifies the Federal Labour Court’s previous rulings on the classification of formal defects in works council elections."
Gleiss Lutz,FORMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKS COUNCIL ELECTIONS,"Conclusion This decision, we are happy to say, clarifies the Federal Labour Court’s previous rulings on the classification of formal defects in works council elections.

The ruling will presumably be applicable to the new election regulations, which have remained unchanged in this regard.

Given that the election period is still running or has just ended, it might make sense in some cases to examine the election that was carried out.

The employer also has a right to challenge the election results within two weeks of their being duly announced.

The challenge is likely to be successful if any of the material provisions governing the right to vote, eligibility or the election procedure have been infringed and the situation has not been rectified.

This does not apply if the infringement could not have changed or influenced the election result."
Gleiss Lutz,COINBASE AND THE INCREASING REGULATORY ACTIVITY AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY COMPLIANCE – SETTING THE PACE FOR GERMANY?,"It was only August 2022 that the New York State Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) reached a USD 30 million settlement with crypto exchange Robinhood for compliance failures.

Now the next settlement has been announced – this time, with Coinbase, Inc. (“Coinbase”).

Coinbase agreed to a USD 100 million settlement with U.S. authorities in a case that reads like a textbook example of (inadequate) compliance with anti-money laundering rules.

Growing need for action on cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency is particularly vulnerable to money laundering.

This virtual payment system has three characteristics that put it at risk: It is (i) decentralised, (ii) pseudonymous and (iii) global.

New legislation is creating an increasingly complex set of rules for crypto exchanges, financial services, and other companies that handle cryptocurrency in their business – and plans are underway for more legislative changes in the future.

For example, the European Commission is moving forward with new rules against money laundering and terrorist financing, incorporating wide-ranging regulations and obligations related to cryptocurrency.

The increasing regulatory requirements are forcing the companies concerned to strengthen their anti-money laundering operations.

The steadily increasing numbers of suspicious activity reports received by the German Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) concerning irregularities in connection with cryptocurrency suggest that awareness has increased among entities obliged under the Money Laundering Act ( Geldwäschegesetz , “GWG”).

Following the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX) – one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges – U.S. financial and regulatory authorities have been playing an increasingly prominent role in combating the risks that cryptocurrency poses.

In doing so, U.S. authorities will likely set the pace for supervisory authorities in European jurisdictions.

For more on anti-money laundering with regard to cryptocurrency and how it may affect non-financial companies, see our article from November 2022.

From routine audit to EUR 100 million settlement In May 2020, DFS conducted a supervisory examination of crypto exchange Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform with more than 100 million customers around the world.

DFS’s audit identified significant deficiencies across Coinbase’s anti-money laundering operations.

DFS launched an enforcement investigation, while Coinbase invested heavily in the development of its compliance system.

However, given the rapid increase in the customer base, the authorities felt that these efforts were not sufficient.

In February 2022, DFS placed Coinbase under the supervision of an independent monitor to oversee and assist in the resolution of the compliance issues and implementation of future measures.

This type of monitor is, in essence, similar to the special representative ( Sonderbeauftragter ) under German law as provided for in section 45c Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz, “KWG” ).

In August 2022, the monitor issued a report that found that despite discernible effort, certain deficiencies in its compliance system persisted.

On 4 January 2023, Coinbase and DFS finally reached a settlement concluding the investigation.

The crypto exchange and the regulator agreed that Coinbase would pay a civil monetary penalty of USD 50 million and that the monitor would remain for at least another year.

Coinbase also agreed to invest a further USD 50 million over the next two years into expanding its compliance programme in line with an investment plan to be approved by DFS.

DFS states in the settlement agreement that Coinbase failed to establish and maintain an appropriate and effective anti-money laundering compliance programme that could keep up with the crypto exchange’s dramatic growth.

This failure represented not only a violation of regulatory requirements, it said, but also made the platform vulnerable to serious criminal conduct."
Gleiss Lutz,COINBASE AND THE INCREASING REGULATORY ACTIVITY AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY COMPLIANCE – SETTING THE PACE FOR GERMANY?,"This failure represented not only a violation of regulatory requirements, it said, but also made the platform vulnerable to serious criminal conduct.

U.S. authorities believe that the crypto exchange may have been used to carry out offences such as fraud, money laundering, the distribution of child sexual abuse material, and narcotics trafficking.

The reputational damage associated with these serious allegations is obvious and could even outweigh the financial losses imposed in the long term.

Know-Your-Customer/Customer Due Diligence DFS highlighted the deficiencies in Coinbase’s Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”) and Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) processes, in particular.

It found that the KYC/CDD programmes, both as written and as implemented, were “immature” and inadequate, noting that Coinbase had treated customer onboarding requirements as a simple “check-the-box” exercise and had failed to conduct appropriate due diligence.

While the entire CDD documentation for some customers had consisted of little more than a copy of a photo ID, the submission of a social media profile had been accepted for necessary verification processes, even though that information was often clearly inaccurate or incomplete.

Coinbase had frequently asked for the bare minimum of identifying documents and at times simply accepted non-responses.

DFS pointed out that such inadequate KYC and CDD measures had made it impossible for Coinbase to assign an appropriate risk rating to customers, and therefore to determine the proper amount of oversight to be exercised over them.

During the course of the investigation, the backlog of customers requiring enhanced due diligence based on their risk rating grew to 14,000, but Coinbase appeared to be unable to remedy the situation due to insufficient personnel and resources.

This failure to obtain and verify customer data ultimately left it exposed to an increased risk of money laundering.

Failure to deal with suspicious activity reports DFS also found that Coinbase had failed to maintain an effective and appropriate transaction monitoring system (“ TMS ”) – a proven anti-money laundering instrument that monitors customers’ transactions for suspicious activity and issues an alert if necessary.

Generally speaking, a TMS takes the information obtained through the KYC process and carries out a risk assessment.

Although Coinbase had implemented such a system, it was already inadequate because of the deficiencies in the KYC process.

In addition, Coinbase – likely also as a result of the rapid increase in customers combined with a lack of sufficient personnel and resources – was unable to keep pace with the TMS alerts received.

This led to a backlog of over 100,000 unreviewed TMS alerts.

Coinbase then hired more than 1,000 (!)

third-party contractors to clear the backlog within a few months – but it later turned out that almost half the alerts checked by the contractors failed to meet the quality requirements.

It had also become impossible for Coinbase to investigate the suspicious activities and report them to the authorities as required.

This led to the crypto exchange only fulfilling its obligations to submit suspicious activity reports months after becoming aware of the activity concerned in some cases.

Requirements for dealing with cryptocurrency DFS also explained what appropriate CDD measures would have looked like.

Coinbase should have obtained more fulsome information from public databases as well as information about the rationale for the customer’s transactions, the nature of the business and the sources of the funds.

Institutional customers should only have been accepted following approval by senior management.

DFS refers in this respect to the relevant standards on combating money laundering in the FATF Recommendations (see “Enhanced CDD measures”, p. 70

et seq.).

These recommendations generally tally with the GwG requirements regarding customer due diligence."
Gleiss Lutz,COINBASE AND THE INCREASING REGULATORY ACTIVITY AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY COMPLIANCE – SETTING THE PACE FOR GERMANY?,"et seq.).

These recommendations generally tally with the GwG requirements regarding customer due diligence.

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht , “BaFin”) makes reference to the following three-pronged approach to effectively combating money laundering, including cryptocurrency money laundering: Effective risk management pursuant to section 4 GwG. This must cover the entire business activity of the obliged entity, take the resulting individual risks into account in a clear and transparent manner and incorporate internal security measures that are appropriate to mitigate these risks in accordance with section 6 GwG. It must also include a risk assessment according to section 5 GwG. Customer due diligence in accordance with section 10 GwG, in particular identifying the contracting partner, the person acting on the contracting partner’s behalf and the beneficial owner.

This includes not only collecting essential information, but also continuously monitoring the business relationship.

Reporting suspicious activity pursuant to section 43 GwG. That goes to show that KYC, CDD and TMS processes serve as cornerstones of Germany’s anti-money laundering efforts for cryptocurrency, too.

But it’s not enough just to implement the individual measures – the information collected and processes implemented must be combined to deliver customer onboarding that meets the legal requirements and acts as a foundation for ongoing risk-based monitoring.

Conclusion and implications for Germany The Coinbase case shows how important it is to have appropriate (anti-money laundering) compliance systems that can deal effectively with the relevant risks and are based on three key systems: know your customer, customer due diligence and transaction monitoring.

On page 14 of its current report “ Risiken im Fokus der BaFin 2022 ”, BaFin repeatedly refers to the money laundering risks posed by cryptocurrency – something that affects not only crypto exchanges, but every business that handles cryptocurrency.

These businesses face a particular challenge: In the case of cryptocurrency, the source of the funds and the beneficial owner can be concealed.

Companies must accept this challenge, however, and introduce appropriate risk-based processes, ensuring that sufficient resources are allocated where the risk profile demands it.

BaFin (and possibly the European anti-money laundering authority (AMLA)) will no doubt be stepping up scrutiny of how anti-money laundering provisions are implemented in connection with cryptocurrency and taking a tougher line on punishing violations.

Businesses are therefore strongly advised to invest in appropriate and effective anti-money laundering compliance systems – or risk their very existence."
Gleiss Lutz,REVISED BILL ON VIRTUAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS,"On 27 April 2022, the Federal Cabinet adopted the draft bill on the introduction of virtual shareholders’ meetings of stock corporations and amendments to other provisions.

I. Background

The German Act on Measures in Corporate, Cooperative, Association, Foundation and Home Ownership Law to Combat the Effects of the COVID 19 Pandemic temporarily created the possibility of holding shareholders’ meetings exclusively in a virtual format.

This special provision is only in force until 31 August 2022.

Given that companies have generally had positive experiences with virtual meetings and in view of the continued digitalisation of German stock corporation legislation, the legislator wants to permanently enshrine virtual shareholders’ meetings in the German Stock Corporation Act.

To this end, the Federal Ministry of Justice published a draft bill in February 2022, which was revised by the Federal Cabinet on 27 April 2022.

II.

New provisions The aim of the revised bill is by and large to give shareholders the same rights in virtual meetings as they have in physical meetings.

The virtual shareholders’ meeting is therefore to be a fully-fledged alternative to the physical meeting (and not merely a “second-class meeting”).

In essence, the bill can be summarised as follows:

Holding virtual shareholders’ meetings is basically contingent on there being a corresponding provision in the articles of association – in the form of either a direct provision or an authorisation granted to the management board – which must be renewed after five years at the latest.

It will also be possible to stipulate in the articles of association that certain matters cannot be dealt with in a virtual shareholders’ meeting, e.g. adopting resolutions on a squeeze-out.

To avoid legal uncertainty, the approval process is to be extended to cover the resolution amending the articles of association so that virtual shareholders’ meetings can be anchored therein.

During a transitional period up to and including 31 August 2023, the management board will, with the consent of the supervisory board, be able to convene a virtual shareholders’ meeting even without the appropriate authorisation having been laid down in the articles of association.

If a virtual shareholders’ meeting is held, the entire meeting must be broadcast with sound and image.

Shareholders must be able to exercise their voting rights by way of electronic communication and by granting proxies.

In addition, it must be possible for shareholders to submit motions during the shareholders’ meeting and to object to resolutions that have been passed.

In contrast to the initial draft, the motions include not only procedural motions but also countermotions and election proposals.

Finally, the management board’s report, or at least the key parts of it, must be made available seven days before the meeting.

Shareholders are granted a right to information by way of electronic communication, which has been made more shareholder-friendly by the revised bill: the management board may decide that shareholder questions must be submitted no later than three days before the meeting.

However, the company must then also answer these questions at the latest one day before the meeting and in return does not have to provide any more information at the meeting itself.

The scope of the questions submitted may be restricted as appropriate in the notices convening the meeting, for example by stipulating a maximum number of questions per shareholder and a maximum number of characters used.

Each shareholder is entitled to ask follow-up questions at the meeting as well as questions on new issues.

Questions that could have been asked before the meeting must also be allowed, provided that there is sufficient time available."
Gleiss Lutz,REVISED BILL ON VIRTUAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS,"Questions that could have been asked before the meeting must also be allowed, provided that there is sufficient time available.

The shareholders’ right to speak at meetings has also been significantly expanded as compared to the initial draft: it must be possible for shareholders to speak at the meeting via video communication.

The right to speak at the meeting also includes the right to ask follow-up and new questions.

Whereas the initial draft stipulated that requests to speak had to be submitted at least four days prior to the shareholders’ meeting and that the company could within reasonable limits specify the number of shareholders permitted to speak and set an overall time for all their contributions, the revised bill no longer contains these requirements.

The aim is to bring virtual shareholders’ meetings in line with physical meetings as far as possible, including allowing debate as a central element of the meeting.

As in the case of physical meetings, measures are to be put in place to ensure that the virtual shareholders’ meeting is properly conducted, for example shortening the time allowed for shareholders to speak at the meeting.

All in all, the time allowed for virtual shareholders’ meetings should be more or less the same as the time allowed for physical meetings.

According to suggestion A.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code, the chair should allow four to six hours per meeting.

Finally, shareholders have the right to submit comments on agenda items no later than five days before the virtual shareholders’ meeting.

These comments are then to be made available to all shareholders no later than four days prior to the meeting.

Companies may allow comments to be submitted later.

Comments may be restricted to a certain number of characters or a certain amount of time, and companies may specify what formats are permitted, e.g. text or video form.

As already stipulated in the initial draft, the existing provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, which restrict the options for contesting resolutions in the event of technical malfunctions, are to be extended to virtual shareholders’ meetings.

The right to contest resolutions in cases not involving technical malfunctions remains in force.

The provisions apply not only to stock corporations, but also to partnerships limited by shares (KGaA), European stock corporations (SE) and mutual insurance associations (VVaG).

III.

Gleiss Lutz comments Even if the move towards enshrining virtual shareholders’ meetings in law is to be welcomed, the currently envisaged structure is not likely to encourage companies to introduce virtual shareholders’ meetings on a permanent basis.

On the contrary, according to the current draft, companies would have to grant all the key rights associated with physical meetings and then grant the additional shareholder rights in advance of the meeting as well as make the necessary technical arrangements.

Unfortunately, the positive insights gained from holding virtual shareholders’ meetings in recent years are hardly taken into account in the draft bill.

Instead, it creates the impression that the conventional format of the physical meeting is to be transferred to an extended virtual format.

The option of holding a hybrid meeting has already shown that such an approach, which entails significantly greater effort and additional costs, is not attractive.

Even though hybrid meetings have been possible for some time, very few companies have actually held one.

It will be interesting to see how the legislative process evolves – as things stand at present, it is more likely that the vast majority of companies will hold a physical shareholders’ meeting again next year.

Given that the special provision is due to expire soon, it is likely that the Bundestag will vote on the bill before the summer break."
Gleiss Lutz,COVID-19: GERMANY’S FEDERAL COURT OF JUSTICE RECOGNISES CLAIM TO RENT ADJUSTMENT UPON CLOSURE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS,"In a decision of 12 January 2022 (XII ZR 8/21), the Federal Court of Justice recognised a rent adjustment claim by a lessee of commercial premises on the grounds of frustration of contract (as set forth in section 313(1) German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch )).

The lessee had been forced to close his business owing to government action taken to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

The amount by which rent should be adjusted in such cases, however, cannot be determined mechanically, the Federal Court of Justice held.

Instead, the circumstances of the individual case are decisive.

Coronavirus closures do not give rise to defects or impossibility in contracts Contrary to the view sometimes still taken in case law from lower instances, the Federal Court of Justice’s judgment first made it clear that closures of business resulting from government orders issued to combat the Covid-19 pandemic do not give rise to a defect in the leased premises within the meaning of section 536(1), sentence 1 German Civil Code.

The Court argued that such restrictions of use do not derive from the leased premises’ actual characteristics, condition or location, as would be required for a defect to be assumed.

Instead, they are tied to the business operation of the lessee in question and the flow of potential customers that such an operation entails.

The Court also pointed out that lessees affected are not exempted from paying rent on the grounds that the respective lessors are no longer able to provide and maintain the leased premises in their due state as contractually stipulated (sections 326(1), 275(1) German Civil Code).

Irrespective of government action, lessors were in fact still able to allow the premises to be used for the purpose agreed.

The official orders to close businesses did not ban lessors from providing premises for use.

Such premises therefore continued to be available for the purpose of lease agreed upon.

Claim to rent adjustment under section 313(1) German Civil Code generally possible A rent adjustment claim by a lessee affected by government action owing to frustration of contract (section 313(1) German Civil Code) is an option, however, in the Federal Court of Justice’s view.

Such claim presumes three things: (i) circumstances on which the agreement was based have undergone a substantial change since the agreement was concluded; (ii) the parties would not have concluded the agreement had they anticipated this change, or the substance of the agreement would have been different; and (iii) the party demanding adjustment cannot be reasonably expected to abide by the unchanged agreement.

In the Federal Court of Justice’s view, Article 240(2) Introductory Act to the German Civil Code ( Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche ) does not conflict with application of the principles of frustration of contract either.

This article temporarily suspended the lessor’s power to terminate an agreement because a lessee is in arrears of payment due to the coronavirus.

Legislators’ intention in introducing this rule was not in fact to definitively regulate the consequences government action to combat the Covid-19 pandemic might have, in particular on commercial leases.

With regard to whether the requirements for a rent adjustment claim (under section 313(1) German Civil Code) are met, the Federal Court of Justice then stated the following: The business basis of commercial lease agreements concluded before the Covid-19 pandemic has substantially changed as a result of the far-reaching restrictions on social and economic life the pandemic has entailed.

This, the Federal Court of Justice held, continues to be a rebuttable assumption under the new rule embodied in Article 240 section 7 Introductory Act to the German Civil Code.

The only scenario in which other rules might apply is where expectations and circumstances are affected which are contractually supposed to fall within only one party’s sphere of risk."
Gleiss Lutz,COVID-19: GERMANY’S FEDERAL COURT OF JUSTICE RECOGNISES CLAIM TO RENT ADJUSTMENT UPON CLOSURE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS,"The only scenario in which other rules might apply is where expectations and circumstances are affected which are contractually supposed to fall within only one party’s sphere of risk.

In the case in question, however, there is no reason to believe that the lessee had assumed the sole risk of use were his retail business to be shut down owing to the pandemic.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, moreover, it can be assumed that the parties would have concluded the lease agreement with different content had they anticipated the possibility of a pandemic and the ensuing risk of business closures by the government at the time they concluded the agreement.

It could be assumed, the Federal Court of Justice argued, that reasonable contracting parties would not impose the entire economic risks involved on the lessee but would instead have provided for a rent adjustment option.

Individual circumstances must be weighed up when assessing whether it is reasonable to abide by an unchanged agreement In the Federal Court of Justice’s view, however, the entire circumstances of an individual case need to be considered in determining whether a lessee affected by an order to close their business can be reasonably expected to abide by an unchanged agreement.

This applies in particular to the contractual or statutory distribution of risk.

One thing the Court pointed out here is that although, fundamentally, the lessee bears the risk of using the leased premises – which also includes the opportunity of generating profit through them – any frustrated expectation of profit deriving from government action such as closure of businesses goes beyond the usual risk of use.

What the case embodies, in fact, is the general risk that life entails.

Unless contractually provided for accordingly, this risk is not included in the distribution of risk under the lease agreement.

But even if not only the respective lessee’s risks are affected here, this does not mean (yet) that affected lessees can always demand that their rent be adjusted over the period of closure.

Such a one-size-fits-all approach is not permissible, the Federal Court of Justice stated.

Lessees cannot, therefore, simply halve their rents for the period during which their businesses are closed.

Having set out why individual circumstances must be weighed up, the Court then specified the following aspects as being of particular relevance: The first important aspect is what disadvantages lessees have suffered from business closures and the duration of such closures.

Loss of sales in the specific leased premises affected need to be considered here, the Federal Court of Justice stated.

A further decisive point might be what measures the lessees took or could have taken to reduce imminent losses.

On the other side of the equation, it is necessary to consider the financial benefits lessees have enjoyed from state compensation payments for disadvantages incurred through the pandemic, or payments from insurers with liability for claims.

State support measures such as loans, however, must be excluded, as they do not constitute final and definitive compensation for loss of sales.

Finally, the lessor’s interests also need to be taken into account when weighing up the various factors.

As a general principle, a lessee demanding amendment of the agreement bears the burden of presenting and proving that abiding by the unchanged agreement would be unreasonable.

Should the respective lessor object that the alleged losses do not derive from the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the lessor will bear the burden of presenting and proving this.

Conclusion The 12 January 2022 judgment is the first decision by Germany’s supreme court on numerous issues connected with restrictions on business ordered by the state in order to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Federal Court of Justice ruled that in these circumstances lessees do not have the right to reduce their rent on account of a defect."
Gleiss Lutz,COVID-19: GERMANY’S FEDERAL COURT OF JUSTICE RECOGNISES CLAIM TO RENT ADJUSTMENT UPON CLOSURE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS,"The Federal Court of Justice ruled that in these circumstances lessees do not have the right to reduce their rent on account of a defect.

The Court also ruled that the lessees concerned are not exempted from paying rent merely because the respective lessors cannot provide the leased premises for the contractually stipulated purpose as owed under the agreement.

In so doing, the Court takes a view consistent with that of case law from lower instances to date.

The Federal Court of Justice also made it clear that although a lessee of premises used commercially may in principle have a claim under the principles of frustration of contract, this is only a possibility and need not always be the case.

Whether and to what degree the lessee affected by the order to close its business is entitled to demand a rent adjustment must be assessed on an individual basis and taking the entire specificities of the case into account.

One-size-fits-all solutions are not permissible.

Halving rent over a lockdown has been a frequently encountered solution in lease agreements.

In future, it will be one but only one of the conceivable ways in which the conflicting interests of lessors and lessees can be reasonably reconciled and the commercial consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic shared by contracting parties.

In practice, the Federal Court of Justice’s decision will mean that when potential rent adjustments are being negotiated more attention will need to be paid than previously to the consequences of a restriction on business ordered by government and/or requirement to close for the respective party.

In addition to the circumstances specified by the Federal Court of Justice, such as loss of sales, state payments to cover ongoing costs, or payments by insurers with liability for claims, it will be necessary to focus on what other sources of revenue the affected lessee generated or failed to generate in breach of duty.

Savings from expenses not incurred – such as lower staffing or operating costs – will also need to be considered.

The Court also pointed out that the lessor’s interests need to be taken into account when weighing up the various factors as required.

This makes it clear that loans, insurance and other property-related costs the lessor continues to bear must be included in the assessment.

Here, the Court has repeatedly indicated that reducing the originally agreed rent by more than 50% is not an option, especially as the decision also implies that merely having to tap into financial reserves built up over previous years does not in and of itself mean that abiding by the agreement is unreasonable.

A final point to note is that the principles set out above do not apply where contractual arrangements distribute risk in derogation of such principles.

The Federal Court of Justice’s decision strengthens the approach taken by many contracting parties over recent years in the pandemic, namely of arriving at a commercially acceptable change to the agreement taking individual circumstances into account.

In many cases, however, lease agreement practice has shown that there are a great many more creative solutions beyond rent adjustment in cushioning the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact.

These include granting rent-free periods, loans from the lessor, or other incentives.

It will also be worth keeping a critical eye on the importance the Federal Court of Justice attaches in future to the efforts undertaken by lessees to compensate for imminent losses.

In any event, this aspect must not lead to a situation in which those who have done good business over the pandemic end up in a worse position than those who consciously accepted a loss of sales.

By providing legal certainty, the Federal Court of Justice has nevertheless made a valuable contribution to a due and proper reconciliation of the interests of the contracting parties involved."
Gleiss Lutz,THIRD COUNTRY REGIME UNDER CRD 6,"In December 2023, the Council confirmed the final compromise reached in the trilogue negotiations between the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament (“EP”) regarding a new amendment of the Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD 6”).

This reform package is now in the final stages of the legislative procedure and will likely be adopted by the EP in early 2024.

Amongst other aspects, CRD 6 introduces a new regulatory framework for market access by third-country undertakings which intend to offer banking services to clients located in EU Member States (“MS”).

This third country regime (“TC Regime”) restricts the ability of third-country (non-EU) undertakings to offer cross-border banking business EU clients, except when undertaken on a reverse solicitation basis.

The TC Regime also harmonises the way in which MS regulate third-country undertakings conducting banking business through branches in the EU (“TCB”).

As such, the TC Regime may have a significant impact on the ability of many non-EU banks to continue to deal with EU clients or counterparties on a cross-border basis in reliance on existing MS regimes.

The purpose of this joint paper is to give an overview of the current EU regulatory framework, the TC Regime under CRD 6 as well as the national implementation and impact."
Gleiss Lutz,TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT OF RESTRUCTURING AND INSOLVENCY LAW PROVISIONS TO MITIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CRISIS,"The Ukraine conflict has been putting an enormous strain on the economy, which was already struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Alongside disrupted supply chains, rising or fluctuating energy costs are driving up prices in many sectors and have pushed inflation to record highs.

The rapid increase in costs and the decline in consumer spending in some sectors have been hitting many companies hard, often leading to liquidity bottlenecks.

In response to this situation, the legislature has once again felt itself compelled to implement temporary adjustments to restructuring and insolvency law.

With today’s promulgation, the newly adopted provisions will enter into force as the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate the Consequences of Crisis ( Sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtliches Krisenfolgenabmilderungsgesetz – “SanInsKG”), taking effect as of 9 November 2022.

1.

Overview of new insolvency law provisions applicable through 31 December 2023

The key element of these new provisions is the shortening of the going concern forecast period pursuant to section 19(2), sentence 1 Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung, “InsO”) from the current twelve months to four months .

This means that managers of companies with balance sheet overindebtedness will no longer need to file for insolvency due to overindebtedness if the company has a liquidity gap (which most likely cannot be closed) between the fifth and twelfth month of the forecast period.

The period required for self-administration and restructuring planning will be shortened from the current six months to a planning period of four months .

The new provisions will additionally extend the maximum deadline for filing an insolvency petition in the event of overindebtedness from the current six to eight weeks .

These provisions will apply until 31 December 2023.

2. Shortening the going concern forecast period to four months Retroactive effect for all companies – even those not affected by the crisis The reason for shortening the relevant period for the going concern forecast under insolvency law pursuant to section 19(2), sentence 1

InsO is to avoid those insolvency proceedings which arise only when a (twelve-month) positive going concern forecast cannot be achieved owing to the current uncertainties.

This is meant to protect companies that are basically in good shape against unnecessary insolvency proceedings.

The provisions also retroactively benefit companies which are already overindebted, but for which the (currently applicable) six-week maximum deadline for filing an insolvency petition had not elapsed by 9 November 2022 .

Notably, all companies fall within the scope of these provisions without exception .

It makes no difference whether a company is experiencing difficulties on account of the current market disruptions.

Public financial assistance, on the other hand, will still only benefit energy-intensive companies.

Only small practical benefits for energy-intensive companies or companies directly affected by the war in Ukraine It is doubtful whether the (energy-intensive) companies actually affected by the current uncertainties will benefit from the shortening of the forecast period.

Liquidity bottlenecks caused by the current crisis often tend to arise within much less than four months because, for example, additional liquidity is needed at very short notice due to margin calls or sudden increases in raw material or material costs.

As a result, many companies will be facing impending insolvency within the next four months.

Even once this amendment enters into force, such companies will still have negative going concern prognoses and therefore, as a rule, be obliged to file for insolvency due to overindebtedness."
Gleiss Lutz,TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT OF RESTRUCTURING AND INSOLVENCY LAW PROVISIONS TO MITIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CRISIS,"Even once this amendment enters into force, such companies will still have negative going concern prognoses and therefore, as a rule, be obliged to file for insolvency due to overindebtedness.

Illiquidity as grounds for filing for insolvency will otherwise on the other hand remain unaffected by the SanInsKG, along with managers’ duty to file for insolvency without delay (after three weeks at maximum).

Notwithstanding the SanInsKG Companies companies and managers will still have to plan ahead notwithstanding the SanInsKG – despite the current uncertainties The practical benefit of shortening the forecast period is also likely to be slight due to the fact that pursuant to section 1 Corporate Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework Act (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und -restrukturierungsgesetz, “StaRUG”), managers are still obliged to set up early warning systems and take appropriate countermeasures if a crisis is identified.

Such measures would also include securing the short and medium-term financing of the company.

Moreover, the SanInsKG will not affect accounting regulations or the going concern forecast periods provided for therein, such as the (unchanged) forecast period of one year after the balance sheet date in the IAS rules.

In order to avoid lender liability , lenders in crisis situations will also continue to insist that borrowers draw up a turnaround plan which is to be examined and confirmed by an expert third party (e.g. in the form of an IDW S6 report).

As a result, planning horizons will likely still need to extend over several years.

Ultimately, managers may not incur unsecured (trade) liabilities if they have to assume that the consideration (payment) cannot be provided at the time it is due, as this could give rise to accusations of fraud (section 263 Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, “StGB”)).

If the consideration falls due within the forecast period of five to twelve months, the persons involved could therefore be subject to a criminal law risk – despite the limited obligation to file for insolvency – if they no longer examine and monitor the previous twelve-month forecast period (on the basis of liquidity planning) in the future.

Decreasing overlap between impending illiquidity and overindebtedness will make StaRUG easier to access in individual cases As a side effect, the new provisions could increase the potential scope of pre-insolvency (financial) restructuring under the StaRUG.

Procedural assistance under the StaRUG, such as approval of a restructuring plan, can be accessed in the event of impending illiquidity, i.e. if a liquidity gap occurs within the next 24 months, but not if insolvency illiquidity or overindebtedness has already occurred.

This means that, in principle, the restructuring instruments of the StaRUG are available in the event of a liquidity ga p that occurs within the next 5-24 months (currently 12-24 months), without overlapping with the going concern forecast or overindebtedness period.

This can facilitate restructuring procedures under the StaRUG in orderso as to avoid insolvency.

3.

Other changes Self-administration planning period now four months rather than six months The financial planning period under section 270a(1), no. 1 InsO (or section 50(2), no. 

2 StaRUG), which has also been shortened to four months , will presumably only help a few companies avail themselves of self-administered insolvency (or a stabilisation order), given the fact that insolvency proceedings are normally opened no later than the fourth month after the filing of the petition, and measures which affect the course of the proceedings (sale of the company, job cuts, etc.) often have to be decided immediately after the opening – and therefore planned in advance.

Deadline for overindebtedness petitions now eight weeks rather than six weeks Even an extension of the petition deadline in cases of overindebtedness will hardly provide any relevant practical relief ."
Gleiss Lutz,TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT OF RESTRUCTURING AND INSOLVENCY LAW PROVISIONS TO MITIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CRISIS,"Companies with their own business operations don’t do not generally use all of the current six-week maximum period.

Between the impending insolvency and the actual filing of the insolvency petition, managers have to comply with additional restrictions (“emergency management”), such as prohibitions of payment under section 15b InsO, which are imposed along with the risk of breaching the duty to file for insolvency under section 15a InsO and significantly curtail and burden business operations (such as dealing with customers and suppliers and other stakeholders).

Managers will therefore generally (have to) file insolvency petitions at an early stage, and not avail themselves of the entire eight-week period, in order to keep the uncertain and especially risky phase of emergency management as short as possible.

4. Conclusion In light of the current economic challenges, the declared objective of the SanInsKG provisions is to respond to planning uncertainties.

The intention to limit liability risks for managers which arise solely due to uncertainties in the current economic situation is understandable.

From the standpoint of insolvency and restructuring law, however, these legal adjustments are not very effectual.

They only protect managers selectively and lack cohesion.

Managers will still (have to) continue to draw up – in some cases very long-term – plans to protect themselves from liability risks.

Even the legal situation as changed by the SanInsKG continues to burden managers of companies in crisis with a multitude of special duties to act and liability risks, and it remains the case that in such situations, a manager should seek expert advice in good time."

Gleiss Lutz,CIVIL LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION: A NEW WORLD?,"If you search BeckOnline for the keywords “ metaverse” and “ ZPO” (Code of Civil Procedure), you currently do not get a single hit.

This is an astonishing search result from one of the major German online legal libraries.

On this basis, at least, it would seem that from a German point of view, little or no attention has been paid to dispute resolution issues in connection with civil litigation and arbitration law in the metaverse context.

The results are a little better if you search for “ Streitbeilegung ” (dispute resolution) and “ smart contract” , but even then the list is not exactly long.

When it comes to international arbitration, the situation is quite different.

For example, an article in Global Arbitration Review from March 2022 entitled “ Get versed in the metaverse!” explains “ why the arbitration community needs to pay attention to blockchain, the metaverse, NFTs and sundry new technologies (even if many think it’s a faddish waste of time)” . 

Against this background, the present article seeks to provide a tour d’horizon of potential issues that may arise under German civil litigation and arbitration law in the future when resolving disputes in connection with the metaverse.

Gleiss Lutz,DO PHYSICIAN’S CERTIFICATES OF INCAPACITY TO WORK HAVE EVIDENTIARY VALUE WHEN THE DATES THEY COVER COINCIDE WITH NOTICE PERIODS?,"If an employee terminates his or her employment relationship and is unable to work because of illness on the day that notice is given, this may call the evidentiary value of the certificate of incapacity to work into question if the certified incapacity to work exactly matches the notice period.

Federal Labour Court, judgment of 8 September 2021 – 5 AZR 149/21

Background On 8 February 2019 the employee terminated her employment relationship as of 22 February 2019.

At the same time, she presented a physician’s certificate of incapacity to work dated 8 February.

This certificate was the first notification of illness and stated that she was expected to be unable to work from 8 to 22 February.

The employer refused to continue paying her salary, arguing that the certificate of incapacity to work corresponded exactly to the period of notice.

The employee brought an action for continued payment of salary for the period in which she had been certified as unable to work.

The labour court upheld the action, but the regional labour court subsequently dismissed it.

Decision The plaintiff’s appeal was also unsuccessful.

As a general principle, the employee bears the burden of presentation and proof with regard to whether the requirements for continued payment of salary have been met.

The employee generally proves that he or she is unable to work owing to illness by submitting a physician’s certificate of incapacity to work.

This is the most important evidence of incapacity to work because of illness and is provided for by statute.

The employer can call the evidentiary value of the certificate of incapacity to work into question by presenting and proving specific circumstances that cast doubt on the employee’s illness.

If the employer succeeds in doing so, it is then in turn the employee’s responsibility to present and prove specific facts indicating that he or she was in fact ill.

One way for the employee to do this is to have the treating physician cross-examined once the latter has been released from his or her duty of confidentiality.

In the present case, the Federal Labour Court recognised that there were serious doubts as to the employee’s incapacity to work because the certified incapacity to work and the beginning and end of the notice period coincided.

The Court held that the evidentiary value of the certificate of incapacity to work had been called into question.

The burden of presentation and proof that she had in fact been ill over the period stated then passed back to the employee.

Despite the Court’s instruction in this regard, she was unable to meet this requirement.

Gleiss Lutz comments This is a welcome decision.

It continues the Federal Labour Court’s case law according to which the requirements placed on employers’ submissions regarding employees’ incapacity to work should not be excessive.

This is because as a rule the employer does not have detailed information on the employee’s state of health.

The employer can call the evidentiary value of the certificate of incapacity to work into question by arguing that there are grounds for serious doubts.

According to the case law, employee conduct that provides grounds for serious doubts includes where the employee (i) threatens to stay away from work, (ii) is repeatedly unable to work around vacations, public holidays, the beginning and end of the week etc., (iii) gives contradictory information on when the incapacity to work began, (iv) does not attend an appointment at the statutory health insurance fund’s medical service, (v) acts in a way that is suspicious for someone who is sick, (vi) is certified as unable to work by a physician whose certificates arouse suspicions because they are issued so frequently, and now (vii) presents a certificate of incapacity to work that covers the entire notice period."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYMENT LAW CHALLENGES IN THE METAVERSE,"The metaverse enables companies to transfer individual tasks – or even entire jobs – to the virtual space.

The new virtual environment raises numerous employment law issues.

Metaverse – a new digital world Technological change has revolutionised the desktop-centric use of the internet in the workplace in recent years.

Continued improvements to the mobile internet have transformed everyday working life, making it possible to work from anywhere.

The result has been a growing trend towards remote work.

In many professions, working from home or elsewhere is now entirely straightforward.

The coming years are likely to see a further shift from mobile internet usage towards internet usage in virtual environments: According to Mark Zuckerberg, it will be possible to switch between virtual office, a metaverse concert with friends, and your parents’ virtual living room – at the click of a mouse in the metaverse.

Virtual reality headsets, personalisable avatars and virtual offices could shape the working day of the future.

The metaverse has created a digital space that allows companies to better connect with each other and with workers all over the world – using cyber-physical systems, digital copies of real objects, 5G virtual reality, and low-latency, AI-assisted data centres to develop products in the virtual sphere.

Customer insights and feedback can be tested in a virtual environment before being implemented in real-world production.

Manufacturers can digitally simulate assembly lines to test and optimise production processes – establishing an “industrial” metaverse that has the potential to make manufacturing more efficient, more innovative, and more profitable.

Practical implications Transferring parts of the working environment to the metaverse has a number of employment law implications: Unless precluded by individual or collective agreement, employers have the right to unilaterally instruct employees to work in the metaverse on a temporary basis for a specific reason – e.g. for meetings – provided that the necessary technical infrastructure is in place.

However, if employees are to work primarily from the metaverse, it is unlikely that a unilateral instruction to this effect will be covered by the employer’s general right of direction.

Businesses planning to operate a “metaverse workforce” should in particular modify their model employment contracts before doing so.

Compliance with occupational health and safety requirements is another issue likely to arise if employees are working in the metaverse.

Working in a virtual space using virtual reality technology will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

On one hand, it may be necessary to restrict the time spent in the metaverse; on the other, the technology can provide a more accessible environment for disabled employees.

Just like employees who work from home, employees working in the metaverse would generally be assigned to existing operations.

However, it is also conceivable that any physical operation could be forgone entirely.

If the workforce works in the metaverse only, what will be the implications in terms of co-determination?

Will metaverse-based works councils be formed that are responsible for all employees working for a given company in Germany?

Is the principle of territoriality appropriate at all in the world of virtual work?

As collaboration in the metaverse becomes more international, determining which jurisdiction’s employment law applies is likely to become increasingly difficult.

While German conflict of laws rules, in accordance with Article 8(2)

Rome I Regulation, generally rely on the physical place of work in cases where no specific choice of law is made, the laws of other countries do not always do so.

Ensuring a heterogeneous level of protection in an international metaverse workforce is something employers need to consider up front, along with all the associated challenges, e.g. in the context of restructuring."
Gleiss Lutz,EMPLOYMENT LAW CHALLENGES IN THE METAVERSE,"It is unclear what impact the metaverse will have on established remuneration structures.

In other countries, metaverse workers are already being paid in cryptocurrency (e.g. employees of online casinos).

This could cause significant problems under current German law, as section 107(1) Trade Regulation Act ( Gewerbeordnung , “GewO”) requires all remuneration to be calculated and paid in euros.

The metaverse creates new opportunities to collect a wide range of data, such as facial expressions, gestures, physiological reactions to certain content, and data about a VR headset’s immediate environment.

This increasingly puts the spotlight on employee data protection.

Employees’ right to privacy – especially in the form of data protection law – must be taken into account.

Conclusion As the world becomes more digital, companies need to prepare for the changes that transferring parts of the workplace to the metaverse entails.

Where necessary, existing rules should be adapted to meet the needs of the digital environment.

Businesses would be well-advised to introduce corporate guidelines for working in the metaverse similar to those previously drawn up for mobile work.

Gleiss Lutz,CS3D update,"On 24 April 2024, the EU Parliament adopted the draft directive on corporate sustainability due diligence (Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, ""CS3D"").

This draft was endorsed by the Permanent Representatives Committee of the European Council on March 15, 2024 (“Council Draft”).

After a series of failed votes and delays, parts of the Council Draft now differ significantly from the previous draft agreement of 14 December 2023 (“Preliminary Draft”).

In particular, the Council Draft significantly limits the personal scope of the Directive.

The following is a brief overview of the latest and presumably final version of the CS3D – subject to the approval of the European Council.

I. Changes to the personal scope of application The scope of the CS3D is defined primarily by employee and turnover thresholds, with a distinction being made between EU and third-country companies: For EU companies, the Council Draft raises the employee threshold to 1,000 employees and the threshold for worldwide net turnover to EUR 450 million.

The Preliminary Draft provided for significantly lower thresholds of 500 employees and EUR 150 million.

It is worth noting that the new employee threshold is in line with the requirements of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, “LkSG ” ), which only applies to companies with more than 1,000 employees.

However, the way the number of employees is calculated differs in some respects from the method specified in the LkSG, with the concept of full-time equivalent (FTE) being a key factor in the Council Draft.

Due to the different calculation methods and the lack of a turnover threshold defined in the LkSG, there are therefore companies that fall under the LkSG but are not covered by the CS3D. Contrary to the Preliminary Draft, smaller EU companies would not be directly covered.

For third-country companies, on the other hand, there is still no employee threshold – only a threshold for net turnover generated in the EU of at least EUR 450 million, as opposed to the EUR 150 million provided for in the Preliminary Draft.

Overall, the personal scope of the Council Draft is much narrower – covering an estimated 70% fewer companies than the Preliminary Draft.

However, the CS3D also applies to the ultimate parent company of a group if the group reaches the turnover threshold – and in the case of EU companies also the employee threshold – even if this is not the case for the ultimate parent company itself.

According to the Council Draft, parent companies that are merely holding companies may, however, be exempt from the CS3D under certain circumstances.

Another significant change in the Council Draft is that there are no longer separate thresholds for companies in so-called high-risk sectors.

The corresponding provision in the Preliminary Draft was deleted without replacement.

Under the less stringent Council Draft, companies that maintain a “common identity” in the EU through licensing or franchising agreements are only covered if they generated royalties of more than EUR 22.5 million in the last financial year (instead of the originally proposed EUR 7.5 million).

EU companies must also have generated net turnover of at least EUR 80 million worldwide (instead of the previous EUR 40 million), while third-country companies must have generated net turnover of at least EUR 80 million in the EU.

The number of employees a company has is irrelevant in this scenario.

The respective thresholds must be reached in two consecutive years.

It should also be noted that, apart from the different method for calculating employees, the Council Draft still covers not only corporations but also partnerships within the meaning of Annex II to Directive 2013/34/EU, i.e. general partnerships (oHG) and limited partnerships (KG) as well as comparable foreign legal forms, irrespective of whether their general partners are corporations.

II."
Gleiss Lutz,CS3D update,"II.

Changes to the scope of protection The legally protected human and environmental rights interests and agreements referenced by the CS3D were already adapted and clarified in the Preliminary Draft, and the Council Draft still contains these changes.

For example, the Council Draft does not restore the general clause on human rights deleted in the Preliminary Draft, but instead makes reference to further United Nations Conventions including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The Council Draft also specifies what type of adverse environmental impacts are covered by the CS3D – namely any measurable environmental degradation such as harmful soil change, water or air pollution, harmful emissions, excessive water consumption or other adverse impacts on natural resources.

III.

Scope of due diligence in the chain of activities Unlike the Commission’s original proposal, the Council Draft no longer uses the term “value chain”, instead focusing on the “chain of activities”.

The term “established business relationship” has also been abandoned.

The chain of activities covers activities of a company’s upstream business partners related to the production of goods or the provision of services by the company, including the design, extraction, sourcing, manufacture, transport, storage and supply of raw materials, products or parts of the products and development of the product or the service.

It also includes activities of a company’s downstream business partners related to the distribution, transport and storage of the product where the business partners carry out those activities for or on behalf of the company.

However, it does not cover the distribution, transport or storage of goods that are subject to export control.

It is worth noting that the provision of services in the downstream chain of activities continues to be excluded.

Parts of the Council Draft go even further, and exclude not only the disposal level from the scope of the Directive, but also the downstream activities of indirect business partners.

IV.

CS3D does not apply to financial services There was much political debate whether to include the financial sector in the scope of the CS3D. As a compromise, the Preliminary Draft stipulated that financial services, i.e. the downstream chain of activities, would at least initially not be included in the CS3D. Financial companies will however have to fulfil the due diligence requirements laid down by the CS3D when it comes to the upstream part of their chain of activities.

Only certain funds (AIFs as defined in Article 4(1)

Directive 2011/61/EU and UCITS authorised in accordance with Article 1(2) Directive 2009/65/EC) are completely excluded from the scope of the CS3D. These decisions to include the financial sector in the scope of the CS3D are however subject to subsequent evaluation – and if necessary, revision.

V. Obligation to prevent and remedy adverse impacts Changes had already been made with regard to the due diligence obligations laid down in the CS3D. For example, the CS3D includes adjustments to a company’s own business plan or business strategy as well as investments in factories, plants and operational processes as suitable measures to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts.

In addition, affected companies will be required to provide comprehensive support to their business partners that are SMEs, including in the form of monetary payments, where compliance with their code of conduct would jeopardise the viability of the business partner.

VI.

Reporting Whereas the European Commission’s proposal stipulated that companies had to publish an annual statement by 30 April each year, the Council Draft requires companies to publish their statement on their website no later than 12 months after the balance sheet date of the financial year for which the statement is drawn up."
Gleiss Lutz,CS3D update,"In addition, from 1 January 2029, the statements must be submitted to a national “collection body”, which is responsible for making the statements available on the European Single Access Point (ESAP).

The ESAP is a central access portal where investors can get free, user-friendly, centralised and digital access to financial and sustainability-related information about EU companies and EU investment products.

The Commission will adopt a delegated act concerning the content of the reporting by 31 March 2027 at the latest.

This act is intended to contain detailed information on the description of the due diligence, potential and actual adverse impacts identified and appropriate measures taken with respect to those impacts.

It should also be noted that the obligation to submit an annual statement will take effect on three different dates, depending on the size and turnover of the companies affected, namely either 1 January 2028, 2029 or 2030.

Companies subject to sustainability reporting under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or included in the consolidated sustainability report of their parent company are exempt from submitting annual statements.

VII.

Obligation to adopt and implement a transition plan for climate change mitigation The Council Draft still requires companies to protect the climate.

The CS3D will require large companies to adopt and implement a transition plan for climate change mitigation that aims to ensure that the company’s business activities are compatible with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement and the objective of achieving climate neutrality as established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 (Article 15(1) CS3D).

The Council Draft deems companies that already report on their climate transition plan under the CSRD to have complied with their obligation under Article 15(1) CS3D.

The obligation to adopt and implement a transition plan for climate change mitigation can be seen as a paradigm shift in corporate law.

Currently, managing directors have the discretion to consider climate protection in business decisions under the business judgement rule, but can also prioritise other concerns.

Once the CS3D has been transposed into German law, they will however be obliged to implement the climate transition plan to the best of their ability, even if this is at the expense of other concerns such as social aspects.

There are likely to be cases in which the climate transition plan required by the Draft cannot be realised within the scope of a company’s existing business purpose or in which its implementation will jeopardise the existence and long-term profitability of the company.

The Council Draft also somewhat weakens this aspect compared to the Preliminary Draft:

Companies with more than 1,000 employees are no longer required to implement their transition plan for climate change mitigation through financial incentives to members of their administrative, management or supervisory bodies – a requirement that could have obligated those companies to include climate targets in the variable remuneration of such persons, particularly managing directors.

VIII.

Directors’ duties The provisions requiring directors of companies to take into account the consequences of their decisions for sustainability matters when fulfilling their duties, as well as to set up and monitor measures for the fulfilment of due diligence obligations, were already removed in the Preliminary Draft.

Under German law, however, directors are already – based on the duty of legality – responsible for implementing and monitoring fulfilment of the CS3D’s due diligence obligations.

Even though the Council Draft does not contain explicit provisions on D&O liability, members of corporate bodies may be exposed to personal liability based on general principles (section 43 Limited Liability Companies Act ( Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung ), section 93 Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ))"
Gleiss Lutz,CS3D update,"if obligations arising from the CS3D are breached.

IX.

Sanctions; civil liability; consideration in procurement procedures The EU Member States will be responsible for laying down rules on sanctions for possible infringements of the CS3D, but must establish financial sanctions and a naming & shaming mechanism.

The maximum fine for infringements is to be at least 5% of a company’s net worldwide turnover.

The CS3D still provides for a civil liability regime that permits claims for breach of human rights and environment due diligence obligations, but only for intent or negligence.

However, participation in industry initiatives or the use of third-party verification or contractual clauses will not reduce liability.

It should also be noted that the Council Draft still expressly excludes liability for the actions of direct or indirect business partners, meaning that companies can only be held responsible for their own sphere of influence.

However, a breach of obligations within a company’s sphere of influence may relate to a violation of human rights and environmental protection by a business partner.

The basis for any liability is not the business partner’s actions, but rather the breach of human rights and environment due diligence obligations under the CS3D. In order to effectively enforce these claims, various procedural simplifications are to be introduced for potential claimants: Evidence disclosure obligations allowing courts to order the production of documents (this mechanism already features in the new Product Liability Directive and similar Directives) Prima facie evidence and disclosure obligations (“discovery light”) Knowledge-based limitation periods of at least five years (longer depending on national law)

Admissibility of third-party standing for NGOs and trade unions if appropriate requirements are met Injunctive measures Prohibition of excessively high litigation costs for claimants Compliance with the obligations under the CS3D is also to be taken into account as an award criterion when awarding public and concessions contracts in accordance with the relevant EU directives.

X. Outlook

As the European Parliament adopted the Council draft on 24 April 2024, the European Council must formally confirm this once again.

The latter is very likely – the CS3D would then enter into force on the twentieth day after its official publication in the Official Journal of the EU.

Member States would then have two years to transpose it into national law.

The German legislator would likely revise the LkSG.

Under the Council Draft, the legal acts transposing the CS3D into national law must take effect according to the following timeline, depending on the size of the company: Three years after the CS3D comes into force for EU companies with more than 5,000 employees and net worldwide turnover of more than EUR 1,500 million in the last financial year before the CS3D comes into force; the same timeline applies to third-country companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 1,500 million in the EU Four years after the CS3D comes into force for EU companies with more than 3,000 employees and net worldwide turnover of more than EUR 900 million in the last financial year; the same timeline applies to third-country companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 900 million in the EU Four years after the CS3D comes into force for companies with more than 1,000 employees and net turnover of more than EUR 450 million; the same timeline applies to third-country companies with a net turnover of more than EUR 450 million in the EU Five years after the CS3D comes into force for all other companies covered; see, for example, the regulations for franchising and licensing companies."
Gleiss Lutz,CS3D update,"Once the CS3D is passed, companies will essentially face the following legal tasks: Reviewing the applicability of the CS3D and, if necessary, reviewing existing risk management, risk analysis and supplier relationships to see if any adjustments need to be made.

The allocation of responsibilities and the preparation and implementation of the necessary processes should therefore be tackled at an early stage.

Companies should also start to draw up climate transition plans if not already doing so under their CSRD reporting obligations.

As it stands, smaller companies with fewer than 1,000 employees are directly covered neither by the LkSG nor by the obligations of the CS3D. However, if such companies have business partners that are or will be subject to the requirements of the LkSG or CS3D, the business partners could also require those companies to meet (some of) the obligations of these acts – which would be the only way the business partners could meet their own supply-chain obligations.

In other words: No matter what the thresholds are, smaller companies will also have to deal with the obligations arising from the LkSG and CS3D in order to meet their business partners’ requirements."
Gleiss Lutz,REDUCING BUREAUCRACY: DEVELOPERS TO RECEIVE EASIER ACCESS TO LAND REGISTER,"The Federal Ministry of Justice ( Bundesministerium der Justiz ) wants to make it easier for developers and operators of renewable energy installations and telecommunications infrastructure to inspect the land register.

This is in response to current obstacles to expanding renewable energies, rolling out fibre optic infrastructure across Germany and implementing the latest mobile communications standard and at the same time gives impetus to the energy transition and digitalisation in Germany.

Obstacles to the expansion of renewable energies and digitalisation Developers and (potential) installation operators need to identify the owners of suitable plots of land at an early stage of project development in order to successfully negotiate the acquisition or use of these plots.

Under current rules, identifying suitable plots of land can involve a great deal of effort because access to the land register is often only granted subject to stringent and varying conditions, pushing developers to make their own local enquiries.

This can significantly impede the expansion of renewable energies.

In addition, radio tower companies and companies that operate other physical infrastructure necessary for telecommunications systems, such as cables, are often not considered to be telecommunications systems operators, meaning that land registries do not grant them access to the land register under section 86a Regulation on the Implementation of the Land Register Code ( Verordnung zur Durchführung der Grundbuchordnung , “GBV”).

Finally, land registries sometimes have very stringent requirements for specific plans as referred to in section 86a(1), sentence 2, no. 2 GBV.

This causes delays in the development of new mobile communications sites and the expansion of digital communications infrastructure.

Renewable energy and hydrogen installations The Federal Ministry of Justice’s initial draft dated 6 November 2023 (“initial draft”) is therefore aimed at amending the GBV, in particular by introducing a new provision on the privileged treatment of specific installations.

According to section 43a, certain companies will generally be deemed to have a legitimate interest in inspecting the land register if they declare that they intend to develop or operate specific installations on the land.

The presumption of this legitimate interest will allow them to inspect the land register in accordance with section 12(1), sentence 1 Land Register Code ( Grundbuchordnung ).

This includes companies that operate or are planning to operate installations for the generation of renewable energies within the meaning of section 3, no. 

21 Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneubare-Energien-Gesetz ), for the electrochemical production of hydrogen or for the generation of electricity from hydrogen, including all associated facilities that are directly used for transmission.

The German government sees the construction and operation of these installations as important goals against the background of climate change and geopolitical developments in the energy market.

Section 43a of the initial draft is intended to standardise and simplify the requirements to be met by these companies to enable them to inspect the land register at an early stage.

It will not be necessary for the planned installations to be permissible or have been authorised under public law.

Nor will the companies have to demonstrate that the land is suitable for the construction of the installations.

All that will be required for a company to inspect the land register is that the project is in an early stage of development.

Radio tower and other telecommunications infrastructure companies Section 86a(1), sentence 1 GBV is to be amended to extend the definition of utilities to include radio tower companies and companies that operate the physical infrastructure necessary for the operation of telecommunications systems, such as cables."
Gleiss Lutz,REDUCING BUREAUCRACY: DEVELOPERS TO RECEIVE EASIER ACCESS TO LAND REGISTER,"They will be granted access to the land register if they have a legitimate interest.

Currently a legitimate interest only exists if the envisaged installation has already been included in the network development plan.

The amendment of section 86a(1), sentence 2, no. 

2 GBV will however create a legitimate interest simply on the basis of the installation falling within the search area designated for the expansion of the mobile communications network.

Mobile network operators generally provide radio tower companies with such search areas in which plots of land are to be identified for the construction of a mobile communications site.

The amendment will reduce the requirements for what constitutes specific plans and allow these companies to inspect the land register during their search for suitable sites.

All companies essential to the telecommunications infrastructure will therefore be treated equally.

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals The aim of the planned amendments to the GBV is to make it possible for certain companies to inspect the land register in the first place, and in some cases to simplify and standardise access.

The initial draft is therefore in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” and “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”.

It also contributes to the achievement of target 9.1, namely to develop regional and transborder infrastructure to support economic development.

Summary and outlook The proposed changes will make it easier for project developers and operators to assess whether projects can actually be developed and constructed on a third-party property.

They will reduce bureaucratic hurdles and provide a further boost for the construction of additional renewable energy and hydrogen installations as well as telecommunications infrastructure in the future."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN BUNDESTAG VOTES TO EXTEND THE SPECIAL PROVISIONS ON SHORT-TIME WORK,"The bill to extend the special provisions on the short-time allowance and other benefits in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic was passed by the Bundestag on 18 February 2022.

Extension of the entitlement period for the short-time allowance On the basis of the wording assistance adopted by the Federal Cabinet for the governing parliamentary groups on 9 February 2022, the entitlement period for the short-time allowance, which was soon to expire, was to be extended to a maximum of 28 months ending no later than 30 June 2022.

Many companies had introduced short-time work at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and were due to reach the end of the 24-month maximum entitlement period for the short-time allowance in February 2022.

The extension to the entitlement period was therefore to come into force with retroactive effect from 1 March 2022.

The Bundestag passed the governing parties’ draft bill to extend the entitlement period for the short-time allowance on 18 February 2022.

Continuation of other pandemic-related special provisions The Bundestag also voted to retain certain other pandemic-related special provisions until 30 June 2022.

These include the provisions on: income from mini-jobs not being offset against the short-time allowance; increased benefit rates for longer periods of short-time work; easier access to short-time work.

The number of personnel affected by the reduction in work remains at the lower threshold of a minimum of 10% instead of the earlier minimum of one-third and as before, no negative balances are being accrued on working time accounts.

After 31 March 2022, employers will continue to be reimbursed one-half of the relevant social security contributions if the short-time work is combined with training measures.

The continuation of the special provisions on the short-time allowance is intended to ensure that employment relationships can also be stabilised in the second quarter of 2022 and that insolvencies and unemployment can be avoided.

Gleiss Lutz comments As seen from the course of the Covid-19 pandemic to date, its end cannot be predicted with certainty.

Nor can a further extension or adjustment of the provisions be ruled out."
Gleiss Lutz,INADMISSIBILITY OF ICSID ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER ENERGY CHARTER TREATY,"The German Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) has found that German courts have jurisdiction for determining that ICSID arbitral proceedings based on the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) are inadmissible in the intra-EU context.

The FCJ held that the arbitration agreement contained in the ECT is invalid.

While the decision merits criticism as a violation of international law, it must be taken into account when structuring foreign investments in the future.

Summary FCJ decisions in three parallel proceedings of 27 July 2023 (I ZB 43/22; I ZB 74/22

and I ZB 75/22)

Although the ICSID Convention, which is binding under international law, excludes a jurisdiction review by national courts, the FCJ affirms the jurisdiction of German courts for such reviews pursuant to section 1032(2)

Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung , “ZPO”).

It holds that the arbitration agreement in Article 26(2)(c) ECT is incompatible with EU law, in particular because it runs counter to the jurisdiction of the ECJ.

In the case of disputes relating to their investments in EU Member States, therefore, European investors will have to rely on legal protection before national courts of the host country The FCJ’s Decisions of 27 July 2023

The FCJ’s decisions were based on investments by Irish companies in Germany and by two German companies in the Netherlands.

The respective investors had initiated ICSID arbitral proceedings based on states’ standing offer contained in Article 26(2)(c) ECT.

The defendant States filed applications with the Berlin Court of Appeal and Cologne Higher Regional Court to determine the inadmissibility of the arbitral proceedings under section 1032(2) ZPO.

Cologne Higher Regional Court ruled in favour of the Netherlands, whereas the Berlin Court of Appeal dismissed the application on the grounds that German courts lacked international jurisdiction.

International Jurisdiction

The FCJ found that German courts had international jurisdiction.

It acknowledged that the requirements of section 1025(2) ZPO were not directly met because ICSID arbitral proceedings are “anational”, i.e. , not embedded in any national jurisdiction.

The place of arbitration is therefore neither abroad nor is it still undetermined .

However, the FCJ considered an analogous application of section 1025(2) ZPO to be required, claiming that there was a regulatory gap in this respect and that the interests were similar.

In doing so, the FCJ disregarded the fact that Article 41(1) ICSID Convention – which itself is part of German law based on the Consent Act of 1969 pursuant to Article 59(2), sentence 1 Basic Law – does indeed contain a provision on the (lack of) jurisdiction of national courts and that, consequently, there is no regulatory gap.

The FCJ also failed to justify its assumption of similar interests, i.e. , equal treatment of ICSID arbitral proceedings and other arbitral proceedings that are embedded in national legal systems.

There was certainly a need to justify why there should be an interest in German courts having jurisdiction at all with respect to ICSID arbitral proceedings even though binding international law precludes this and the legislator considered it obvious that agreements under international law take precedence over section 1025 ZPO.

The New York Convention of 1958 (“NYC”), with which German arbitration law seeks to align on recognition and enforcement issues, also undoubtedly does not apply to ICSID arbitral proceedings.

Admissibility In Spite of the Blocking Effect of the ICSID Convention Only in its comments on the admissibility of an application pursuant to section 1032(2)

ZPO does the FCJ take a closer look at the blocking effect of Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention.

In this respect, it explains in detail that the ICSID Convention contains a closed system for jurisdiction review which in principle excludes review by national courts."
Gleiss Lutz,INADMISSIBILITY OF ICSID ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER ENERGY CHARTER TREATY,"In this respect, it explains in detail that the ICSID Convention contains a closed system for jurisdiction review which in principle excludes review by national courts.

The FCJ maintains, however, that the effet utile under European law calls for a different decision in the intra-EU context.

It asserts that, in Achmea , Komstroy and other cases, the ECJ decided that national courts needed to review the terms of intra-EU investor-state arbitral awards.

But the FCJ claims that the principle of effectiveness requires that such a review also be possible for the matter of determining jurisdiction.

In any case, this conclusion does not seem inevitable either.

The FCJ postulated that EU law takes absolute precedence over national law of EU Member States and international treaty law.

Instead of this, the question should have been raised as to whether, on the contrary, an interpretation of EU law that aligns with international law and thus also with the ICSID Convention is required for the simple reason that almost all EU Member States are bound by the ICSID Convention under international law, thereby taking into account the requirement of mutual consideration.

In any case, it is doubtful whether applying the effet utile can also justify a prior review based on section 1032(2) ZPO.

The principle of effectiveness primarily serves to enforce individual EU rights and not, in an abstract manner, to make EU law fully valid as early as possible.

Moreover, most EU Member States do not have an instrument corresponding to the procedure under section 1032(2) ZPO, by means of which such a prior review would be possible; one cannot make a sweeping assumption here that the principle of effectiveness has been violated.

Need for Legal Protection The decisions of German courts are not binding on ICSID arbitral tribunals.

In view of this, the need for legal protection for an application pursuant to section 1032(2)

ZPO follows – according to the FCJ – from the fact that a successful application does three things.

Firstly, it prevents a subsequent declaration of enforceability in Germany (but this would not require a determination pursuant to section 1032(2) ZPO).

Secondly, it also has a de facto indirect effect on the arbitral tribunal, which would possibly also declare that it lacks jurisdiction.

And thirdly, it could send a strong message to third-country enforcement states.

In this respect, it is true that the arbitral awards issued since the Achmea case indicate that most arbitral tribunals are not impressed by ECJ case law on intra-EU investor-state arbitral proceedings.

Enforcing such arbitral awards, at least outside the EU, remains possible.

However, one cannot deny that the decision has de facto implications and diminishes the value of an arbitral award, if one is issued.

In any case, the two German investors and the claimant have declared their respective arbitral proceedings concluded.

Merits of the Applications – Invalidity of the Arbitration Agreement The FCJ found that the arbitration agreement based on Article 26(2)(c) ECT violates EU law and is therefore invalid.

To this end, the FCJ was largely guided by its earlier decisions on the effects of Achmea and Komstroy and others.

Assessment and Conclusion The FCJ’s rejection of the universal applicability of international law is regrettable.

From a practical standpoint, the decisions further limit the legal protection afforded to foreign investors in the EU.

Even if, in some situations, it might be possible to conduct investment arbitral proceedings despite a finding of inadmissibility by a German court, and a corresponding arbitral award can be enforced outside the EU, many investors will de facto have to seek legal protection before the national courts of the host country.

However, the lack of an independent ruling body – that is also perceived as neutral – is poison for the investment climate."
Gleiss Lutz,INADMISSIBILITY OF ICSID ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER ENERGY CHARTER TREATY,"However, the lack of an independent ruling body – that is also perceived as neutral – is poison for the investment climate.

It would be a good thing if a supranational investment court could be established.

Until then, special attention will need to be paid to structuring the contractual bases for foreign investments."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN AND GERMAN PLANS ON ENERGY PRICE MEASURES AND SECURITY OF SUPPLY – A WORKSHOP REPORT,"The package of measures proposed by the European Commission to reduce energy prices and ensure security of supply was supposed to be adopted in November.

Even though some issues are still in dispute between the Member States, the draft regulation already indicates important points on how these goals need to be implemented.

In addition, Germany also put together a package of measures designed to provide additional relief and strengthen energy security in Germany.

However, some detailed regulations governing the specific consequences for the energy market are still outstanding.

The following is therefore intended as a workshop report.

The European package of measures and the status of national implementation in Germany At European level, the package of measures to reduce energy prices and guarantee security of supply ( COM/2022/549 final ) has sparked great controversy among Member States.

This is due to differing interests, which in many cases can be traced back to different supply and demand situations as well as circumstances which still hinder the full realisation of the internal energy market.

In Germany, there is still an ongoing discussion about the implementation of the package of measures.

In particular, the EU and Germany are planning or currently implementing the following measures: Joint gas purchasing, Reduction in gas demand (already adopted in Regulation (EU) 2022/1369, for comments on the draft see link ), Solidarity and optimisation of use (in addition to the solidarity measures of Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938), Energy price regulation, in particular a dynamic price cap, a new benchmark index and energy price brakes, Reliefs and subsidies, Amendments to the Energy Security Act ( Energiesicherungsgesetz , “EnSiG”)  and the Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , “EnWG”), in particular to extend expropriation powers in the interests of securing supply.

Joint gas purchasing A temporary energy platform is to ensure that gas storage facilities will be refilled in the coming summer months starting in spring 2023.

Member States will notify the EU of their gas requirements and the EU will in turn instruct a service provider to supply the combined demand.

Domestic businesses will be required to meet 15% of their gas storage obligation through the common platform, with companies’ participation in the platform being in principle voluntary for gas volumes over and above the 15% target.

Companies participating in the energy platform will be able to form joint ventures with other companies for joint procurement, which has to date been illegal under competition law.

As the requirements in the Member States differ in this respect, the EU will allow several mergers.

The aim is to create improved market conditions for SME’s and Member States regarding the purchase of gas.

A steering committee of Member States and the Commission will be overseeing this measure.

So far, questions of antitrust and competition law remain explicitly open in this respect.

Furthermore, in this context, the Commission must be notified of gas purchases exceeding 5 TWh per year.

If an individual transaction that meets this criterion has a negative impact on joint procurement or the internal market, the Commission will be able to issue a recommendation on this transaction.

Reduction in gas demand Efforts will continue to be made to drastically reduce gas consumption.

In order to promote gas savings, Member States will also be able to reduce the non-essential gas consumption of protected customers .

The Member States will determine who qualifies as “protected customers ”.

In Germany, for example, the term “ protected customers” generally includes household customers.

Depending on their consumption, SMEs also regularly qualify as “protected customers”.

German energy law already distinguishes between essential and non-essential gas requirements."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN AND GERMAN PLANS ON ENERGY PRICE MEASURES AND SECURITY OF SUPPLY – A WORKSHOP REPORT,"Depending on their consumption, SMEs also regularly qualify as “protected customers”.

German energy law already distinguishes between essential and non-essential gas requirements.

However, the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ) is currently defining in more detail the conditions under which requirements of non-protected customers qualify as essential gas requirements.

This includes, for example, the production of life-sustaining, non-importable medicines.

Solidarity and optimisation of use So-called solidarity agreements ensure that each Member State receives gas from another Member State in case of urgent need, for which it has to pay a fair compensation.

There are currently only six such bilateral agreements, including those between Germany and Denmark as well as Germany and Austria.

The Council’s agreement means that in the event of gas shortages, these solidarity agreements, which have so far been voluntary under Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply, will become binding by means of standard rules, provided that a state has not yet concluded such a solidarity agreement at Member State level in its gas supply relations.

The decision has also been made to extend the solidarity obligation to Member States without a direct pipeline connection, in order to take account of the importance of LNG terminals.

A shortage in this sense is considered to exist if a Member State declares an EU alert because it can no longer supply its protected customers.

The Member State benefiting from the solidarity measures must pay the market price for the gas received under such measures.

It must also bear indirect costs such as the reimbursement of financial losses resulting from the disconnection of customers.

Furthermore, the Member States have decided to optimise the use of LNG terminals by enabling network operators to reallocate transit rights or reserved capacities more quickly if they are not in use.

In addition, a secondary market for unused capacities will be established.

In order to counteract liquidity shortages in the energy trading sector, the draft stipulates that traders should be able to provide non-cash collateral for margin calls, as well as government guarantees.

In addition, there are plans to raise the clearing threshold for non-financial counterparties from EUR 3 to 4 billion.

The EMSA is currently drafting rules for this purpose.

There are also plans to limit volatility in electricity and gas trading by introducing rules on price fluctuations (“circuit breakers”) that occur within a trading day, with a focus on front month derivatives.

Energy price regulation: dynamic price cap and new benchmark index Instead of a fixed gas price cap, a dynamic price cap has been agreed for a period of one year for the main benchmark index TTF.

This market correction mechanism will be triggered as soon as the TTF month-ahead price exceeds EUR 180 per MWh for three consecutive days.

The LNG reference price must also be at least EUR 35 less than the TTF price during these three days.

The mechanism will be activated for at least 20 days.

If the price then falls below EUR 180 per MWh again for three consecutive days, the mechanism will be deactivated.

However, over-the-counter transactions outside of the exchanges will still be possible.

In Germany, the dynamic price cap is viewed with concern.

During the heated discussions about the introduction of the gas price cap, Berlin pointed in particular to the risk that gas would have to be rationed and allocated as a result of this measure, as the cap could lead to gas being preferentially supplied to other markets.

In order to counteract supply bottlenecks, it should be possible to suspend the EUR 180 cap in the event of a significant decline in LNG imports."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN AND GERMAN PLANS ON ENERGY PRICE MEASURES AND SECURITY OF SUPPLY – A WORKSHOP REPORT,"In order to counteract supply bottlenecks, it should be possible to suspend the EUR 180 cap in the event of a significant decline in LNG imports.

In addition, the decision has been made to introduce a completely new benchmark index for LNG imports by the end of March 2023, which will replace the dynamic price cap for the next filling season in order to decouple LNG deliveries from the TTF price.

The index will only apply to new contractual relationships and will not interfere with existing ones.

For the purpose of designing the mechanism, the regulatory agency ACER is to provide more transparency on LNG import prices by the end of the year.

According to the Commission, the aim is to correct gas prices that are no longer accurately reflected by the TTF benchmark index, and to contribute to more stable and predictable pricing for LNG transactions.

Market participants and experts, on the other hand, largely criticise the new index as artificial and unpromising.

Energy price regulation: energy price brakes at German level The energy price brakes, which are envisaged as a further stage of the relief measures, will apply from 2023 onwards.

Non-industrial electricity customers will feel the financial effects as early as 1 January 2023, which is when the gas and electricity price brake for industry is also to come into force.

The gas and electricity price brake for customers billed according to standard load profiles (SLP customers) will enter into force on 1 March 2023 with retroactive effect for January and February 2023.

The latter is to grant beneficiaries a gross gas price of 12 ct/kWh for 80% of projected annual consumption and 9.5 ct/kWh for district heating until 30 April 2024.

The same applies to residential units or lodgings with real-time meters ( registrierende Leistungsmessung , “RLM”) as well as some state or state-approved facilities that have a consumption of less than 1.5 GWh/a.

At least for large consumers, especially industrial ones, a cap on the net gas price of 7 ct/kWh will apply from 1 January 2023 until 30 April 2024.

This relief applies to 70% of the consumption volume, based on the period from November 2021 to October 2022.

The cap applies both to gas-based heat generation in production processes and the use of gas as a raw material for production.

In addition, the cap applies regardless of actual consumption in the next year.

The electricity price brake will also apply to all SLP customers from 1 January 2023 to 30 April 2024, with the relief calculated based on a cap at 40 ct/kWh for a base quota of up to 80% of the previous year’s consumption.

It will apply retroactively as from March 2023.

For industrial consumers, particularly RLM customers, the electricity price brake is expected to result in relief based on a net price of 13 ct/kWh for a quota of 70% of the previous year’s consumption.

As the relevant regulations must remain within the EU Commission’s Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF), a term of 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 is initially envisaged for this, whereby the relief is not to be implemented until March 2023 and will apply retroactively from 1 January 2023.

Other planned measures include the stabilisation of transmission system charges at 2022 levels and the absorption of windfall profits in the electricity market, which is mandatory under the EU Emergency Electricity Regulation.

Relief and subsidies at European level In order to relieve the burden on citizens and, in particular, on small and medium-sized companies in Europe, it is planned to reallocate EUR 40 billion of EU budget funds.

Furthermore, the Temporary Crisis Framework has been extended to make it possible to provide up to EUR 150 million in subsidies to energy-intensive industries.

This framework will also allow for new subsidy schemes.

For the time being, however, the proposal to subsidise gas for electricity generation and thus the electricity price has been abandoned."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN AND GERMAN PLANS ON ENERGY PRICE MEASURES AND SECURITY OF SUPPLY – A WORKSHOP REPORT,"This framework will also allow for new subsidy schemes.

For the time being, however, the proposal to subsidise gas for electricity generation and thus the electricity price has been abandoned.

The Commission stated that the problem of leakage, i.e. the outflow of subsidised electricity to non-EU countries, and the financing of such subsidies would first have to be clarified.

Relief and subsidies at German level In addition, the Bundestag has adopted comprehensive relief measures, which also include emergency aid and the aforementioned gas, heat and electricity price brakes, while maintaining incentives for savings.

The “gas and heat emergency aid package” has already taken effect in December 2022, allowing refunds within this framework from 1 December 2022.

The aim of the emergency aid package is to provide relief for the rise in energy prices by covering a single monthly instalment for customers.

In the case of gas, the relief amounts to one-twelfth of the annual consumption forecast by the gas supplier in September 2022 multiplied by the energy price for December, plus pro rata relief for other price components.

In the case of heat, on the other hand, the relief is the product of the September instalment and the statutory adjustment factor of 120%.

The relief will be granted to all consumers or SLP customers, i.e. in particular households, SMEs and social facilities, which are thus exempted from their December instalment payment.

RLM customers are also eligible if their annual consumption does not exceed 1.5 million kWh for the withdrawal point concerned.

The refund to the suppliers will be processed by the state and was due to be made – as part of an advance payment aimed at securing liquidity – on 1 December 2022 or at the latest two weeks after the submission of an application for the advance payment.

This means that the German legislator has ignored the concerns expressed by the energy sector, which sees the measures to be implemented in the short term as imposing an almost unmanageable additional burden on the energy companies, which have been turned into “paying agents for the German government”.

Amendments to the EnSiG and the EnWG, in particular to extend expropriation powers in the interests of security of supply Germany has adopted amendments to both the EnSiG and the EnWG in order to be able to respond more comprehensively and flexibly to gas shortages.

A key change to the EnSiG is the extension of the expropriation statute.

According to the statute, the ownership of petroleum and petroleum products as well as other energy sources, electrical energy and other energies or other means of production can be expropriated in favour of a third party if this is necessary to ensure that the essential need for energy is met.

It has been clarified that this can take place independently of the use for energy purposes.

In principle, the acquisition or production costs of the person entitled to compensation at the time of the acquisition or production of the expropriated property and the costs of financing are to be decisive for compensation.

In order to secure the energy supply, Germany is promoting the rapid expansion of LNG terminals.

Therefore, it will be possible to access movable property by means of an intervention equivalent to expropriation.

The intervention refers only to such moveable property that the owner does not need in the near future for the construction, maintenance and repair of gas infrastructure, but that is required for the construction of natural gas pipelines and associated infrastructure.

Furthermore, it only concerns such property suitable for making a significant contribution to securing the energy supply.

The amount of compensation for this is to be determined based on the market value."
Gleiss Lutz,EUROPEAN AND GERMAN PLANS ON ENERGY PRICE MEASURES AND SECURITY OF SUPPLY – A WORKSHOP REPORT,"The amount of compensation for this is to be determined based on the market value.

At the same time, it will also be possible to demand access to documentation, in particular written documents and records insofar as this can enable or accelerate the construction of natural gas pipelines or related infrastructure.

This includes the use of such documentation and the granting of rights of use to subject-matter protected by industrial property rights and copyrights as well as to business secrets.

A remuneration obligation is envisaged for the aforementioned rights of use, which will initially be incumbent on the Federal government, but will ultimately have to be borne by the beneficiary.

In particular, the amendments to the EnWG lay down the obligation to provide a consumer-specific account of certain fill levels at the request of the Bundesnetzagentur if there is a risk of non-compliance with fill-level requirements.

In addition, the hydrogen network development concept envisaged by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz ) will be postponed, as discussions of the European Commission’s internal gas and hydrogen market package, which is decisive in this respect, will be delayed as a result of the energy crisis.

Conclusion The Commission’s proposal for a package of measures to reduce energy prices and ensure security of supply has so far signalled, in particular, a joint European approach to the energy crisis.

The focus of this approach is on the dynamic price cap and the joint procurement of gas in order to ensure the EU’s security of supply for the coming year as well.

In addition, Germany has adopted short-term measures to cushion the acute burdens for both consumers and industry this winter and – in a second step – from 2023 onwards."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TWELFTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"On 18 December 2023 the EU adopted further economic sanctions against Russia in response to the ongoing Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.

The twelfth sanctions package tightens the existing sanctions from the previous packages, most recently from 23 June 2023 ( article of 28 June 2023 ).

The latest package aims to weaken Russia’s ability to wage war by depriving it of further important sources of income.

It also aims to make it even harder for companies and individuals to skirt existing sanctions.

One measure that has garnered particular media attention is the G7’s import ban on Russian diamonds.

The import of a range of further goods (in particular copper and aluminium) is now also prohibited.

Export restrictions and punitive measures against individuals and organisations that support the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine have been introduced for other goods as well.

In addition, the EU is tightening the price cap mechanism for Russian oil exports to third countries, which has had little practical effect to date.

It has also introduced an entirely new obligation to use contractual re-exportation clauses.

EU sanctions The EU’s twelfth sanctions package (Regulation (EU) 2023/2878, Regulation (EU) 2023/2873 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/2875) further tightens and adapts its existing sanctions against Russia.

The measures affect in particular the trade-related sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 .

I. Import ban on diamonds Trade with Russia has already been severely restricted, especially in the areas of oil and gas as well as iron and steel, but efforts are now being made to gradually shut down another important source of income for Russia:

In early December 2023, the G7 countries agreed on a ban on the import of “Russian” diamonds .

This will be implemented in the new Article 3p of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

Article 3p covers the diamonds listed in Annex XXXVIII Parts A, B and C that originate in or are exported from Russia.

Mere transit through Russia is also expressly prohibited.

Beginning on 1 January 2024, sanctions will be progressively phased in for diamonds exported from or transiting Russia.

From 1 March 2024 and 1 September 2024, respectively, the ban will extend to certain diamond products processed in a third country using Russian diamonds of a certain minimum weight.

The import ban on diamonds provided for under the new Article 3p Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (unlike the other import bans contained in the twelfth sanctions package) thus follows the familiar pattern of Article 3g Regulation (EU) 833/2014 regarding the import of certain steel and iron products: Restrictions are imposed not only on the direct or indirect import of listed diamond products from Russia, but also on the import of diamond products from third countries , where these contain Russian “inputs” as specified in greater detail.

As with Article 3g Regulation (EU) 833/2014, the importer must submit a corresponding guarantee of origin when importing the diamond products in question into the EU.

From 1 September 2024, this proof must include a certificate stating that the diamonds were not mined, processed or manufactured in Russia.

Companies affected by this should take the necessary steps as soon as possible.

The diamonds listed in Annex XXXVIII Parts A, B and C include, in particular, rough diamonds.

In the case of natural diamonds, so-called industrial diamonds are expressly excluded from the import ban .

These are used, among other things, to manufacture machines and tools.

However, in the case of synthetic diamonds (“lab grown diamonds”) – which are also generally covered by the ban – no such exemption applies to the import of industrial diamonds.

The import ban on diamonds is complemented by bans on direct or indirect technical assistance, brokering services or certain other services (see Article 3p(5)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

II."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TWELFTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"The import ban on diamonds is complemented by bans on direct or indirect technical assistance, brokering services or certain other services (see Article 3p(5)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

II.

Import restrictions for other goods (in particular copper and aluminium)

The sanctions package introduces further import restrictions for goods that have generated considerable income for the Russian economy in the past.

These include, in particular, copper and aluminium wires as well as pig iron and spiegeleisen, but also liquefied propane gas.

Article 3i Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and the associated Annex XXI have been amended accordingly, with Article 3i(3ca), (3cb), (3cc) and (3cd) stipulating various transition periods and clauses for existing contracts.

Unlike the import ban on diamonds and iron and steel products, the import restrictions described above only cover listed goods that originate in Russia or are exported from Russia, i.e. not goods that are manufactured or processed in a third country.

III.

Expansion of export restrictions The twelfth sanctions package also further expands the lists of goods in the annexes relevant for export-related sanctions, adding additional chemicals, lithium batteries, thermostats, direct current (DC) motors and servomotors for unmanned aerial vehicles, machine tools and machinery parts.

IV.

Obligation to use re-exportation clauses The obligation for EU companies to use re-exportation clauses (sometimes also referred to as “No Russia clauses”) in purchase and/or supply contracts contained in Article 12g Regulation (EU) 833/2014 is completely new and its practical impact should not be underestimated.

It will generally enter into force on 20 March 2024.

Exporters must contractually prohibit the re-exportation of certain sensitive goods and technologies (including those listed in Annexes XI, XX and XXXV of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, i.e. essentially goods for the aerospace industry, aviation turbine fuels and certain weapons) to Russia or for use in Russia, i.e. they must include a so-called re-exportation clause or “No Russia clause”.

According to Article 12g(1) Regulation (EU) 833/2014, this does not apply to trade with partner countries listed in Annex VIII, i.e. currently the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.

Article 12g(2) provides for an exception for the fulfilment of existing contracts.

V. Prohibition of services expanded The existing prohibition of services in Article 5n

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has been extended to the provision of software for business management and for industrial design and production described in more detail in the new Annex XXXIX.

This includes, in particular, Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) software and systems that map or control customer relationships or supply chains.

The (partially amended) exemptions of Article 5n Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and a wind-down period for existing contracts until 20 March 2024 also apply here.

Businesses may also apply for authorisation, for example under Article 5n(9b)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014, if this is strictly necessary for the implementation of international open-source projects.

Further amendments address the circumvention of this prohibition in connection with crypto wallets, crypto accounts or crypto custody services for Russian nationals and residents.

VI.

Enforcement of the oil price cap The twelfth sanctions package introduces stricter compliance rules to enforce the price cap mechanism for Russian oil .

To further facilitate the implementation of and compliance with the price cap while increasing the barriers to the falsification of attestations, the new rules have introduced a requirement that itemised price information on ancillary costs, such as insurance and freight, be shared upon request throughout the supply chain of Russian oil trade."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TWELFTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"An enhanced information exchange mechanism will be created to better identify vessels and organisations that engage in misleading practices in the transportation of Russian crude oil or petroleum products, such as ship-to-ship transfers to disguise the origin or destination of cargo or manipulation of the automated vessel identification system.

In addition, reporting obligations will be introduced for the sale of tankers to third countries to make their sale and export more transparent, especially in the case of second-hand tankers that could be used to circumvent the import ban on Russian crude oil.

VII.

Reporting obligations of EU companies with a Russian “owner”

The new Article 5r Regulation (EU) 833/2014 introduces reporting obligations for money transfers of more than EUR 100,000 to countries outside the EU.

These apply to all legal persons, entities or bodies established in the EU whose proprietary rights are owned for more than 40% by a Russian company, a Russian national or a natural person residing in Russia.

VIII.

Expanded import restrictions for iron and steel products In our articles on the tenth sanctions package ( 1 March 2023 ) and eleventh sanctions package ( 28 June 2023 ), we already reported on the import restrictions on iron and steel products processed in a third country using iron and steel products listed in Annex XVII of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 originating in Russia, which were introduced with the tenth sanctions package but only came into force on 30 September 2023.

The EU has since clarified the practical implementation of this import restriction by providing FAQs on Articles 3g, 3i and 3o of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, thereby creating more certainty for the companies affected.

The EU has, in particular, made it clear that a so-called Mill Test Certificate (MTC) is sufficient to comply with the obligation introduced by the eleventh sanctions package to provide proof of the country of origin of the iron and steel pre-products used to process the product in a third country.

However, national authorities are free to accept other documents as proof of origin.

The German customs authorities have since announced that they will also accept invoices, delivery notes, quality certificates, long-term supplier declarations, calculation and production documents, customs documents of the exporting country, business correspondence, production descriptions, manufacturer’s declarations or exclusion clauses in purchase contracts that show the non-Russian origin of the primary products.

Under the twelfth sanctions package, such proof is not required if products are imported from one of the partner countries listed in Annex XXXVI (currently Switzerland and Norway).

IX.

Personal sanctions The EU has added another 61 individuals and 86 entities to the list of personal sanctions .

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons listed in Annex I; it also prohibits the provision (including indirect provision) of funds or economic resources to sanctioned individuals or entities (see our articles of 7 March 2022 , 12 April 2022 and 9 June 2022 ).

The scope of application of personal sanctions has also been expanded under the twelfth sanctions package: The name of a natural person may now remain on the sanctions list in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 269/2014 even after their death if the objectives of the EU’s restrictive measures would be jeopardised by the removal of this person from the list, i.e. the assets would otherwise probably be used to finance the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.

It also includes further exemptions from the asset freeze aimed at enabling the sale or use of shares in or assets of an entity established in Russia if a EU entity’s ownership of such an entity is affected by a forced transfer by the Russian government, and enabling the termination of contracts concluded with a newly listed organisation."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: TWELFTH PACKAGE OF EU SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"Russia’s countermeasures In response to the EU’s eleventh sanctions package, Russia has adopted further measures aimed, among other things, at making it more difficult for Western companies to withdraw from the Russian market and protecting its capital market.

For example, a government declaration was issued in July 2023 introducing new requirements for the existing authorisation obligations affecting foreign investors.

This concerns the sale of shares in Russian companies by a foreign person and the distribution of dividends from Russian companies to foreign persons.

A recently published presidential decree also tightens the previously established procedure for authorising transactions between Russian residents and foreign persons from “unfriendly states” (including all EU Member States).

This will also apply to certain transactions involving intellectual property, which will then require authorisation from the Government Commission for the Control of Foreign Investment in Russia.

This can be seen as a response to the EU’s intellectual property-related sanctions introduced with the eleventh package.

Outlook

The twelfth sanctions package introduces yet another range of new measures that companies must implement.

This applies in particular to the newly created obligation to use re-exportation clauses prohibiting buyers from transferring certain goods to Russia.

This is likely to be of particular relevance, as it must also be met by those companies that do not (or no longer) have direct business with Russia and (with the exception of a few partner countries) applies to all third-country transactions.

The exemption of industrial diamonds from the scope of the import ban on natural diamonds will certainly make it easier for the industry to deal with the new ban on diamond imports.

For the remaining new import bans (e.g. copper and aluminium wire), the EU has refrained from restricting the import of products processed in third countries.

As with the previous sanctions packages, the EU is ramping up its efforts to prevent circumvention of the sanctions and increase their effectiveness – extending transit bans, in particular, and adapting the oil price cap rules.

Companies must therefore continue to closely monitor developments at EU level to keep track of the complicated web of EU and US sanctions as well as Russian countersanctions and to adapt their business operations accordingly.

The ongoing Russian war of aggression means that there is currently no end in sight to the sanctions, and further sanctions packages and thus further changes to the legal situation are to be expected."
Gleiss Lutz,CANNABIS LEGALISATION “LIGHT”,"On 12 April 2023, the Federal Government presented a key proposals paper on legalisation of cannabis for recreational purposes which was substantially revised from its earlier draft.

Full legalisation is off the table. 

The paper envisages two pillars of cannabis legalisation.

Pillar 1: Higher limits for personal consumption / “cannabis social clubs”

The first pillar contains the following provisions: Non-profit associations (“cannabis clubs”), with a maximum of 500 members 18 years of age and older, may collectively cultivate cannabis for recreational purposes and supply it only to members for their own consumption.

These clubs will be under the supervision of the state authorities.

A maximum of 25 grams of cannabis per day and 50 grams per month may be dispensed to each member.

People under 21 years of age may only receive a maximum of 30 grams per month.

Consumption will not be permitted in the club rooms (alcohol will also be prohibited).

The clubs will have to maintain a minimum distance from schools and day-care centres and consuming cannabis will be prohibited in their vicinity.

Consumption of cannabis in pedestrian zones before 20:00 will not be allowed.

The clubs may provide their members with a maximum of seven seeds or five cuttings for self-cultivation.

Possession of up to 25 grams of cannabis for recreational use will remain exempt from punishment.

Minors who are caught with cannabis will have to participate in intervention and prevention programmes.

In the future, each adult will generally be allowed to have three cannabis plants for home cultivation.

The limits for use while driving will be reviewed with input from specialist committees.

Evaluation after four years.

Pillar 2: Commercial model projects (bill expected in the autumn of 2023)

As part of the second pillar , “commercial supply chains” are to be tested in model projects in districts and cities of several federal states.

For five years, companies are to be allowed to produce, distribute and sell cannabis for recreational purposes to adults in licensed specialist retail stores.

The model will be scientifically monitored and the findings will be provided to the EU Commission as well.

The possibility of permitting distribution of edibles (e.g. biscuits or cakes containing cannabis) subject to strict conditions is currently being reviewed.

No timetable for implementing the second pillar has been announced.

According to Federal Health Minister Lauterbach, however, an initial bill can be expected in the autumn of 2023.

Next steps In the course of implementing the new two-pillar model, the Federal Government will invoke – vis-à-vis the relevant UN bodies – the interpretive declaration made in 1993 upon ratification of the 1988 UN Convention and issue a statement declaring the project to be compatible with the purpose and legal requirements of the UN Conventions.

Moreover, the Federal Government has announced that alongside the national implementation, it will continue with its efforts to persuade European partners to align with the more liberal approaches of the original key proposals paper, while assessing the possibility that a sufficient number of EU Member States will take the initiative to make the EU legal framework more flexible and develop it further.

Consequences for cannabis distribution in Germany In contrast to what is stipulated in the coalition agreement, no comprehensive legalisation will be adopted.

Nevertheless, cannabis will become more available in the population as a whole which, from a purely objective standpoint, is also likely to have an impact on law enforcement.

But commercial production and distribution of cannabis will still only be possible for medical purposes ( article of 2 December 2022 ).

However, it is also conceivable that for chronically ill patients, membership in a “social club” will eliminate their need to obtain prescriptions for medical cannabis."
Gleiss Lutz,CANNABIS LEGALISATION “LIGHT”,"However, it is also conceivable that for chronically ill patients, membership in a “social club” will eliminate their need to obtain prescriptions for medical cannabis.

It is very likely that it will only be possible to dispense commercially produced/imported cannabis in licensed shops in the course of implementing the model projects involved in the “second pillar”.

It is unclear when these model projects will commence.

According to Federal Health Minister Lauterbach, a corresponding bill is planned for autumn 2023."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FIGHT FOR ENERGY AND POSSIBLE CIVIL LAW CONSEQUENCES IN GERMANY,"The last few months have seen a sharp reduction in gas supplies from Russia, which at times have ceased altogether.

The resulting fight for energy is on everyone’s lips, and the subject of numerous political and regulatory measures.

Inevitably, the ensuing substantial rise in energy costs has led to discussions on how this impacts contractual relationships along company supply chains, in particular in the form of price increases, adjustments to contracts, or rights to refuse performance.

This article looks at possible consequences for civil law and litigation in Germany under the country’s Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , “BGB”) and Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung , “ZPO”).

Special rules apply to specific industries in Germany, one example being the current approval requirement in section 27 of the Energy Security Act ( Energiesicherungsgesetz , “EnSiG”) for gas suppliers’ rights to refuse performance because gas supplies have ceased or been reduced.

Such rules, however, fall outside this article’s scope.

I. Price adjustments 1.

Price increases as grounds for requesting a contract adjustment under section 313 BGB Legally, a price increase owing to a sharp rise in energy prices may constitute legitimate grounds for a request to adjust a contract under section 313(1) BGB.

For a contract or price to be successfully adjusted on this basis, there needs to have been a change to the contractual basis of sufficient gravity that the parties would not have concluded the contract in that form or at all if they had been able to predict this change, and that adhering to the contract would be unreasonable.

A key criterion for such a request to be successful is that the threshold of risk that the obligated party can be expected to tolerate has been exceeded.

In general, section 313 BGB is not applicable where frustration of the contract results in a risk that the party seeking an adjustment to the contract is in fact obliged to bear, given how risks are allocated between the contracting parties.

As a general rule, the seller or supplier of tangible goods must bear the risks of procurement and the entailing risk of rising production costs (including price increases in raw, primary, auxiliary or operating materials, as well as a rise in manufacturing and logistics costs).

In particular, this applies where the contract includes a fixed price that is to be understood as a price guarantee in the relationship with the customer.

An example of this is a recently published decision by Düsseldorf Regional Court on an injunction sought by a regional consumer rights association ( Verbraucherzentrale NRW) in a B2C context (Düsseldorf Regional Court, decision of 26 August 2022, case no. 12 O 247/22).

The same generally applies where parties have included index clauses in their contract.

Such a clause is evidence that the parties have recognised the issue of increasing production costs and may in fact have settled the matter once and for all.

In this context, a further criterion for courts is whether the parties have hedged against the risk of increasing production costs or whether such hedging would at least have been customary in business.

Should this be the case, there will generally be little scope for application of section 313 BGB.

This applies as well where the circumstances increasing the prices already existed when the contract was concluded (for example after the start of the war in Ukraine).

An exception to these principles may apply where the party seeking the adjustment faces a threat to its existence.

The individual circumstances must be reviewed in each case.

Even if a request to adjust a contract is justified in an individual case, the adjustment must not overcompensate for the losses incurred.

On the contrary, the contract may only be adjusted up to the point where rendering performance just becomes reasonable again.

In most cases, therefore, the extra costs will not be fully compensated for."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FIGHT FOR ENERGY AND POSSIBLE CIVIL LAW CONSEQUENCES IN GERMANY,"In most cases, therefore, the extra costs will not be fully compensated for.

Litigation-wise, an action can be brought for the adjusted performance directly.

The court then reviews the adjustment under section 313 BGB accordingly.

2.

Price adjustment rights in contracts – unilateral rights to specify performance under section 315 BGB Depending on how an adjustment clause is designed in the contract, another mechanism for adjusting prices may be to specify performance unilaterally under section 315 BGB.

This is the case where there is a corresponding contractual agreement to the supplier’s benefit and such agreement is permissible (e.g. under the law on general terms and conditions, where applicable).

In this scenario, a party may specify performance at its reasonably exercised discretion (section 315(1) BGB).

Increasing prices under a supply agreement because procurement costs have risen may be equitable insofar as falling costs elsewhere do not compensate for this.

In any event, the equitable limit is probably exceeded where the unilaterally set price exceeds the increase in procurement costs (i.e. in these cases the rise in energy prices).

If the obligee (i.e. the supplier in these cases) exercises its right to unilaterally specify prices, and the obligor finds grounds to argue that this constitutes an unreasonable price increase, the obligor can wait for the obligee to take legal action for performance.

In the course of such legal action, the court will be checking whether a price increase is equitable under section 315(3) BGB.

However, the obligor can itself bring an action for a judicial modification of contract ( Gestaltungsklage ) under section 315(3), sentence 2 BGB, i.e. for the court to itself specify an equitable performance (section 315(3), 1st half of sentence BGB).

This may be the case, for example, where the obligor considers that the level of the price increase is excessive, while recognizing that a price increase owing to the rise in energy prices is generally permissible.

II.

Rights to refuse performance vis-à-vis contracting partners Rights to refuse performance are an option in particular where a request to adjust a price is denied (see 1.), or where the Bundesnetzagentur for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway (“ Bundesnetzagentur ”) orders that certain consumption points be disconnected (see 2.).

1.

Where a request to adjust prices is made Alongside such requests to adjust prices, there is also the issue of rights to refuse performance vis-à-vis contracting partners, given the energy crisis.

Supplier and customer perspectives need to be differentiated here: From the supplier ’s perspective, the first issue is how to handle deliveries under a contract where, for example, the contracting partner does not agree to the supplier’s request (justified in its view) to adjust prices under section 313(1) BGB or rejects a unilateral specification of prices under section 315(1) BGB.

The supplier may now consider stopping deliveries, but only in a few cases is there going to be a reliable legal basis for this.

Increased production costs due to a rise in energy prices do not allow the supplier to refuse performance under section 275 BGB on the grounds that such performance is (economically) impossible.

Except where relevant contractual provisions have been made, these cases must be resolved according to the principles of ceased basis of the transaction under section 313(1) BGB (see above).

If the contractual provisions stipulate that the supplier has to perform in advance of payment, then refusing performance under section 321 BGB is an option if it is evident that the supplier’s claim to payment is at risk because the customer lacks the means to pay.

Where there are grounds to deem a customer insolvent under section 17 et seq.

Insolvency Code ( Insolvenzordnung , “InsO”), this criterion will frequently be met."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FIGHT FOR ENERGY AND POSSIBLE CIVIL LAW CONSEQUENCES IN GERMANY,"Where there are grounds to deem a customer insolvent under section 17 et seq.

Insolvency Code ( Insolvenzordnung , “InsO”), this criterion will frequently be met.

With regard to overindebtedness as grounds for insolvency (section 19 InsO), it should also be noted here that legislators wish to reduce the timeframe of the going concern forecast from twelve to four months.

Irrespective of the forecast’s timeframe, however, the customer’s ability to satisfy the claim when it becomes due, and to do so with sufficient likelihood, is likely to be crucial to the right to refuse performance under section 321 BGB.

Generally, therefore, litigation will be the only way to enforce the price increase asserted should the parties fail to reach agreement.

Only in narrowly defined cases will interim relief be possible by way of a preliminary injunction for continued performance ( Leistungsverfügung ) under section 940 ZPO.

Under section 1033 ZPO, this is also possible where the parties have agreed an arbitration clause.

For the matter to have the requisite urgency (known as grounds for the injunction), the supplier must be reliant on its claim to payment being immediately satisfied, the payment must be due in the near future, and the negative consequences of non-payment must be severe and disproportionate to the loss incurred by the customer.

Generally speaking, it will be possible to meet these criteria only where a company is in an existential economic plight.

From the customer ’s perspective, a preliminary injunction under section 940 ZPO for continued deliveries may be appropriate where the supplier stops deliveries (unjustifiably so in the customer’s view).

Here too, the grounds for the injunction are subject to strict requirements.

As a whole, however, they will be slightly easier to substantiate than those from the supplier’s perspective.

Where there is a threat of a production stoppage, for example, the grounds for the injunction may only result from such stoppage likely entailing economic consequences severe enough that the customer cannot be expected to sue the supplier in court and/or later assert claims for damages.

In weighing up these interests, another factor is the legal position regarding the claim to an injunction and how clear that position is.

2. Where the Bundesnetzagentur orders disconnection If the supply situation worsens, Germany’s Federal Government can trigger the emergency level as the final level of the country’s gas emergency plan.

The Bundesnetzagentur would then assume the role of “federal load distributor”, allowing it to order the partial or complete disconnection of the gas supply to certain consumption points.

Should the supplier (e.g. an energy-intensive company) be affected by such a Bundesnetzagentur order and have to stop production, objective impossibility under section 275(1) BGB is likely to be given.

In principle, therefore, the supplier would be entitled to refuse to supply its customer for as long as the disconnection lasts; in return, the supplier would have no claim to payment over this period under section 326(1) BGB.

It is possible that the supplier can still supply some of its contracting partners (e.g. because the Bundesnetzagentur only partially reduces energy quantities over a certain period, or because the supplier can produce its own electricity from other fuel and this suffices for part of the production, or because stocks exist, or for some other reason).

The question that then immediately arises is which customers may or even must be supplied primarily.

The Bundesnetzagentur may itself have included a condition in its disconnection order whereby with the remaining capacity only customers may be supplied which in turn contribute to maintaining essential sectors.

We will need to wait and see how specifically the Bundesnetzagentur structures individual orders or a general order, should such orders be issued."
Gleiss Lutz,THE FIGHT FOR ENERGY AND POSSIBLE CIVIL LAW CONSEQUENCES IN GERMANY,"We will need to wait and see how specifically the Bundesnetzagentur structures individual orders or a general order, should such orders be issued.

If the Bundesnetzagentur does not make any stipulations, in general a multiple obligation does not mean that performance is legally impossible (section 275(1) BGB).

Impossibility arises only when the quantity of supplies an obligor provides to one of the obligees, for example, is such that it can indeed no longer supply the other obligees.

Based on the principle of privity of contract, the supplier is fundamentally free to decide which obligee to supply.

But there is a risk that obligees who receive no deliveries will claim damages from the supplier (see below).

Accordingly, which customer to supply is also a matter for the supplier’s risk assessment.

III.

Claims for damages due to non-delivery or default In cases of non-delivery or default on the supplier’s part, the customer may also bring claims for damages owing to impossibility of performance, non-delivery although delivery was possible, or default (section 280(1) and (3), 281, 283 or section 280(4) and 286 BGB).

If the supplier has wrongly relied on a right to refuse performance, for example, this may constitute a breach of duty and entail responsibility.

The customer would then have to be compensated for the losses it incurred owing to non-delivery.

Such losses can be considerable, for example where the customer’s production line stops, and may put the supplier’s existence at risk where it has unjustifiably refused performance.

It is therefore crucial to carefully check the risk of damages should deliveries be stopped unjustifiably.

The situation is different where a supplier fails to deliver because the Bundesnetzagentur issued a disconnection order and the supplier itself had no electricity available for production, for example.

Although this would constitute impossibility of performance under section 275(1) BGB, the supplier will not usually need to bear responsibility for this.

There is a possible exception to this if the supplier had been able to take precautions against this scenario.

And the situation may be different again if the supplier makes deliveries to only one of several customers.

In this case, a claim for damages is an option for the customers who did not receive deliveries.

Our comments above apply to the scope of possible losses.

IV.

Conclusion and recommended action As a result of the energy crisis, companies are already facing a multitude of challenges, which will only increase in future.

These challenges range from internal “supply chain screenings” of numerous contractual provisions, to finding the strategically correct communication with contracting partners, through to what are likely to be major disputes regarding the essential resource of energy.

Companies should now be reviewing their contractual provisions to see whether price adjustment mechanisms are possible, and if so which ones, clustering them according to whether the company may face requests to adjust prices or itself wishes to assert such requests, should it need to pass on price increases to its customers, for example.

Given the sharp rise in energy prices and the fraught prospects for the coming winter, one thing appears to be clear: further energy disputes are on their way.

Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ACT NOW IN FORCE,"Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2023 on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data (“Data Act”) came into force on 11 January 2024 and represents an important step towards realising the European data strategy.

The stated goal of the new Regulation is to remove barriers to accessing data, while creating incentives for investing in data generation.

Background In less than two years after the Commission presented an initial draft ( article of 9 March 202 2 ), the Data Act has now come into force following numerous – and sometimes substantial – amendments during the legislative process, most recently in the trilogue negotiations.

Although the majority of the provisions of the Data Act will apply from 12 September 2025 or 12 September 2026 (product design obligations), respectively, some already require action now.

A core element of the Data Act is to grant users (or third parties designated by them) access across all sectors to data generated by their connected products (Internet of Things or IoT products ) and related services.

Data holders will only be able to use and exploit non-personal data generated by IoT products on the basis of a contractual agreement with the user.

This gives users control over data generated by IoT products, even if it is not intended to create “data ownership”.

Personal data may still (only) be used to the extent permitted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), so a certain degree of complex overlap between the Data Act and the GDPR seems inevitable.

Other areas covered by the Data Act include in particular: Data holders’ rights to use data Product design obligations for manufacturers of IoT products Unfairness test for general terms and conditions in B2B data use contracts Rights for public sector bodies to access data in situations of exceptional need Provisions to facilitate switching between data processing services Safeguards for international access to and transfer of non-personal data Requirements for the interoperabilit y of data spaces and data services The Data Act covers both personal and non-personal data, but makes it clear that the level of protection created by existing data protection regulations, in particular the GDPR, should not be lowered.

Other specialised legal provisions – with the exception of database law – are also unaffected.

Users’ right to access data generated by IoT products According to Article 4(1), the user of an IoT product is entitled to demand that the data holder make “readily available” data accessible to it without undue delay, of the same quality as is available to the data holder, easily, securely, free of charge, in a comprehensive, structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and, where relevant and technically feasible, continuously and in real time.

The Data Act provides definitions for most terms, including “user”, “data holder”, “connected product” (here also IoT product) and “product data”.

However, some of these definitions are not entirely clear.

A connected product is an item that obtains, generates or collects data concerning its use or environment and that is able to communicate product data (e.g. via on-device access or a Wi-Fi connection) (Article 2 (5) Data Act).

This includes, for example, fitness trackers, smartwatches, connected vehicles, driver assistance and navigation systems, video game consoles, smartphones and connected kitchen and household appliances.

It does not cover products and modules that do not permit the transfer of data and items whose main function is to store third-party data (this excludes servers in particular).

Product data are data generated by the use of a connected product that the manufacturer designed to be retrievable (Article 2 (15) Data Act)."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ACT NOW IN FORCE,"Product data are data generated by the use of a connected product that the manufacturer designed to be retrievable (Article 2 (15) Data Act).

However, users are only entitled to access “ readily available data ” (Article 2 (17) Data Act), i.e. data that the data holder can obtain without disproportionate effort going beyond a simple operation.

This includes not only raw data, but also pre-processed data (e.g. physical quantities such as temperature, oil pressure, speed, position) and metadata.

By contrast, information inferred or derived from such data is no longer regarded as product data and therefore does not fall under the right of access.

Such information includes the results of processing such data, for example using proprietary algorithms obtained by making additional investments (e.g. the interpretation of speed data).

In some cases, it will be difficult to draw the line between data that are covered by the Act and data that are not.

According to the somewhat misleading definition, a data holder is any person who has the right or obligation to use and make available data (Article 2 (13) Data Act).

The definition can only be understood to mean that the data holder is the person who has actual control over the data and is in a position to grant the access under the Data Act.

This was clarified by the amendments proposed during the legislative process, but these were unfortunately not included in the final text.

Finally, a user is any person who owns a connected product or to whom temporary rights to use that connected product have been contractually transferred (Article 2, point (12) Data Act).

Users can therefore be owners, co-owners or renters, for example.

Persons who only use a product for a time (e.g. family members) are not deemed to be users, however.

The data should be made available to the user free of charge.

However, it is unclear whether the data holder must transmit the data or whether it is sufficient for the data to be made accessible to the user on the data holder’s own server (in this direction, cf. recital 22).

Also, the Data Act does not define the term “make available”.

Unlike in the case of the data holder (see below), the Data Act imposes almost no restrictions on the user’s right to use of the data to be made available .

The data may therefore essentially be used for all legal purposes, except for the development of competing products.

Data holders’ rights of use Data holders’ rights of use will be restricted under the Data Act to the extent that they will only be able to use non-personal data on the basis of a contract with the user (Article 4(13) Data Act).

However, there is nothing to stop data holders from making the use of a product dependent on the user having been granted a right of use.

That said, it will probably no longer be possible to grant exclusive rights of use, at least not in general terms and conditions.

In the case of personal data , however, nothing will change – data holders may only use such data in compliance with data protection regulations (in particular the GDPR).

Third parties’ rights to access and use data The Data Act does not grant third parties who are not users a direct right to access a data holder’s data .

At the request of a user , however, the data holder must make the data available to any third party – which may also include a competitor of the data holder, but excludes any gatekeepers within the meaning of the Digital Markets Act (Article 5(1) Data Act).

Third parties may nevertheless demand access to the data on behalf of a user.

Such third parties may be providers of a service (e.g. a garage that approaches a vehicle manufacturer about data on behalf of a driver) or data intermediaries that demand access to data on behalf of a large number of users.

Whereas data is made available free of charge directly to a user, the transmission of data from a data holder to a third party is not free of charge."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ACT NOW IN FORCE,"Whereas data is made available free of charge directly to a user, the transmission of data from a data holder to a third party is not free of charge.

The data holder must make the data available to the data recipient under FRAND terms and conditions (“ F air, R easonable a nd N on-

D iscriminatory”).

The data holder can therefore demand reasonable remuneration from the data recipient, the amount of which is calculated on the basis of the costs incurred in making the data available, the investment costs and a reasonable margin (Article 9(1) Data Act).

The scope of the data recipient’s rights of use depends on the contractual agreement with the user.

The data recipient must erase the data when they are no longer necessary for the purpose agreed with the user (Article 6(1) Data Act).

If the data recipient is a microenterprise, a small or medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) or a not-for-profit research organisation, the remuneration may not include a margin.

The Commission will adopt guidelines on the calculation of reasonable remuneration.

Following the “compliance by design” approach, the Data Act requires manufacturers of IoT products and providers of related services to design and manufacture/provide their products and services in such a way that the obligations to make data available laid down by law can be fulfilled (Article 3(1) Data Act).

Unfairness test for general terms and conditions in data use contracts Another important aspect of the Data Act is the introduction of an unfairness test for general terms and conditions in B2B relations for “unilaterally imposed” provisions relating to data access and data use.

Contrary to what was still envisaged by the Commission’s draft, the rules on unfair contractual terms not only applies to clauses unilaterally imposed on an SME, but also to the field of B2B in general.

A clause is to be regarded as “unilaterally imposed” if it is introduced by one of the contracting parties and its content cannot be influenced by the other contracting party despite attempts to negotiate it.

In this case, the burden of proof is on the party imposing the clause (Article 13(5), sentence 2 Data Act).

Some of the prohibited clauses listed in Article 13 Data Act are already covered by German law on general terms and conditions, which means that companies need not expect major changes.

However, the data-related provisions may be of considerable importance for existing and future contracts in a data context.

According to the catch-all provision in Article 13(3) Data Act, a standard term can be considered unfair if its use grossly deviates from good commercial practice in data access and use, contrary to good faith and fair dealing.

In addition, Article 13 Data Act distinguishes between “black” and “grey” clauses (even though the German translation of the Data Act does not make such a distinction, and will therefore presumably have to be amended): The “black clauses” listed in Article 13(4) Data Act are always considered to be unfair (shall be unfair).

These include, in particular, clauses that give the user the right to determine whether the data supplied are in conformity with the contract.

The “grey clauses” listed in Article 13(5) Data Act are presumed to be unfair.

For instance, these include clauses (i) that allow the user to access and use the data of the other contracting party in a manner that significantly impairs the legitimate interests of the other contracting party – for example, in the case of commercially sensitive data or if data are protected as trade secrets or intellectual property, (ii) that prevent the contracting party from making use of the data provided by that party in an adequate manner, or (iii) that prevent the contracting party from obtaining a copy of the data provided or generated by that party during the term of the contract or within a reasonable period after the termination thereof."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ACT NOW IN FORCE,"However, a clause is to be regarded as unilaterally imposed only if it is introduced by one of the contracting parties and its content cannot be influenced by the other contracting party despite attempts to negotiate it.

In this case, the burden of proof is on the party imposing the clause (Article 13(5), sentence 2 Data Act).

Before 12 September 2025, the Commission will develop and recommend non-binding model contractual terms on data access and use (Article 41 Data Act).

The unfairness test for general terms and conditions under Article 13 Data Act applies to new contracts that are concluded after 12 September 2025 .

The unfairness test will also apply to old contracts (i.e. contracts concluded on or before 12 September 2025) from 12 September 2027 , provided that these contracts provide for an indefinite term or are due to expire 10 years from 11 January 2024 at the earliest.

This means that companies need to comply with the requirements of the unfairness test for general terms and conditions now when concluding new contracts with an indefinite term or with a term of more than 10 years.

Dealing with trade secrets The protection of trade secrets was hotly debated during the legislative process.

The Data Act does not answer the question of when data actually constitutes trade secrets.

However, there is no denying the risk that a large amount of aggregated data can, for example, be used to determine how a device works or to uncover other trade secrets.

However, according to the Data Act, the mere classification of data as trade secrets does not exclude the obligation to grant rights to access and use data.

The Regulation takes the approach of ensuring protection through technical and organisational measures (TOMs) that must be agreed.

According to Article 4(6) Data Act, trade secrets therefore only have to be disclosed to users and data recipients if all necessary measures have been taken beforehand to preserve their confidentiality.

This includes technical and organisational measures, especially non-disclosure agreements or in situ access to the data.

If data recipients or other third parties do not comply with the agreed measures, they must, at the request of the data holder or trade secret holder, (i) erase the data, (ii) withdraw from the market goods produced on the basis of the data, and/or (iii) where this is appropriate in light of the interests of the data holder or user, inform the user of the unauthorised disclosure and pay compensation to the injured party (Article 11(2) Data Act)  .

The same obligations apply to a user who alters or removes the technical protection measures or does not maintain the technical and organisational measures agreed with the data holder or trade secrets holder.

The data holder can only refuse to grant access to data in exceptional circumstances, namely if it is able to demonstrate that, despite compliance with the TOMs by the user or third party, serious economic damage is highly likely to result from the disclosure of trade secrets.

The data holder must duly substantiate its refusal in writing without undue delay on the basis of objective elements and notify the competent national authority.

Such elements include, in particular, the lack of protection of trade secrets in third countries, the nature and level of confidentiality of the data requested, the uniqueness and novelty of the product as well as a negative impact on cybersecurity.

The requirements for refusing access are therefore very high, which means that they are very difficult to fulfil in practice.

The Data Act thus attaches more importance to the right of disclosure than to the protection of trade secrets.

Conclusion It remains to be seen to what extent the Data Act will actually unlock the potential of the data generated in the EU.

Foreign product manufacturers are following the developments relating to the new Data Act with both interest and concern."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA ACT NOW IN FORCE,"Foreign product manufacturers are following the developments relating to the new Data Act with both interest and concern.

Should the Regulation achieve its intended effects, it can certainly serve as a blueprint for future legislation in countries outside of Europe.

For IoT companies, however, the Data Act will require considerable effort when it comes to compliance and execution.

Simply identifying product data that, from 12 September 2025, must be disclosed to users and data recipients on request will pose a challenge for many businesses.

And companies already have to keep an eye on the contract design requirements outlined above as well as – given the long development cycles – the product design obligations contained in the Data Act."
Gleiss Lutz,PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES IN LONG-TERM B2B ENERGY SUPPLY CONTRACTS: IS THERE A WAVE OF LAWSUITS LOOMING?,"The recent price increases on wholesale markets for electricity and gas – caused by the Ukraine war – have led to across-the-board price hikes for existing energy supply contracts.

Unsurprisingly, this development has already resulted in legal disputes, and the first lawsuits on the compatibility of price adjustments with price guarantees issued in the B2C sector have already been decided by the regional courts.

In the B2B sector, the number of disputes about the permissibility of contractually agreed price adjustments is also likely to increase.

For long-term gas supply contracts, for example, suppliers with agreements to supply customers at prices linked to those for heating oil – a practice previously widespread – are facing particular economic pressure because import prices for heating oil have recently lagged significantly behind producer prices for natural gas.

In the electricity sector, the sharp rise in prices is likely to incentivise having the validity of pricing clauses reviewed by (arbitration) courts.

This may affect contracts for (virtual) power plant slices (capacity leases) and power purchase agreements (PPAs) concluded for the long-term marketing of renewable power plants.

Starting points for legal action might in particular include the requirements of the Price Clause Act ( Preisklauselgesetz , “PrKG”) and – in the case of pre-formulated price clauses – of the law governing general terms and conditions (section 305 et seq.

Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , “BGB”).

Price adjustment clauses have been among the most contentious elements of energy supply contracts since the liberalisation of energy markets began.

Since 2008, the Federal Court of Justice has handed down around 20 decisions on this issue relating to the supply of gas and electricity – but many practical questions remain unanswered.

Basic types of price adjustment clause The extent to which a price adjustment clause can be legally challenged depends on its type.

A distinction must generally be made between price reservation clauses under section 315 BGB and index clauses: In price reservation clauses (also referred to as performance reservation clauses), suppliers reserve the right to unilaterally adjust pricing at their reasonable discretion.

These clauses typically regulate the reason, the conditions and the scope of a price adjustment in general terms, but not the specific cost factors.

Index clauses , however, are often structured as mathematical formulas and result in automatic price adjustment at regular intervals.

Alongside fixed values, the formulae also contain an index component based on the import or spot prices for energy carriers and products, CO2 certificate prices, or the development of wages and salaries.

In electricity supply contracts, for example, so-called “coal-wage clauses” were widespread before energy market liberalisation – whereas today, reference is often made to spot market quotations.

Distinction must be made between two different forms of index clause:

Cost component clauses are used to pass on increases or decreases in the cost of providing the contractual service.

Reference price clauses are based on a reference price taken as a measure of the value relationship between performance and consideration (for example, the price of heating oil as a measure of the value of the supply of natural gas) – irrespective of cost.

Usually, changes in sovereign costs (taxes, levies, or other charges) and network charges are passed on to the customer in full using a separate price adjustment clause.

Compatibility with the PrKG The PrKG restricts the ability of market participants to make price adjustments, preventing inflationary spirals and maintaining price stability.

It generally prohibits escalation clauses, with some exceptions."
Gleiss Lutz,PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES IN LONG-TERM B2B ENERGY SUPPLY CONTRACTS: IS THERE A WAVE OF LAWSUITS LOOMING?,"It generally prohibits escalation clauses, with some exceptions.

According to the prohibition on price clauses – which applies to both individual agreements and pre-formulated clauses – the amount of monetary debts may not be directly and automatically determined by the price or value of other goods or services that are not comparable to the agreed goods or services (section 1(1) PrKG).

The prohibition does not apply to the following clauses often used in energy supply contracts: Performance reservation clauses, where the party entitled to determine the price can use its reasonable discretion in adjusting this (section 1(2), no. 1 PrKG);

Price reference clauses, where the linked goods or services are essentially similar or at least comparable (section 1(2), no. 2 PrKG), and Cost component clauses, if the changes in price or value taken into account directly influence the costs incurred by the creditor to provide the consideration (section 1(2), no. 3 PrKG).

Price adjustment clauses that violate the prohibition on price clauses are invalid.

But the price clause only actually becomes invalid once this has been determined by a court (section 8 PrKG), and the previous legal effects of the price clause are not affected by this.

The parties to an energy supply contract can therefore argue that a price adjustment clause should be invalidated because it violates the prohibition on price clauses, provided that no exceptional circumstances apply: The reservation of a right of the energy supplier to specify performance pursuant to section 315 BGB for an electricity or gas price is, however, generally unproblematic under the PrKG, because it allows decisions to be made using reasonable discretion.

Doubts about the validity of the clause under the law governing prices could in particular arise if the clause does not make it clear that price adjustments must be made “using reasonable discretion” and that section 315 BGB applies.

If price reference clauses are used, the similarity/comparability of the reference product must be clearly established in each individual case.

The Federal Court of Justice has not yet ruled on whether it is permissible to link the gas price to changes in the price of light heating oil.

While the majority of legal commentators agree that these are comparable products based on assumed substitutability, the case law of the higher courts is inconsistent – and the recent differences in how heating oil and gas prices have changed are likely to rekindle the discussion.

When it comes to cost component clauses , the question is whether the referenced costs are actually incurred in connection with the contractually owed performance .

According to Munich Higher Regional Court, this requirement is not met if the electricity price is linked to changes in the average price of imported coal, but the contract does not cover the supply of electricity from a coal-fired power plant.

Is the price adjustment permissible under the law governing general terms and conditions?

The test of fairness and reasonableness under the law governing general terms and conditions is generally carried out independently of the review of the price clause prohibition.

Even a contract structure permitted by the PrKG does not prevent a further test of fairness and reasonableness under section 309, no. 1 BGB or section 307(1), sentence 1 BGB given the different legal purposes of the PrKG (monetary policy objectives) and section 305 et seq.

BGB (protection of the contracting partner against unreasonable disadvantage).

Conversely, a clause that violates the PrKG but whose invalidity has not yet been determined by a court pursuant to section 8 PrKG may withstand a test of fairness and reasonableness under section 307 et seq.

BGB.

In the case of price reservation clauses , the reason and the prerequisites for as well as the scope of the price adjustment must be specified in sufficient detail in the clause."
Gleiss Lutz,PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES IN LONG-TERM B2B ENERGY SUPPLY CONTRACTS: IS THERE A WAVE OF LAWSUITS LOOMING?,"BGB.

In the case of price reservation clauses , the reason and the prerequisites for as well as the scope of the price adjustment must be specified in sufficient detail in the clause.

The Federal Court of Justice has yet to fully clarify what practical requirements apply in this respect in B2B transactions.

Businesses wishing to avoid legal problems have in the past often relied on provisions of the Basic Supply Regulations (section 5(2) Basic Gas Supply Regulation ( Gasgrundversorgungsverordnung , “GasGVV”)/Basic Electricity Supply Regulation ( Stromgrundversorgungsverordnung , “StromGVV”), but it is doubtful whether these can be used as a model for B2B contracts.

In the electricity sector, the Federal Court of Justice’s ruling of 25 November 2015 introduced a “safe option” based on the price reservation clause for private customers approved by the Court, which can usually be readily applied to commercial electricity customers.

Particularly in the case of older contracts, businesses should check whether there is anything in case law indicating that the price adjustment clause is invalid.

As an ancillary price agreement, index clauses are subject to the test of fairness and reasonableness under the law governing general terms and conditions as far as future price changes are concerned.

According to section 307(3), sentence 1 BGB, the initial price is not subject to this test, however, even if it is only specified in terms of a formula in the contract.

It is also important to make the following distinction: According to the law governing general terms and conditions , energy suppliers and their customers have a great deal of leeway when agreeing price reference clauses .

While the Federal Court of Justice has ruled that for contracts with consumers, it must be possible to predict that the market price for the performance owed typically undergoes similar changes to the market price for the reference product, it has also held that this does not apply to B2B contracts.

Whether, for example, linking the gas price to the market price for light heating oil – as the reference product – is appropriate and acceptable is entirely for the customer to decide using reasonable business judgement.

The prohibition on price clauses (see above) is generally likely to offer a more promising argument when faced with price adjustments based on a price reference clause.

A cost component clause with a transparent and comprehensible mechanism that applies automatically and covers the main cost factors does not as a rule violate section 307(1), sentence 1 BGB when used between businesses.

But even in B2B contracts, such a clause must not allow the supplier to generate additional profit by passing on specific cost increases – ruling out clauses enabling a cost increase with limited impact to be applied to unaffected price components , for example adjusting the price component for investment costs when only the fuel costs have increased.

Price adjustment clauses must also ensure that adjustments are made for rising and falling prices alike – so no formulae where the price increases when one cost factor goes up but any decrease in the costs in other areas is ignored.

Companies must therefore check whether the price formula accurately reflects material changes in costs.

In B2B contracts, at least, an index clause can be combined with a separate price adjustment provision to pass on price changes mandated by the German government .

Is the individual price adjustment permissible?

Even if the price adjustment clause is valid, customers can ask the court to review the individual price increase.

Where price adjustments are based on cost reservation clauses, they must fulfil all contractual requirements in terms of form and content and be made with reasonably exercised discretion within the meaning of section 315 BGB.

The supplier may in particular justify its price adjustment by citing increased procurement costs."
Gleiss Lutz,PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES IN LONG-TERM B2B ENERGY SUPPLY CONTRACTS: IS THERE A WAVE OF LAWSUITS LOOMING?,"The supplier may in particular justify its price adjustment by citing increased procurement costs.

It must demonstrate and prove that these have gone up, but does not have to disclose how it calculates its total price.

When it comes to index clauses, the supplier only has to provide evidence of the index components needed for the price formula.

Conclusion There are various ways for businesses to challenge price adjustment clauses in court based on the PrKG and the law governing general terms and conditions – and this may be especially worthwhile for older contracts.

The Federal Court of Justice has however clarified a range of questions about the permissibility of price adjustment clauses in recent years, making it possible to draft new contracts that are legally sound.

But the current situation leaves much to be desired, as the legal requirements for price adjustments are still overly complex and affected companies often have no legal certainty.

Simplifying the rules and regulations would be a step in the right direction – starting with abolishing the PrKG, which has been controversial right from the outset.

No other country in the euro area has such a law, and its practical impact on price stability is likely to be negligible.

It is hard to say whether a wave of B2B lawsuits is imminent.

Many long-term energy supply contracts have been replaced by shorter-term, market-oriented procurement in recent years, with price adjustment clauses generally being less important.

How much court time is tied up with this in future will therefore depend on the number of active long-term energy supply contracts that have not yet been brought in line with recent case law"
Gleiss Lutz,MODERNISATION OF GERMAN ARBITRATION LAW MAKING PROGRESS,"On 1 February 2024, the Federal Ministry of Justice published a draft bill for an Act on the modernisation of German arbitration law ( Draft bill of Federal Ministry of Justice | Draft bill for an Act on the modernisation of German arbitration law ).

The draft bill follows on from the white paper of 18 April 2023, which – without proposing any specific wording – had identified issues that were to be harmonised with international developments in arbitration law ( article of 16 May 2023 ).

The draft bill now addresses many of the issues already mentioned in the white paper, leaves out others and adds one new aspect.

However, all of the reform proposals serve the same objectives.

The main goal is to adapt arbitration law to the needs of today’s world, increase its efficiency and, in so doing, make Germany more attractive as an arbitration location.

In the following, we present the provisions contained in the draft bill and their potential effects: Informal, English and digital To ensure that German arbitration can compete internationally as a seat of arbitration, the draft bill provides for a simplification of formal requirements and a modernisation of procedural regulations: Pursuant to draft section 1031(4)

German Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung, “ZPO” )

, it will be possible to conclude arbitration agreements informally if the arbitration agreement is a commercial transaction within the meaning of section 343 Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ) for all parties.

The draft bill sees a practical need for arbitration agreements that do not have to adhere to a certain form, particularly in the case of global supply chains and complex framework agreements.

Since parties have a legitimate interest in documentation, each party will be able to demand that the other party confirm the content of an informally concluded arbitration agreement in textual form.

However, it is hard to imagine this provision being helpful if a dispute over the existence of an arbitration agreement has already arisen.

Draft section 1063b ZPO provides that any document in English that has been prepared or submitted in arbitration proceedings may be submitted, without a translation, in German-language court proceedings in all arbitration matters.

This includes, in particular, enforcement or annulment proceedings, proceedings on the appointment or challenge of an arbitrator as well as proceedings on assistance in the taking of evidence.

Although this saves the parties from having to pay the translation costs that would otherwise be incurred, it implicitly increases the qualification requirements for state court judges.

In addition, the draft bill is intended to clarify what is already common practice, namely that – after hearing the parties – the arbitral tribunal can conduct a video hearing unless the parties have agreed otherwise (draft section 1047(2) ZPO).

As the only addition to the proposals in the white paper, draft section 1054(2)

ZPO provides that it will also be possible to issue the arbitral award as an electronic document .

In this case, each member of the arbitral tribunal must sign the award with his or her qualified electronic signature.

Specialisation, reliability and transparency The draft bill also offers solutions that promote specialisation, reliability and transparency in arbitral proceedings.

It facilitates the concentration of arbitration-related proceedings before the commercial courts .

According to draft section 1062(5) ZPO, the Federal State governments will be authorised to transfer jurisdiction in arbitration matters to the commercial courts if the latter have been established in one Federal State or by several Federal States jointly.

Draft section 1063a

ZPO allows the entire proceedings before the commercial courts to be conducted in English."
Gleiss Lutz,MODERNISATION OF GERMAN ARBITRATION LAW MAKING PROGRESS,"Draft section 1063a

ZPO allows the entire proceedings before the commercial courts to be conducted in English.

However, decisions issued in English will need to be translated into German (draft section 1063a(1) ZPO), without this having any cost implications for the parties.

One of the reasons for this is that it is up to the Federal Court of Justice to decide whether proceedings it hears will be conducted in English (draft section 1065(3) ZPO).

Pursuant to draft section 1063a(3)

ZPO, all of a commercial court’s decisions in arbitration matters will be published in anonymised form (together with the German translation if the decisions were issued in English).

Moreover, draft section 1059a ZPO provides for another new legal remedy for setting aside arbitral awards that is based on actions for a retrial pursuant to section 580 ZPO.

For example, it will be possible to set aside final domestic arbitral awards that have been obtained through bribery or perversion of justice.

To increase transparency in arbitral proceedings and to promote the further development of the law, arbitral tribunals will in future be able to publish arbitral awards in anonymised form pursuant to draft section 1054b ZPO.

Publication is subject to the parties’ consent, which will be deemed to have been given if, after having been asked by the arbitral tribunal for their consent, the parties do not raise an objection to publication within one month.

This legal consequence of tacit consent must of course be explained to each party.

The parties are allowed to agree otherwise at any time.

Draft section 1054b(3)

ZPO also points out that other legal provisions may impose further requirements on the publication of arbitral awards, for example to ensure data protection and safeguard business secrets or privacy rights.

Where court assistance in taking of evidence or the performance of other judicial acts pursuant to section 1050 ZPO are concerned, the white paper envisaged transferring competence from the local courts to the higher regional courts, which are otherwise competent for arbitration matters.

However, this was not addressed in the draft bill.

Legal certainty It is the intent of the draft bill that all of the proposals in the white paper under the heading “legal certainty” be implemented.

This concerns the following points: Under the draft bill, the existing possibility to request that a state court declare the (in)admissibility of arbitral proceedings will be expanded.

Accordingly, a party can choose between only having the court decide on the question of whether the specific subject matter of the dispute falls under the arbitration agreement (currently section 1032(2), sentence 1 ZPO), or having the court issue an explicit decision on the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement that becomes res judicata (draft section 1032(2), sentence 2 ZPO).

Draft section 1040(4), sentence 2 ZPO provides for new grounds for setting aside arbitral awards.

State courts will be able to set aside negative decisions on jurisdiction by arbitral tribunals if they consider the decision to be wrong.

The purpose of this is to ensure that cases for which the arbitral tribunal has declined jurisdiction will in future be treated in the same way as cases for which the arbitral tribunal has assumed jurisdiction.

This gives the claimant an additional option if his or her request for arbitration has already failed due to an (alleged) lack of jurisdiction.

As considered in the white paper, draft section 1054a ZPO now actually wants to explicitly declare separate opinions to be admissible “for the future” , both with respect to the final ruling ( dissenting opinion ) and to the reasoning ( concurring opinion ).

A decision by the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court in 2020 had given rise to doubts about the admissibility of separate opinions in Germany (and internationally), but separate opinions will not be a part of arbitral awards."
Gleiss Lutz,MODERNISATION OF GERMAN ARBITRATION LAW MAKING PROGRESS,"Under the draft bill, it will, however, be possible for the parties to agree otherwise, and this might already need to be taken into account in the arbitration clause.

In complex multi-party arbitration proceedings , all parties will be obliged to cooperate in the appointment of arbitrators .

If a party fails to fulfil this obligation within one month despite being requested to do so, the arbitrator will be appointed by the state court (draft section 1035(4) ZPO).

A more technical clarification the draft bill envisages is that, where a request for a declaration of enforceability is rejected and, at the same time, the arbitral award is set aside pursuant to section 1060(2), sentence 1 ZPO, the state court will be able, upon request of one of the parties, to refer the matter back to the arbitral tribunal (draft section 1060(2), sentence 4 ZPO in conjunction with section 1059(4) ZPO).

The same applies to the possible finding that the decision to set aside the award will cause the arbitration agreement to be revived with respect to the subject matter of the dispute (draft section 1060(2), sentence 4 ZPO in conjunction with section 1059(5) ZPO).

Interim relief There is less focus on interim relief in the draft bill than in the white paper.

The draft bill also comprehensively revises the provision in section 1041(2) ZPO, which regulates the powers of the state court with regard to interim measures of the arbitral tribunal.

In addition to editorial changes and clarifications, draft section 1041(2) ZPO (in conjunction with draft section 1025(1) ZPO) also stipulates that interim relief measures of arbitral tribunals seated abroad will be admissible unless one of the specified grounds for refusal applies.

However, German courts will still be authorised to make an admission of enforcement contingent on the provision of security.

The clarification in draft section 1063(3), sentence 1 ZPO is unlikely to change much about the situation.

According to the new wording, in the context of compulsory enforcement or execution of provisional/protective measures of the arbitral tribunal, if the chairperson has not previously heard the opposing party , he or she will no longer be able to issue measures at his or her discretion, but only in urgent cases and upon request.

On the other hand, provisions on the so-called emergency arbitrator are not to be included.

Whereas the white paper had at least considered introducing such provisions, the draft bill does not state the reasons for leaving them out.

Conclusion The draft bill takes into account many of the proposals in the white paper, with the only new additions being provisions on the “electronic arbitral award”.

There will be no “emergency arbitrator” after all.

Some points will surely be highly debated in the further legislative process, and the bill is expected to undergo further significant changes.

This is all the more so considering that it must be harmonised with the introduction of the commercial courts, which is envisaged in a separate bill.

We will monitor further developments and report again as soon as the revised draft bill is available."
Gleiss Lutz,EU SUPPLY CHAINS CONFERENCE: “IT’S NOT ABOUT TICKING A BOX”,"On Monday, 26 September 2022, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development ( Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, “BMZ”) hosted a livestream conference entitled “The CSDD Directive from a Development Policy Perspective”.

>>

See the conference agenda It’s not about ticking a box: The conference featured national and international speakers from the political sphere and from business and focused on the following questions concerning the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDD) proposal, which was published in February 2022: How can the CSDD Directive improve working and living conditions along global value chains, particularly in developing countries?

What actions are expected from the EU and its Member States to support stakeholders along global value chains?

What constitutes an effective smart mix of accompanying measures at EU level?

Of particular interest were the insights of Carsten Stender of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs ( Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales, “BMAS”) on the Federal Republic of Germany’s work on and approach to the development of the CSDD Directive : In particular, Germany advocated for due diligence along the entire supply chain – that is, for both upstream chains (e.g. raw materials extraction) and downstream chains (e.g. disposal of environmentally harmful waste).

Germany is currently working on changing damages law in individual Member States so that victims of due diligence violations can also assert claims for damage occurring abroad before the courts of the Member States.

This includes ensuring that victims have easy access to these courts.

“Enablement before withdrawal” : Businesses should also operate in countries with less stringent human rights, occupational health and safety and environmental standards and use their influence to improve conditions.

But there must be limits to this – situations where business relationships ultimately have to be terminated as a last resort.

Clear regulations should be put in place to give companies guidance and legal certainty, especially those operating in unstable countries.

The key messages of the conference make one thing particularly clear: At EU level, supply chain compliance will be required broadly across industries to ensure effective worldwide protection of human rights and the environment – the same approach as Germany has taken with its Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltsplichtengesetz , “LkSG”).

While it is recognised that implementing due diligence will be a time-consuming and expensive process for companies, and they have been assured of support, it is nevertheless crystal clear that they will be expected to take their obligations seriously or otherwise face severe consequences such as sanctions or civil claims for damages.

Risk-based approach a key feature of the CSDD Directive The risk-based approach applied for the LkSG will also be pursued at EU level to successfully implement the CSDD Directive’s objectives.

The following were mentioned as essential elements: prioritisation; contribution; collaboration within the supply chain; engagement; and accountability .

It was repeatedly emphasised that due diligence is not and should not be about “checkbox compliance” – and has to be more than something that just looks good on paper.

Businesses are expected to be proactive and creative .

Measures for effectively implementing the CSDD Directive include: Civil liability and sanctions: Member States are in particular to lay down rules governing civil liability for due diligence violations.

Building on existing regulations (ILO, OECD guidelines): “From voluntary to mandatory” Easy and effective access to legal remedies Close cooperation with the individual groups concerned, international organisations, trade unions, etc.; creation of simple and effective reporting options on the ground."
Gleiss Lutz,EU SUPPLY CHAINS CONFERENCE: “IT’S NOT ABOUT TICKING A BOX”,"Involvement of the relevant third countries Implementation difficulties/risks: Coordination between Member States: desire for extensive information sharing, avoidance of inconsistent rules within the EU; “European Action Plan” needs to be clearer.

Problem of companies moving to countries with stricter human rights and environmental standards instead of putting remedial measures in place locally ( “cut and run” vs “stay and behave” ).

Solution: Extend due diligence to as many companies in as many countries as possible; assist companies with implementation; moving elsewhere should be the last resort.

Timing: Companies will need some time to implement the Directive’s requirements, they can’t do this from one day to the next.

Putting supply chain compliance into practice can therefore be seen as a learning process.

But while it is clear that businesses will be expected to make steady progress in implementing the requirements, it is not yet clear what criteria that progress can be measured against.

Support for companies (“enabling, not blaming”): Dissemination and advancement of best practices; support through smart tools Clear guidance and broad and easy access to information for companies (help desks etc.)

Financial support, especially for SMEs (subsidies etc.) CONCLUSION More or less the same questions are now arising at EU level that arose when the LkSG was implemented in Germany.

There is, in particular, a certain tension between the justified desire for human rights, occupational health and safety and environmental standards that are effective, and the actual due diligence implementation process at companies – something that will likely tax them to their limits.

Whether and how this will be resolved in practice will become clear in Germany, at least, from 1 January 2023, when many businesses will have to implement the requirements of the LkSG.

This will no doubt highlight one aspect that came up at the conference: supply chain compliance is a learning process – for both companies and the authorities."
Gleiss Lutz,DAOS: THE “COMPANIES OF THE METAVERSE AND WEB3”,"The metaverse and Web3 have become an attractive market for businesses and investors – increasing the need for organisational structures that are better adapted to the decentralised nature of the digital world than traditional corporate entities.

This has paved the way for decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) to take their place as the “corporate entities of the metaverse and Web3” – and the opportunities they offer for efficient capital procurement have only added to their popularity.

The following aims to provide an initial overview of DAOs.

1.

What are DAOs?

Put simply, DAOs are blockchain-based virtual organisations with no central governing body.

Instead, decisions are made by the DAO’s members.

DAOs are similar to regular companies, but run digitally using a set of software programs known as smart contracts.

A DAO’s members are its tokenholders, who manage the DAO decentrally with the help of the smart contracts, which are stored and automatically executed on the blockchain when certain criteria are met.

2. Types of DAOs DAOs can be used for a wide variety of purposes.

Originally, DAOs became known as investment vehicles – like BitDAO, a decentralised investment fund that enables anybody to invest in Web3 and decentralised finance (DeFi) startups and initiatives.

The entire DeFi sector is heavily influenced by DAOs, and MakerDAO is probably the best-known DeFi credit institution.

Over time, however, more diverse types of DAO have evolved: Social DAOs and creator DAOs such as Friends with Benefits and Developer DAO bring like-minded people together.

Media DAOs such as Decrypt and BanklessDAO are a new form of social media.

Individuals who are active on the decentralised network earn profits instead of the business entity.

The virtual worlds of the metaverse are often run by DAOs.

One example is Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual destination that is rapidly becoming a leading platform in the metaverse and is already used by many international companies such as Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola and Adidas.

Decentraland also hosts Gleiss Lutz’s metaverse office.

Grant DAOs usually function as a charitable extension of a larger project, and well-known examples include Aave Grants and Gitcoin.

Philanthropy DAOs are organised around a common philanthropic goal.

Big Green DAO, for example, is linked to the public charity Big Green, and UkraineDAO raised over EUR 3 million in ETH in one week to support the Ukrainian army.

Collector DAOs allow tokenholders to pool their funds to invest in more valuable NFT artworks and other collectibles.

Each tokenholder owns a share corresponding to their personal investment.

ConstitutionDAO was a well-known example of a collector DAO.

It was formed to buy an original copy of the United States Constitution at auction, an endeavour for which it raised USD 47 million in ETH.

DAOs can also act as service providers: LexDAO, for example, builds smart contracts that can provide legal services.

It is even possible to create corporate group-like structures using subDAOs.

SubDAOs comprise a subset of tokenholders who manage specific functions such as operations, partnerships, marketing, treasury and grants.

They offer an effective structural solution for growing DAOs in particular, because not every proposal has to be adopted by the whole DAOs.

3. Setup and operation You can either code a whole new DAO yourself, or build on existing infrastructure and open-source software.

Platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus offer ready-made templates that make it easier to enter the world of DAOs.

The DAO is “founded” by writing code, and membership acquired through equity tokens.

The code controls the interaction between tokenholders: It contains the key governance rules of the DAO, in particular those on exercising voting rights, passing resolutions and how smart contracts are triggered.

[k3]"
Gleiss Lutz,DAOS: THE “COMPANIES OF THE METAVERSE AND WEB3”,"[k3]

[nsch4] For the system to run smoothly, the code must set out all the tokenholders’ rights and the programmer must have developed smart contracts for all conceivable scenarios.

Because it is recorded on a blockchain, the DAO code cannot be changed after it goes live without the consensus of the tokenholders.

Any code stored on the blockchain is visible to all users and almost impossible to modify – making the DAO’s success depend on precise coding.

DAOs operate independently via a decentralised, digital structure.

They are not supervised by regulatory authorities and have no managing body; instead, decisions are made bottom-up by tokenholders.

Tokenholder interactions are regulated by smart contracts and cannot be (subsequently) altered.

That creates complete transparency in the DAO and fewer opportunities for fraud and abuse than with human management.

In traditional investment DAOs, for example, all tokenholders vote on how to use the jointly raised capital.

If a predetermined majority agrees, the DAO’s code automatically executes the desired transaction via a smart contract.

4.

Legal classification Legal questions start to arise when a DAO’s tokenholders or contracting partners want to enforce their claims in court, if not earlier: What law actually applies and which court has jurisdiction?

Is the DAO a company, and if so, what is its legal form?

Who is liable for the DAO’s actions vis-à-vis third parties?

Can tokenholders’ liability be limited?

a) Applicable law Before questions about a DAO’s legal classification and liability can be answered, it is necessary to determine which law applies – a difficult task, given DAOs’ decentralised structure.

Applying the law of the headquarters’ location, for example, can be ruled out for several reasons: The key feature of a DAO is specifically that it does not have an administrative body whose place of business can be used as a basis.

DAOs are managed automatically using smart contracts that do not have a specified location, because they are executed by a large number of nodes simultaneously.

Basing choice of law on the place where a DAO’s decisions are made doesn’t make sense, either, because tokenholders are usually scattered all over the world.

And because DAOs are established as autonomous organisations that exist on a blockchain in Web3, it doesn’t make any sense to link the applicable law to the place of establishment either – at least until Web3 legislation is passed.

Given all these uncertainties, it currently seems likely that lex fori – that is, the law of the venue in which the legal action is brought – will apply.

This ambiguous legal situation highlights the importance of jurisdiction and choice of law clauses.

In practice, these can be incorporated into the DAO’s terms and conditions of use, which must be accepted when DAO tokens are purchased, or into general terms and conditions of business when dealing with contracting partners.

(For more on civil procedure and arbitration law issues, see our article “ Civil Litigation and Arbitration: A New World?

,” 10 November 2022.)

b) Legal status By buying tokens, tokenholders make a legally binding decision to come together for a common purpose – creating what is, by definition, a company under German law.

But DAOs are not yet recognised as independent corporate entities in Germany, Switzerland or Austria.

According to prevailing opinion, DAOs are currently to be regarded as civil-law partnerships ( Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts (GbR)) or general partnerships ( offene Handelsgesellschaft (OHG)) under German law.

Some commentators consider DAOs to be unincorporated associations ( nichtrechtsfähiger Verein ), which are nevertheless subject to the provisions governing civil-law partnerships.

c) Limitation of liability The main disadvantage of being classified as a partnership or unincorporated association is that the partners or members have unlimited liability."
Gleiss Lutz,DAOS: THE “COMPANIES OF THE METAVERSE AND WEB3”,"c) Limitation of liability The main disadvantage of being classified as a partnership or unincorporated association is that the partners or members have unlimited liability.

If DAOs are to succeed as a new form of organisation, however, it is vital that they be able to limit their liability risk – and the search for solutions is underway both in Germany and abroad.

In Germany , liability can currently only be limited if DAO members use limited liability holding companies as intermediaries to hold the tokens in the DAO and/or if the DAO agrees contractual limitations of liability in relation to third parties.

Particularly in Switzerland, there is a debate as to whether under currently applicable law, a decentralised and autonomous association can act vis-à-vis third parties and at the same time limit the liability of its tokenholders.

An association is guided by its established purpose as well as its members, giving it a structure close to that of a DAO.

At the same time, the liability risks of an association’s members are limited, which could solve one of the main problems of structuring a DAO as a partnership.

Since Swiss associations have very flexible structures, this is currently one of the leading solutions for DAOs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

The U.S. approach to the problem of liability risks has been to create “limited liability wrappers”, combining traditional legal structures with a decentralised organisation.

The first DAO with limited liability (LLC-DAO) was founded under the law of the State of New York.

Vermont followed suit in 2018, introducing blockchain-based limited liability companies (BBLLCs), to which a DAO can be linked .

Delaware created the LAO (Legal DAO) as another “legal wrapper”, where the DAO is structured as an LLC so that the company – and not the persons acting on its behalf – is responsible for contracts, taxes and violations of the law.

The DAO LLC introduced by Wyoming in 2021 is especially interesting, being best adapted to the actual DAO structure as compared to the competing legal forms.

This recognises the DAO’s legal status and puts it on a par with the American LLC.

DAO LLCs are recognised in Germany as U.S. companies with the attendant limitation of liability.

Businesses should however note that – unlike the traditional DAO – the various American legal wrappers go hand in hand with supervision by the SEC.

Other jurisdictions will no doubt gradually follow suit.

Conclusion As the metaverse and Web3 continue to grow, so too does the DAO’s importance as a “virtual company”.

The various legal developments abroad also make it an especially promising organisational structure.

This should encourage German and European legislators to make a limited liability framework available for DAOs and to amend corporate digitalisation provisions accordingly."
Gleiss Lutz,FEDERAL ARMED FORCES PROCUREMENT ACCELERATION ACT,"The Federal Armed Forces Procurement Acceleration Act ( Bundeswehrbeschaffungsbeschleunigungsgesetz , “BwBBG”), which was passed on 7 July 2022, is intended to accelerate the expansion of what section 1 BwBBG calls the “Armed Forces’ range of capabilities” by amending procurement legislation for a limited period of time.

The aim is specifically to speed up the process for awarding public contracts for the procurement of military equipment.

Bundestag passes law to accelerate procurement measures for the Federal Armed Forces The war of aggression in Ukraine, which violates international law, marks a turning point in Germany’s security and defence policy.

It also raises the question of whether the Federal Armed Forces can adequately maintain their alliance and defence capabilities on the basis of their current equipment.

The watershed referred to in this context by the Chancellor in his policy statement of 27 February 2022 initially prompted the creation of a special EUR 100 billion fund for the Federal Armed Forces on the basis of the new Article 87a(1a)

German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz , “GG”) that came into force on 1 July 2022.

The Bundestag then went one step further and passed the BwBBG on 7 July 2022.

The amendments to procurement legislation laid down by the BwBBG are intended as a further step towards rapidly strengthening the operational capability of the Federal Armed Forces.

In what follows we will look at some of the new provisions introduced by the BwBBG: Scope and term Pursuant to section 9 BwBBG, the Act will initially apply until 31 December 2026 and, pursuant to section 8 BwBBG, will also cover all award procedures already commenced but not yet completed prior to its entry into force on 19 July 2022.

Section 2 BwBBG stipulates that the Act governs public contracts with a value exceeding the EU threshold and which cover the supply of military equipment to directly strengthen the operational capability of the Federal Armed Forces or construction and maintenance services directly related thereto.

By adopting the Economic Committee’s recommendation for a decision , the Bundestag also made it clear that the term “military equipment” must be broadly defined to include e.g. software, rights and energy.

Exceptions to the requirement to award contracts by lots Over and above the exceptions laid down in section 97(4), sentence 3 German Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen , “GWB”), section 3(1), sentence 1 BwBBG stipulates that several partial or trade-specific lots may be awarded collectively “if this is justified on economic, technical or time-related grounds.”

In this way, the legislator has created an additional exception by also recognising, unlike section 97(4), sentence 3 GWB, “time-related grounds” as justification for awarding lots collectively without the requirement of “urgency” as defined in procurement law having to be met.

It has also relaxed the general prerequisites for awarding lots collectively by stating that the specified grounds merely have to “justify” this rather than “requiring” it as stipulated in section 97(4), sentence 3 GWB.

This provision considerably restricts the requirement to award contracts by lots, the primary purpose of which is to protect the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises.

It does not abolish the requirement altogether, however, even though Directive 2009/81/EC of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of procedures for the award of certain works contracts, supply contracts and service contracts by contracting authorities or entities in the fields of defence and security, and amending Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC does not require the use of lots at all.

This should probably be seen in light of the objective laid down in the Coalition Agreement of getting SMEs to compete in the defence sector."
Gleiss Lutz,FEDERAL ARMED FORCES PROCUREMENT ACCELERATION ACT,"This should probably be seen in light of the objective laid down in the Coalition Agreement of getting SMEs to compete in the defence sector.

Prioritising solutions already available on the market Section 3(7) BwBBG stipulates that, in order to accelerate procurement projects, market research should generally be carried out to identify products and services already available on the market that would fulfil the specified requirements.

If a service is procured that is not already available on the market, the economic feasibility study should indicate why such a service is to be procured and whether the added value provided by a service developed specifically for the Federal Armed Forces justifies the expected additional cost.

Acceleration of review proceedings The proceedings before the public procurement review chambers and procurement panel for the review of alleged breaches of public procurement law are to be accelerated (the new provisions in the German Liquid Natural Gas Acceleration Act ( LNG-Beschleunigungsgesetz , “LNGG”) are along similar lines – also due to the crisis, but applicable to a different area).

Hearings in review and appeal proceedings can be held by means of video and audio transmission (sections 5 and 6 BwBBG).

Moreover, public procurement review chambers may take a decision based on the documents before them if this serves to accelerate the proceedings (section 5(1) BwBBG).

Section 6(2) BwBBG provides that in exceptional cases this option is also available to the public procurement panel at the higher regional court, which is the first and final court of appeal.

Such appeal proceedings can have a clear impact on public procurement processes, an impact which will be reduced by the envisaged acceleration of the review proceedings.

According to the 15th Defence Report of the Federal Ministry of Defence , there were, for example, only eleven applications for review proceedings out of a total of 1,038 procurement procedures (1.1%) carried out in 2021 by the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support ( Bundesamt für Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr ) for contracts whose value exceeds the EU threshold.

From 2014 to 2020, there were only 82 such applications out of 8,926 procedures (0.9%).

The Defence Report also explained, however, that the appeals predominantly related to very high-volume, important procurement procedures and in some cases led to the projects concerned being considerably delayed.

Simplification of cooperative procurement at EU level The aim of section 4 BwBBG is to make it simpler to carry out cooperative procurement with other EU Member States.

According to section 4(1) BwBBG, contracting authorities may restrict participation in a procurement procedure to tenderers established in a Member State of the EU if the public contract is awarded under a cooperation programme conducted with at least one other EU Member State.

Greater focus on security interests Section 7 BwBBG makes it possible for contracting authorities to take greater account of security interests during procurement procedures.

Under section 7(2) BwBBG, for example, they may exclude applicants or tenderers from non-EU states.

Section 7 (1) BwBBG makes it clear that according to section 145, no. 

1 GWB it is not only procurements for classic institutional intelligence services such as the German Military Counterintelligence Service ( Militärischer Abschirmdienst ) that are exempt from procurement law, but now – taking the functional concept of “intelligence activities” as a basis – explicitly also all contracts that are used for the purposes of military intelligence operations.

It will be interesting to see how broadly this exception is interpreted in the future."
Gleiss Lutz,FEDERAL ARMED FORCES PROCUREMENT ACCELERATION ACT,"It will be interesting to see how broadly this exception is interpreted in the future.

If it were to be accepted for all the sub-tasks of the broadly diversified staff function of military intelligence, as defined for example in the currently applicable Federal Armed Forces Concept , this would affect the areas of military intelligence gathering and reconnaissance, intelligence management and military security, which are in some cases closely intertwined with other military activities.

This new provision may therefore have a considerable impact.

Conclusion and outlook Whether the said measures will lead to a significant acceleration of the procurement process remains to be seen.

It is also unclear what the reform of public procurement law announced for this legislative period will bring ( Coalition Agreement p. 33

et seq.)

– this time in the form of changes applicable for an indefinite period.

It will be interesting to see whether the new provisions introduced by the BwBBG will stand up to detailed scrutiny for conformity with EU law (compatibility with the TFEU, with Directive 2009/81/EC and with the EU Directives on legal remedies in public procurement law) – legal disputes on this are to be expected."
Gleiss Lutz,MESSENGER SERVICES: DELIVERING MEDICINE AT YOUR DOORSTEP IN MINUTES,"Since autumn 2021, a growing number of express delivery services (First A, MAYD, Phaster, Volt/Apocity, to name a few) in major German cities have been offering door-to-door delivery of medicines via app in 30 minutes or less.

An app serves as the contact and communication platform between pharmacies – which work in cooperation with express delivery services – and customers.

The delivery is then usually made by (bike) messengers employed by the respective express delivery service.

The product range is (currently) limited to over-the-counter medicines and other common pharmacy items (i.e. corona tests, dietary supplements, etc.).

With the expected more extensive use of the e-prescription, the delivery of prescription medicines is also set to become possible in the course of 2022, which is likely to again considerably ramp up the market relevance of the delivery option and competition not just with “normal” retail pharmacies, but also with mail-order pharmacies.

Dr Enno Burk and Dilara Puls from our Berlin healthcare team summarise the current developments and the underlying legal framework.

I. Messenger service or mail order?

1.

When classifying express delivery services from a legal standpoint, the first question to be asked is whether such services should be regarded as messengers of the pharmacy or whether the fact that the pharmacy is using express delivery services already qualifies as mail-order activities that require a licence: A delivery by messenger within the meaning of section 17(2) German Ordinance on the Operation of Pharmacies (Verordnung über den Betrieb von Apotheken, “ApBetrO”) is to be assumed if the pharmacy specifies which natural person will deliver the medicine off the pharmacy premises and this person is subject to the head pharmacist’s right to give instructions.

If a third person stipulates, even temporarily, which specific natural person will deliver the medicine to the customer or his/her designated recipient off the pharmacy premises, and if this third person has a right to give direct instructions to the person delivering the medicine, then that will likely constitute a mail-order delivery.

2.

Express delivery services have until now – as far as we can tell – operated exclusively as “messengers of the pharmacy” and not as its dispatcher.

II.

Can pharmacy messengers be regarded as legally independent express delivery services?

1. The wording of section 17(2), sentence 1 ApBetrO does not require that the messengers be employed by the pharmacy.

The background and the underlying system of the relevant provision laid down in section 17 ApBetrO also support this view.

Consequently, corporations or partnerships with employees can also qualify as “messengers of the pharmacy”.

2.

However, the Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA) holds a contrary view and requires that the messengers be employed by the pharmacy.

A court decision on this issue has not yet been handed down, but legally valid arguments for ABDA’s position are not readily apparent.

III.

Pharmaceutical advice in the case of express delivery services Regardless of the messengers’ legal status, the delivery must comply with the requirements for pharmacists’ obligation to provide information in accordance with section 20 ApBetrO as well as the special requirements laid down in section 17 ApBetrO. Pursuant to section 17(2), sentence 5 ApBetrO, a delivery of medicine must be carried out by “pharmaceutical staff of the pharmacy” if no advice has been provided prior to the delivery.

Since the bike messengers of the express delivery services are not “pharmaceutical staff” of the pharmacy, the cooperating pharmacies offer customers pharmaceutical advice by telephone before the order is placed.

Video consultations with pharmacy staff (for example, via smartphones carried by the messenger) are also conceivable.

IV."
Gleiss Lutz,MESSENGER SERVICES: DELIVERING MEDICINE AT YOUR DOORSTEP IN MINUTES,"Video consultations with pharmacy staff (for example, via smartphones carried by the messenger) are also conceivable.

IV.

Transparency requirements: The pharmacy – and not the express delivery service – is the contracting partner During the order and delivery process, it must be clearly and unambiguously communicated to the customer that the medicine is not being dispensed by the express delivery service but instead by a specifically named pharmacy.

In addition, it must be made clear that the express delivery service itself is not a pharmacy and is therefore neither a contracting partner for the sale of medicine, nor is it responsible for the (pharmaceutical) advice or any other duties incumbent on the pharmacy towards the customer.

V. Outlook 1.

The emergence of express delivery services in major German cities is only just beginning.

As soon as the establishment of the e-prescription makes it possible for the delivery option to also be extended to prescription medicine, a marked increase in demand and therefore also in the potential of express delivery services can be expected.

2. From this point on, at least from the perspective of customers who are comfortable with smartphones and online ordering processes, there will be little reason not to make use of the convenience of ordering medicines – particularly prescription medicines – by app: They will save themselves a trip to the pharmacy when they are ill and still receive the medicine without the delay that comes with ordering from a mail-order pharmacy – a delay that limits the economically attractive prescription share in the mail-order business, except for customers who are chronically ill.

At the same time, it is also possible for the pharmacist to provide pharmaceutical advice via video conference or telephone without sacrificing quality.

3.

Therefore, when combined with the option of purchasing via an express delivery service, e-prescriptions are likely to give participating retail pharmacies in urban areas a significant competitive advantage over mail-order pharmacies that are located further away or in other EU countries, as well as over retail pharmacies that do not cooperate with express delivery services."
Gleiss Lutz,EU COMMISSION ADOPTS STATE AID RULES IN CONNECTION WITH UKRAINE CRISIS,"On 23 March 2022, the European Commission adopted a Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following aggression against Ukraine by Russia .

This sets out how and under what conditions Member States can support undertakings affected by the economic consequences of the crisis.

Introduction The European Commission’s new Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following aggression against Ukraine by Russia (the “Temporary Crisis Framework”, now published in the Official Journal of the European Union of 24 March 2022, 2022/C 131 I/01) aims to provide Member States with a basis for adopting State aid measures to support undertakings affected by the crisis.

The Commission sees a large number of potential adverse effects for undertakings, such as shrinking demand, an interruption of existing contracts and projects with a resulting loss of turnover, as well as disruptions in supply chains (e.g. of raw materials).

In addition, other inputs might no longer be available or even become unaffordable.

The energy market has also been hit hard by the increase in electricity and gas prices in the EU.

State aid measures that mitigate the economic consequences of the crisis and the economic sanctions imposed in this connection, as well as the consequences of the counter-measures taken by Russia, are therefore to be assessed in accordance with the requirements of the Temporary Crisis Framework.

Process How the Temporary Crisis Framework operates will take some getting used to, but it is in line with the system prescribed by the EU Treaties, with the Commission having to approve all State aid in advance.

The model is similar to the (proven) temporary framework model known from the financial and coronavirus crises, i.e. the Temporary Crisis Framework is not “self-executing”.

This means that the crisis framework cannot yet be used as a direct basis for support measures; instead, for the time being, it only provides the Member States with (very precise) requirements as to how their aid schemes must look in order to be approved by the Commission.

However, experience with the previous temporary frameworks in the context of the coronavirus and financial crises has shown that a wave of Member State regulations can be expected soon (in Germany, for example, from the German development bank KfW), which will adopt these requirements exactly as they stand and then be approved by the Commission at short notice.

Following this multi-stage process (which took only a few days for many Member States during the coronavirus crisis), the national funding agencies can grant the support measures directly and unbureaucratically.

The Commission has provided Member States with various aid measures and criteria that it will take into account when assessing the compatibility of measures.

These three or four measures will be discussed briefly below.

General requirements When notifying the aid, Member States must show that it is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the Member State concerned and that all the requirements of the Temporary Crisis Framework are fulfilled.

No aid may be granted to undertakings that are subject to EU sanctions.

The Temporary Crisis Framework does not generally exclude undertakings in difficulty “UID” – unlike the temporary framework in connection with the coronavirus crisis.

Limited amounts of aid The Commission makes it possible for Member States to grant limited amounts of aid of up to EUR 400,000 (including in the form of direct grants) to undertakings affected by the crisis.

Aid of up to EUR 35,000 per undertaking may be granted for undertakings active in the primary production of agricultural products or in the fishery and aquaculture sectors."
Gleiss Lutz,EU COMMISSION ADOPTS STATE AID RULES IN CONNECTION WITH UKRAINE CRISIS,"Aid of up to EUR 35,000 per undertaking may be granted for undertakings active in the primary production of agricultural products or in the fishery and aquaculture sectors.

Liquidity support in the form of guarantees or subsidised loans Member States may also provide liquidity support in the form of guarantees or subsidised loans to undertakings affected by the current crisis.

There is a limit on both the duration of the guarantees or loan agreements (maximum of six years) and the overall loan amount per beneficiary.

The State guarantee may not exceed 90% of the loan principal where losses are sustained proportionally and under the same conditions by the credit institution and the State, or 35% of the loan principal in the case of a first-loss guarantee.

Guarantees may be granted for investment and/or working capital loans; loans for investment and/or working capital needs.

Aid for additional costs due to exceptionally severe increases in natural gas and electricity prices The Commission also provides for aid for additional costs due to exceptionally severe increases in natural gas and electricity prices.

Temporary support is intended to alleviate exceptionally severe increases in the price of natural gas and electricity which undertakings may not be able to pass on or adapt to in the short-term.

The aid may be granted in various forms (direct grants, tax and payment advantages or other forms such as repayable advances, guarantees, loans or even equity).

The overall aid per undertaking must not exceed 30% of the eligible costs up to a maximum of EUR 2 million.

Additional support may be warranted in particular for energy-intensive undertakings.

Under certain conditions, therefore, Member States may grant aid of up to EUR 25 million per undertaking (limited to 50% of the eligible costs and a maximum of 80% of the operating losses of the undertaking).

For energy-intensive undertakings active in a sector or sub-sector listed in the Annex to the Temporary Crisis Framework, the overall aid may even be increased to a maximum of EUR 50 million per undertaking (not exceeding 70% of the eligible costs related to the production of the products in the sectors or sub-sectors listed in the Annex and a maximum of 80% of the operating losses of these activities).

Member States are also invited to consider setting requirements related to environmental protection or security of supply (for example, by requiring investments in energy efficiency or investments to reduce or diversify natural gas consumption).

Outlook The Temporary Crisis Framework applies until 31 December 2022, and the Commission will consider whether an extension is necessary before the end of this period.

Changes to the Temporary Crisis Framework cannot be ruled out, in particular in light of experiences with the temporary framework in the context of the coronavirus crisis, which was adjusted a total of six times.

In addition to the above aid measures under the Temporary Crisis Framework, the Commission also explicitly refers to other possibilities (for example, aid to make good the damage caused by exceptional occurrences, Article 107(2), letter b TFEU).

It now remains to be seen whether Member States will make use of all the options on offer and to what extent.

It is however likely that they will take rapid action, and undertakings affected by the crisis should therefore keep a close eye on developments."

Gleiss Lutz,"Key proposals for German government’s carbon management strategy published, greenlighting CCS and CCU use","Although Germany’s federal and state governments have been sceptical of carbon capture technologies for a long time, it is now clear that CCS and CCU will be needed in order for Germany and the EU to achieve their climate goals.

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action’s recent key proposals for a carbon management strategy and a revision of the Carbon Dioxide Storage Act consequently aim to create a legal framework for future use of CCS and CCU technologies.

Recent studies show that for Germany to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2045, carbon capture and storage (“ CCS ”) and carbon capture and utilisation (“ CCU ”) already need to be used to a substantial degree in emission-intensive sectors by 2030.

The need for these technologies has already been recognised at European level: in February 2024, the EU published its Industrial Carbon Management Strategy, which also aims to boost the use of CCS and CCU.

The key proposals by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz , “ BMWK ”) for a carbon management strategy, published on 26 February 2024, indicate how these technologies might be used in Germany in future.

The Ministry simultaneously presented a draft revision of the main statute, the Carbon Dioxide Storage Act ( Kohlendioxid-Speicherungsgesetz , “ KSpG ”), which to date has prevented storage or utilisation of CO 2 .

These measures are intended to ensure that the relevant systems and infrastructure will be ready to go by 2030.

Where CCS and CCU will be used CCS and CCU technologies are used to capture CO 2 and store it underground or offshore (CCS) or use it for some other purpose (CCU).

CCS and CCU can be used both to capture industrial or power plant emissions as well as, potentially, for direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS).

Germany intends to use these technologies chiefly where emissions are hard or impossible to abate (for example in lime or cement production, or in thermal waste treatment).

The proposals do not limit CCS/CCU use to these applications, but also make it possible for power plants that run on gaseous fuels or biomass to use these technologies as well.

The only emissions to be banned from CO 2 pipelines are those from coal-fired electricity generation, as this would otherwise put the planned phase-out of coal at risk.

The key proposals repeatedly stress that CCS and CCU approval in no way calls into question the higher goals of minimising emissions and completing the fossil fuel phase-out.

However, critics fear that the option of using these technologies to capture avoidable emissions may delay that phase-out.

The proposals address these concerns by concentrating public funding for CCS and CCU use on hard- or impossible-to-abate emissions, though this is the only measure mentioned in this regard.

Public funding By deeming CCS-captured and permanently-stored emissions to have not been emitted, EU emissions trading has already created incentives to use CCS and CCU.

Even if allowance trading has put cost pressure on industry to reduce its emissions, the CO 2 price remains too low for CCS and CCU to be cheaper than emission-intensive production.

Public funding is therefore needed to accelerate the growth of these technologies.

The Funding Guideline for Federal Funding for Industry and Climate Action ( Förderrichtlinie Bundesförderung Industrie und Klimaschutz ) is aimed at supporting CCU or CCS projects in industry and waste management, where hard-to-abate CO 2 emissions are prevalent.

This includes both capture installations themselves as well as research, development and innovation projects.

CCS and CCU have already been included in the BMWK’s Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD) programme as technologies that qualify for funding."
Gleiss Lutz,"Key proposals for German government’s carbon management strategy published, greenlighting CCS and CCU use","CCS and CCU have already been included in the BMWK’s Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD) programme as technologies that qualify for funding.

The CCfD concept provides that companies in emission-intensive industries be compensated for the additional costs they incur when setting up and operating installations that are more climate-friendly than those with the best technology currently available ( article of 13 March 2024 , German only).

The new legal framework for a pipeline network The key proposals envisage a pipeline infrastructure operated by the private sector for the transportation of CO 2 .

As well as new pipelines, the proposals provide for existing gas pipelines to be repurposed.

The KSpG’s current provisions are to be amended because they remain rudimentary and fail to account for the instruments in place for expediting approval procedures.

The draft revision provides for the KSpG to be renamed the Carbon Dioxide Storage and Transport Act ( Kohlendioxid-Speicherungs-und-Transportgesetz , “ KSpTG ”), establishing a secure legal framework for both the transport and storage of CO 2 .

This will standardise approval procedures and considerably simplify the process for public administrators and project developers.

The proposed references in section 4(2) KSpTG to Germany’s Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , “ EnWG ”) aim to expedite planning and approval procedures, for example by allowing empty conduits to be laid for later use when CO 2 pipelines are built (section 43j EnWG) or enabling existing gas pipelines to be repurposed for CO 2 transport without requiring an additional procedure (section 43l (4) to (7) EnWG).

All the same, the draft revision does not fully harmonise the KSpTG’s approval procedure with the one laid down in the EnWG.

It does not adopt certain elements which would significantly expedite planning and approval, such as dropping the requirement for an environmental impact assessment or curtailing the legal process.

Finally, the draft revision aims to simplify approvals for pipelines transporting CO 2 from Germany into EU Member States.

Existing obligations to verify the other Member State’s compliance with EU rules are to be abolished in order to facilitate cross-border expansion of the pipeline network .

This includes an amendment to the London Protocol with regard to pipeline connections to storage facilities in other EU countries.

The key proposals also stress the importance of connections to storage capacity in other Member States, as capacity is expected to become available in some of them earlier than in Germany.

Changes to the KSpG allowing exploration and development of offshore storage sites

Whereas the current KSpG limits offshore storage of CO 2 to research, testing and demonstration, the draft revision will enable such storage in the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone across the board in future, legislators now being persuaded that it is sufficiently safe.

The draft therefore provides for an approval procedure for “facilities for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide in underground rock strata”, enabling commercial storage of carbon dioxide on an industrial scale and opening up the sector to private investors and providers.

Before such projects can be approved, however, it will be necessary to explore suitable sites, which has previously been prevented by conflicting provisions in Germany’s northernmost federal states.

The draft revision limits potentially suitable sites by prohibiting storage within marine protected areas or where current or future wind energy installations might be impaired, prioritising the expansion of renewable energies.

In order to take sufficient account of competing usage in the exclusive economic zone, the key proposals provide that CO 2 storage sites be integrated into future marine spatial planning."
Gleiss Lutz,"Key proposals for German government’s carbon management strategy published, greenlighting CCS and CCU use","In order to take sufficient account of competing usage in the exclusive economic zone, the key proposals provide that CO 2 storage sites be integrated into future marine spatial planning.

At the current time, underground onshore storage on the mainland is not to be permitted, but the proposals leave open the possibility of adding a further provision to the KSpTG allowing the federal states to legislate for onshore storage if they so wish.

Outlook

Since both the key proposals and the draft revision of the KSpG were authored by the BMWK, they have not been agreed with either the Federal Government as a whole or with further decision-makers.

How these drafts will be amended, as well as the final form the Federal Government’s carbon management strategy takes, therefore remain to be seen.

One point of contention is likely to be the sectors in which CCS and CCU can be used for abatable emissions.

Furthermore, not only the KSpG but also other laws will need to be amended.

European provisions on CCS and CCU can also be expected, now the European Industrial Carbon Management Strategy has been published.

At the same time, there is time pressure to create a stable legal framework that will enable CCS and CCU to be used, to a significant extent, in Germany by 2030, given the whole new infrastructure that needs to be established."
Gleiss Lutz,FSR IMPLEMENTING REGULATION – A REAL RELIEF FOR COMPANIES?,"From 12 July 2023, parts of the EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) will start to apply.

Just two days prior, the European Commission finally adopted rules for its implementation in the FSR Implementing Regulation .

The package also includes notification forms for filings related to M&A deals (Annex I – Form FS-CO) and public procurement procedures (Annex II – Form FS-PP).

Even though the notification-based provisions of the FSR will not take effect until 12 October 2023, these forms are already critically important for preparing FSR filings, and upcoming pre-notification contacts with the European Commission.

The adoption of the FSR Implementing Regulation has been long awaited.

The initial draft published in February 2023 had been fiercely criticised by companies and business associations during the consultation process.

One focus of this criticism was the far-reaching reporting obligations for foreign financial contributions (FFCs) received by companies (see article of 8 February 2023: M&A Deals Under the New Foreign Subsidies Regime – A Taste of What to Expect) .

Simplified preparation of FSR filings for M&A deals The European Commission has responded to this criticism and significantly reduced the reporting obligations on FFCs filed using the Form FS-CO.

Instead of the “catch all” approach provided for in the initial draft (line-by-line reporting of all FFCs worth EUR 200,000 or more), the European Commission has now opted for a much more focussed approach:

First, companies need to provide detailed information about FFCs that may fall into any of the categories of foreign subsidies most likely to distort the internal market as defined in Article 5(1) FSR ( “high risk FFCs” ).

Second, high-level information on certain other FFCs needs to be made available in aggregate form ( “other reportable FFCs” ).

Information on such FFCs needs to be reported for the three years prior to the signing of the M&A deal.

Importantly, the reporting obligation only applies to individual FFCs worth EUR 1 million or more .

Line by line reporting of “high risk FFCs”

This category of FFCs comprises the following measures/transactions considered by the FSR most likely to distort the internal market: FFCs granted to an ailing undertaking , i.e. the relevant entity was at any point in time in the last three years an undertaking was likely to go out of business in the short or medium term in the absence of any FFC; or FFCs granted in the form of an unlimited guarantee for the debts or liabilities of an entity, namely without any limitation as to the amount or duration of such guarantee; or FFCs that qualify as an export financing measure not in line with the OECD Arrangement on officially supported export credits; or FFCs that directly facilitate a concentration (i.e. M&A transactions involving a change of control).

FFCs that fall into any of these categories need to be reported individually both by the notifying party/parties and by the target company.

High level reporting of other FFCs Unlike high risk FFCs, only the notifying parties – but not the target company (nor the seller) – have to report other FFCs.

Such other FFCs do not need to be reported line by line.

Rather, the Form FS-CO provides a template (table) to be completed with high level information for each type of FFC (e.g. direct grant, loan, tax advantage, guarantee, risk capital instrument, equity intervention, debt write-off, etc.) and the estimated aggregate amount of FFC per non-EU country (by using ranges).

No information is required for non-EU countries where the notifying party/parties has/have received an estimated aggregate amount of FFCs below EUR 45 million within the relevant time period.

Importantly, FFCs granted in the context of the provision/purchase of goods/services (except financial services) at market terms in the ordinary course of business no longer need to be reported."
Gleiss Lutz,FSR IMPLEMENTING REGULATION – A REAL RELIEF FOR COMPANIES?,"Importantly, FFCs granted in the context of the provision/purchase of goods/services (except financial services) at market terms in the ordinary course of business no longer need to be reported.

Finally, there are important alleviations for investment companies , such as PE firms.

Under certain conditions, they no longer need to include FFCs granted to other investment funds (or their portfolio companies) managed by the same company.

Main takeaways The final version is very much in line with the unofficial rumours that have been spreading since April (see article of 24 April 2023:

Update on EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) .

In a nutshell, it is fair to say that the European Commission has taken the significant concerns raised by stakeholders regarding the excessive reporting obligations under the initial draft FSR filing forms seriously – and remedied them to at least a certain extent.

While significantly less information needs to be disclosed, the legal and factual complexity of the information gathering process has increased .

In fact, the references to complex legal concepts such as high risk FFCs within the meaning of Article 5 FSR and the multi-layered system of exceptions and counter-exceptions for other reportable FFCs (including the new EUR 45 million threshold) will make it even more challenging for companies to apply the FSR.

For instance, it remains to be seen to what extent companies, in particular multinational corporations, will be able to estimate whether they exceed the EUR 45 million threshold per non-EU country.

This could be challenging , for instance where the corporate group in question has more than one legal entity active in a given non-EU country.

And things are even worse under the FSR’s public procurement tool, where the EUR 45 million threshold is replaced by a significantly lower EUR 4 million threshold.

Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the re-adjustment of the scope of reportable FFCs for the FSR filings has no impact on the assessment of the filing obligation (i.e. the EUR 50 million FFC threshold for M&A deals).

For the latter, things have not changed, meaning that each and every FFC still needs to be counted towards the threshold (including, for instance, FFCs below EUR 1 million, FFCs granted in the context of transactions concluded at market terms, and FFCs granted to portfolio companies controlled by an investment fund managed by the same PE firm).

Next steps: What companies can and should do now The final FSR Implementing Regulation confirms that the new system will have a major impact on potentially notifiable M&A transactions.

The adjustments in the final implementing regulation are a step in the right direction.

However, they do not change the fact that the FSR requires many EU and non-EU companies alike to immediately engage in an extensive, time-consuming and complex information gathering process.

With regard to the reporting obligations under the FSR, in particular, it will be key to establish an internal information gathering system to collect the requested information on a global and group-wide basis for the past three years.

At least those companies that can already foresee or cannot rule out that they may have to make a FSR filing within the next 12 to 24 months should kick off this process sooner rather than later.

Since the timeframe of the reporting obligation is linked to the date of signing of the M&A agreement (for M&A deals) or the notification (for public procurement procedures), the system should also be designed in a way to allow for regular future updates.

We are working on legal tech solutions to help companies collect information in a way that minimises their administrative burden.

Gleiss Lutz,Rights to trained AI,"While the EU’s new Artificial Intelligence Act primarily poses regulatory challenges, it also raises a number of IP issues relating to artificial intelligence, machine learning and neural networks.

Manually programmed software can undeniably enjoy copyright protection.

There is also consensus that AI-generated output (e.g. DALL-E images and ChatGPT text) generally cannot.

One unanswered question, however, is who owns the rights to the AI itself?

Training AI

When it comes to copyrights, a distinction must be made between untrained and trained software.

Artificial neural networks do not simply run the algorithms contained in the original software.

Instead, they provide instructions on how individual network neurons are to analyse and weight the training data fed to them to make them “intelligent”.

Broadly speaking, there are three training techniques: In “supervised learning”, the AI is fed data with a known output.

Thus, the error rate can be determined by considering the input/output pairs.

In “reinforcement learning”, the AI receives positive or negative feedback on which of its actions are desirable or undesirable.

In “unsupervised learning”, the AI receives no feedback but instead organises its output according to its own criteria.

This method is therefore particularly suitable for cluster analysis to discover unknown patterns.

Training always takes place at object code and not source code level, regardless of the approach.

The source code itself is not altered, nor can the training data be reconstructed – even by analysing the weighted neural network (known as the “black box effect”).

Untrained software Legally, the rights to the source code typically belong to the developer or, under section 69b(1) Copyright Act ( Urheberrechtsgesetz, “UrhG”), to his or her employer.

Training the AI does not change this, nor do the rights simply cease to exist once the AI has been trained.

Using the trained AI without the consent of the owner of the rights to the original software therefore usually constitutes an infringement.

The same typically applies to the training itself, provided that the original software is used for this purpose.

Trained software Two main questions arise with respect to the trained AI: (1) whether the trained software is even eligible for copyright protection and (2) who owns these copyrights.

These questions are closely related due to the principle of authorship ( Schöpferprinzip ) under German copyright law and have not yet been conclusively discussed.

German copyright law protects “programs of any form” (section 69a (1) UrhG) and the “ expression in any form of a computer program” (section 69a (2), sentence 1 UrhG).

This means that copyright protection exists for both the source code and the (untrained) object code; the latter is merely the compiled, machine-readable expression.

The programmer of the source code therefore also owns the copyrights to the resulting object code.

However, when neural networks are trained, the source code and the trained object code no longer match since the object code – due to the weighting of the neurons – contains additional information not present in the source code.

This is the information that makes the software “intelligent”.

According to what is likely the prevailing opinion in the literature, the trained software and the original software are therefore not two expressions of the same software.

As a result, the programmer’s copyright to the original software does not extend to the trained part of the software.

Consequently, if the programmer has no influence over the further training, his or her copyright is limited to the original software.

This raises the additional question of who owns the rights to the trained software – assuming it is actually protectable as copyright.

For the software to enjoy protection, the result must constitute an individual intellectual creation (section 69a (3), sentence 1 UrhG)."
Gleiss Lutz,Rights to trained AI,"For the software to enjoy protection, the result must constitute an individual intellectual creation (section 69a (3), sentence 1 UrhG).

This has to be assessed based on the development process, i.e. the training itself: If this is purely automated and does not require any further human intellectual input, there is no apparent basis for copyright protection under currently applicable law.

This is particularly evident in the case of the aforementioned “unsupervised learning” – at least if the contribution is limited to the provision of random training data.

The issue becomes more complex if the training process itself can be regarded as an intellectual, creative achievement.

Therefore, it cannot be dismissed from the outset that copyright protection applies in the case of “supervised learning” or “reinforcement learning”.

In this scenario, only the person who initiated and controlled the data collection or training can be considered the creator, i.e. the copyright owner.

However, this depends on the extent to which the training was actually under the control of the “creator”, i.e. still qualifies as an individual intellectual creation within the meaning of German copyright law.

It is doubtful whether the targeted selection of data is sufficient for this, as at least some form of additional control is likely required (e.g. checking output).

There are similarities here between machine learning and computer-aided software development.

However, in the case of the latter, the question of individuality ( individuelle Schöpfung ) tends to play a more central role.

In the case of machine learning, the focus will usually be on whether the result constitutes an intellectual creation ( geistige Schöpfung ).

Conclusion There are still many unresolved questions about the ownership rights to AI-based software.

Where contractual relationships are concerned, one solution would be to include appropriate provisions in the relevant agreements (such as restrictions on use as well as confidentiality obligations).

When dealing with third parties, de facto restricting access may oftentimes be the best solution – at least if no action can be taken based on copyrights to the untrained software."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NINTH SANCTIONS PACKAGE AGAINST RUSSIA,"On 16 December 2022, the EU again tightened economic sanctions against Russia in response to its ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.

The ninth sanctions package builds on those of 6 October 2022 ( newsletter of 10 October 2022 ), 21 July 2022 ( newsletter of 28 July 2022 ), 3/4 June 2022 ( newsletter of 9 June 2022 ), 9 April 2022 ( newsletter of 12 April 2022 ), 16 March 2022 ( newsletter of 18 March 2022 ), 28 February/2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) and 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ).

The ninth package continues to target the Russian economy and those who are instrumental in the war.

It therefore introduces a number of measures ranging from additional personal sanctions to new export controls and restrictions, further action against banks and the media, and the extension of the ban on consultancy services and on investments in the energy and mining sectors.

The latest sanctions package (comprising Regulations (EU) 2022/2474 and 2022/2475 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2476) tightens and modifies the existing sanctions against Russia – in particular, the personal sanctions in Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and the financial and trade sanctions in Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

Personal sanctions The EU has added 141 individuals and 49 entities to the list of personal sanctions, which now has more than 1,500 entries.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 freezes funds and economic resources belonging to, owned or held by the persons and entities listed in Annex I to the Regulation.

No funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of these persons and entities.

The ninth sanctions package expands the list in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014 to include additional persons from the Russian government and political sphere, in particular persons responsible for various events in connection with Ukraine as well as family members of persons already listed.

The Credit Bank of Moscow and JSC Dalnevostochny Bank have also been added, as well as several entities from the Russian defence, industry and media sectors.

Ongoing sales or transfers under Article 6b(2b) and (2c) Regulation (EU) 269/2014, for which funds and economic resources may be released by special authorisation, can now be completed by 17 June 2023 instead of the previously specified 31 October 2022.

Both this special authorisation option and the exemptions under Article 6e relating to agricultural products have been extended to cover the newly listed Credit Bank of Moscow and JSC Dalnevostochny Bank.

This does not mean, however, that sales that do not meet the requirements under this Regulation will become valid retroactively.

The deadline specified in connection with the special authorisations under Article 6b(3)

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 has been extended from 31 December 2022 to 28 February 2023.

Financial and trade sanctions The EU also adopted further measures expanding and tightening financial and trade sanctions: The export restrictions on goods and technologies that might contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement or the development of the defence and security sector (Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014) have been broadened, in particular.

The list of bodies connected to Russia’s military-industrial complex (Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 833/2014) has also been extended by 168 entries .

To avoid circumvention, some Russian-controlled entities based in illegally annexed Crimea or Sevastopol are also included in the list.

The ban on new investments in the Russian energy sector under Article 3a Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has been expanded, and new investments in the Russian mining sector are now prohibited as well.

Exceptions apply to activities involving certain critical raw materials ."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NINTH SANCTIONS PACKAGE AGAINST RUSSIA,"Exceptions apply to activities involving certain critical raw materials .

The ban on exporting goods and technologies suited for use in aviation or the space industry laid down in Article 3c Regulation (EU) 833/2014 has been extended to aircraft engines and their parts .

This applies to both manned and unmanned aircraft, meaning that from now on the direct export of drone engines to Russia and any third country that could supply drones to Russia – such as Iran – is prohibited.

The new paragraph 6b of Article 3c Regulation (EU) 833/2014 provides for special authorisations for space technology and goods intended only for medical, pharmaceutical or humanitarian purposes.

The import bans on iron and steel products under Article 3g Regulation (EU) 833/2014 have been specified in greater detail.

For example, import volume quotas have also been introduced for goods falling under CN code 7224 90 (slabs of other alloy steel).

The wind-down periods have been extended until 18 June 2023 for the import ban on methanol and methyl alcohol (Article 3i(3ba) Regulation (EU) 833/2014) and until 8 January 2023 for the export ban on certain goods pursuant to Article 3k in conjunction with Annex XXIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

In addition, special authorisation can now be obtained for certain household goods or the provision of related technical or financial assistance if such goods or assistance are necessary for personal household use of natural persons (Article 3k(5a) Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

The provisions restricting Russian oil imports have been modified to allow the transfer of petroleum products to Ukraine; in addition, certain reporting requirements now apply for transactions involving natural gas condensates of subheading CN 2709 00 10 originating in Russia (Articles 3m and

3n Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

The prohibition on nationals of an EU Member State holding posts in governing bodies has been extended under the new Article 5aa(1b)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 to all Russian state-owned or state-controlled legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia.

Similarly, the prohibitions on consulting and other services in Article 5n Regulation (EU) 833/2014 have been broadened to include market research and public opinion polling services, technical testing and analysis services and advertising services.

A corresponding wind-down period applies until 16 January 2023.

Article 12b(1) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 introduces the possibility of authorising – until 30 September 2023 – the sale, supply or transfer of goods and technologies listed in Annexes II, VII, X, XI, XVI, XVIII, XX and XXIII , which is in principle prohibited under Articles 2, 2a, 3, 3b, 3c, 3f, 3h and 3k Regulation (EU) 833/2014, if this is strictly necessary for the divestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia .

For this to be the case, the goods and technologies must be owned, at least indirectly, by a national of or an entity from a Member State and must have been physically located in Russia before the relevant prohibitions entered into force, and there must be no indication that they have a military end-use in Russia.

Article 12b(2)

Regulation (EU) 833/2014 contains a similar provision for authorising the import or transfer of goods listed in Annexes XVII and XXI , which is in principle prohibited under Articles 3g and 3i Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

This is to make it easier for European companies to wind down their business activities in Russia and withdraw completely from the Russian market.

Conclusion and outlook Given the plethora of new provisions – especially relating to import and export restrictions – companies should be extremely vigilant as sanctions are now linked to a wide variety of circumstances.

Further variations and increasingly specific exceptions have also been added, especially in connection with winding down business activities in Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU ADOPTS NINTH SANCTIONS PACKAGE AGAINST RUSSIA,"Further variations and increasingly specific exceptions have also been added, especially in connection with winding down business activities in Russia.

The various (and once again extended) prohibitions on services under Article 5n Regulation (EU) 833/2014 have very specific practical implications and businesses and consultants alike should pay particular attention to them.

As before, companies need to keep a close eye on developments, monitor the complicated web of EU and U.S. sanctions as well as Russian countersanctions, and adapt their business operations accordingly.

We will of course keep you informed of the latest changes in this regard as there is currently no end in sight to the sanctions against Russia.

On the contrary: further sanction packages and consequently further changes in the legal situation are to be expected."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2022,"The Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code (“ Government Commission ”) presented the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code (“ GCGC 2022 ”) on 17 May 2022.

The GCGC 2022 was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Justice for review and published in advance on the Government Commission’s website.

The GCGC 2022 will enter into force on publication in the electronic Federal Gazette.

1 (1) No poverty, (2) zero hunger, (3) good health and well-being, (4) quality education, (5) gender equality, (6) clean water and sanitation, (7) affordable and clean energy, (8) decent work and economic growth, (9) industry, innovation and infrastructure, (10) reduced inequalities, (11) sustainable cities and communities, (12) responsible consumption and production, (13) climate action, (14) life below water, (15) life on land, (16) peace, justice and strong institutions, (17) partnerships for the goals.

See https://sdgs.un.org/goals for further information.

Sustainability as focal point As was already apparent in the draft of the GCGC 2022 from January, the key changes to the Code take into account the growing importance of environmental, social and corporate governance issues (“ ESG ” for short).

Listed companies are expected to incorporate social and environmental sustainability into their corporate strategy and planning, placing greater responsibility on management and supervisory boards for these issues.

The Explanatory Memorandum to the GCGC 2022 states that companies can use the UN’s “17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to transform our world” as a guide when interpreting the concept of sustainability.

1

In addition to an emphasis on ESG, the GCGC 2022 contains adjustments necessitated by the Second German Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions and the German Act Strengthening Financial Market Integrity.

These adjustments include in particular new recommendations on the internal control system and risk management system, on the audit committee and on cooperation with the auditor.

The new provisions in detail The key changes to the GCGC from its previous version of 16 December 2019 are as follows: Social and environmental factors in corporate management : The revised Code’s focus on ESG is already apparent from the second paragraph of the preamble , according to which the management board and supervisory board must take social and environmental factors into account “in the enterprise’s best interests”: “Social and environmental factors influence the performance of the enterprise, and its activities have an impact on people and the environment.

The Management Board and Supervisory Board take this into account in the enterprise’s best interests when performing their management and supervisory duties.”

Furthermore, this focus is clearly reflected in the new recommendation A.1 : “The Management Board shall systematically identify and assess the risks and opportunities for the enterprise associated with social and environmental factors, as well as the environmental and social impacts of the enterprise’s activities.

In addition to long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy shall also give appropriate consideration to ecological and social goals.

Corporate planning shall comprise appropriate financial and sustainability-related objectives.”

Sustainability as part of supervisory board’s monitoring task : The revised Code’s focus on ESG is also reflected in recommendations that only concern the supervisory board.

The final version of the GCGC 2022 no longer contains the recommendations geared specifically to the supervisory board’s monitoring of sustainability issues, as included in the consultation draft (recommendation A.6).

By way of a supplement to principle 6 , however, the final version does generally state that the supervisory board’s monitoring and advisory tasks also cover sustainability issues."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2022,"By way of a supplement to principle 6 , however, the final version does generally state that the supervisory board’s monitoring and advisory tasks also cover sustainability issues.

The addition made in the consultation draft to recommendation C.1 has been retained.

This states that supervisory boards must in future also have expertise on sustainability issues relevant for the enterprise in question.

Qualification matrix for the supervisory board : A new addition in the final version of the GCGC 2022 is that the implementation status of the specified objectives for the composition of the supervisory board and the competence profile is to be published in a qualification matrix in the corporate governance statement ( recommendation C.1, sentence 4 ).

Internal control system and risk management system : Principle 4 on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system and risk management system now includes a sentence about internal monitoring: “Internal monitoring is essential to ensure that the internal control system and the risk management system are appropriate and effective.”

It is the Government Commission’s view that this internal monitoring falls under the remit of internal auditing (cf.

Explanatory Memorandum on A.5).

The Explanatory Memorandum points out that voluntary external audits, e.g. according to the IDW PS 980, 981 and 982 audit standards, can be used to corroborate the statements made on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems.

The management board would thus also enable the audit committee to make the assessment required of it, so that “ external audits would be required from time to time ” (cf.

Explanatory Memorandum on A.5).

According to the new recommendation A.3 , the internal control system and risk management system must in future also cover sustainability-related objectives: “Unless already required by law, the internal control system and risk management system shall also cover sustainability-related objectives.

This shall include processes and systems for collecting and processing sustainability-related data.""

The new recommendation A.5 stipulates that the internal control system and risk management system are to be described in the management report: “The management report shall describe the main characteristics of the internal control system and risk management system as a whole, and provide comment upon the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems.”

Compliance management system : The current recommendation A.2 on the compliance management system has been deleted, but – unlike in the consultation draft – has been replaced by additional wording in principle 5 : “The internal control system and risk management system also comprise a compliance management system aligned to the enterprise’s risk situation.”

The deletion was rightly criticised during the consultation process.

Given the great legal and practical importance of compliance management systems, this change would have sent the wrong signal.

Minimum gender participation : Principle 9 has been adapted in line with the legal situation that has existed since the introduction of the Second German Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions and now reads: “The Supervisory Board ensures that the statutory minimum gender participation on the Management Board is complied with or defines target values for the share of women on the Management Board within the framework of the statutory requirements.”

Establishing an audit committee and cooperating with the external auditors: The current recommendation D.3 on establishing an audit committee has been deleted.

Principle 14 has instead been expanded and now states that an audit committee must be established."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2022,"Principle 14 has instead been expanded and now states that an audit committee must be established.

This is based on the new section 107(4), sentence 1 German Stock Corporation Act introduced by the German Act Strengthening Financial Market Integrity, according to which the supervisory board of a listed company must establish an audit committee.

In addition, the current recommendation D.11, according to which the audit committee is to evaluate the quality of the audit on a regular basis, is to be replaced by a new recommendation D.10 : “The Audit Committee shall discuss the audit risk assessment, the audit strategy, audit planning and audit results with the external auditors.

The Chair of the Audit Committee shall discuss the progress of the audit on a regular basis with the external auditors and report on this to the Committee.

The Audit Committee shall consult with the external auditors on a regular basis without the Management Board.""

Unlike the consultation draft, the final version no longer includes the recommendation that the chair of the audit committee is, on a regular basis, (i) to meet with the Chief Financial Officer and (ii) to participate in discussions regarding critical audit matters between the management board and the external auditors and report on these to the committee.

In addition, the final version of the GCGC 2022 no longer contains the recommendation that the audit committee is also to arrange for external reviews of the internal audit system.

The recommendation in the consultation draft – which was rightly criticised – that the audit committee is also to meet with the external auditors without the management board, was modified in recommendation D.10 of the final version (only) to the extent that “meet” was changed to “consult with”.

Recommendation D.10 supplements the new section 109(1), sentence 3 German Stock Corporation Act introduced by the German Act Strengthening Financial Market Integrity, according to which the management board will not participate in a meeting of the supervisory board if the external auditors are called in as experts, unless the supervisory board or the committee deems its participation necessary.

Qualifications of the financial experts on the audit committee: The GCGC 2022 also contains a new principle 15 on the qualifications of the members of the audit committee: “At least one member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of auditing financial statements.”

This reflects the requirement introduced by the German Act Strengthening Financial Market Integrity that at least two of the members of the supervisory board or audit committee must be financial experts (section 100(5), section 107(4), sentence 3 German Stock Corporation Act).

Recommendation D.3 , which follows principle 15 and is likewise largely new, provides that knowledge relating to sustainability reports and audits of such reports also falls under knowledge of and experience in the application of accounting principles, internal control and risk management systems and auditing financial statements.

The chair of the audit committee must also be an expert either in accounting or in auditing financial statements, or both.

The corporate governance statement must identify the relevant members of the audit committee and provide details of their expertise.

Finally, as provided in the current recommendation D.3, the chair of the supervisory board may not chair the audit committee.

Report on the form of supervisory board meetings : According to the new version of recommendation D.7, the supervisory board report must also state how many meetings of the supervisory board and the committees were held as physical meetings and how many as video conferences or conference calls.

This was not part of the consultation draft."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2022,"This was not part of the consultation draft.

Gleiss Lutz comments Leaving aside the amendments triggered by the Second German Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions and the German Act Strengthening Financial Market Integrity, it is clear that the primary focus of the changes to the GCGC 2022 is sustainability.

During the consultation process, there was some criticism of the importance given to this topic in the Code.

The Government Commission has however responded to this by making only a few linguistic improvements in the final version.

This is understandable given the ever-increasing importance of sustainability aspects for the work of the management board and supervisory board.

All in all, the GCGC 2022 emphasises this rising importance, thereby addressing a concern of many institutional investors.

Those affected by the GCGC 2022 should review the amendments as soon as possible to ensure they will be ready to submit the next declaration of conformity.

Companies that do not already comply with the new recommendations, in particular, can immediately initiate the necessary internal processes and have these implemented by the time the next declaration of conformity is submitted.

It is especially important for the management board to review its corporate strategy in view of recommendation A.1 and its internal control and risk management systems in view of recommendation A.3.

Recommendations C.1, sentence 2, and D.3 on the qualifications of members of the supervisory board or audit committee, as well as recommendation D.7 on supervisory board meetings, are particularly relevant for the supervisory board.

The qualification matrix recently recommended in C.1, sentence 4, must also be developed for the corporate governance statement if no deviation from the provisions of the GCGC is to be declared."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: GERMANY’S FEDERAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUTS FORWARD DRAFT BILL,"Headed by Germany’s Free Democrats (the FDP), the Federal Ministry of Justice published a draft bill for an “Act to Improve the Protection of Whistleblowers and Transpose the Directive on the Protection of Persons who Report Breaches of Union Law” (Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz or “Whistleblower Act”) on 13 April 2022.

The draft bill is long overdue, as the deadline for transposing the EU Directive expired on 17 December 2021 and the European Commission has already started infringement proceedings against Germany.

Points especially relevant to practice: 1. One for all – the group-wide reporting channel 2.

Catch all – more whistleblowers covered, more matters protected 3.

Anonymity of reports – not mandatory, but recommended 4.

Well prepared – specific requirements for case managers 5.

Burden of proof reversed – but whistleblowers must still prove they have faced disadvantages 6.

Fines – it could get expensive If companies have not yet done so, they should review whether their existing processes meet the statutory requirements.

This applies with regard to both European and German rules on internal reporting systems.

Where necessary, the review should also take into account the obligation to implement a complaints procedure from 2023 onwards, as stipulated in Germany’s Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz or “Supply Chains Act”).

It is worth basing the review on a gap analysis and developing concepts for formalized processes with regard to responsibilities, handling reports and whistleblowers, reporting channels and documentation.

These concepts can then be used as a basis for clear procedural instructions, descriptions of processes and group-wide guidelines.

1.

One for all – the group-wide reporting channel Contrary to widespread fears and the European Commission’s demands in connection with the EU Whistleblowing Directive, the German draft bill provides that the whistleblower system can be centralised within the corporate group .

This clarification is very welcome, not least in light of the fact that from 1 January 2023 onwards companies with at least 3,000 employees will also be obliged under the Supply Chains Act to set up an internal complaints procedure.

At the company’s choice, this procedure can be group-wide.

In summer 2021, the European Commission had interpreted group-level matters very restrictively: companies with 250 or more employees were not permitted to share internal reporting system resources.

Any central reporting channel on the level of the holding, the Commission held, was only possible in addition and in parallel to a local reporting channel on the level of subsidiaries.

At the whistleblower’s wish, the report would have to remain with and be processed by the company employing the whistleblower.

Sweden, for example, has transposed the EU Whistleblowing Directive so as to require companies with at least 250 employees to set up their own internal reporting channel .

Such companies must operate this channel themselves in full, without drawing on the resources of other companies within the group.

Establishments with 50 to 249 employees may share resources in receiving reports and undertaking follow-up investigations, but the whistleblower must not be contacted via the common resources.

The German draft bill, we are happy to say, provides instead that an independent and confidential reporting channel may also be set up at another group company .

Such centre is then a “third party” within the meaning of Article 8(5) of the EU Whistleblowing Directive and can act on behalf of several independent group companies.

The bill nevertheless makes clear that responsibility for pursuing and addressing infringements originates and must remain with the respective subsidiary that instructs such group company to take action.

This applies equally, for example, whether external or in-house lawyers from within the group assist in the matter (cf."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: GERMANY’S FEDERAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUTS FORWARD DRAFT BILL,"This applies equally, for example, whether external or in-house lawyers from within the group assist in the matter (cf.

p. 85 of the draft bill’s explanatory memorandum).

Accordingly, group-wide reporting systems for all employees will continue to be permissible.

When processing reports, the reporting channel will be acting on behalf of the respective legally independent subsidiary.

Responsibility does not pass to the reporting channel.

The reporting channel must differentiate internally according to the respective subsidiaries when processing reports, and confidential treatment of reports must be ensured.

Group management may only be notified by or on behalf of the respective group company and maintaining confidentiality as to the whistleblower’s identity.

Example: a group parent company has a compliance department.

A subsidiary with 300 employees has not set up a separate compliance role of its own.

According to the draft Whistleblower Act’s explanatory memorandum, the group parent company’s compliance department is an independent third party that may receive incoming reports on the subsidiary’s behalf and process them confidentially, separating them according to company.

Resorting to group-wide resources does not equate with transfer of responsibility, however.

Responsibility for stopping infringements originates and remains with each group company.

It remains to be seen whether this interpretation of the group parent company as a “third party” will stand up under European law.

Article 8(6) of the EU Whistleblowing Directive eases rules on companies with 50 to 249 employees and is transposed in section 14(2), sentence 1 of Germany’s draft Whistleblower Act.

Going beyond subsection 1, this provision eases rules for small companies still further to head off financial burdens.

Such companies can combine their resources for receiving reports and undertaking follow-up measures by setting up and operating a joint centre.

Nevertheless, it is up to each company to take measures to stop infringements and to report back to the whistleblower accordingly.

2. Catch all – more whistleblowers covered, more matters protected Personal scope: generally, companies with at least 50 employees are obliged to set up a centre for internal reports that employees can contact (section 12(1) and (2) of the draft Whistleblower Act).

For companies with 50 to 249 employees the deadline for implementation has been extended to 17 December 2023.

Certain companies in the financial services sector (e.g. credit institutions) are obliged to set up internal reporting channels irrespective of how many employees they have.

Employees require access to the internal reporting system.

But to emphasize their awareness of compliance issues, companies may also choose to open their whistleblower systems up to third parties.

This may be of particular interest to companies that fall under the Supply Chains Act because of how many employees they have.

They will need to set up a complaints procedure that is not limited to employees in any case.

Material scope: As expected and set forth in the coalition agreement of Germany’s current ruling parties, the material scope of the draft Whistleblower Act goes beyond European Union law.

In addition to breaches of European Union law covered by the Directive, the draft Whistleblower Act also includes breaches of German criminal law and regulations punishable by a fine (where the regulation serves to protect life and limb, or the rights of employees and their representative bodies).

The draft bill therefore meets expectations for the comprehensive protection of whistleblowers and is in line with the legislation of other Member States.

3.

Anonymity of reports – not mandatory, but recommended The EU Whistleblowing Directive leaves it up to Member States to decide whether companies must also be obliged to receive anonymous reports."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: GERMANY’S FEDERAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUTS FORWARD DRAFT BILL,"3.

Anonymity of reports – not mandatory, but recommended The EU Whistleblowing Directive leaves it up to Member States to decide whether companies must also be obliged to receive anonymous reports.

According to the draft bill, companies are not obliged to provide reporting channels that enable anonymous reports to be made (end of section 16(1) of the draft Whistleblower Act).

We recommend enabling anonymous reports to be made as well, however, as this lowers any inhibitions employees may have in reporting infringements.

Another reason to open up the system to anonymous reports is that anonymous whistleblowers whose identity becomes known also enjoy protection, according to the explanatory memorandum.

4.

Well prepared - specific requirements for case managers The draft bill also takes a stance on issues left open by the EU Whistleblowing Directive, namely requirements placed on case managers.

Notably, the draft bill clarifies the fact that it is unnecessary to create a full position to meet the duties under the draft Whistleblower Act.

This lack of a wholly dedicated position is already everyday practice in many companies.

Case managers may have other tasks and duties besides those they have in connection with the internal reporting channel (section 15(1), sentence 2 draft Whistleblower Act).

To ensure that persons tasked with processing reports remain independent as required, we recommend explicitly stating that case managers cannot be instructed to complete reporting procedures in a particular way.

Companies must also ensure that case managers have the requisite specialist skills.

These can be obtained in training sessions or through other further training.

Following the need-to-know principle, the draft Act requires reporting channels to be structured such that only case managers (or persons supporting them) have access to the incoming reports.

For technical solutions, putting this rule into practice will mean coming up with concepts for access rights.

In compliance with the requirement of confidentiality, incoming reports need to be documented such that they can be accessed on an ongoing basis .

This is to facilitate access to the documents should legal disputes ensue.

Documentation is deleted two years after the procedure has been completed.

5.

Burden of proof reserved – but whistleblowers must still prove they have faced disadvantages The draft bill transposes the reversal of the burden of proof that the EU Directive provides for.

Accordingly, if an employee suffers a disadvantage after reporting or disclosing a matter, it is assumed that this disadvantage is a reprisal for the employee’s action.

Such disadvantage – which may take the form of a termination or warning in the employment relationship – is illegal.

It is incumbent upon the employer (or principal or other organisation) to prove that such action has adequate justification or did not result from the report or disclosure (section 36(2) draft Whistleblower Act).

In a welcome move, the explanatory memorandum states that the whistleblower must demonstrate and prove that a measure taken represents a disadvantage.

Notably, if a short-term contract is not turned into a permanent one, or a potential promotion is withheld, the whistleblower must prove that he or she had grounds to expect that such permanent contract or promotion would have been forthcoming.

If the ban on reprisals is breached, the whistleblower has a claim for damages against the party responsible.

But the whistleblower has no claim to an employment relationship being established or to professional advancement.

The pre-requisite for such protection includes the fact that at the time of reporting the whistleblower had reasonable grounds to believe that the information was true and concerned breaches that fell within the scope of the Act (section 33(1) draft Whistleblower Act)."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: GERMANY’S FEDERAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE PUTS FORWARD DRAFT BILL,"Regrettably, the draft bill adopts the Directive’s imprecise legal terminology instead of following the familiar standards of intent and negligence when it comes to culpability.

According to the explanatory memorandum, there must be actual indications that a breach has taken place; no protection is extended to either speculation or negligent reports where no reasonable effort at verification was made.

Where a whistleblower files an erroneous report with intent or gross negligence, he or she is obliged to pay damages.

Just like the EU Whistleblowing Directive, the draft bill is ambivalent about taking account of a whistleblower’s motivation .

Although the explanatory memorandum states that the whistleblower’s subjective motivation plays no role, elsewhere it specifies that persons reporting abusively or maliciously incorrect information are not protected.

Insofar, taking account of the whistleblower’s motivation does not seem to be ruled out when assessing whether the whistleblower had “reasonable grounds to believe” in the truth of their information.

6.

Fines – it could get expensive New fines defined in section 40(2) of the draft Whistleblower Act go beyond those provided for under the EU Whistleblowing Directive.

These new fines will be especially critical in practice.

A fine of up to EUR 100,000 can be imposed on anyone obstructing (or attempting to obstruct) a report or subsequent communication, anyone taking (or attempting to take) illegal reprisal, or anyone failing to comply with the requirement of confidentiality with intent or gross negligence.

In contrast to the Directive, the German draft bill also provides for a fine of up to EUR 20,000 where an internal reporting system is not set up or not operated .

Sections 30 and 130 of Germany’s Act on Regulatory Offences ( Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz ) apply via section 40(5), last sentence of the draft Whistleblower Act.

Legal entities may therefore receive a fine if an executive has committed a regulatory offence.

At the same time, breaches of duties of supervision may be penalized.

Please note that the reference to section 30 Act on Regulatory Offences means that for certain infringements the maximum fine can increase ten-fold.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA TIGHTENED FURTHER – RUSSIA TAKES “COUNTERMEASURES”,"Due to Russia’s continuing attacks on Ukraine, the EU and U.S. (as well as numerous other countries) have once again adopted harsh sanctions against Russia.

Following the entry into force of a first package of EU sanctions on 24 February 2022 and a second on 26 February 2022 ( link to first article from 28 February 2022 here ), the EU published a third sanctions package on 28 February 2022 further restricting foreign trade with Russia.

On 2 March 2022, the EU also significantly tightened sanctions against Belarus due to the involvement of the Belarusian military in the attacks on Ukraine.

The U.S. likewise tightened its sanctions against Russia and Belarus once again.

The Russian government, in turn, adopted its first counter-sanctions on 28 February 2022.

Expansion of EU sanctions against Russia On 28 February 2022, the EU again expanded and tightened Regulations (EU)

No 269/2014 and No 833/2014, adding persons and entities to the sanctions lists, tightening financial sanctions against the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, banning the export of euro notes and imposing sanctions on the Russian aviation industry.

In addition, the EU suspended the broadcasting licences of certain Russian media and banned the broadcasting and distribution of content produced by them.

It is moreover now clear which Russian banks will be excluded from the SWIFT payment system.

The EU first extended the scope of application of the personal sanctions on 28 February 2022 (see Regulation (EU)

No 2022/336) and then again on 2 March 2022 (see Regulation (EU)

No 2022/353): The list of persons affected by the measures now covers 718 individuals and 56 bodies: The listed persons are still banned from entering and transiting the territory of the European Union and all their funds and economic resources are being frozen.

German and other European companies are moreover prohibited from directly or indirectly providing the listed persons with funds or economic resources .

Indirect provision of funds or economic resources is generally assumed where these are made available to non-listed persons that are in turn owned (> 50%) or controlled by a listed person (see Council document 5664/18, para.

55b, for the relevant criteria).

However, this does not apply if it can be determined on a case-by-case basis – taking into account the relevant circumstances (including the potential practical use of the resources by the listed person) – that the funds or economic resources in question are not in fact used by or for the benefit of the listed person/entity.

In line with the EU Sanctions Guidelines (Council document 5664/18, para. 55d.)

, it can be assumed that the mere fact that a resource is used by a non-listed person/entity to generate profits which might be in part distributed to a listed shareholder (minority or majority shareholder), will not mean that the ban on indirect provision has been violated.

This has been the approach followed by at least the German authorities to date.

Further developments in this regard should however be carefully monitored.

The scope of the financial sanctions has also been expanded once again: The trading ban already in place on securities and money market instruments issued by the Russian Central Bank now includes a prohibition on all transactions related to the management of reserves and assets of the Russian Central Bank .

A special licence for such transactions may only be granted to safeguard the financial stability of the Union or a Member State.

All investments in projects co-financed by the Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF are now prohibited A broad ban has also been imposed on the sale, supply, transfer and export of euro-denominated banknotes to Russia or to natural or legal persons, entities or bodies in Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA TIGHTENED FURTHER – RUSSIA TAKES “COUNTERMEASURES”,"The only exceptions are for personal use and for the official purposes of diplomatic missions, consular posts or international organisations in Russia enjoying immunities in accordance with international law.

On 1 March 2022, the EU published the previously decided and announced exclusion of some Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system (see new Article

5h Regulation No 833/2014, amended by Article 1(3) Regulation No 2022/345):

As of 12 March 2022, this will apply to the banks listed in Annex XIV to Regulation No 833/2014 (currently: Bank Otkritie Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya Sovcombank, VNESHECONOMBANK (VEB), VTB BANK ) as well as to legal persons established in Russia more than 50% of which is directly or indirectly owned by one of the financial institutions listed in Annex XIV.

Expansion of EU sanctions against Belarus On 2 March 2022, the EU also amended and expanded Regulation (EC) 765/2006 (see Regulation (EU) 2022/355), significantly tightening existing sanctions against Belarus in response to the involvement of Belarus’ military in the attacks on Ukraine.

The personal sanctions against the currently 183 persons and 26 bodies listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) 765/2006 generally continue to apply unchanged, as do the existing financial sanctions .

However, regarding the ban on granting specific credit and loans and providing certain types of insurance and reinsurance to certain persons/entities, the privilege for existing contracts concluded before 25 June 2021 has been lifted .

The EU has also decided to impose further restrictions on Belarus in the trade of certain goods.

These goods-related sanctions concern the following areas in particular: The export ban on dual-use goods listed in Annex I of the Dual Use Regulation was tightened to prohibit the direct or indirect sale, export, transfer and supply of all such goods .

This means that, unlike in the past, the specific (military or civilian) use of the goods in Belarus is no longer decisive.

Exceptions apply only to certain humanitarian uses.

In addition, companies can – until 30 April 2022 – apply to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, “BAFA”) for a special licence to export dual-use goods if the goods ,existing contracts that were concluded before 3 March 2022.

The EU has introduced a new export ban on goods and technology (whether or not originating in the Union) which might contribute to Belarus’s military and technological enhancement or to the development of its defence and security sector.

The affected goods are listed in the new Annex Va to Regulation (EC) 765/2006.

The list covers the following categories: electronics; computers; telecommunications; sensors and lasers; navigation and avionics; marine; aerospace and propulsion.

Exceptions for certain humanitarian purposes apply in this case as well.

As with the dual-use goods, companies can – under the aforementioned conditions – also apply for special licences in order to fulfil existing contracts.

Moreover, an export ban is now also planned for a large number of machines across a wide range of economic sectors (such as the packaging and textile industries), which are listed in the new Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) 765/2006.

Again, exceptions for certain humanitarian purposes also apply in this case.

Furthermore, the ban on the execution of existing contracts concluded before 2 March 2022 does not apply until 4 June 2022 (“ wind down period” ).

The export bans on equipment, technology and software for monitoring telecommunications are to remain in place.

With regard to the already existing export ban on goods used for the production or manufacturing of tobacco products , the privilege for existing contracts has been lifted for contracts concluded before 25 June 2021.

And finally, the EU has also widened existing bans on the import of certain goods originating in or exported from Belarus."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA TIGHTENED FURTHER – RUSSIA TAKES “COUNTERMEASURES”,"And finally, the EU has also widened existing bans on the import of certain goods originating in or exported from Belarus.

The import bans now also prohibit the provision of financing and financial assistance as well as insurance and reinsurance in connection with the import of the products concerned.

The restrictions now apply to mineral products (petroleum products and gaseous hydrocarbons), potassium chloride products, wood products, cement products, iron and steel products and rubber products.

Exceptions apply – until 4 June 2022 – to the import of wood, cement, iron and steel and rubber products, in each case for the execution of existing contracts concluded before 2 March 2022 (“ wind down period ”).

In a remarkable development, Switzerland also implemented the EU’s first and second sanctions packages on 3 March 2022 (see link to first article from 28 February 2022 here ).

It has now adopted the third package of extended personal and financial sanctions against Russia – but not the measures imposed against Belarus.

Expansion of US sanctions The U.S. has further tightened its economic sanctions against Russia and – in response to the Belarusian military’s involvement in the attacks – has also expanded its sanctions against Belarus:

On 3 March 2022, the U.S. imposed personal sanctions on a number of additional individuals by expanding the SDN list.

This concerns Russian oligarchs and their family members in particular.

The listed persons’ U.S. accounts are being blocked and their assets frozen.

U.S. persons are subject to a complete ban on transactions (transfer of goods and money) with SDN-listed persons; the term “U.S. person” refers to, among others, U.S. citizens and U.S. companies, green card holders as well any person during his or her stay in the U.S. Non-U.S. persons (European companies), for their part, risk having sanctions imposed on them by the U.S. authorities if they “knowingly facilitate a significant transaction” with SDN-listed persons.

“Insignificant” transactions therefore remain unaffected .

However, it is still unclear when a transaction is deemed “significant”.

Unlike in the case of the U.S. embargo on Iran, serious consequences are unlikely to arise for EU companies based on the current assessment, since corresponding restrictions also exist in accordance with the directly applicable sanctions law.

Nor is there any risk of the boycott prohibition being violated (section 7 Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance) in this respect.

The aforementioned consequences under sanctions law not only apply directly to the SDN-listed natural and legal persons, but also generally indirectly to all those companies where 50% or more is owned by SDN-listed persons, even if these companies have not been explicitly named (in the case of several listed owners, the shares are added together; control without ownership is not relevant – unlike under EU sanctions law).

On 2 March 2022, the U.S. government had already added restrictions on oil and gas refining technology to the goods-related restrictions applicable to business dealings with Russia.

The scope of application of the goods-related restrictions was also extended to business dealings with Belarus .

Adoption of “countermeasures” by Russia The Russian government, in turn, adopted its first counter-sanctions on 28 February 2022.

The measures require Russian exporters to sell 80% of foreign currency receipts from 28 February 2022 onwards.

The obligation applies to proceeds credited on or after 1 January 2022 to accounts of residents participating in foreign economic activity.

The provisions affect, above all, exporters of goods, services and IP."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA TIGHTENED FURTHER – RUSSIA TAKES “COUNTERMEASURES”,"The provisions affect, above all, exporters of goods, services and IP.

Since 1 March 2022, Russian residents have also been prohibited from granting foreign loans in foreign currency and from crediting foreign currency to bank accounts outside Russia as well as from making transfers, without opening a bank account, by electronic means of payment operated by foreign payment services providers.

Capital controls are also in place to prevent foreign currency outflows: exports from Russia of cash and financial instruments in foreign currency with a value in excess of USD 10,000 have been prohibited since 1 March 2022.

Since 2 March 2022, Russian residents have also been prohibited from, among other things, granting loans or credit (in roubles) and selling securities or real estate to foreign persons with ties to “unfriendly states” (including EU Member States).

The prohibitions cover both nationals of “unfriendly states” as well as companies that have their “place of primary business or place of primary profit extraction from activity in unfriendly states”.

The Russian government has announced further measures to prevent foreign investors from withdrawing from Russia.

Conclusion and recommended action The further tightening of the EU sanctions will once again significantly complicate the business done by German and other European companies with Russia.

In addition to the combined financial sanctions imposed by the West, individual decisions by companies are bringing an additional - and, in this form, unparalleled - dynamic to the market: Many Russian plants of foreign companies, e.g. of Mercedes and VW in the automotive industry, are now facing closure.

Shareholdings and subsidiaries in Russia are being sold off, for example by British-Dutch oil company BP or by Exxon from the U.S. Western companies ranging from Apple to SAP and Volvo are joining the mass exodus.

This withdrawal from the Russian market undoubtedly also has its origins in the suspension of SWIFT for some Russian commercial banks as well as in the aforementioned foreign exchange restrictions imposed by the Russian government.

Companies remain advised to review their internal compliance structures and to subject any business with Russia to strict scrutiny.

This also applies in particular to checking whether any persons involved in the transaction are on the EU or U.S. sanctions lists.

At present, companies often face the challenge of obtaining reliable information on the current ownership and shareholdings of their business partners since in particular Russian sources are often not available or unreliable.

In this case, we recommend documenting at least the efforts made to scrutinise the relevant business partner and the fact that it was not possible to investigate further.

A risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis (taking into account the available information and the nature of the transaction) to determine whether the transaction should nevertheless be pursued.

Companies should also carefully monitor and review the goods-related restrictions.

The restrictions on the export of certain machinery to Belarus, in particular, generally apply to all sectors and are therefore likely to affect numerous German or other European companies."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"In Germany, the amended Act against Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen, “GWB” ) is set to enter into force on 7 November 2023.

The final version of the Act softened the government’s draft bill ( Regierungsentwurf ) of 5 April 2023 ( article of 17 April 2023 ) and the initial draft of the competent Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz ) of 15 September 2022 ( article of 28 September 2022 ) in some – but not in material – respects.

The new law is the culmination of intense debates between supporters and opponents of the proposals.

The responsible minister regards this as “the biggest reform of competition law since Ludwig Erhard”.

The Amendment adds a fourth pillar to the GWB, the “basic law of the social market economy”.

In addition to the three existing pillars – the prohibition of cartels, abuse control and merger control – the Federal Cartel Office ( Bundeskartellamt ) has a new intervention mechanism at its disposal for “protecting free and fair competition”.

By means of targeted measures, it will be able to put a stop to or remedy “significant and continuous malfunctioning of competition” identified in sector inquiries.

The reason for the Amendment was a price hike during the 2022 energy crisis, which also made itself felt at petrol stations.

The original intention of the competent Ministry was to implement more effective antitrust legislation.

According to the explanatory memorandum, the Amendment aims “to improve the State’s ability, in the interest of consumers, to put a stop to malfunctioning of competition.

Antitrust intervention mechanisms are to be strengthened where market structure conflicts with competition, for example where there are only a few providers on the market and prices generally develop in parallel, to the disadvantage of consumers.”

In addition, the Amendment aims to simplify the already existing rules regarding the disgorgement of benefits and to create the legal basis for the Bundeskartellamt to support the European Commission in enforcing the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and for injured parties to enforce the DMA in Germany before the civil courts.

I.

The changes in detail: 1.

Sector inquiries and remedies (section 32e and section 32f(3-9) GWB)

In future, it will be possible for sector inquiries to have consequences – in line with the approach in the UK.

So far, sector inquiries have been without consequences, with most mainly culminating in final reports (for example, the final reports on the fuel sector (2011), on electricity generation and wholesale markets (2011), on buyer power in the food retail sector (2014) or most recently on hospitals (2021) as well as on the collection of household waste (2021)).

It was only the sector inquiries into rolled asphalt (2012) and cement and ready-mixed concrete (2017) that led to any extensive unbundling of joint ventures.

This was, however, based on administrative proceedings initiated or threatened on the basis of the rules on cartels.

Under the new provisions, the Bundeskartellamt will be able to take action with respect to identified abuses and to intervene based on regulatory requirements, without having to prove any specific antitrust violations.

The procedure has two stages:

First, the sector inquiry must be carried out.

After that, a malfunctioning of competition must be identified and a remedy ordered.

Sector inquiries, section 32e GWB Sector inquiries are to last a maximum of 18 months.

This will strengthen their effectiveness.

The Bundeskartellamt is obliged to publish interim – or at least final – reports in future.

These reports may include recommendations to the Federal Government regarding competition policy.

It will also be possible to carry out seizures as part of investigations."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"These reports may include recommendations to the Federal Government regarding competition policy.

It will also be possible to carry out seizures as part of investigations.

However, sector inquiries usually focus on interviews, requests for information (including data collection) and information analyses carried out by the Bundeskartellamt, with these forming the basis for the subsequent final report.

Section 32f GWB as the central provision of the new intervention mechanism At the heart of the new intervention mechanism – a major change – is section 32f GWB, which grants the Bundeskartellamt far-reaching powers to intervene following publication of the final sector inquiry report.

The Bundeskartellamt should also not spend more than an additional 18 months on this second stage, in which it determines whether there has been a malfunctioning of competition and orders remedies.

The proceedings before the Bundeskartellamt should therefore be concluded no later than 36 months after a sector inquiry has begun.

The main requirement for exercising these powers is a situation in which there is “significant, continuous malfunctioning of competition on at least one market extending across Germany, several individual markets or across markets” .

The procedure in accordance with this provision is subject to “soft” subsidiary application, in particular in relation to the prohibition of cartels and rules on abuse.

No provision is made as to how the Bundeskartellamt is to prove in individual cases that “the other powers set forth in [the GWB] cannot be expected to appropriately counter the malfunctioning of competition in an effective and lasting manner, given the findings available to the Bundeskartellamt at the time the decision is taken.”

According to the explanatory memorandum, however, the Bundeskartellamt will not be subject to very strict requirements ( “cursory” , “not necessary to conduct any further investigations” ) when setting out grounds for its decision.

Malfunctioning of competition Using a number of (non-exhaustive) examples drawn from complex theories of harm in competition law, which are themselves quite general and open to and in need of interpretation, section 32f(5) GWB attempts to clarify what constitutes a “malfunctioning of competition”.

Depending on the scenario, the examples are intended to be considered either in isolation or cumulatively as part of an overall assessment determining whether there is significant malfunctioning of competition.

They partially draw on the factors relevant for market dominance, but deviate from these in that they include, in particular, market outcomes and behaviours that negatively affect competition in the overall assessment.

Section 32f(5), sentence 1 lists “in particular” four examples of cases in which malfunctioning of competition can take place, namely in the case of unilateral seller or buyer power (no. 1), restrictions on entering or leaving a market or restrictions on company capacity or on switching to another seller or buyer (no. 2), uniform or coordinated behaviour (no. 3) or input or customer foreclosure through vertical relationships (no. 4).

This attempt to be more specific, addresses one of the main criticisms levelled at the initial draft, but still falls short of the mark.

Section 32f(5), sentence 2 GWB sets out a number of additional criteria for analysing individual cases when assessing whether malfunctioning of competition has taken place.

However, these provide neither a binding nor a conclusive framework, but merely a guideline that supplements sentence 1.

Nor do these additional criteria have to be cumulatively met.

Rather, the provision mentions possible indications that competition is malfunctioning (such as cross-ownership of companies (no. 2) as well as prices or volumes, selection and quality of the goods offered (no. 3)).

The degree of market dynamics is also relevant (no. 6).

It is also possible to mount an efficiency defence."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"The degree of market dynamics is also relevant (no. 6).

It is also possible to mount an efficiency defence.

The Amendment makes it clear that the malfunctioning of competition is continuous only “if this malfunctioning has continued or occurred repeatedly over a period of three years and no indications exist at the time of the order under section 3 that it is more likely than not that the malfunctioning will cease within two years.”

A greater degree of uncertainty remains in this respect as well, and predictive decisions by the Bundeskartellamt are necessary.

Who is subject to remedies?

The criteria for determining which companies will be subject to remedies were modified somewhat during the legislative procedure.

Being subject to remedies requires “that [the] companies [...] must have significantly contributed to the malfunctioning of competition through their behaviour and their significance for the market structure” and that “in particular their market position” is taken into account.

This provision should in particular protect smaller market participants from remedies, but not from the sector inquiry itself.

Remedies In terms of legal consequences , the Amendment provides for behavioural or structural remedies to be ordered as a rule, with behavioural remedies taking precedence.

Unlike the preventive merger control, the new market structure control will however allow behavioural remedies to be followed by further control of conduct on a continued basis.

Section 32f(3), sentence 6 GWB lists a number of non-exhaustive and in part far-reaching examples, which include instructing companies to grant access to data, interfaces, networks or other facilities (no. 1), imposing requirements on business relationships (no. 2), obliging companies to establish FRAND standards (no. 3), imposing requirements on contractual arrangements (no. 4), prohibiting the unilateral disclosure of information (no. 5) and, as a structural measure, requiring the unbundling of company or business divisions in accounting or organisational terms (no. 6).

The Bundeskartellamt can therefore give the companies concerned very specific instructions on how to behave in the market and monitor compliance with these instructions in the long term if it believes that they will eliminate malfunctioning of competition in the affected market.

This makes it possible for the Bundeskartellamt to heavily intervene in the markets and impose a wide range of requirements on companies.

Ownership unbundling as last resort The blunt instrument that is the unbundling order under section 32f(4) GWB – which does not require any violation – is to be used as a last resort only under strict application of the principle of proportionality and other procedural steps and only where the serious and ongoing malfunctioning of competition cannot be remedied or significantly reduced by other means.

In response to criticism of the initial draft, this instrument has been limited to dominant companies.

The Amendment sets minimum proceeds of 50% of the business unit’s value as a prerequisite for unbundling and introduces a compensation provision should the proceeds fall short of the value.

This ensures the constitutional concerns about unbundling are taken into account.

Merger control clearance or ministerial authorisation is grandfathered in for ten years for unbundling measures.

Legal protection The legal protection for companies subject to remedies has been strengthened in the course of the legislative procedure.

This means that a company can ask the court to review not only the remedies imposed, but also the decision determining that there has been a malfunction of competition.

However, the sector inquiry as such cannot be contested in isolation.

Appeals against the remedies now also have suspensive effect.

Companies that are subject to remedies can accordingly have them reviewed in court and do not have to implement them immediately."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"Appeals against the remedies now also have suspensive effect.

Companies that are subject to remedies can accordingly have them reviewed in court and do not have to implement them immediately.

They only have to do so once a court has confirmed the Bundeskartellamt’s legal opinion.

The legislator has therefore responded to the harsh criticism raised by legal practitioners and has made allowances for companies’ need for legal protection.

Other aspects Affected companies can offer the Bundeskartellamt commitments that the Bundeskartellamt can then declare to be binding.

It is conceivable that companies may choose this route to avoid a remedial order and a legal dispute.

Given the extent to which it can intervene, the Bundeskartellamt is now obliged to hold a public hearing when imposing remedies in order to grant the right to be heard and comply with the transparency requirement, unless the parties waive this.

Finally, an evaluation clause was added late in the legislative procedure.

This requires the Ministry to report to the legislator on its experience with section 32f GWB ten years after it comes into force.

2. Expanded merger control by way of individual orders (section 32f(2) GWB)

Sector inquiries can also have an impact on merger control.

Under section 32f(2) GWB, concentrations below the thresholds stipulated in section 35 GWB may be subject to notification if the Bundeskartellamt’s sector inquiry has uncovered indications that further concentrations would significantly impede competition in the sector concerned.

In this case, the Bundeskartellamt can oblige companies to notify all concentrations where the acquiring undertaking has turnover of EUR 50 million in Germany and the target has turnover of EUR 1 million.

As per the previous section 39a GWB, the notification obligation and therefore the prohibition to implement a concentration applies for three years from the date of service of the order and may – following a restriction imposed by the Economic Affairs Committee – be extended by three years a maximum of three times.

This new rule applies with retroactive effect to sector inquiries already completed when the Amendment came into force, if the final report was published less than a year beforehand.

This could apply, in particular, to the sector inquiry into non-search online advertising concluded in May 2023 or the ongoing ad hoc sector inquiry into refineries and fuel wholesaling.

3. Simplified disgorgement of benefits (section 34 GWB)

The explanatory memorandum points out that the previous legal hurdles for the disgorgement of benefits were too high in relation to the overall economic damage caused by antitrust violations, and that the relevant provisions were therefore not applied in practice.

For example, the antitrust authorities previously had to carry out complex calculations of the economic benefit and prove that a company acted intentionally or negligently.

The new provision is aimed at making it easier to force companies to disgorge benefits – thereby deterring them from committing antitrust violations.

A double presumption now applies: first, it is presumed that an infringing company that acted intentionally has obtained an economic benefit from its antitrust violation.

Second, there is a blanket presumption that the benefit obtained by the company as a result of the proven antitrust violation amounts to 1% of its domestic turnover with the relevant product or service.

This is, however, capped at 10% of the total annual group turnover worldwide in the year prior to the authority’s decision.

There are very stringent prerequisites for rebutting the blanket presumption.

This can only be done “if the company proves that neither the legal entity directly involved in the violation nor the company as a whole achieved a profit in the relevant amount during the disgorgement period” or “if obtaining a benefit is excluded due to the special nature of the violation”."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"The explanatory memorandum mentions very specific exceptions where the violation does not result in a benefit, e.g. bid-rigging where none of the participating companies is awarded the contract or a violation of the boycott prohibition that goes no further than a “request” without this request being complied with.

Fault is still required, contrary to what was provided in the initial draft.

It remains unclear whether the 1% rule also applies to violations committed before the 11th Amendment entered into force, which is likely to lead to some legal uncertainty in this regard.

Contrary to the proposals of the initial draft, the time limits set in connection with the disgorgement of benefits have not been tightened.

A time limit of seven years (instead of ten) after termination of the violation has therefore been retained.

The maximum disgorgement period remains limited to five years.

The explanatory memorandum points out that the previous legal hurdles for the disgorgement of benefits were too high in relation to the overall economic damage caused by antitrust violations, and that the relevant provisions were therefore not applied in practice.

For example, the antitrust authorities previously had to carry out complex calculations of the economic benefit and prove that a company acted intentionally or negligently.

The new provision is aimed at making it easier to force companies to disgorge benefits – thereby deterring them from committing antitrust violations.

4. Amendment of the procedural provisions relating to the DMA (section 32g GWB)

The Amendment gives the Bundeskartellamt the power to conduct its own investigations into possible violations by gatekeepers of Articles 5, 6 and 7 DMA (cf. section 32g GWB).

However, the Bundeskartellamt can only support the European Commission – without prejudice to the options open to the Bundeskartellamt to take action, pursuant to section 19a GWB, outside the scope of the DMA.

Only the European Commission can find that the DMA has been violated.

The new law also strengthens private enforcement options.

The explanatory memorandum follows the provisions for facilitating private enforcement in antitrust proceedings implemented with the Antitrust Damages Directive.

These are declared applicable in the DMA context where appropriate, and some of the simplifications for civil antitrust actions also apply.

In particular, a final decision of the European Commission finding that the obligations pursuant to Articles 5-7 DMA have been violated has binding effect in follow-on damages proceedings before German courts.

This considerably strengthens Germany’s position as the place of jurisdiction for such lawsuits.

As is also the case under antitrust law, jurisdiction is centralised so that the court divisions responsible for antitrust matters – specifically the civil divisions – also have jurisdiction as far as DMA-related disputes are concerned (sections 87, 89 GWB).

Finally, the Amendment makes it possible for the Bundeskartellamt to take part in court proceedings relating to the DMA. II.

Assessment and outlook The Amendment significantly bolsters the Bundeskartellamt’s powers by adding new intervention mechanisms.

The planned market structure control, which will not be based on violations or abuses, provides antitrust law with a fourth pillar alongside the prohibition of cartels, abuse control and (preventive) merger control, even if a very soft form of subsidiary application is stipulated for section 32f GWB.

All in all, the new law not only tightens German competition law, but represents a paradigm shift.

The legislator considered the previous intervention powers of the competition authorities to be insufficient in cases involving a malfunctioning of competition that lacks a demonstrable violation and could have causes related to market structure."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"In such cases, competition authorities will now not only be able to prevent negative structural changes (merger control), but also to actively promote preferable structures.

Under its current management, however, the Bundeskartellamt has emphasised that it will deal responsibly with the new options and does not want to engage in “market design”.

It is to be hoped that the Bundeskartellamt will maintain this sense of proportion and not allow itself – and its new powers – to be used for political purposes.

It remains unclear whether the gap in the law described by the legislator actually exists, and this was extremely contentious during the legislative procedure, with business associations and some academics and legal practitioners expressing strong doubts.

In any event, the explanatory memorandum does not contain any new arguments in this regard.

It also remains to be seen whether the new fourth pillar will in fact have the practical impact described by the responsible minister.

The Bundeskartellamt itself is assuming that it will conduct in the region of two sector inquiries per year.

Given that there are two stages to the process, it will be some time before the first decisions determining that there has been a malfunctioning of competition are issued and remedies ordered.

The various legal protection options – and the fact that an appeal will have the effect of suspending the ordered remedies – also mean that it will most likely take years before it is clear whether the new intervention mechanism actually has any teeth.

The broader scope of legal protection adopted in the legislative procedure compared to the original draft is an important counterweight to the far-reaching possibilities for intervention by the antitrust authorities – especially since the large number of undefined legal terms in section 32f GWB will no doubt give rise to substantial interpretation issues.

What is in any event to be welcomed is the clarifying, and in some cases mitigating, wording introduced into section 32f GWB – as compared to the initial draft – during the part of the legislative procedure involving the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and the Federal Ministry of Justice ( Bundesministerium der Justiz ) and later the Economic Affairs Committee.

The extension of preventive merger control is consistent with parallel developments at European level.

This is demonstrated by the new stance taken by the European Commission and the General Court ( Illumina/Grail ) on referrals under Article 22 EUMR, also by Member States which did not originally have jurisdiction, as well as the most recent case law of the ECJ ( Towercast ) on the application of Article 102 TFEU to non-notifiable concentrations by national competition authorities.

This significantly reduces legal certainty for corporate acquisitions, especially given the new hurdles created by the expansion of regulatory procedures in connection with foreign investment control and the newly introduced control of third-country subsidies at EU level (Foreign Subsidies Regulation).

It is doubtful whether the simplified disgorgement of benefits, in particular the blanket and more or less irrebuttable presumption that profits are obtained by infringing companies, is constitutional.

This needs to be clarified.

There are still no provisions governing how this relates to civil damages awards or allowing for any privileged treatment of leniency applicants.

These points are to be addressed in a future amendment.

The same applies to the specification of legal privilege in German law.

The Amendment merely implements the first part of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action’s competition policy agenda of 21 February 2022, which sets out ten points for achieving sustainable competition, fleshing out what was agreed in the coalition agreement."
Gleiss Lutz,11TH AMENDMENT TO THE ACT AGAINST RESTRAINTS OF COMPETITION ENTERS INTO FORCE; CONSULTATIONS ON 12TH AMENDMENT BEGIN,"Further elements of the ten-point agenda – such as more legal certainty for cooperations between companies aimed at greater sustainability and stronger consumer protection – are to be addressed in another Amendment before the end of this legislative period.

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action recently launched the consultation process for this: Öffentliche Konsultation zur Modernisierung des Wettbewerbsrechts – Wettbewerb weiter stärken (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz) .

And so change remains constant in antitrust law – and seems to be coming faster and faster."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW EU STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES FOR THE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THIRD COUNTRIES – WHAT COMPANIES NOW NEED TO DO,"On 4 June 2021 the European Commission adopted new rules for the transfer of personal data to recipients in countries outside the EU.

The so-called standard contractual clauses are intended as a tool to allow companies to exchange personal data beyond EU borders without breaching data protection law.

The standard contractual clauses impose special obligations on the contracting parties designed to ensure that the data subjects retain control over “their” data abroad as well.

Existing data protection contracts based on the old standard contractual clauses must now be adjusted to bring them in line with the new law.

Companies do not have much time to make the necessary adjustments.

1. Background Many thousands of companies in the EU use the European Commission's standard contractual clauses as a basis for exchanging data with group companies, business partners and service providers in third countries.

The clauses normally in use to date go back to 2001, 2004 and 2010, i.e. long before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in May 2018.

Over time, the standard contractual clauses have begun to show more and more signs of “old age”: references to the now repealed Data Protection Directive, a lack of clarity as regards the interplay with the requirements for agreements for commissioned data processing and for joint controllership, and the question of their applicability to European processors processing data on behalf of controllers in third countries.

The decision handed down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 16 July 2020 in Schrems II (C-311/18) finally brought home the need for the clauses to be updated.

While the ECJ still found the standard contractual clauses to be basically suitable as a basis for data transfers to “unsafe” third countries, the grounds it gave for its decision revealed the weaknesses of the standard contractual clauses.

Specifically, according to the ECJ, the clauses still in force do not contain any provisions that adequately protect the personal data of EU data subjects from access by foreign security authorities that is disproportionate by European standards.

The grounds for the decision said that additional measures were therefore required if it was to be possible to lawfully transfer data.

What measures it had in mind the ECJ omitted to say, leaving companies and supervisory authorities at a loss for how to proceed.

These new standard contractual clauses represent the European Commission’s attempt to remedy the shortcomings of the old clauses and, as far as possible, bring about legal certainty.

2.

The new standard contractual clauses The new standard contractual clauses only partly fulfil the hope of a return to legal certainty for global data transfers, however: The way the standard contractual clauses work remains the same.

The data protection obligations on EU companies set out in the GDPR are being transformed into contractual provisions, making them binding on the “data importer” in third countries.

In particular, the data importer must cooperate in making data processing transparent and guarantee the data subjects’ key data protection rights.

The details of the data transfer and its purposes, as well as the technical and organisational data protection measures to be implemented by the data importer, are to be described in an annex to the clauses.

Generally speaking, the requirements as to the level of detail are stricter than under the law as it stood before.

Like the previous clauses, in large part the new ones also have the effect of according rights to third party beneficiaries, i.e. persons who are the subject of the data being processed can use the clauses as a basis to assert their rights against the contracting parties and, where applicable, enforce them in EU courts.

The standard contractual clauses take into account the Schrems II ruling and the opinions published by the supervisory authorities on that ruling."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW EU STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES FOR THE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THIRD COUNTRIES – WHAT COMPANIES NOW NEED TO DO,"The standard contractual clauses take into account the Schrems II ruling and the opinions published by the supervisory authorities on that ruling.

They explicitly oblige users to check whether, given the legal situation in the third country, the data importer is in a position to comply with the contractual provisions, in particular to protect against disproportionate access by public authorities.

The parties must document the results of these checks and any technical and organisational measures taken to protect the data (e.g. encryption) and submit them on request to the supervisory authority responsible for the EU company exporting the data.

The data importer is also obliged to notify the data exporter if it considers itself unable (or no longer able) to protect the data from access by public authorities.

Upon receipt of such notification, the exporter must stop transferring the data unless the supervisory authority allows it to continue.

The data importer must also take all measures available by law to defend itself against requests by public authorities for information and inform the data exporter and data subjects thereof.

The new standard contractual clauses are modular in structure.

For each of the following situations, they take a different format: (i) Transfer from a controller in the EU to a processor in a third country (ii) Transfer from a controller in the EU to a controller in a third country (iii) Transfer from a processor in the EU to a controller in a third country (iv) Transfer from a processor in the EU to a sub-processor in a third country.

Standard contractual clauses are now available for the first time for the latter two variants.

One new pragmatic and likely useful feature is the so-called “docking clauses”, which will enable additional parties to accede to the standard contractual clauses.

Another new feature is that the standard contractual clauses provide for liability on the part of the parties for breaches of duty not only vis-à-vis the data subjects, but also in relation to each other.

Whether the parties can exclude or at least limit this liability in terms of their relationship inter se , e.g. in order to adapt it to the liability regime otherwise applicable between them, is unclear.

3. Outlook and need for action The EU Commission's new standard contractual clauses bring up to date what is in practice by far the most important instrument for enabling data to be exchanged with third countries.

They eliminate many ambiguities, and the modular format and the simplified possibility for additional parties to accede to the clauses create valuable flexibility.

However, the standard contractual clauses cannot fully alleviate the high level of legal uncertainty associated with the transfer of personal data to third countries since the ECJ’s ruling in Schrems II .

Where, in a third country such as the USA, China or Russia, there is a – more than just theoretical – risk that security authorities may access the transferred data in a disproportionate manner, and if this risk cannot be eliminated by additional measures such as data encryption, then the new standard contractual clauses cannot legitimize the data transfer either.

Companies that are reliant on the exchange of data with, for example, US group companies or (cloud) service providers therefore still face a dilemma that is difficult to resolve.

That apart, there is a need for action: While companies may still continue to conclude data transfer contracts on the basis of the old clauses for a transitional period of three months from publication of the new standard contractual clauses in the EU Official Journal, all contracts must be brought in line with the new standard contractual clauses within 18 months of publication of the new clauses at the latest.

Especially for companies that maintain extensive business relations with non-EU countries, this represents an enormous challenge."
Gleiss Lutz,OECD RECOMMENDATIONS,"I. Introduction In November 2021 and, given recent international events, somewhat unnoticed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“ OECD ”) adopted the 2021 Recommendation of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (“ 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation ”).

The OECD is an international organisation, uniting governments worldwide, that has taken it upon itself to combat social, economic and environmental challenges.

Since its establishment in 1961, the OECD has developed around 460 legal instruments, many of which have become international standards.

OECD recommendations are not legally binding, but represent a political commitment to the principles they contain and quite often set a certain standard for national legislation.

The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention has a long tradition: It came into force in February 1999 and legally binds its parties to prosecute and impose sanctions on individuals and companies for the bribery of foreign public officials regarding internal business transactions.

The OECD Working Group on Bribery monitors the OECD member countries’ implementation of the Anti-Bribery Convention.

In 2009, the OECD adopted the Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials (“ 2009 Anti-Bribery Recommendation ”), which particularly focused on the supply side of bribery and contained key recommendations for preventing, detecting and investigating allegations of foreign bribery.

Over a decade later and after an extensive review of the impact and updated challenges in the anti-corruption field, the OECD adopted the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation, which now supersedes the 2009 Anti-Bribery Recommendation.

It addresses the OECD member countries and other countries party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.

The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation updates and expands the previous Recommendation and emphasizes the importance of continuously enforcing anti-bribery measures.

Below we have summarized the key elements of the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation in order to encourage businesses to include the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation when evaluating their anti-bribery procedures.

II.

Key elements of the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation Whereas the 2009 Anti-Bribery Recommendation focused on the “supply side” of bribery, i.e. the business side handing out bribes, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation focuses, inter alia, on the opposite, i.e. “demand side”, as well as international cooperation, exclusion of non-trial resolutions in foreign bribery cases and incentivising anti-corruption compliance in companies as well as the protection of whistleblowers.

1. Addressing the demand side The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation includes a new section on the solicitation and acceptance of bribes by foreign officials.

The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation emphasises the need for more awareness of bribe solicitation (and acceptance) among relevant public officials.

It recommends that member countries, inter alia, raise awareness of bribe solicitation risks and provide training to public officials posted aboard.

The section on the demand side particularly mentions small facilitation payments with the recommendation that member countries review their policies and approach on small facilitation payments.

Most importantly from the business side, it is recommended that companies should be encouraged to prohibit or discourage the use of facilitation payments, as they are generally illegal in the countries where they are made.

The demanding and taking of bribes by (foreign) public officials, including European public officials, is subject to sanction under the Criminal Code (secs. 

332, 334, 335a).

The German legislator is therefore aware of the corruption risks related to public authorities and we do not expect any changes of the law in that regard."
Gleiss Lutz,OECD RECOMMENDATIONS,"332, 334, 335a).

The German legislator is therefore aware of the corruption risks related to public authorities and we do not expect any changes of the law in that regard.

2. Sanctions and confiscation As already the case in Germany, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation further encourages its member states to confiscate and freeze profits of bribes and proceeds.

However, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation goes even further and recommends publishing resolved cases of bribery of foreign officials, including the main facts, the natural or legal persons sanctioned, the approved sanctions, and the basis for applying such sanctions (“naming and shaming”).

Additionally, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation states that good corporate behaviour should be promoted and rewarded by member states.

Potential mitigating factors expressly mentioned are voluntary, timely and full disclosure to law enforcement authorities and full cooperation, acceptance of responsibility as well as timely and appropriate remediation.

The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation aims at making the solicitation of bribes as risky as possible, including “public naming and shaming” which has been introduced in other areas (e.g. insider dealing (cf. publications of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)).

While appreciating the objective of the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation, public naming and shaming would result in the introduction of a further sanction, which – unlike ""conventional"" sanctions – cannot be appropriately quantified and might, more often than not, overstep the mark.

Naming and shaming should therefore be rejected.

3. Non-trial resolutions The 2021 Recommendation also suggests further developing non-trial resolutions, commonly referred to as settlements, which often lead to speedier results.

Non-trial resolutions are based on a negotiated agreement between a natural or legal person and a prosecuting/public authority, following the principles of due process, transparency and accountability.

Such non-trial agreements might have a global effect and encourage companies to agree to them, in particular to avoid proceedings and sanctions in more than one jurisdiction (double jeopardy, cf. below).

German authorities do not have non-prosecution or deferred prosecution agreements in their tool box so far.

Nevertheless, there is a practical need for settlement options.

Against this background, fines and confiscation orders are, in practice, often negotiated with investigating authorities; in the course of such a “settlement”, the companies concerned often waive possible legal remedies.

4. Tax deductibility The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation also emphasizes that bribes to foreign public officials should not be tax-deductible, which was introduced in Germany many years ago.

If companies identify past bribe payments, their management is regularly obliged to correct their tax statements, sec. 

153 German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung) – thereby being required to disclose undue payments in the past.

5.

International cooperation The newly introduced chapter on international cooperation goes hand in hand with the one on non-trial resolutions.

Member states cooperate internationally in investigating and prosecuting bribery and corruption, e.g. by sharing information, entering into agreements for mutual international assistance, and even considering cooperating with countries that are not party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.

The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation encourages the member countries to partake in a proactive approach in seeking international cooperation and expressly highlights the risk of double jeopardy in multijurisdictional cases.

In practice, investigating authorities are increasingly cooperating internationally (at least in significant cases).

Against this background, the regulations to avoid double jeopardy in an international context are currently inadequate."
Gleiss Lutz,OECD RECOMMENDATIONS,"Against this background, the regulations to avoid double jeopardy in an international context are currently inadequate.

With respect to data protection and international cooperation, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation states that data protection laws should not “unduly impede the effectiveness” of any international cooperation regarding compliance.

6. Reporting foreign bribery With a similar aim as the EU Whistleblower Directive, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation further highlights the importance of protecting reporting persons as they often play an essential role in exposing bribery of foreign officials.

It encourages the member countries to establish procedures enabling confidential and anonymous reporting including a legal framework to protect reporting persons and prevent retaliation.

The German legislator will most likely implement a national law meeting the requirements of the EU Whistleblower Directive sometime this year.

We assume that the German act will include a procedure for reporting all kinds of breaches of the law, including bribery and corruption – including but not limited to cases involving (foreign) public officials.

7. Accounting requirements, external audit, and internal controls, ethics and compliance Apart from adequate accounting requirements, such as independent external audits, the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation urges member states to encourage companies to implement and publicly disclose appropriate internal anti-corruption compliance measures as a whole and particularly with regard to preventing and detecting foreign bribery.

This also applies to business organisations and professional associations.

Member countries should incentivise the implementation of such internal controls by considering such measures when granting public advantages, and as a mitigating factor in the context of enforcing measures combating foreign bribery and related offences.

Meanwhile, corresponding control systems can often be a relevant factor in the assessment of fines.

8.

Public advantages, including public procurement Member countries should consider “blacklisting” companies that have bribed foreign officials from competing for public contracts or other public advantages.

Information on such offences should be available to relevant government authorities.

Such blacklisting already takes place in Germany today.

9.

Update of the Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics and Compliance The OECD also updated its Good Practice Guidance on Internal Control, Ethics and Compliance (“ Guidance ”) which is included as Annex II to the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation.

The Guidance addresses companies and covers good practices for effective internal compliance.

It highlights the necessity to individualise the compliance programme according to the circumstances of the company, e.g. business model, sales organization and country-related risks, as well as the need for regular monitoring and re-assessment.

Good practice includes, for example, a clear internal commitment to a culture of compliance, the autonomy of compliance officers, risk-based due diligence of acquisition targets and business partners and regular monitoring – all elements that any company with an adequate compliance culture should operate on.

III.

Conclusion/ Comment With the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation the OECD reiterated its will to fight bribery and corruption globally and to strengthen the enforcement of measures combating foreign bribery.

The OECD follows a holistic approach by addressing the member states and companies directly.

It is unlikely that Germany will have to amend its laws and practices based on the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation, yet we expect the 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendation to set the tone with respect to international compliance standards.

In a more and more digitalized environment, corruptions risks have been appearing in different guises and creating new challenges."
Gleiss Lutz,OECD RECOMMENDATIONS,"In a more and more digitalized environment, corruptions risks have been appearing in different guises and creating new challenges.

The 2021 Anti-Bribery Recommendations has generally recognized this trend.

Whether the recommended measures will actually lead to a noticeable reduction in corruption, however, remains to be seen."
Gleiss Lutz,SEP-USERS: TAKE ACTION NOW – EU COMMISSION CONSULTS PATENT HOLDERS AND USERS OF STANDARDS REGARDING STANDARD-ESSENTIAL PATENTS,"The European Commission is currently conducting a public consultation on standard - essential patents (“SEPs”) (see link ).

The Commission also issued a call for evidence for an impact assessment concerning the main problems identified by it as affecting the licensing of SEPs.

These consultations will lay the groundwork for the Commission’s intended regulation of SEP licensing and enforcement.

Both procedures will run until 9 May 2022.

Background The Commission defines SEPs as patents that protect technology essential to a standard.

In order to include a patent in a standard, the respective patent holders must commit to licensing the technology protected by the relevant SEP to others on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms and conditions.

Conflicts between SEP holders and standard users (SEP implementers) have steadily increased over the last decade.

It is to be expected that these conflicts will continue to increase and escalate when it comes to IoT/5G. The Commission is now examining the issue and has launched a public consultation and a call for evidence for an impact assessment.

With this initiative, the Commission has set itself the goal of creating a new framework for SEPs that provides fair and balanced general conditions for licensing.

It aims to achieve this by combining legislative measures, such as a regulation, with non-legislative measures.

The Commission already identified a need for action in its 2017 Communication setting out the EU approach to Standard Essential Patents (see link ) (for more details, see also Gleiss Lutz, "" Die EU-Guidelines zur Nutzung von standardessenziellen Patenten für das Internet of Things (IoT) "" at link ).

The Commission is focusing on three aspects: improving the efficiency of SEP enforcement, enhancing transparency and providing more clarity on FRAND terms and conditions.

To this end, the Commission is now consulting stakeholders, ranging from SEP holders and implementers to patent-pool administrators and industry associations.

The Commission wants to find out if new regulations and/or antitrust requirements are needed, for example to increase the efficiency of SEP licensing.

Public consultation and call for evidence for an impact assessment The Commission is using the public consultation as an opportunity to identify the issues that are particularly relevant for the licensing of SEPs.

Its questionnaire addresses various aspects, only a few of which are covered below.

Lack of transparency and predictability The Commission addresses the obvious problem that there are no databases with detailed, up-to-date and easily accessible information on SEPs.

This leads to uncertainty about whether a patent is actually essential to the standard and which SEP is essential for which part of the standard.

This uncertainty primarily affects SEP implementers, as they often do not know, when developing and launching their products, for which – and for whose – patents they would have to acquire a licence at all.

This means that it is not possible – or very difficult – to determine the amount of any royalties beforehand or to factor these into the cost of product development.

The Commission therefore raises the question of whether and, if so, what information should be made publicly available by both sides (SEP holders and SEP implementers).

For instance, the SEP holder could publicly provide information on possible changes of holder, product categories that use the standard, licensing programmes or standard FRAND terms and conditions.

Patent pools could also make information publicly available – for example, the standards that form part of the pool, a list of certified SEPs, licensed products, existing SEP holders or licensees.

The Commission also points out that there is currently no “quality control” by independent third parties, for example to determine whether the patent is (still) essential."
Gleiss Lutz,SEP-USERS: TAKE ACTION NOW – EU COMMISSION CONSULTS PATENT HOLDERS AND USERS OF STANDARDS REGARDING STANDARD-ESSENTIAL PATENTS,"The Commission also points out that there is currently no “quality control” by independent third parties, for example to determine whether the patent is (still) essential.

It therefore aims to establish to what extent checks by such independent third parties of whether a patent is in fact essential could be useful and beneficial and which authority or body would be best placed to carry these out.

Transparent FRAND terms and conditions A further objective is to eliminate uncertainties about which licensing terms and conditions qualify as FRAND.

For SEP implementers, the lack of publicly available information on FRAND licensing terms and conditions makes it difficult to factor licensing costs into their business models.

It also makes it harder for SEP holders to forecast their potential revenue.

The Commission therefore proposes granting judges and arbitrators access to confidential licence agreements in order to better determine FRAND royalties.

It also aims to identify what impact implementing the same standard in different ways may have on FRAND terms and conditions – and, for example, what type of discounts could be granted without being discriminatory.

Where in the value chain should licensing take place?

The Commission explicitly addresses the question of where in the value chain licensing should take place and the potential consequences that may arise from choosing to license at a given stage.

It looks at various potential structures, for example licensing at the beginning/end of the chain, at a given component level, or at the product level at which the most functions of the standardised technology are relevant, etc.

Insight into licensing negotiations The Commission also wants to understand how licensing negotiations between SEP holders and SEP implementers take place.

The first aspect concerns the length of licensing negotiations – that is, the time between first contact and the licensing of the patent – and the problems that arise during this period.

In this context, the Commission also focuses on the different stages in licensing negotiations established in case law (declaration of interest in concluding a licence agreement under FRAND terms and conditions; written offer of FRAND terms and conditions from the SEP holder; response from the SEP implementer; etc.) and aims to establish how long each stage lasts and at which stages or under which circumstances there is still a need for clarification.

The Commission is also seeking information on the costs associated with determining which or how many SEPs potential implementers require (for example, the costs of searching patent databases, assessing the enforceability, validity and ownership of the SEP and whether or not it is essential).

The question also arises as to why SEP implementers then decide not to use a standard (for example, because there are alternative technologies available under better terms and conditions, because royalties are too high, because the SEP holder refuses to grant a licence, or because the costs of negotiation and possible legal disputes are too high).

The Commission explicitly addresses “hold-out” (the opportunistic behaviour of SEP implementers who, for example, delay the conclusion of a licence agreement as long as possible or refuse to pay royalties until they are ordered to do so by a court) and “hold-up” (the opportunistic behaviour of SEP holders who exploit their market power to obtain excessive royalties or conditions).

In practice, it is not always clear when a given situation can be considered “hold-out” or “hold up” behaviour, and the Commission describes a range of potential scenarios.

Legal protection Finally, the Commission addresses the question of whether sufficient legal protection is available (in particular against “hold-out” and “hold-up”) and, if so, what practical problems may arise in connection with dissenting court rulings or injunctions."
Gleiss Lutz,SEP-USERS: TAKE ACTION NOW – EU COMMISSION CONSULTS PATENT HOLDERS AND USERS OF STANDARDS REGARDING STANDARD-ESSENTIAL PATENTS,"Ultimately, different courts may adopt different interpretations of both the concept of FRAND itself and the process for negotiating FRAND terms and conditions.

The Commission also sees a risk of high enforcement costs or inefficient enforcement of SEPs.

Conclusion The public consultation and call for evidence as part of the Commission’s impact assessment should be welcomed.

They offer users of standards a good opportunity to draw attention to issues around SEP licensing negotiations and the legal disputes that may follow.

Companies that are or may be affected should therefore participate in the consultation process while this is still underway to ensure that their concerns are heard.

All major SEP holders are likely to take part in the consultations.

It is therefore all the more important for SEP implementers, the users of the standards, to share their own experiences and contribute suggestions for improvement to ensure a balanced solution.

We therefore strongly recommend that all users of technical standards complete the Commission’s questionnaire or respond to its requests for feedback."
Gleiss Lutz,ENERGY CRISIS – THE LATEST AMENDMENTS TO THE ENERGY SECURITY ACT AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTE,"In recent months, there has been much coverage of the gas emergency plan and its three levels – early warning, alert and emergency, with the focus often being on government-imposed gas rationing measures that may be triggered if the emergency level is declared.

But on top of these, there are also other gas supply security measures that would have a serious impact on companies that are significantly dependent on gas.

The government recently changed the law to make it possible to introduce a levy ( Umlage ) and adjust prices, and this is likely to result in very significant additional costs for gas-consuming companies.

To ensure preparedness for a further escalation of the energy crisis, companies should take action early on to assess the available legal remedies in the face of government-imposed gas rationing and other additional costs resulting from government measures.

Three different mechanisms for securing the supply of gas In July 2022, the legislator introduced further regulatory measures to secure gas supplies ( see newsletter from 20.

July 2022 ).

As the legislation currently stands, companies must prepare for three mechanisms and consider the possibilities available to defend themselves against them in court: Levy system (section 26 Energy Security Act ( Energiesicherungsgesetz , “EnSiG”)), Price adjustment by the energy provider (section 24 Energy Security Act), and Official rationing by the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency).

Levy system In July, the legislator created a legal basis for the financial stabilisation of ailing energy providers that are system-relevant when it comes to the security of supply (section 29 EnSiG).

A levy system (section 26 EnSiG) has also been introduced; the new ordinance necessary for that was adopted by the Federal Cabinet on 4 August 2022 and it is scheduled to enter into force by 9 August.

It is a temporary measure, remaining in force until 30 September 2024 ( BMWK - Bundeskabinett verabschiedet zeitlich befristete

Gas-Umlage für sichere Wärmeversorgung im

Herbst und Winter ).

The levy gives gas importers the opportunity to obtain financial compensation for the high cost of sourcing alternative supplies of gas.

Gas importers must apply to the so-called market area manager (Trading Hub Europe) for compensation and the costs will subsequently be passed on to all gas consumers.

The resulting price increases will not only affect individual gas customers, therefore; quite the opposite: The very purpose of the levy is to apportion the costs for the sourcing of alternative supplies equally across all gas customers.

The levy will apply from 1 October 2022 to 1 April 2024.

System-wise, the mechanism is based on previous levy-based regimes such as the renewables levy and the combined heat and power levy, but is not intended to provide any relief for major consumers.

Only limited legal remedies are available to customers of energy providers to protest the increase in prices via the levy.

The price increase is not being set unilaterally by the energy provider, but on the basis of a legal ordinance implemented by the Federal Government.

Anyone affected by the price increase is free to take individual legal action by way of seeking an incidental review ( Inzidentkontrolle ), i.e. by filing an action in connection with the gas bill that includes the levy in the price (in particular an action for a judgment declaring the price increases to be unreasonable or a defence of an action for payment by the energy provider).

A general judicial review ( Normenkontrolle ), in which a court decides – centrally and uniformly – on the validity of a regulation for all those affected, is not available as a remedy against federal ordinances.

One must also bear in mind that, substantively, there is only limited scope for subjecting price increases set by the Federal Government as part of the levy system to judicial review."
Gleiss Lutz,ENERGY CRISIS – THE LATEST AMENDMENTS TO THE ENERGY SECURITY ACT AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTE,"One must also bear in mind that, substantively, there is only limited scope for subjecting price increases set by the Federal Government as part of the levy system to judicial review.

The legislator simply requires the Federal Government to ensure that the levy system introduced by the ordinance is transparent and non-discriminatory and gives due consideration to consumers’ interests.

Although these criteria are subject to judicial review, they are so vague that a legal action against the levy and its amount, especially in injunction proceedings, must be well prepared and will only be successful if blatant violations are shown to have been committed.

Price adjustment by the energy provider As a second option, the law still gives energy providers a right to adjust prices themselves (section 24 EnSiG).

There are two requirements to be met before prices can be adjusted:

First, the alarm or emergency level of the gas emergency plan must have been declared ( see newsletter from 20.

July 2022 ).

The Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection already declared the second, i.e. alarm, level on 23 June 2022, meaning that this requirement has been met.

The other requirement, which has not been met to date, is a formal determination by the Bundesnetzagentur that there has been a significant reduction in total gas import volumes to Germany.

This decision is at the discretion of the authorities and must be published in the Federal Gazette.

If both requirements are met, all the energy providers concerned along the whole length of the supply chain will be given the right to adjust the prices they charge their customers for gas to an “appropriate level”.

The energy provider must notify its customers of the price adjustment in good time before it comes into force, stating its reasons for making price adjustments.

For end consumers, the minimum period between notification and entry into force of the price increase is one week, for other customers in the supply chain one day.

Price adjustments could therefore follow quickly on the heels of a formal determination by the Bundesnetzagentur .

As a general principle, the right to adjust prices is intended to be secondary to the stabilisation measures and the levy mechanism.

Once the aforementioned ordinance on the levy system has entered into force, initially the gas providers may no longer exercise their right to adjust their prices.

It remains to be seen whether the Federal Government will fall back on the individual price adjustment rights of energy providers after the planned activation of the levy system; it is not out of the question, either after the ordinance expires on 1 October 2024 or if the ordinance is repealed before then.

The law does not put any clear limits on these price adjustment rights – it simply says that the adjustments must be appropriate.

The test of appropriateness is by its very nature vague and opens up a gateway for judicial review.

The EnSiG uses a negative criterion to define appropriateness, stating that a price adjustment ceases to be appropriate in particular at the point where it exceeds the additional costs incurred by the energy provider in question for sourcing an alternative to supply to customers due to the reduction in the volumes of gas imported.

The price increases are to be kept within a range that covers the actual additional costs and should not be used to generate profit.

When laying down the details of the right to adjust prices, the legislator fell back on the provisions of the German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, “BGB” ) on the unilateral right to specify performance.

The amount of the price adjustment is determined unilaterally by the energy provider and communicated to the customer.

The customer has the right to require the energy provider to review and, if necessary, immediately adjust the price to an appropriate level every two months after the price change takes effect."
Gleiss Lutz,ENERGY CRISIS – THE LATEST AMENDMENTS TO THE ENERGY SECURITY ACT AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTE,"The customer has the right to require the energy provider to review and, if necessary, immediately adjust the price to an appropriate level every two months after the price change takes effect.

The energy provider must announce the result of its review within two weeks, whereby it must also take into account any cost reductions that have occurred in the meantime.

A large number of court cases are to be expected on the back of the price adjustments.

Where a customer still considers the price increase to be unreasonable, they can take legal action against the energy provider to have the price increase declared “inappropriate”.

Legal actions by energy providers against customers who fail to pay the price increases are also conceivable.

The EnSiG states that disputes over price adjustments are to be settled in the ordinary courts of law; actions by or against energy providers are to be brought before the courts that have local jurisdiction in the particular case.

Though this could initially lead to some inconsistency in the rulings handed down across the various courts, it has the advantage that there is not one single judiciary body that will be subjected from the start to an avalanche of injunction applications.

Official gas rationing by the Bundesnetzagentur The state already exerts influence on the market through the rules on the levy system and on price adjustments.

If the energy crisis worsens and the Federal Government declares the emergency level of the gas emergency plan, the state can also intervene directly in the market by taking genuine sovereign measures (section 1(1), no. 1 in conjunction with section 4(4) EnSiG) because that then makes the Bundesnetzagentur what is referred to as the federal load distributor.

It then decides which gas-consuming companies will have their “gas tap turned off”.

To date, there is no fixed order of shutdown; there is currently talk of different criteria that the Bundesnetzagentur could use as a basis for its decisions.

For the emergency level to be declared and for the Bundesnetzagentur to take on the function of federal load distributor, a further legal ordinance is required, which will then presumably set out the shutdown criteria.

Consideration will also have to be given to the shutdown criteria the EU gas emergency plan provides for in its final version ( see newsletter from 22.

July 2022 ).

A significant wave of lawsuits can be expected, should state gas rationing be introduced.

Even simply from the perspective of the responsibility and liability incumbent on executive boards, supervisory boards and managing directors, it may make sense to have a state shutdown order reviewed by the courts.

A legal remedy of this kind against the direct state measure could be a prerequisite for a possible (official) liability claim against the state.

Unlike with the legal remedies against the levy or the price increases by the energy providers, however, it is not the regional courts (whether at the energy provider’s seat or at the gas delivery point) that have jurisdiction for actions against shutdown orders, but just one (cartel) division of the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf for all reductions in the supply of gas in the territory of the Federal Republic.

It is possible that this division will be overloaded.

Major gas consumers should lay the groundwork for taking legal action, but at the same time recognise that, even in injunction proceedings, they may not secure timely and thus effective legal protection.

Here, too, it is advisable to prepare early for such a scenario.

Conclusion No one can say for sure at this stage how the gas supply situation in Germany will evolve.

With the levy system and, at the next level down, the statutory right to adjust prices, the legislator is relying on price signals to nudge consumers into using gas sparingly.

State-imposed gas rationing will be the last resort after these measures."
Gleiss Lutz,ENERGY CRISIS – THE LATEST AMENDMENTS TO THE ENERGY SECURITY ACT AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTE,"State-imposed gas rationing will be the last resort after these measures.

Both state-imposed price increases in the form of a levy or a price adjustment and state-ordered reductions in gas supply can be reviewed in court.

As there are already signs that measures aimed at securing gas supplies may be triggered within a matter of days, gas-consuming companies should not only prepare for the actual consequences of a gas shortage, but also for possibly taking legal action against related measures.

The groundwork for legal remedies of this kind can already be laid now, e.g. by developing lines of argument internally and collating evidence."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GAS AND HEAT PRICE BRAKE AND DECEMBER EMERGENCY AID: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"On 15 December 2022, the Bundestag passed the gas and heat price brake in order to curb rising energy costs.

This will be supplemented by emergency aid granted for December 2022.

And it is not just consumers who will benefit from these measures, companies will too.

The following aims to answer key questions about these measures: I.

What are the legal regulations behind the gas and heat price brake?

Step 1: On 10 November 2022, the Bundestag adopted the Gas and Heat Emergency Aid Act ( Erdgas-Wärme-Soforthilfegesetz , “EWSG”) , and this came into force on 19 November 2022.

Household customers and businesses with an annual consumption of up to 1.5 million kWh will benefit from emergency aid for gas and heat costs in December 2022.

This is supposed to bridge the period until the gas and heat price brake comes into force.

Step 2: The gas and heat price brake has now also been introduced in a second step by the Gas and Heat Price Brake Act (Erdgas-Wärme-Preisbremsengesetz, “EWPBG”) .

For SMEs with low to medium gas consumption, the price brake will not apply until March 2023, but is then to be applied retroactively to the months of January and February 2023.

For industrial gas and heat customers (“industrial customers”), the price break will already apply from January 2023.

II.

Who will benefit from these measures?

1.

Gas and Heat Emergency Aid Act (EWSG)

The emergency aid is geared towards end consumers of gas, i.e. natural or legal persons who purchase gas for their own consumption.

Companies will benefit from this if their gas consumption is billed via standard load profiles ( Standardlastprofile , “SLP”) or, in the case of real-time metering ( registrierende Leistungsmessung , “RLM”) , if (not: insofar as) their annual consumption per withdrawal point does not exceed 1.5 million kWh .

This limit was chosen because RLM customers with consumption levels in excess of 1.5 million kWh are generally designated as industrial customers, which are not to receive support under step 1.

Furthermore, the emergency aid is not intended for end consumers using gas for the commercial operation of electricity and heat generation plants, which means that electricity power plants in particular are not eligible for this.

If a company uses gas for other commercial purposes (e.g. to heat its sales premises), this in itself will not rule out the possibility of the company benefitting from the aid package.

In the heat sector, customers of heat supply companies will also receive the emergency aid if (not: insofar as) their annual consumption does not exceed 1.5 million kWh (per withdrawal point).

However, as an exception, the emergency aid may be granted to particularly vulnerable consumers (e.g. hospitals) even if they exceed the limit.

2. Gas and Heat Price Brake Act (EWPBG)

This Act is intended to cover industrial customers in addition to the household customers and businesses covered by the EWSG.

Support for companies that are already eligible under step 1 is not conditional on the emergency aid for December 2022 actually having been received.

III.

How will the emergency aid or price brake work?

1.

Gas and Heat Emergency Aid Act (EWSG) Gas or heat customers do not have to apply in order to receive the financial support.

Instead, suppliers are obliged by law to credit the relevant amount.

Taking the emergency aid for gas customers as an example, this means that the gas supplier must credit the relief amount to gas customers for each of their withdrawal points.

The credited amount can be offset against the actual contractual costs in a number of ways; SLP customers (only) will receive a provisional benefit from the gas supplier , i.e. the instalment for December does not have to be paid.

The support is financed by the German government, but it is the suppliers which are solely responsible for ensuring that entitled consumers benefit from this."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GAS AND HEAT PRICE BRAKE AND DECEMBER EMERGENCY AID: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"The support is financed by the German government, but it is the suppliers which are solely responsible for ensuring that entitled consumers benefit from this.

However, although natural gas suppliers generally have a legal obligation in this regard, companies should check their eligibility independently and monitor the process closely so that they can quickly rectify any application errors made by natural gas suppliers – which are already bogged down by red tape.

If SLP customers are not required to pay the instalment for December, they should take care to ensure that a payment is not triggered unintentionally (e.g. because a standing order is not suspended).

RLM gas customers must keep in mind that they bear some responsibility for receiving the emergency aid, as they must inform their suppliers by 31 December 2022 that they have fulfilled the requirements.

2. Gas and Heat Price Brake Act (EWPBG)

The financial support provided under the EWBPG will be handled using a mechanism similar to that for the emergency aid for gas customers.

A relief amount to be determined by the supplier will credited to the gas or heat customer on a monthly basis in this case, too; RLM customers bear more responsibility because they are required to make various notifications to their suppliers.

Certain end consumers, for example, must notify their suppliers if, by way of exception, they are not they are not eligible under sanctions law or because they themselves are energy producers.

Cooperation with authorities may also be necessary, also by way of exception, primarily to determine special, qualified eligibility to receive support.

Large industrial consumers often do not procure natural gas from natural gas suppliers, but rather directly from a wholesaler, on exchanges, or on OTC platforms.

Relief for such consumption will not be provided via contracting partners on the energy market; instead, the end consumer itself will be treated as a natural gas supplier and must assert claim to the reimbursement of monthly relief payments by the Federal Republic of Germany, to which a quarterly advance payment entitlement applies.

There are additional circumstances that may apply depending on corporate structure; for this reason, it may be necessary to submit an application .

IV.

How is the amount of support calculated?

1.

Gas and Heat Emergency Aid Act (EWSG)

The Act does not specify an absolute figure, but ultimately aims to cover the gas costs for one-twelfth of 2022 and therefore the gas instalment payment for December 2022.

In the gas sector, this will not be based on the actual gas consumption in December 2022, but rather on one-twelfth of the annual consumption forecast by the gas supplier in September 2022 (for SLP customers) or one-twelfth of the measured withdrawal from the grid from November 2021 up to and including October 2022 (for RLM customers).

This figure will be multiplied by the gas price contractually agreed as of 1 December 2022 (including labour-related and other price components accruing pro rata for December 2022).

In the heat sector, contracts are structured differently to those for networked gas, and the relief for December 2022 will therefore be granted in the form of a one-off payment based on the amount of the instalment paid in September 2022.

2. Gas and Heat Price Brake Act (EWPBG)

The price brake is to apply for the entire year 2023 at least, and the Act contains an option to extend that period through April 2024.

The EWPBG lays down a guaranteed gross gas price of 12 ct/kWh (industrial customers: 7 ct/kWh) for a certain percentage of gas consumption, with the relief amount to be credited on a monthly basis.

The guaranteed price will apply to 80% of the annual consumption (industrial customers: 70%) forecast by the gas supplier for the withdrawal point concerned in September 2022, with the contractually agreed kWh price applying to any gas consumption above this.

The same mechanism is to apply to heat."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GAS AND HEAT PRICE BRAKE AND DECEMBER EMERGENCY AID: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"The same mechanism is to apply to heat.

The guaranteed gross heat price is 9.5 ct/kWh gross (industrial customers: 7.5 ct/kWh net) applicable to 80% of the annual consumption forecast by the heat supplier in September 2022 or, for industrial customers, 70% of the heat quantity measured for the 2021 calendar year at the withdrawal point concerned.

The relief amount received does not have to be paid back , even if the actual consumption in the year-end statement differs from the assumed amount.

However, the relief will be granted subject to the proviso that it may be recovered .

Finally, it should be noted that for reasons relating to EU state aid law, absolute and relative maximum relief limits will apply under the EWBPG that must not be exceeded overall (several withdrawal points are not to be considered separately).

The maximum permissible relief amount includes all state aid for additional costs due to the exceptional increase in energy prices – and therefore also includes relief granted under the electricity price brake, for example.

The maximum limit is EUR 4 million (absolute amount) for regular companies, or 50% of crisis-related additional energy costs .

Final consumers who are determined by a (federal) audit authority yet to be specified (likely the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle , “BAFA”)) to be particularly affected by high energy prices can receive support of up to EUR 100 million or 40% of crisis-related additional energy costs.

If the audit authority additionally determines that a final consumer is energy intensive , other arrangements apply.

In certain cases, support can total EUR 150 million or 80% of the crisis-related additional energy costs.

There are various obligations to cooperate with and notify suppliers and the audit authority that must be observed; non-adherence to these obligations is subject to fine.

V. What framework conditions must be observed?

The right to be credited the amount of the relief arises directly from the Act if the prerequisites laid down therein are met.

Unlike the coronavirus assistance, the financial support is not dependent on additional funding guidelines.

However, the EWPBG itself contains a series of restrictions.

For reasons relating to state aid law, no support may be granted if EU sanctions have been imposed on the company or its affiliated persons, organisations or institutions.

The receipt of relief of more than EUR 2 million is linked to a job retention obligation.

After much wrangling, the Bundestag finally also passed a limited ban on bonuses and dividends that will only apply once a relief amount of EUR 25 million has actually been claimed.

From this amount onwards, variable compensation components and increases in the fixed salaries paid to members of corporate bodies on or before 31 December 2023 will only be able to be paid if they were agreed before 1 December 2022.

If a relief amount in excess of EUR 50 million is utilised, the payment of variable compensation components and increases in fixed salaries paid to corporate bodies as well as the distribution of dividends is generally excluded until after 31 December 2023.

VI.

European gas price cap The European Union is working in parallel on the introduction of a gas price cap , causing controversy among Member States.

The European Commission has presented a draft regulation introducing a market correction mechanism that is being negotiated by EU energy ministers.

The market price correction mechanism takes a different approach than the German gas price brake.

While the gas price brake accepts market prices and aims to dampen them by providing subsidies to final consumers, the gas price cap represents direct intervention in market prices."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN GAS AND HEAT PRICE BRAKE AND DECEMBER EMERGENCY AID: A LEGAL OVERVIEW,"While the gas price brake accepts market prices and aims to dampen them by providing subsidies to final consumers, the gas price cap represents direct intervention in market prices.

It foresees temporarily capping the price of month-ahead derivatives under the TTF European Gas Spot Index at EUR 275 if prices remain above that threshold for a period of two weeks and exceed a pre-determined ratio against LNG prices.

In theory, the two mechanisms can exist alongside each other.

However, it is not yet clear how they will act in combination or what economic policy consequences the introduction of the market correction mechanism will have.

VII.

Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY’S “EASTER PACKAGE” – AN OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST CHANGES TO ENERGY REGULATION,"The German energy reform bill – known as the “Easter Package” – has finally been adopted and gives shape to the coalition’s political aspirations.

Recent developments mean that renewables are no longer important simply in terms of climate policy but are also a matter of national security.

The reform is aimed boosting the transformation of the energy industry.

Gleiss Lutz commentary The Easter Package is set to reshape German energy law, triggering extensive changes to the German Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz , EnWG), the German Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz , EEG) and the German Offshore Wind Energy Act ( Windenergie-auf-See-Gesetz , WindSeeG).

It is the biggest energy policy reform in decades, with the following aims and anticipated impact : Greater renewables capacity will be put up for tender, increasing the number of development projects.

The country’s renewables capacity is expected to double.

A commitment to dedicate 2% of land mass to onshore wind capacity will provide more space for wind power generation.

Approval procedures for new wind turbines will be simplified and accelerated.

Harmonisation of surcharges will simplify district and on-site supply models.

Prequalification of bidders in offshore auctions and the requirements of the special equalisation scheme will strengthen the power purchase agreement (PPA) market.

Eliminating the EEG surcharge will reduce the burden on businesses and consumers.

Conditions for energy-intensive users under the special equalisation scheme will be simplified.

However, the elimination of the EEG surcharge means this will play a less important role.

Financial support for green hydrogen power generation and hydrogen-based electricity storage will be increased.

Non-EU investors should coordinate in advance with the Federal Network Agency to determine their eligibility to bid on renewables.

Expansion of renewable energies The Easter Package focusses on the expansion of renewables.

The targets for renewables have been increased, with at least 80% of Germany’s gross electricity consumption to stem from renewables by 2030.

Early drafts of the legislation went so far as to include a renewables target of 100% for electricity by 2035, but this was scrapped during the final rounds of deliberations.

The target of generating at least 80% of Germany’s gross electricity consumption from renewables by 2030 is highly ambitious.

With the current share standing at about 49%, virtually as much renewable capacity will have to be added in the next eight years as during the last 30 years.

Increasing electrification means that demand for electricity will also continue to rise – the German government expects demand for renewable electricity to reach 600 TWh by 2030.

In pursuit of the 80%, auction volumes have been adjusted: Capacity from solar installations is to be gradually increased from 59 GW at the end of 2021 to 400 GW by 2040.

The auction volumes for solar installations on buildings and noise barriers are 650 MW for 2023, 900 MW for 2024 and 1,100 MW annually from 2025 to 2029.

For freestanding installations and installations on other structures, the volumes are 5,850 MW for 2023, 8,100 MW for 2024 and 9,900 MW annually from 2025 to 2029.

The previous EEG 2021 provided for volumes of 1,650 MW (2023-2025) and 1,550 MW (2026-2028), meaning that the new volumes indicate a yet more definite shift towards solar energy.

The auction volumes for offshore wind energy now range between 8,000 and 9,000 MW for 2023 and 2024 and between 3,000 and 5,000 MW for 2025 and 2026.

From 2027, the annual volume is to be 4,000 MW.

The WindSeeG previously set a volume of 700 MW for 2023 to 2025.

The auction volume for onshore wind energy has also been increased to 12,840 MW for 2023 and 10,000 MW annually from 2024 to 2028.

Auction quantities not awarded from 2023 onwards will be put out to tender again the following year."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY’S “EASTER PACKAGE” – AN OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST CHANGES TO ENERGY REGULATION,"Auction quantities not awarded from 2023 onwards will be put out to tender again the following year.

The volumes under the EEG 2021 were 3,000 MW (2023), 3,100 MW (2024), 3,200 MW (2025), 4,000 MW (2026), 4,800 MW (2027) and 5,800 MW (2028).

The bidding volumes for biomass are now 600 MW for 2023, 500 MW for 2024, 400 MW for 2025 and 300 MW annually from 2026 to 2028.

Biomethane plants also now have a dedicated capacity target of 600 MW annually from 2023 to 2028.

Previously, an annual volume of 800 MW was stipulated but without distinguishing between biomass and biomethane installations.

The innovation auction is to be retained.

The Easter Package allows for 800 MW to be auctioned in 2023, 850 MW in 2024, 900 MW in 2025, 950 MW in 2026, 1,000 MW in 2027 and 1,050 MW in 2028.

These volumes were increased to the stated values in the committee phase, with each representing a 200 MW increase over the volumes in the EEG 2021.

Final parliamentary deliberations also led to an auction segment for electricity from green hydrogen : In 2023, 800 MW of capacity is to be put out to tender on the 15 December bidding date; further bidding dates are planned for 2024 to 2026 with 1,000 to 1,400 MW of capacity annually.

Foreign investors should note that the EEG now includes a new provision that allows the Federal Network Agency – in agreement with the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection – to exclude non-EU bidders from tender procedures if the operation of the installation is likely to pose a threat to Germany’s public order or security.

The Federal Network Agency can also revoke awards or payments that have already been authorised.

The Act stipulates that a bidder must provide information on its shareholding structure and business activities if asked by the Federal Network Agency to do so.

The purpose is to enable the Agency to deal at any early stage with any dependencies that may pose a future threat to public order or security.

This extends the – already broad – control over investment, which will now also include cases where foreign investors intends to set up their own (energy) business in Germany.

Increased auction volumes aside, a large number of individual measures are planned to promote the expansion of renewables : Solar Power Solar installations of up to 1 MW capacity are to receive a set feed-in tariff (e.g. up to 6.2 ct/kWh for rooftop systems, depending on capacity).

A bonus is available where an installation feeds in to the general grid all electricity the installation generates in a calendar year and the grid operator is notified in good time.

Factoring in this bonus – and depending on the capacity of the solar installation – remuneration is between 13.4 ct/kWh (installations up to 10 kW) and 8.1 ct/kWh (installations up to 1 MW).

Adjustments are also to be made to the areas available for freestanding installations and solar installations are to be added on agricultural land, unused expanses of water and marshland.

Onshore Wind Energy

The expansion of onshore wind energy is being hampered mainly by obstacles in the approval process.

Whilst the Easter Package contains a number of regulatory incentives to accelerate onshore wind energy (e.g. a broadening of the “reference yield model” (used to make sites comparable with respect to given wind power and estimated subsidy amounts to include a new category tailored to the south of Germany), the key step has been to enshrine in the EEG the principle that use of renewable energies is "" in the overriding public interest and serves public security ”.

This principle should be especially relevant when weighing protected interests during approval procedures.

The Federal Government’s idea is for it to provide a basis for the approval of wind turbines even where they may negatively impact private or other public interests."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY’S “EASTER PACKAGE” – AN OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST CHANGES TO ENERGY REGULATION,"The Federal Government’s idea is for it to provide a basis for the approval of wind turbines even where they may negatively impact private or other public interests.

The newly created Wind Energy Area Demand Act ( Windenergieflächenbedarfsgesetz , WindBG) provides for binding, quantitative targets for the identification of wind energy sites.

These area targets implement the 2% goal for onshore wind energy agreed in the coalition agreement and are intended to reflect the energy industry’s needs.

The federal states are given an overall target for the end of 2032, coupled with an interim target for the end of 2027, the purpose of which is to ensure a continuously increasing allocation of land consistent with the expansion volumes set out in the EEG 2023.

The WindBG also specifies obligations to act that allow monitoring as early as 2024.

The special rules on onshore wind energy in the German Building Code ( Baugesetzbuch , BauG) are adapted to the WindBG, in particular to the area targets.

Offshore wind energy With regard to offshore wind energy , not only fully pre-surveyed but now also areas that have not been pre-surveyed are to be put out to tender.

Bidders on non-pre-surveyed areas must meet specific quality criteria, e.g. by demonstrating that power purchase agreements (PPAs) are used to market the electricity, and offer a supplementary payment.

The aim of this is to boost the German PPA market.

There are also plans to accelerate the procedure for the approval of offshore wind turbines.

Environmental assessments and rights of participation will be more closely linked.

In addition, the planning consent process for areas that have already been centrally pre-surveyed has been expedited by removing the requirement for an environmental impact assessment and public consultation.

The repowering of wind farms – the replacement of older wind turbines with more powerful ones – should benefit from a relaxation of species protection requirements.

Biomass and hydropower In biomass and hydropower , the focus is to be on certain specific energy market factors.

The original plan to discontinue support for hydropower plants under 500 kilowatts was dropped at committee stage.

These will now continue to receive a (slightly reduced) EEG remuneration rate of 12.03 ct/kWh.

The other rates, also slightly reduced, are 7.93 (up to 2 MW), 6.07 (up to 5 MW), 5.32 (up to 10 MW), 5.13 (up to 20 MW), 4.12 (up to 50 MW) and 3.37 ct/kWh (more than 50 MW).

Support for biomass is to be focussed on highly flexible peak load power plants and newly approved plants with a capacity greater than 10 MW must be capable of power generation based solely on hydrogen from 2028 onwards.

The remuneration rate for rated output of up 150 KW has been reduced from 12.8 to 12.67 ct/KWh.

Hydrogen-based electricity storage A new auction segment has been introduced to encourage innovative concepts in hydrogen-based electricity storage .

Installations of this type combine onshore wind turbines and solar installations (as energy suppliers) with a chemical electricity storage system based on hydrogen.

The aim is to store surplus electricity generated by suppliers until it can be fed back into the grid at a later point in time.  

Details of the auction process are to be set out in a separate regulation before the end of the year.

Elimination of the EEG surcharge The Energy Financing Act ( Energiefinanzierungsgesetz , “EnFG” – known in draft form as the Energy Surcharge Act, Energie-Umlagen-Gesetz , EnUG) brings together all the energy-related surcharges, i.e. the EEG, KWKG and offshore surcharges.

The draft initially contained a requirement for an annual decision on whether the Energy and Climate Fund would provide the financial resources to meet the EEG surcharge.

This left room for the surcharge to potentially be levied anew in future."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY’S “EASTER PACKAGE” – AN OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST CHANGES TO ENERGY REGULATION,"This left room for the surcharge to potentially be levied anew in future.

Section 6 EnFG now provides transmission system operators with a fixed right to compensation against the Federal Republic.

In addition, only the offshore and KWKG surcharges now form part of surcharge calculations under section 7 EnFG.

As a result, there is no more need for an annual political decision on how to meet the EEG financing requirement, leading to greater planning certainty for businesses and consumers who will no longer be required to subsidise it.

The “behind the meter” principle The new EnFG introduces the ""behind the meter"" principle.

In future, the sole reference point for levying the surcharge will be withdrawal from the grid .

Electricity flows upstream of the grid connection point are therefore notionally irrelevant to energy sector regulation.

This should make it easier to measure electricity quantities for self-consumption and for direct supply (to tenants) within a customer installation.

It remains to be seen whether this will in fact simplify things in practice.

There are still cases where a distinction must be made between who consumes what electricity quantities, e.g. where there is supply within a closed distribution grid or where the special compensation scheme applies.

There has also been no dovetailing with electricity and energy tax law so far.

It may therefore remain necessary, for example, to isolate consumption by a third party on a company’s premises if the company itself enjoys the privileged electricity tax law treatment afforded to manufacturing industries.

Special compensation scheme Despite elimination of the EEG surcharge, the provisions on the special compensation scheme ( Besondere Ausgleichsregelung ) remain relevant – in particular in relation to the KWKG surcharge (currently: 0.378 ct/KWh) and the offshore surcharge (currently: 0.419 ct/KWh) – and have been significantly changed and carried over into the EnFG.

In future, the capping of surcharges will no longer depend on a (complex) calculation of electricity cost intensity, but rather on electricity use in excess of 1 GWh/a coupled with proof that the eligible company is “energy efficient”.

Energy efficiency can be demonstrated by implementing an energy management system or by using 30% unsubsidised electricity.

This significantly streamlines the application procedure.

The level of capping depends on the sector to which the company is assigned by an annex to the Act; a high use of renewables can produce further reliefs.

These provisions are to apply in principle from the 2024 capping period onwards.

Transitional and hardship provisions also apply post 2024 to businesses already in possession of a capping notice.

These transitional provisions also take account of the share of renewables in electricity consumption and link higher reliefs on surcharges in 2027 and 2028 to whether companies cover their electricity consumption from renewables to a “significant extent”.

Measures to protect household customers and extend substitute supply The Easter Package adds provisions to the EnWG to protect household customers.

Scheduled terminations of energy supply to household customers must now be notified to the Federal Network Agency three months in advance and affected household customers must be informed accordingly.

The obligation to notify is subject to a fine.

This provision marks the Federal Government’s reaction to recent terminations of electricity supplies, some of which have been very abrupt, in cases where flat-price and low-price suppliers have no longer been able to honour their contracts.

It remains to be seen whether the duty to notify can improve contractual compliance.

The new provisions also provide for a clearer separation of default and substitute supply."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMANY’S “EASTER PACKAGE” – AN OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST CHANGES TO ENERGY REGULATION,"It remains to be seen whether the duty to notify can improve contractual compliance.

The new provisions also provide for a clearer separation of default and substitute supply.

Default supply is now only available for household customers; commercial customers – who can also be affected by near-term price increases or (threatened) supply stops – must rely on substitute supply."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT – 12 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS,"After the first attempts to adopt the German Whistleblower Protection Act (""WPA"") failed, it has now passed the legislative process.

Today, 2 July 2023, it has finally come into force.

The WPA sets out the requirements for companies based in Germany to establish a corporate whistleblowing system.

This includes the implementation of an internal reporting channel, the procedure for handling reports as well as follow-up actions.

Learn more about the new and far-reaching law and its impact on German companies in our FAQs: Question 1: Are you obliged to set up an internal reporting channel?

Question 2: Whose reports do you need to process?

Question 3: Which reports do you need to process?

Question 4: Do you have to allow for reports to be submitted in a specific way?

Question 5: Who is responsible for operating the reporting system?

Question 6: What are the confidentiality and data protection requirements?

Question 7: Are there any specific deadlines that must be met?

Question 8: What are the main steps when a report is made?

Question 9: How should employees be informed about the (internal) reporting channels?

Question 10: Do you have to involve the works council (“ Betriebsrat ”)?

Question 11: How do you build employees’ trust in the reporting system?

Question 12: What should be considered regarding disciplinary actions against whistleblowers? >

Question 1: Are you obliged to set up an internal reporting channel?

Generally, all companies with 50 or more employees are obliged to set up an internal reporting channel.

However, small and medium-sized companies with 50 to 249 employees have time until 17 December 2023 to set up their reporting channel.

The number is determined by taking the existing workforce and its future development into account; ultimately, the headcount is crucial.

> Question 2: Whose reports do you need to process?

Reports from employees of the company.

Employees within the meaning of the WPA include employees in atypical employment relationships, trainees and self-employed persons who are economically dependent (quasi-employees).

There is no legal obligation under the WPA to follow up on reports from third parties.

However, it is widely acknowledged that due to their duties of care the directors of a company have to pursue all substantiated reports of any significant violation.

Furthermore, the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains requires companies with 3,000 (January 2024: 1,000) employees to establish a reporting mechanism, which needs to be open to third parties, such as suppliers. 

It is therefore advisable to open up the internal reporting system to reports from all persons who may perceive violations in connection with their professional activities, e.g. former employees, job applicants, colleagues/relatives of employees, customers, suppliers.

> Question 3: Which reports do you need to process?

The scope of the WPA is restricted.

We recommend expanding this to include information on further violations and serious misconduct.

A de-minimis rule should be considered.

The WPA encompasses reports regarding: violations that carry a criminal penalty; violations that can be penalized with a fine, in so far as the violated provision aims to safeguard (i) the physical integrity and health of a person or (ii) workers’ rights and their representative bodies; other violations against specific acts of European or German law; violations of public procurement law, financial services supervision, and of specific tax provisions or the attempt to avoid specific tax provisions; violations of the Digital Markets Act; statements by civil servants which constitute a violation of their loyalty to the constitution.

>

Question 4: Do you have to allow for reports to be submitted in a specific way?

The internal reporting channels must allow for the possibility of written and/or oral reports (e.g. telephone hotline, online platform on the internet/intranet, e-mail, postal mail)."
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT – 12 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS,"The internal reporting channels must allow for the possibility of written and/or oral reports (e.g. telephone hotline, online platform on the internet/intranet, e-mail, postal mail).

At the whistleblower's request, the employer has to set up a face-to-face meeting within a reasonable time frame.

The barriers to using the internal reporting channels should be as low as possible for the whistleblower, since he or she is also allowed to directly contact the authorities via the external reporting channels.

When choosing a reporting system, employers should, for example, consider: (i) the availability of the system around the clock (e.g. in the case of a telephone hotline, via an answering machine), (ii) the possibility of contacting the whistleblower (e.g. in the case of postal mail, contact is only possible if the whistleblower provides contact information) and (iii) the extent to which the process can be automated.

In Germany, there is no legal obligation to open up the internal reporting channel to anonymous reports.

The WPA simply “recommends” doing so (“shall process anonymous reports”).

Allowing anonymous reporting could motivate whistleblowers to use the internal reporting channels in sensitive cases rather than directly contacting authorities via the external reporting channel.

In addition, it builds trust in the whistleblowing system as a whole.

> Question 5: Who is responsible for operating the reporting system?

An independent person or department designated for this purpose should operate the reporting system (receipt, communication, follow-up action).

Alternatively, a contracted external third party (e.g. external reporting platform providers, external consultants, auditors, ombudspersons) can operate the reporting channel.

The procedural steps can be carried out by the same person/department.

Different persons/departments can also be appointed in each case.

In any case, conflicts of interest with regard to the processing of reports should be avoided.

>

Question 6: What are the confidentiality and data protection requirements?

The identity of the whistleblower and third parties mentioned in the report must be treated confidentially.

This also applies to any other information from which the identity of the reporting person may be directly or indirectly deduced.

Employers should lay down clear and strict authorizations on a “need to know” basis.

The identity of the whistleblower may only be disclosed if this is required by a national authority or by law (e.g. in criminal or administrative proceedings).

Additionally, the identity of the whistleblower is not protected if the whistleblower makes a report in bad faith.

Personal data must be deleted if no longer relevant.

Personal data which are manifestly not relevant for the handling of a specific report must not be collected or, if accidentally collected, must be deleted without undue delay.

An effective system should be implemented to ensure the deletion of personal data.

>

Question 7: Are there any specific deadlines that must be met?

The whistleblower must receive an acknowledgement of receipt within seven days .

The whistleblower must receive feedback on further progress within a reasonable timeframe, at the latest within three months after receipt of the report / the acknowledgement of receipt.

Employers should provide sufficient resources (personnel/technical) to meet deadlines and maintain a process for effective deadline management.

> Question 8: What are the main steps when a report is made?

Acknowledging receipt within seven days Checking whether the report falls within the scope of the WPA Staying in touch with the whistleblower Checking the validity of the report Requesting further information from the whistleblower if necessary Taking follow-up actions (see next question)

Providing feedback within three months Complying with recordkeeping and confidentiality requirements >"
Gleiss Lutz,GERMAN WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT – 12 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS,"Providing feedback within three months Complying with recordkeeping and confidentiality requirements >

Question 9: How should employees be informed about the (internal) reporting channels?

The employer should provide clear and easily accessible information on the use of the internal reporting system.

In addition, the WPA requires employers to inform employees about the procedures for external reporting to the competent authorities.

The information can be published on the company website, posted in a prominent location accessible to all employees and/or covered in training sessions.

A whistleblowing policy that includes the essential information on the internal reporting system is helpful.

> Question 10: 

Do you have to involve the works council (“ Betriebsrat ”)?

Depending on how the system is designed, the consent of the works council is often required, in particular if an electronic system is introduced.

It is generally advisable to involve the works council if one exists.

This can also increase employee acceptance of the system.

> Question 11: How do you build employees’ trust in the reporting system?

Whistleblowers' trust in the internal reporting system is an essential prerequisite for an effective compliance system.

The main drivers are: Permanent accessibility of the reporting channel.

Training the responsible persons in handling reports and communication with whistleblowers.

Defining a process with clear responsibilities and minimum requirements for the respective step.

Publishing clear and easily accessible information on the internal reporting procedure.

Management's commitment to the reporting system.

> Question 12: What should be considered regarding disciplinary actions against whistleblowers?

Any form of retaliation against whistleblowers is prohibited.

However, this does not mean that whistleblowers are granted immunity for their own wrongdoings.

Whistleblowers can still be subject to disciplinary actions.

Ideally, those making decisions regarding disciplinary action should not know the identity of the whistleblowers and this should be documented accordingly.

If the whistleblower's identity is known, the reasons for any disciplinary action should be carefully documented."
Gleiss Lutz,FATF’S FINAL REPORT URGES FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING MEASURES IN GERMANY,"I. The FATF’s final report on Germany On 25 August 2022, the Financial Action Task Force (“ FATF ”) published its report on anti-money laundering in Germany ( Mutual Evaluation Report Germany ).

The FATF is an international body that sets standards for preventing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

Over 200 jurisdictions have committed to these standards.

Every ten years a group of FATF experts conducts a review on the individual member states, thus ensuring that state action in this area is regularly monitored.

In line with this requirement, the FATF has been reviewing the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing in Germany since September 2020.

In their review, the experts first examined implementation of FATF standards in Germany, i.e. the degree to which the requisite national statutes, regulations and measures ensure compliance with the 40 FATF recommendations.

They also checked whether and to what extent the formal requirements have in fact been effectively applied.

Steps the FATF took to this end included on-site visits to interview key institutional and private stakeholders in sectors with money laundering relevance.

Following further discussions, the FATF submitted its final report in late August.

II.

Key findings In their report, the FATF reviewers found that Germany has made considerable progress in combating money laundering and terrorist financing over the last five years.

According to the reviewers, Germany has reached a satisfactory level in technical compliance in particular (technical compliance is the degree to which FATF standards have been implemented in national law).

Important steps that Germany has taken here include changing the criteria for money laundering in the German Criminal Code and making it easier to confiscate incriminated assets.

The FATF also praised the establishment of a Beneficial Ownership Register, increased staffing for Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht “ BaFin ”) and Financial Intelligence Unit (“ FIU ”), and the generally good understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in the banking sector.

Efforts to improve international and national cooperation in anti-money laundering were also singled out by the FATF as positive developments.

The FATF identified a need for further substantial action against money laundering and terrorism, however.

In some cases, this need is in key areas.

Specifically: 1. More efficient use of the FIU’s information The FATF views Germany’s efforts to restructure the FIU as a step in the right direction, but access to and use of the FIU’s financial information still needs to be improved, it reports.

In addition, FIU analyses should be better tailored to the operational needs of law enforcement authorities.

The information available must be used and evaluated more efficiently by employing up-to-date strategies such as artificial intelligence.

2. Coordination between Germany’s federal government and the regional states; regulation outside of the financial sector The BaFin is the main regulator in the financial sector, but there are also numerous regulators at federal, regional state and municipal level tasked with monitoring other areas under anti-money laundering law.

The reviewers found that although these regulators’ responsibilities are adequately defined, their staffing and efficiency require major improvements.

One key point for action is coordination of the regulators among themselves and with law enforcement authorities.

To put the matter in perspective: over 300 regulatory authorities at federal, regional state and municipal level are responsible for monitoring obliged entities under anti-money laundering law.

Efficiently coordinating all public authorities is the only way to pursue an effective common approach to anti-money laundering."
Gleiss Lutz,FATF’S FINAL REPORT URGES FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING MEASURES IN GERMANY,"Efficiently coordinating all public authorities is the only way to pursue an effective common approach to anti-money laundering.

Financial institutions tend to be aware of their anti-money laundering obligations, but outside of the financial sector, risk awareness remains weak, the report’s authors found.

According to the FATF, obliged entities (in particular small enterprises) outside of the financial sector face major challenges in duly implementing preventive measures.

3. Developing the Transparency register The FATF’s assessment of the Tranparency Register’s introduction is generally positive.

But the reviewers criticized the fact that precise and up-to-date information was not always available in the register during their review.

Such deficits need to be remedied on an ongoing basis, they stated.

In particular, Germany needs to ensure that the register has sufficient resources, since this is the prerequisite for using the register to its full potential in combating money laundering.

4. Prevention and prosecution With regard to law enforcement, one particular point the reviewers criticized is that very few instances of money laundering are actually prosecuted, given Germany’s size, economic power and risk profile.

Overall, there is room for improvement in how complex money laundering structures are uncovered.

German law enforcement generally follows a cautious approach, and overly so in the report’s view.

One possible consequence of this is that professional money laundering networks, cash smuggling and misuse of legal entities can go undetected.

Germany also fails to take adequate action against non-registered providers of money value transfer services, in particular those that operate hawala networks.

III.

Impact FATF standards are not legally binding, and neither the review nor the final report will have a direct legal impact.

Nevertheless, FATF findings are widely noted internationally, for two reasons.

Firstly, the results of the study send a political signal and may impact Germany’s reputation as a place for business.

Secondly, deficits in implementing anti-money laundering provisions can affect business itself, such as when foreign companies undertake stricter anti-money laundering checks on international transactions or business with German companies.

In the light of this, we expect that Germany will try to implement the FATF recommendations and address the deficits found.

Even before the FATF report was published, the Federal Minister of Finance had announced that a new federal-level authority is to be set up to more effectively combat money laundering ( the Higher Federal Authority for Combating Financial Crime ).

The new authority will bundle competencies and strengthen law enforcement.

Following on from these measures, a new Federal Police Office for Financial Crime will also be established, which will report to the Higher Federal Authority for Combating Financial Crime.

Its staff will have their own responsibilities and powers to investigate financial offenses.

The Federal Ministry of Finance has presented a paper setting out the key points in this regard.

IV.

Practical relevance to business As a place for global business without restrictions on cash, Germany continues to have a strong appeal for money launderers, whether they act nationally or internationally.

The FATF has explicitly confirmed this again for Germany.

The current finance minister has vowed to tackle the outstanding issues in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing that the report identified.

But the FATF’s recommendations confirm the continuing potential risk for companies in Germany under anti-money laundering law, at least at the current time.

Obliged entities under anti-money laundering law should therefore view the FATF recommendations as an opportunity to take adequate measures to prevent money laundering and avert the associated risks under criminal and regulatory law."
Gleiss Lutz,FATF’S FINAL REPORT URGES FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING MEASURES IN GERMANY,"Although the action recommended by the FATF has no binding effect on companies, it is likely to exert a considerable influence on legislators and regulators.

Given the FATF’s numerous recommendations for companies outside the financial sector, we assume that regulators will be taking a closer interest in the anti-money laundering requirements for obliged entities in this area."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW FEDERAL BUDGET RETAINS KEY ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOLLOWING FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULING ON CLIMATE AND TRANSFORMATION FUND,"On 15 November 2023, Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court declared the second supplementary federal budget for 2021 unconstitutional and therefore null and void (case 2 BvF 1/22).

The ruling created a need to overhaul the Climate and Transformation Fund ( Klima- und Transformationsfond , “CTF”), and a significant step towards this was taken on 18 January 2024 when the Bundestag Budget Committee voted to retain the CTF’s key funding programmes.

Following the successful conclusion of the delayed ""budget week"" in the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the Budget Act 2024 now only needs to formally enter into force for the budget freeze to be lifted and new funding to be approved.

The CTF is the German Federal Government’s main instrument for financing the energy transition and climate protection within Germany.

A ruling by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court deprived the Fund of EUR 60 billion, making extensive revisions necessary.

The Federal Government’s declared aim for the overhaul was to maintain the Fund’s key funding programmes for energy and infrastructure projects.

With the Budget Committee having accepted the proposed new-model CTF, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action ( Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz , “BMWK”) lifted its pause on applications and approvals for CTF funding programmes on 22 January 2024.

New applications will also soon be able to be approved when the provisional budget period ends with the publication of the Budget Act 2024 in the Federal Law Gazette.

Background In February 2022, the Federal Government used the Second Supplementary Budget Act 2021 to retroactively shift superfluous 2021 coronavirus-related loan authorisations of EUR 60 billion into a special fund, the CTF (previously known as the Energy and Climate Fund), with the intention of repurposing them for future financial years.

The Federal Constitutional Court considered this to violate a number of budgetary principles however, not least the debt brake enshrined in Articles 109 and 115 German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ), resulting in a EUR 60 billion reduction in the CTF’s total volume of over EUR 200 billion.

Since the judgment, the Federal Government has mostly been prevented from entering into new commitment appropriations.

The German Federal Ministry of Finance immediately froze numerous items in the 2023 federal budget, including the CTF’s economic plan.

New 2024 commitments are presently hampered not only by this spending freeze but also by provisional budget management under Article 111 German Basic Law, which restricts spending to existing or statutory obligations until the year’s federal budget has been adopted.

The BMWK consequently imposed a stop on all applications and approvals for CTF funding from 1 December 2023 except for those relating to energy efficiency and renewables in the building sector.

The stop was lifted on 22 January 2024.

What are the implications of the CTF restructuring?

To absorb the EUR 60 billion shortfall, there will be changes in how the CTF is financed and the number of programmes it funds.

While the CTF has previously been 100% self-financing through its share in the proceeds from European emissions trading and carbon pricing in national emissions trading, there are now plans for Federal Government subsidies for 2025 and 2026.

Moreover, a return to the 2019 carbon pricing trajectory means that carbon pricing will also increase from 2024 onwards, the 2022 increase having been postponed in order to reduce the burden on individuals and companies.

As regards its future focus, the CTF will continue to concentrate on its core projects, most of which remain unchanged."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW FEDERAL BUDGET RETAINS KEY ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOLLOWING FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULING ON CLIMATE AND TRANSFORMATION FUND,"As regards its future focus, the CTF will continue to concentrate on its core projects, most of which remain unchanged.

Although the agreement reached by the Federal Government provides for just EUR 49 billion in funding for 2024, i.e. EUR 12 billion less than originally planned, the key programmes in the areas of the hydrogen economy, electromobility and the energy and building sectors will nevertheless be retained:

The hydrogen economy is to be expanded by promoting hydrogen use in industrial production (funding of EUR 1.27 billion), the decarbonisation of industry (EUR 680 million), the implementation of the national hydrogen strategy (EUR 640 million), the Franco-German IPCEI (EUR 670 million) and the hydrogen strategy for foreign trade (EUR 280 million).

In electromobility , funds of EUR 1.92 billion are available for the construction of refuelling and charging infrastructure and EUR 500 million for the industrial production of battery cells.

The building sector continues to be a funding priority, with the EUR 16.7 billion in support for energy-efficient building refurbishment promised under the Building Energy Act remaining in place.

The planned measures to help reduce energy costs for individuals and companies are also unchanged.

In particular, EUR 3.9 billion will be invested in electricity price compensation and the “super cap” for energy-intensive industries.

A further EUR 10.9 billion will be available to transmission system operators to compensate for the abolished EEG surcharge.

Some funding programmes outside the core projects have had to be discontinued, although existing commitments will be honoured.

Savings are to be achieved, for example, by eliminating planned subsidies to transmission system operators that would have allowed them to reduce network charges, cancelling rebates for e-car buyers, and changes to the financing for rail infrastructure investments, which will now come from an increase in Deutsche Bahn’s equity rather than the CTF.

Outlook The consensus in the Budget Committee means that the scope of the future funding programmes under the CTF is now largely decided, which enabled the BMWK to lift the pause on applications and approvals for CTF funding on 22 January 2024.

However, whereas the BMWK is now accepting new applications for CTF programmes, approvals are not yet possible due to provisional budget management.

This will end as soon as the 2024 federal budget comes into force, at which time new 2024 CTF applications will also be eligible for approval."

Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: UKRAINE CONFLICT – NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"The EU imposed far-reaching economic sanctions against Russia on 23 and 25 February 2022 in response to the Russian military’s attack on Ukraine.

The packages of sanctions include both a tightening and expansion of existing financial and personal sanctions, restrictions on the movement of goods between the EU and Russia, as well as comprehensive territorial sanctions restricting trade and transactions with Donetsk and Luhansk.

On 26 February 2022, the EU states and their western allies also decided to exclude already-sanctioned Russian financial institutions from the international SWIFT system and to impose further sanctions on the Russian central bank.

The U.S. had also decided earlier to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

The sanctions have far-reaching consequences for German companies that do business in Russia.

EU sanctions On 23 February 2022, as a first step in response to Russia’s recognition of the non-Ukrainian government controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the EU strengthened economic sanctions against Russia by amending/supplementing Regulations (EU) 269/2014 and 833/2014 and also restricted foreign trade with the Donetsk and Luhansk regions (Regulation (EU) 2022/263).

On 25 February 2022, following Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, the EU decided to further tighten sanctions against Russia on the movement of goods and money.

The regulations adopted by the EU include comprehensive personal sanctions on a total of, currently, 670 individuals and 55 entities, including the Russian President, the Foreign Minister, members of the National Security Council, the State Duma and individuals who supported the Russian military action from Belarus (see Implementing Regulations (EU) 2022/332, (EU) 2022/269, (EU) 2022/261 and (EU) 2022/261.

The scope of Regulation (EU) 269/2014 relating to the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol has been extended to apply to a greater number of people and entities.

Under the new Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 269/2014, these include – most notably – leading businessmen and legal persons, entities and bodies in certain sectors of the economy that are considered to be a significant source of revenue for the Russian government (cf.

Regulation (EU) 2022/330).

Persons listed on this basis are banned from entering and transiting the territory of the European Union and all their funds and economic resources are being frozen.

For German companies, the key element of the personal sanctions is, however, the ban on providing the above persons – as well as entities or bodies held or controlled by said persons – with funds or economic resources , whether directly or indirectly.

The law is worded broadly in order to try and prevent transactions aimed at circumventing it; deliveries to companies owned or controlled by a listed person are also banned, for example.

Lastly, visa restrictions are being introduced for diplomats, other Russian officials and businesspeople, meaning that they will no longer be granted privileged access to the EU (Decision (EU) 2022/333).

The EU is also applying comprehensive financial sanctions with the aim of increasing Russia’s borrowing costs, driving inflation and gradually eroding Russia’s industrial base.

The main measures that have been adopted by the EU are as follows: The trading ban already in place on certain transferable securities and money market instruments has been extended.

It now also applies in particular to securities and money market instruments issued by Russia, its government and the Russian central bank .

The ban also covers, among others, credit institutions and companies listed in the amended Annexes III, V, VI, XII and XIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014 that provide material support to the Russian state or operate in the military or oil industry ."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: UKRAINE CONFLICT – NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"In addition to the securities trading ban, there is a general ban on granting new credit and loans to the aforementioned institutions and companies after 23/26 February 2022, respectively.

On top of that, there is now a ban on the sale of euro-denominated transferable securities issued after 12 April 2022 to Russian customers .

It will no longer be possible to trade shares in Russian state-owned companies in the EU .

Regulation (EU) 2022/328 provides for a ban on the listing of, and provision of services in connection with, shares in Russian companies on EU trading venues.

Lastly, a ban on accepting deposits of more than EUR 100,000 (as legally defined in Article 1(k) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014) from Russian citizens or residents has been newly introduced.

One exception to this ban is if the deposits are necessary for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between the EU and Russia.

26 February 2022 also saw the introduction of a of a general ban on providing public funding or financial assistance for trade with or investment in Russia.

As a consequence, the German government has already announced that it is suspending until further notice the approval of Hermes guarantees and investment guarantees for Russia.

This also applies to trade in non-sanctioned goods.

Where sanctions relating to goods are concerned, the EU has also tightened the existing restrictions laid down in Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and added additional provisions (see Regulation (EU) 2022/328):

The export ban on dual-use goods listed in Annex I of the Dual Use Regulation was tightened to prohibit the direct or indirect sale, export, transfer and supply of all such goods .

This means that, unlike in the past, the specific (military or civilian) use of the goods in Russia is no longer the determining factor.

Exceptions apply only to certain humanitarian uses.

In addition, companies can – until 30 April 2022 – apply to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle , “BAFA”) for a special licence to export dual-use goods if the goods are intended for non-military purposes and non-military end users, and the delivery serves to fulfil existing contracts that were concluded before 26 February 2022.

The EU has introduced a new export ban on goods and technologies (with or without originating in the EU) that can add to Russia’s military and technological strength or the development of the defence and security sector .

The affected goods are listed in the new Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

Exceptions for certain humanitarian purposes apply in this case as well.

As with the dual-use goods, companies can – under the aforementioned conditions – also apply for special licences in order to fulfil existing contracts.

Moreover, an export ban is now also planned for certain oil refining equipment listed in the new Annex X of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, as well as for goods and technologies for use in the aerospace industry (new Annex XI ).

Until 27 May 2022, neither of these bans applies to the execution of existing contracts that were concluded before 26 February 2022.

Thus, for the first time, the Regulation also includes a “wind-down period” for the sanctions against Russia during which existing contracts may still – but also have to – be settled.

Regulation (EU) 2022/263 also now contains a comprehensive import ban on goods originating in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine , and a ban on the direct or indirect provision of financing or financial assistance, as well as insurance and reinsurance, related to the import of such goods.

An exception applies to those goods that have been granted a certificate of origin by the Government of Ukraine."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: UKRAINE CONFLICT – NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"An exception applies to those goods that have been granted a certificate of origin by the Government of Ukraine.

Moreover, the trade in (as well as the export of) goods and technologies for use in the sectors of transport, telecommunications, energy, prospecting, exploration and production of oil, gas and mineral resources in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and the provision of services in these sectors is also prohibited.

Likewise prohibited are the acquisition and extension of ownership of real estate or entities and the establishment of joint ventures, including the provision of financing and investment services related to these transactions.

An exception to these prohibitions applies to the fulfilment of existing contracts concluded before 23 February 2022, provided that the relevant transaction is notified to the competent authority at least five working days in advance.

Finally, services related to tourism activities in the two regions are also prohibited.

The tightening of EU sanctions is expected to have a significant impact on the business that German/European companies do with Russia.

T his is due not least to the imposed financial sanctions, which are unique in this form and seek to curtail Russia’s access to the most important capital markets.

According to EU estimates, these sanctions affect 70% of the Russian banking market as well as important state-owned enterprises, including those in the defence sector.

U.S. sanctions At virtually the same time as the EU, the U.S. also issued new sanctions packages and imposed further economic sanctions on Russia.

These are very similar to the European sanctions in terms of content and extent, but they are not identical.

The main U.S. sanctions include: Territorial restrictions on trade with Donetsk and Luhansk: Comprehensive ban on the import of goods from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions into the U.S. Comprehensive ban on the export of goods into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions Expansion of goods-related restrictions in business dealings with Russia: Export restrictions on all goods produced in the U.S. or manufactured abroad with U.S. technology/U.S. software that are suited for use in the military sector .

Export bans on key technologies in the defence, aerospace and naval sectors.

This applies in particular to technologies in the area of semiconductors, telecommunications, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies.

Broadening of personal sanctions by expanding the SDN list (natural persons from Vladimir Putin’s “inner circle”; in particular the banks VEB and PSB as well as a number of their subsidiaries; Nord Stream 2 AG and its management) with the consequence that no more business may be conducted with these persons.

Imposition of extensive financial sanctions: Sberbank , including 25 of its subsidiaries, cut off from U.S. financial system Comprehensive blockade of the banks VTB, Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC and Novikombank and their subsidiaries by freezing and blocking all the assets of these banks.

Ban on the acquisition of and trade in government bonds of the Russian Federation by U.S. financial institutions on the primary market and, starting from 1 March 2022, also on the secondary market; ban on lending to the Russian state or the Russian central bank.

Ban on financing and engaging in transactions with 13 of Russia’s largest companies (including Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, Rostelecom, Alrosa and RusHydro).

The impact of U.S. sanctions on German/European companies may be significant.

On the one hand, U.S. sanctions may also apply to German and European companies directly in the form of export controls ( primary sanctions ).

This is the case, for example, where U.S. goods or goods that contain a certain share of U.S. components or are manufactured on the basis of U.S. technology are exported – i.e. supplied from Germany or the EU to Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: UKRAINE CONFLICT – NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"The same applies if U.S. persons, in particular U.S. banks (such as in the case of transactions in U.S. dollars), are involved in the transaction or if the company exporting the goods employs U.S. persons (including green card holders) in a responsible position.

Secondly, the U.S. sanctions against Russia also provide for secondary sanctions in certain cases.

These not only cover U.S. persons or U.S. related matters, but also persons from third countries.

A direct link to the U.S. is not necessary.

Exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system On 26 February 2022, the U.S., Germany and other countries agreed to exclude some large Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT banking communications network , with the aim of cutting them off from international financial flows.

The ban is initially intended to cover all Russian banks that have already been sanctioned by the international community.

Additional Russian banks are to be added if necessary.

In principle, banks can also communicate without SWIFT (for example, by direct contact via telephone or e-mail).

However, this is much more cumbersome, and therefore more time-consuming and costly.

The exclusion of Russian banks from the system thus severely restricts them in international transactions.

Conclusion and recommended action The newly imposed sanctions will have a very significant impact on the activities of German and other European companies doing business in Russia or with Russian business partners.

The exclusion of Russian banks from SWIFT, in particular, is likely to lead to far-reaching restrictions on trade between Russia and the West.

Although it may still be possible to conduct business through Western banks and their subsidiaries in Russia (insofar as they are still on the ground and able to work), removal from the system will make payments more cumbersome and far more expensive.

What’s more, further sanctions are likely to follow at any time.

The companies affected currently face tremendous challenges as a result: For one, they need to meet increased requirements for export controls and economic sanctions compliance to avoid obstacles to implementation, unexpected delays in scheduling or even criminal sanctions for violations of foreign trade regulations.

Companies also need to assess which steps to take with regard to their remaining employees or assets in Russia or Ukraine.

Given these circumstances, companies should urgently review their internal compliance structures, and establish whether sufficient manpower and resources are available to deal with these tasks.

Depending on the extent of a company’s exposure, it may be advisable to set up an internal task force to manage responsibilities and tasks, and keep reporting lines short.

In particular, companies should ensure they do the following: Closely monitor EU and U.S. sanctions, their development and impact (in particular, frequently screen for any extension of the EU’s sanctions lists).

Take the necessary steps to follow the sanctions (compliance management), in particular: Contract and licence management for existing contracts : Review existing business relationships for any newly introduced bans or licencing requirements (possible exemptions for old contracts need to be taken into account in this regard).

Export licences already issued by BAFA in the past often contain the very vaguely worded condition subsequent according to which the licence expires if the legal situation that applies to the export transaction changes.

We recommend clarifying with BAFA on a case-by-case basis whether the licence is still valid."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: UKRAINE CONFLICT – NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE,"We recommend clarifying with BAFA on a case-by-case basis whether the licence is still valid.

Conclusion of new contracts : Careful review of whether the contract complies with the relevant sanction regulations (e.g. whether it exclusively affects the supply of non-sanctioned goods); inclusion of an additional provision (supplementing the force majeure provisions) to shift the risk of tighter sanctions and the associated risks to execution of the contract to the Russian contracting partner.

Continuous risk assessment of whether the company faces disadvantages as a result of the sanctions or the factual situation in Ukraine or Russia, such as the disruption of business relationships or supply chains (including, for example, due to increased cyber attacks).

Monitoring of possible de facto payment issues of Russian customers/contractual partners in connection with probable foreign exchange control in Russia as well as the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT communication system.

Review of the extent to which Russian group companies must also observe EU sanctions and the extent to which German or European group companies must observe U.S. sanctions .

Monitoring of possible measures taken by the Russian side and, if necessary, protection of assets located in Russia (also given the possibility of “retaliation” by the Russian government).

Review of duties of care under labour law with regard to employees travelling or posted to Ukraine and Russia (difficulties in leaving the country due to closure of European airspace to Russian and Belarusian aircraft).

Training of employees with business contacts to Russia and Ukraine ."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIAN COUNTERMEASURES,"The EU has imposed further economic sanctions on Russia in light of the continuing attacks on Ukraine: On 9 April 2022 the EU’s fifth package of sanctions came into force.

This package of sanctions builds on those of 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ), 28 February/2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) and 16 March 2022 ( newsletter of 18 March 2022 ); the EU’s intention is to ramp up the pressure on the Russian government and economy and to limit the resources available to the Kremlin.

The new measures include various bans on the import of Russian products such as wood, cement, fertilisers and coal into the EU, restrictions on the transport of goods by Russian ships and vehicles, and further export bans, especially on machinery and computer equipment.

The existing personal sanctions have also been extended.

A ban on transactions by a number of major Russian banks and the closing of loopholes around sanctioned payments are also among these latest measures.

The U.S. has also adopted additional sanctions in coordination with the EU and the G7:

On 6 and 7 April 2022, the U.S. government issued a ban on Russian investment, the strictest financial sanctions to date against Sberbank, Russia’s largest state-owned bank, and Alfa-Bank, its largest private bank; it also placed further Russian government officials and their family members on the SDN List.

These measures follow on the heels of the ban already imposed on 4 April 2022 on using money held in accounts with U.S. financial institutions to repay Russian state debts.

Russia is also launching new countermeasures.

In addition to possible criminal consequences for company management bodies that comply with Western sanctions, these concern most notably restrictions on the protection of intellectual property rights to the detriment of rights holders from “unfriendly states”.

EU sanctions In its fifth sanctions package (Regulations (EU) 2022/581 and 2022/576) of 8 April 2022 , the EU has again amended and tightened Regulations (EU) 269/2014 and 833/2014.

The EU has added a further 200 entries to the list of personal sanctions , bringing the current total to 1,110 individuals and 83 entities.

The new Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014 now also includes companies whose products or technologies played a role in the invasion.

Key “oligarchs” and businessmen, high-ranking Kremlin officials, proponents of disinformation and information manipulation who systematically spread the Kremlin’s narrative around Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and family members of already sanctioned individuals now also find themselves on the list.

The aim here is to avoid assets being transferred as a means of circumventing EU sanctions. 

As already explained in our newsletter of 7 March 2022 , the listed persons are banned from entering and transiting EU territory, and all their assets are being frozen.

In recent announcements, the EU Commission indicated that the rule banning European companies from providing funds or economic resources to listed persons is clearly also intended to apply to non-listed companies that, overall, are majority-owned by (multiple) listed persons.

The Commission is therefore adding together the company shares held by listed persons; this means, for instance, that companies 30% of whose shares are held by one listed person and 25% by another are also considered to be controlled by a listed person.

In the legal opinion of the Commission, which is admittedly non-binding in this respect, trading with a company of this kind may therefore constitute a breach of the ban on the indirect provision of funds or economic resources.

With Annex I to Regulation (EU) 269/2014 now also listing four major Russian banks as sanctioned entities, the fifth sanctions package is introducing a complete ban on transactions by major Russian banks."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIAN COUNTERMEASURES,"The banks concerned are VTB Bank, Otkritie FC Bank, Novikombank and Sovcombank, which together make up 23% of the market share in the Russian banking sector; contrary to some assumptions, Sberbank is not affected by this ban.

These banks have already been excluded from the SWIFT system, but this transaction ban goes further – their assets are now being frozen, cutting the banks off completely from the EU markets.

The focus of the sanctions is once again the amendment of Regulation (EU) 833/2014, adding further financial and trade-related sanctions: The ban on exports and investments imposed by Articles 3, 3a, 3b and 3c now also applies to coal and other fossil fuels, to goods and technologies capable of being used in the liquefaction of natural gas, as well as to aviation turbine fuel and fuel additives (special authorisations may be granted for aircraft financial lease agreements).

This means that in addition to the oil refining sector, the gas industry is now also being targeted, with the legislator explicitly limiting the export ban in Article 3b to goods and technologies for the liquefaction of natural gas.

The ban therefore still does not cover other goods and technologies for natural gas treatment/processing that do not involve the liquefaction of natural gas.

In addition, various lists of goods affected by already existing import and export bans have been revised.

Export bans now also extend, for example, to quantum computers and advanced semiconductors, high-value electronic products, software, other sensitive high-tech machinery, certain liquid gas technologies and vehicles.

Under the new Article 3ea, providing any vessel registered under the Russian flag access to ports in the territory of the Union is prohibited.

The new Article 3l prohibits road transport undertakings established in Russia or Belarus (cf.

Article 1zc of Regulation (EC) 765/2006) from transporting goods by road within the territory of the Union, including in transit.

In certain cases, the prohibitions only apply from 16 April 2022; authorities may grant special authorisations for the import of permitted goods.

The new Articles 3i, 3j und 3k of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 introduce trade restrictions worth a total of more than EUR 20 billion according to EU Commission estimates.

The import into the Union of certain products originating in Russia is now banned, such as: Coal and other solid fossil fuels, which are listed in detail in the new Annex XXII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014. 

A wind-down period has been agreed, meaning that through 10 August 2022 this ban does not apply to the execution of contracts concluded before 9 April 2022. 

The previously open-ended exemption from the comprehensive ban on transactions under Article 5aa of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 (see our last newsletter newsletter of 18 March 2022 ) for transactions involving these goods therefore now only applies until 10 August 2022.

The products listed in detail in the new Annex XXI to Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 (such as wood, cement, tyres, glass, fertilisers, seafood and spirits) may also no longer be imported (there are quotas for certain goods).

Here too, a wind-down period applies, meaning that through 10 July 2022 this ban does not apply to the execution of contracts concluded before 9 April 2022.

Many new export bans also apply: The goods listed in the new Annex XXIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014, which could contribute in particular to enhancing Russia’s industrial capacities, may no longer be exported (new Article 3k).

This very wide-ranging and extensive list includes, for instance, certain plants, earths, chemical raw materials, fabrics, stones, glass, machines and other products.

A wind-down period also applies in this case, meaning that through 10 July 2022 this ban does not apply to the execution of contracts concluded before 9 April 2022.

Exceptions may be made, especially for products needed for humanitarian purposes."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIAN COUNTERMEASURES,"Exceptions may be made, especially for products needed for humanitarian purposes.

This is an “explosive” rule – Annex XXIII is heterogeneous and far-reaching with a shotgun effect.

Tying the export ban (Article 3k(1)) to the usual “ban on services” (Article 3k(2)(a)) is likely to affect a large number of transactions that were previously unregulated.

There is considerable legal uncertainty here.

Affected companies should therefore take a critical look at their business activities (involving Annex XXIII goods and related services) to start with and where possible await clarification by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action/Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control.

The prohibition in Article 5b of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 on accepting deposits of more than EUR 100,000 is being extended to include cryptowallets.

The ban on the sale of banknotes and transferable securities in Article 5f of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 now applies not only to euros but to all official currencies of the EU Member States.

The new Article 5k of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 prohibits Russian companies from participating in public tenders in EU Member States.

Lastly, the new Article 5l of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 also prohibits all financial support for public entities in Russia. 

Public entities are legal persons, entities or bodies established in Russia with over 50% public ownership or public control.

Exceptions apply in particular in the area of intergovernmental cooperation.

U.S. sanctions On 4 April 2022, the U.S. government also announced that it was imposing further sanctions that were closely coordinated with its allies and partners.

The U.S. administration estimates that Russia’s GDP will contract up to 15 percent this year, wiping out the last fifteen years of economic gains.

The U.S. has now adopted the following measures: As from 4 April 2022, Russia is banned from making dollar debt payments with Russian government funds subject to U.S. jurisdiction.

Although the considerable sums of Russian money invested in U.S. financial institutions had already been essentially frozen, these could however still be used to pay debts to bondholders.

The new ban means that in order to repay its sovereign debt Russia must drain its remaining dollar reserves, generate new revenue, or default.

The measure is directly linked to the date of 4 April 2022 when major payments mature.

On 6 April 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury published an extended SDN List.

In addition to other state-owned companies, Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank – along with 42 of its subsidiaries – and Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa-Bank – including 6 of its subsidiaries – are now also listed.

In 2014 the U.S. already imposed sanctions on Sberbank in response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea (cutting Russia off from long-term borrowing on U.S. financial markets).

On 24 February 2022, further sanctions were imposed on Sberbank and, for the first time, Alfa-Bank: U.S. financial institutions have since been prohibited from opening or maintaining accounts for these banks or processing transactions on their behalf.

Their inclusion on the SDN List means that these banks are now subject to full blocking sanctions: With the exception of three general licences, which authorise certain clearing and settlement transactions during a wind-down period, the banks and their subsidiaries are now fully blocked from interacting with U.S. financial institutions.

Further natural persons were also added to the SDN List, which now includes President Putin’s adult children, Foreign Minister Lavrov’s wife and daughter, and members of Russia’s Security Council including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIAN COUNTERMEASURES,"All assets of the listed persons located in the U.S. or owned or controlled by U.S. persons are blocked (regarding the legal consequences of the listing see our newsletter of 7 March 2022 ).

As regards the ban on dealing with SDN-listed persons and companies (and in some cases their subsidiaries), it should be noted that U.S. law can in some cases go beyond the restrictions and prohibitions under EU law.

For example, the ban on transactions under Article 5aa of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 in conjunction with Annex XIX does not apply to subsidiaries of the persons listed in Annex XIX, provided they have their registered office in the EU (see our newsletter of 18 March 2022 ).

There is no such restriction on the scope of application under U.S. law, however.

German and European companies therefore need to bear in mind that a planned transaction permissible under EU law may nevertheless fall foul of US rules and regulations (with potentially serious consequences).

On 6 April 2022, President Biden also signed an executive order prohibiting new investment in Russia, expanding existing investment bans affecting certain industries, in particular the energy sector.

As a result, all new investment in Russia by U.S. persons (i.e. U.S. citizens, U.S. residents and entities organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States) or any person located in the U.S. is banned.

U.S. persons are also prohibited from providing support services for such investments.

The Secretary of the Treasury may, together with the Secretary of State, ban the provision of services to any person located in the Russian Federation by U.S. persons.

This allows bans to be imposed not only on specific companies from certain service sectors, but on entire service industries.

None of the enacted U.S. sanctions (see our previous newsletters of 18 March 2022 , 7 March 2022 and 28 February 2022 ) is intended to affect humanitarian activities that benefit the Russian people and people around the world: U.S. companies can continue to operate in Russia if their activities concern the availability of basic foodstuffs and agricultural commodities, safeguard access to medicines and medical equipment, and enable telecommunications services to support the flow of information and access to the internet (which provides outside perspectives to the Russian people).

To prevent the disruption of such activities, OFAC issued General License 6A on 24 March 2022, which authorises the (re)exportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, replacement parts and components for medical devices, as well as software updates for medical devices to, from, or transiting the Russian Federation and transactions required for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of COVID-19.

No more carnets for Russia and Belarus Due to the EU’s financial sanctions against Russia and Belarus, guarantee payments can no longer be made to these countries if carnet operations are suspended ( see the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK)’s announcement for further details ) .

This means that it is not currently possible to obtain carnets secured through the DIHK for Russia and Belarus.

Carnets can still be obtained for Ukraine, but they require additional written risk assumption declarations from the carnet applicants.

Further Russian countermeasures Russia in turn is introducing further countermeasures (see our newsletters of 7 March 2022 and 18 March 2022).

According to a current draft bill, executives of companies that take steps to implement foreign sanctions against Russia can expect to be subject to criminal sanctions in the future.

Examples of such steps include refusing to fulfil outstanding obligations or suspending deliveries due to export control limitations ( link )."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIAN COUNTERMEASURES,"Examples of such steps include refusing to fulfil outstanding obligations or suspending deliveries due to export control limitations ( link ).

Restrictions on the protection of IP rights of right holders from “unfriendly states” are again being tightened and specified in greater detail (see our newsletter of 18 March 2022 ):

For example, in cases of “extreme necessity” (such as ensuring the defence and security of the state or protecting the life and health of its citizens), the Russian government is basically entitled to decree that a patent, utility model or design can be used without the consent of the right holder.

In such cases, it is generally intended that the right holder should receive adequate compensation.

However, Decree No. 299 of the Russian government issued on 6 March 2022 provides that no such compensation is to be paid to right holders from “unfriendly states”.

Such a quasi-compulsory licence without adequate compensation likely violates the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement (cf.

Article 31 letter (h)).

Even though this decree does not yet apply to trademark rights and copyrights of right holders from “unfriendly states”, the EU Commission considers it likely that restrictions on the use of these IP rights will be similarly lifted (https://intellectual-property-helpdesk.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/russia-suspending-some-ip-rights-and-peppa-pig-trade-mark-infringement-2022-03-17_en).

For example, in trademark infringement proceedings concerning the well-known British cartoon character Peppa Pig, a Russian court – in light of the sanctions imposed by Western countries – recently held that the British right holder’s claim for damages constituted an abuse of rights and thus dismissed it.

It is likely that other Russian courts will also use this decision as a basis for their rulings.

Furthermore, Article 18(13) of the Federal Law of 8 March 2022 N 46-FZ (as amended on 26 March 2022) now provides that the Russian government may draw up a list of goods that, temporarily, will not be subject to certain statutory provisions on the protection of exclusive IP rights.

According to Resolution No. 506 of the Russian government dated 29 March 2022, the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade can draw up a list of those goods that may be imported into Russia even without the consent of the holder of the patent rights, utility models, designs or trademark rights that exist in Russia; they are thus deemed to have been placed on the market in Russia with the right holder’s consent (parallel imports).

This means that the right holder would be powerless to prohibit original goods or counterfeits from third countries from being imported into Russia.

The corresponding list is to be published soon.

The Russian Patent and Trademark Office (Rospatent) also lists a large number of trademark applications for signs that are confusingly similar to some trademarks of Western companies that are protected in Russia (e.g. McDonald’s, IKEA).

According to a statement by Rospatent, however, these are only published trademark applications.

Rospatent claims that a trademark right in these applications will not arise until after it has carried out a substantive examination, including an assessment of the possible likelihood of confusion with existing earlier trademarks.

However, given the current developments in Russia’s policy towards “unfriendly states”, it seems more likely that Rospatent will reject the notion of such a likelihood of confusion with the already existing trademark rights of Western right holders.

The validity of trademarks of Western companies currently registered in Russia could be further jeopardised if the distribution of the goods and services in Russia is discontinued.

If a registered trademark is not used on the Russian market for a period of three years, its trademark protection may expire prematurely."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: NEW EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIAN COUNTERMEASURES,"If a registered trademark is not used on the Russian market for a period of three years, its trademark protection may expire prematurely.

Conclusion and outlook: Implementation measures and financial support for affected companies The expansion of the EU and U.S. sanctions and the announcement that further measures will be enacted as required once again highlight the need for companies to review internal compliance structures and carefully examine all business with Russia.

The German and EU authorities have meanwhile not only recognised the need for effective implementation of the adopted measures, but have also laid the foundations for providing financial support to EU companies affected by the sanctions: The Federal Government has set up a “sanctions task force” to ensure – together with the federal states – that the adopted sanctions are effectively and consistently enforced and not circumvented.

On 1 April 2022, the EU Commission (Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union) published a “Notice to economic operators, importers and exporters” in the Official Journal of the European Union (CI 145/1).

In this notice, the Commission emphasises that the sanctions also apply to the knowing and intentional participation in the circumvention of imposed import and export bans.

In the Commission’s view, a particular risk arises in the case of exports to third countries from which goods can easily be diverted to Russia or Belarus.

Imports from third countries from which the goods in question can easily be diverted to the EU also pose a risk.

The Commission recommends that economic operators take adequate due diligence measures in order to minimise these risks of circumvention.

In particular, they should introduce provisions in import and export contracts to ensure that any imported or exported goods are not subject to the restrictions (for details of recommended compliance measures, see our newsletter of 28 February 2022 ).

Following the EU Commission’s adoption of the “Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid for Economic Support in the wake of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine” on 23 February 2022, which established the legal framework for Member State subsidies (see our newsletter of 25 March 2022 ), the German government announced that it would provide low-interest KfW loans to affected German companies.

The federal and state governments are to discuss further aid.

In view of Russian countermeasures and the dynamics of the proposed restrictions, holders of IP rights are advised to revise and adapt their IP strategy for Russia on an ongoing basis.

For example, right holders should examine individual cases for any opportunities to take action against IP rights infringements in Russia and ensure the continued existence of the rights there.

Given the emerging increase in parallel imports of goods from third countries (e.g. China, India) to Russia that infringe IP rights, affected companies should also take steps to exhaust all available options in the third country to prevent the export of such (counterfeit) goods to Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,COUNTDOWN FOR BIG TECH – DIGITAL MARKETS ACT PUBLISHED TODAY,"Today – 12 October 2022 – saw the publication of the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) in the Official Journal of the European Union (see here ).

This seminal piece of legislation is one of the first initiatives worldwide to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital platforms.

As we have laid out in more detail here when commenting on one of the earlier versions of the law, the new Regulation allows the Commission to designate digital companies as “gatekeepers” on the basis of specific turnover, market value and user thresholds.

In its designation decision, the Commission will identify these gatekeepers’ core platform services that will be required to comply with a broad set of self-enforcing obligations regarding - among others - data access, interoperability, as well as several prohibitions and restrictions, e.g. concerning self-preferencing and the use of personal data for targeted advertising.

The DMA is going to enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication, i.e. on 1 November 2022, and will apply from 2 May 2023 .

The latter date is especially important, because it entails that all businesses providing core platform services and meeting the quantitative criteria for designation as ‘gatekeepers’ (Article 3(2)) have to notify the Commission of their potential gatekeeper status and the relevant core platform services without delay and in any event within 2 months, i.e. by 3 July 2023, at the latest .

A gatekeeper’s failure to notify can lead to the imposition of fines of up to 1 % of total global turnover in the last financial year.

The next steps will unfold relatively briskly: the Commission is required to designate undertakings meeting the applicable criteria as ‘gatekeepers’ within just 45 working days of submitting a complete notification (Article 3(4)).

Consequently, the Commission’s first gatekeeper designation decisions – specifying the relevant core platform services to which the prohibitions and obligations in Article 5-7 DMA will apply – may be issued as early as in August 2023.

The relevant core platform services will then have to fully comply with the new prohibitions and obligations within a strict deadline of 6 months after the adoption of the designation decision (Article 3(10)), i.e. potentially from early 2024 onwards.

This tight time frame will constitute a huge challenge not only for gatekeeper candidates, but first and foremost also for DG COMP and DG CNECT, the Commission services tasked with applying and enforcing the DMA.

And because failure to comply with the gatekeeper obligations and prohibitions can lead to the imposition of severe fines of up to 10 % of worldwide total turnover (and even up to 20 % of total worldwide turnover in case of repeated infringements), gatekeeper candidates are well-advised to reach out to the Commission now in order to avoid non-compliance.

It is very likely that the most obvious gatekeeper candidates have already done so.

The DMA also bears opportunities for businesses that are using platform services of potential gatekeepers.

Not only will business users of platforms be able to complain to the Commission in case of potential violations, but they will also have the ability to enforce the new gatekeeper obligations themselves by bringing private claims before national courts.

Should the 11 th amendment to the German Competition Act be enacted as proposed (see here ), German courts may become attractive venues for such private enforcement litigation."
Gleiss Lutz,TRANSPOSING THE EU DIRECTIVE ON WORKING CONDITIONS: TIME TO AMEND ALL YOUR EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS?,"EU Directive 2019/1152 on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions in the European Union (“Working Conditions Directive”) aims to promote transparent and predictable employment and introduces wide-ranging rules on the information that employers must provide.

The German Bundestag passed the bill transposing the Directive on 23 June 2022.

The act is to come into effect on 1 August 2022.

It will cause more work for employers.

What steps do you need to take?

What does the Working Conditions Directive regulate?

The Working Conditions Directive standardises requirements for employers to provide extensive information about the essential aspects of employment relationships and necessitates comprehensive changes to the German Written Statement Act

( Gesetz über den Nachweis der für ein Arbeitsverhältnis geltenden wesentlichen Bedingungen , “NachwG”).

The NachwG, which was previously of lesser importance in employment law practice, will play a more prominent role in the future.

Under the bill, violations of a company’s obligations will be punishable by fines of up to EUR 2,000.

Which employment contracts are affected?

While all employment relationships are potentially affected, employers only need to take proactive action for new employment contracts.

New contracts: Employers are required to proactively provide information to employees with employment relationships beginning on or after 1 August 2022 .

The criterion here is the existence of the employment relationship (and not the conclusion of the employment contract), meaning that this requirement also applies to contracts concluded in the past if the employment relationship commences on or after 1 August 2022.

Existing contracts: Employees who were employed before the effective date only need to be provided with information at their request.

Employers are then obliged to provide written information in addition to their existing employment contract – if their written employment contract does not already contain this information.

How will the proposed legislation impact an employment contract’s validity and content?

Breach of legislation does not render an employment contract invalid .

Nor do employment contracts already have to include all the information.

Employees can also be provided with information about the essential contractual conditions in a separate letter.

However, a more straightforward approach would be to specify the necessary details in the employment contract itself – at least for new employment contracts.

The bill’s information obligations with the greatest impact include: Information about the termination process : Alongside the previously common clauses such as the written form requirement for terminations and the notice period, the bill requires that employees are notified of the deadline for bringing an action on the grounds of unfair dismissal .

However, failure to fulfil this obligation does not mean the three-week deadline for filing an action does not apply.

Any entitlement to employer-provided training Elements of remuneration , including elements and amounts of remuneration for overtime, bonuses, allowances, premiums, special payments, and other elements of remuneration, each of which must be stated separately alongside the date on which they are due for payment and the method by which payment is to be made Agreed breaks and rest periods , and if shift work has been agreed, the shift system, rhythm and conditions for shift changes The ordering of and requirements for overtime (if agreed) Where commitment to a company pension has been made, the name and address of the pension fund institution Written form requirement in the age of digitalisation Until the end, there was intense discussion over whether electronic proof was to be permitted – as the Directive explicitly foresees."
Gleiss Lutz,TRANSPOSING THE EU DIRECTIVE ON WORKING CONDITIONS: TIME TO AMEND ALL YOUR EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS?,"Despite severe criticism from quarters such as the Confederation of German Employers’ Associations (BDA), the bill regrettably retains the stricter written form; employees must therefore be provided with information about their essential working conditions in writing .

That means that employers must supply a document signed in wet ink containing all essential working conditions.

While employment contracts can theoretically still be concluded verbally or electronically – unless they are contracts for a limited term of employment only – the impracticality of producing two documents will result in a practical need to list all essential working conditions in the employment contract.

The written form requirement for providing information is met: If the employment contract is concluded in writing and a contract deed is supplied to the employee If the essential conditions of employment are printed out, signed by the employer, and then supplied to the employee; The employee is not required to countersign for the obligation to be met.

When does the information have to be provided?

The bill sets three different deadlines .

Some information has to be made by the first day of work (e.g. name and address of the parties to the contract and the elements and amount of remuneration); for other information, it is the seventh calendar day after the agreed start of the employment relationship (e.g. time and date of the start of the employment relationship, place of work, and description of the work); and for yet other information one month after the agreed start at the latest (e.g. period of paid leave or entitlement to employer-provided training).

To ensure compliance, employers should include all the necessary information in their contract templates and supply a signed contract document to employees before commencement of the contract.

If they haven’t yet done so, companies should check their standard contracts and ensure their processes meet the new requirements.

Gleiss Lutz,NEW PRICE INDICATION ORDINANCE ON 28 MAY 2022,"Changes to the German Price Indication Ordinance ( Preisangabenverordnung , PAngV) took effect on 28 May 2022.

Businesses that advertise prices or quote them in offers must therefore pay particular attention to the following, or risk receiving warning letters from competitors or business associations with a standing to sue, or even face fines:

Note: The regulations only apply to business-to-customer (B2C) and not business-to-business (B2B) sales.

1.

Price reductions New in section 11 Price Indication Ordinance:

When advertising goods with a price reduction, the lowest overall price applied in the last 30 days must be indicated as reference.

This is to prevent comparison with unrealistic, short-term prices.

Example 1: A dress first costs EUR 100, then EUR 150 for two weeks, and then EUR 75 after that.

The lowest price 30 days prior to the reduction is therefore EUR 100.

Only this price may be used for comparison.

Example 2: A dress first costs EUR 100, then EUR 150 for eight weeks (i.e. more than 30 days), and then EUR 75 after that.

Relevant reference price: EUR 150.

Exception: If prices are gradually reduced, without interruptions, the lowest price during the 30 days before the application of the first price reduction can be used as a reference. 

Example: A dress first costs EUR 100, then EUR 90, then EUR 70 and then (four weeks after the first price reduction) EUR 50.

The seller can use its prior price of EUR 100 for comparison.

However, there are also still some open questions, including: Do separate sales campaigns qualify as a price reduction “without interruptions”?

Example: price reductions applied during a Black Friday campaign and then during a Cyber Week or other sale.

Section 11 only covers goods, not services or digital products.

It only applies if reference is made to an prior price, i.e. not if only the new price is mentioned.

It does not apply to references to an RRP, to general statements such as “sale”, to offers such as “buy 1, get one 1 free” or “buy 3 pay for 2” etc., nor to perishable goods or individual price reductions.

2. Bottle deposit In the case of bottle deposits, the deposit must still be indicated next to the final price.

It is still not certain, however, whether this will hold up before the European Court of Justice.

Proceedings are already pending there after the Federal Court of Justice referred this question to the ECJ.

3.

Basic price For pre-packaged goods, in particular, the basic price must still be indicated in an “unambiguous, easily identifiable and clearly legible” manner.

The relevant units of measurement are 1 kilogram, 1 litre, 1 cubic metre, 1 metre or 1 square metre.

Smaller units (100 gr/100 ml) are only allowed for loose goods (e.g. fruit); in the case of customer self-service, the basic price by weight may also be indicated.

“Easily identifiable” means identifiable at a glance and therefore rules out the use of hover or mouseover action or separate links.

However, it is no longer necessary for the basic price to be indicated “in close proximity” to the final price.

Gleiss Lutz comments The German Price Indication Ordinance (PAngV) remained unchanged for a long time, while fundamental framework conditions have changed, especially at European level.

The innovation – triggered by the EU’s Omnibus Directive – takes this into account to some extent.

However, a number of questions remain unanswered, in particular regarding the regulation’s compatibility with EU law.

The above points only concern what we consider to be the major new developments.

In addition, the PAngV contains many other requirements (such as the obligation to truth and clarity in pricing, to indicate final prices, etc.) that still need to be met.

The German Unfair Competition Act ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb , UWG) also imposes price advertising requirements, all of which cannot be presented here."
Gleiss Lutz,NEW PRICE INDICATION ORDINANCE ON 28 MAY 2022,"The German Unfair Competition Act ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb , UWG) also imposes price advertising requirements, all of which cannot be presented here.

Companies are therefore strongly advised to take a close look at these regulations, regardless of whether they are online or brick-and-mortar businesses."
Gleiss Lutz,OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY UPDATE – FIRST AWARDS FOR SITES LISTED IN THE 2023 SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN,"On 12 July 2023, Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur, “BNetzA”) announced the 2023 auction results for sites that had not undergone central preliminary investigation, and on 10 August 2023 the auction results for sites that had undergone central preliminary investigation.

The auction and award process for the non-centrally pre-investigated sites put to auction generated a total of EUR 12.6 billion.

The auctions were based on the 2023 site development plan (“SDP”) published by the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency ( Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie ).

The sites and auction volumes stipulated in the SDP are the vehicle for achieving the desired expansion in offshore wind energy capacity from the current 8 GW of installed capacity to 30 GW by 2030.

Overview of the auction and award procedure The sites and auction volumes specified in the SDP are put up for auction by the BNetzA in the indicated calendar years.

The sites include sites that have undergone central preliminary investigation (“pre-investigated”) and sites that have not (“non-investigated”).

Successful bidders for non-investigated sites must carry out an own preliminary investigation into the marine environment, seabed and wind and oceanographic conditions before wind farm construction.

Bids for non-investigated sites must be submitted by 1 June of the respective calendar year and bids for pre-investigated sites by 1 August .

The successful bidder for each non-centrally pre-investigated site is the one with the lowest funding requirement for a wind farm on the site.

If a number of bidders submit zero-cent bids per kilowatt hour and waive funding (in particular the market premium), a “dynamic bidding procedure” is conducted.

In this procedure , the successful bidder is the one willing to pay the highest amount (“pay to play”).

Of the proceeds from the dynamic bidding procedure, 90% goes towards reducing electricity costs, while marine conservation and sustainable fishing each receive 5%.

The successful bidder for each centrally pre-investigated site is the one whose bid receives the highest number of points in an assessment procedure.

The bid amount is decisive, as this is where the most points are awarded.

Four qualitative criteria are also assessed.

2023 auction and award procedure On 31 January 2023, the BNetzA presented four non-investigated sites in the North and Baltic Seas with a combined capacity of 7,000 MW for auction.

Bidders had until 1 June 2023 to bid for the sites.

As each site attracted a number of bidders submitting zero-cent bids and waiving funding, the first-ever dynamic bidding procedure was conducted to establish what the bidders were willing to pay.

The successful bidders were determined online in a series of bidding rounds at increasing bid levels: Site N-11.1, with an auction volume of 2,000 MW, was awarded at a bid value of EUR 1.83 million/MW after 64 bidding rounds.

Site N-12.1, also with an auction volume of 2,000 MW, was awarded at a bid value of EUR 1,875 million/MW after 65 bidding rounds.

The successful bid for site N-12.2 (auction volume 2,000 MW) was EUR 1.56 million/MW after 55 bidding rounds and for site O-2.2 (auction volume 1,000 MW) EUR 2.07 million/MW after 72 bidding rounds.

The total amount achieved was EUR 12.6 billion .

On 27 February 2023, the BNetzA presented four pre-investigated sites in the North Sea with a combined capacity of 1,800 MW for auction.

Bidders had until 1 August 2023 to bid for these sites.

The successful bidders now have a right to a planning approval procedure for constructing and operating offshore wind installations on their site as well as to grid connection and grid connection capacity.

Outlook The EUR 12.6 billion achieved in the 2023 auction and award process for non-investigated sites clearly illustrates the attractiveness of investments in offshore wind energy."
Gleiss Lutz,OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY UPDATE – FIRST AWARDS FOR SITES LISTED IN THE 2023 SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN,"Outlook The EUR 12.6 billion achieved in the 2023 auction and award process for non-investigated sites clearly illustrates the attractiveness of investments in offshore wind energy.

The 2023 SDP identifies ten further sites with a total capacity of 14,000 MW for continued expansion of offshore wind energy during the years 2024 to 2027.

In 2024 , three pre-investigated sites in the North Sea with a total auction volume of 5,500 MW will be put up for auction with bids due on 1 August 2024.

These are sites N-9.1 (due to become operational in Q3 2029) and N.9.2 (due to be come operational in Q3 2028), each with a planned installed capacity of 2,000 MW, and site N-9.3 (due to become operational in Q4 2029), with a planned installed capacity of 1,500 MW.

In addition, two non-investigated sites in the North Sea with a combined capacity of 2,500 MW will be put up for auction with bids due on 1 June 2024.

These are site N-11.2, with a planned installed capacity of 1,500 MW, and site N-12.3, with a planned installed capacity of 1,000 MW (each due to become operational in Q3 2031).

Two pre-investigated sites in the North Sea will be put up for auction in 2025, with bids due on 1 August 2025.

These are sites N-10.2, with a planned installed capacity of 500 MW, and N-10.1, with a planned installed capacity of 2,000 MW.

The wind farms are due to become operational in Q3 2030."
Gleiss Lutz,PUBLIC ACCESS TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGISTER INFRINGES EU FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS,"The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has declared parts of the 4th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive invalid, most notably the requirement that information about ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) of companies in the EU must be publicly accessible.

The ECJ sees this as a serious, unnecessary and disproportionate infringement of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Background

In the proceedings that gave rise to the decision (ECJ, judgment of 22 November 2022 – C-37/20), two companies subject to registration sued the Luxembourg Business Registers.

Under Luxembourg law, which is based on the 4th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/843), various kinds of personal information about the UBOs of companies can be accessed at the Luxembourg Business Registers, which is freely accessible on the internet.

The plaintiffs requested – initially without success – that public access to information concerning their UBOs should be restricted.

One of their arguments was that public access to the UBO’s personal information infringes the rights to protection of private and family life and of personal data embedded in Articles 7 and 8, respectively, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter of Fundamental Rights).

They also argued that the information entering the public domain would put the UBOs at significant risk of being kidnapped, abducted, subjected to violence or even killed.

Luxembourg District Court ( tribunal d’arrondissement de Luxembourg ), the court handling the two cases, referred a number of questions to the ECJ, in particular on the compatibility of the relevant provision of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

ECJ decision The European Court of Justice ruled that the new version of Article 1(15)(c) of Directive 2018/843, according to which beneficial ownership information is to be accessible to any member of the general public, was invalid, arguing that this provision infringed Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The interference with fundamental rights was, it said, neither limited to what was strictly necessary, nor was it proportionate to the purpose of the Directive.

The availability of the information to the general public constituted a serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and protection of personal data.

Furthermore, it went on, unrestricted access to information about the UBOs was neither limited to what was necessary nor was the severity of the interference in proportion to the aim, being to combat money laundering and terrorism.

An earlier version of the Directive had made it a requirement that the party seeking the information has a legitimate interest in that information, and, as the decision showed, this had only been dropped on account of problems with the definition of “legitimate interest”.

In the ECJ’s opinion, that was not sufficient to justify the interference.

Furthermore, public access to information on UBOs was not strictly necessary because of the effects resulting from such access.

The Directive’s recitals mentioned scrutiny by civil society, but this, the ECJ argued, was not the responsibility of the general public, but primarily that of public authorities and institutions, such as credit and financial institutions.

Furthermore, the data to be made available to the public was not clearly and exhaustively defined because the Directive simply set minimum requirements and allowed states to make further data available.

The rule allowing Member States to require an online registration to get access to information on beneficial ownership and to provide, in exceptional circumstances, for an exemption from access to that information by the general public also did not alter the fact that the rule was disproportionate."
Gleiss Lutz,PUBLIC ACCESS TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGISTER INFRINGES EU FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS,"According to the ECJ, this was not a sufficient guarantee for data subjects that their personal data would be protected against risks of misuse.

Rather, the accessible information enables a potentially unlimited number of persons to gain knowledge of the material and financial situation of a UBO, to create profiles, to store the data and forward it to others.

Gleiss Lutz comments The ECJ’s decision is to be welcomed because it strengthens the rights to informational self-determination; it also counteracts any further erosion of those rights.

In particular, the ECJ has taken a clear stand against the almost complete subordination of data protection to anti-money laundering considerations.

The decision is in line with the pro-data protection stance the Court has taken to date, especially in its rulings on data retention.

The corresponding German rule on access to the German Register of Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO Register) (section 23(1), no. 3 Money Laundering Act ( Geldwäschegesetz , GwG)) also allows “all members of the public” to access personal data of UBOs (section 3 GwG).

This notion of public accessibility, introduced in 2020, was sharply criticised by commentators and practitioners for the reasons now set out by the ECJ in its decision.

In this context, critics were right to point out the risk of identity theft, risks of reputational damage on the basis of general suspicion directed at UBOs, competition-related risks, as well as the increased risk that UBOs may become victims of criminal offences.

In Germany, persons who wish to inspect the information must register online.

However, as the ECJ accurately pointed out, this is not sufficient to justify the serious interference with fundamental rights represented by the general public availability of information about UBOs.

It is now up to the German legislator to amend section 23(1), no. 3 GwG in line with European law in accordance with the requirements imposed by the ECJ.

That aside, German courts must already comply with the ECJ’s decision when ruling on national cases.

Whether this also applies to German public authorities, namely the Federal Office of Administration ( Bundesverwaltungsamt , BVA), being the body responsible for scrutinising the work of Bundesanzeiger Verlag GmbH (publishers of the Federal Gazette), which maintains the UBO Register, is unclear.

There are stronger arguments in favor of BVA and Bundesanzeiger Verlag GmbH being obliged to ensure that access to the UBO Register is restricted with immediate effect in such a way that personal information of UBOs can no longer be viewed by all members of the public.

UBOs may also consider filing a request under section 23(2) GwG to restrict inspection of the UBO Register and transmission of the data stored there.

If such request is refused and public access remains unrestricted, UBOs can sue for restriction of access based on the ECJ’s decision."
Gleiss Lutz,ANOTHER STEP IN THE EU’S FIGHT AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING,"On 28 March 2023, the European Parliament adopted its position on the European Union’s anti-money laundering package.

The new EU rules are intended to close the gaps that exist in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

The AML package consists of (i) an anti-money laundering regulation, (ii) the 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, (iii) a regulation establishing a European Anti-Money Laundering Authority (“AMLA”) and (iv) an update to the Wire Transfer Regulation.

The position adopted by MEPs on the AML package includes the following: 1. Expansion of companies’ due diligence obligations The texts adopted by the majority of MEPs oblige entities such as banks, asset and cryptoasset managers, real estate agents and, in future, professional football clubs to verify the identity of their customers and to establish the beneficial owners.

2. New caps for transferring cash and cryptoassets To reduce the abuse of cash and cryptoasset transactions for (financial) crime, MEPs want to cap cash payments at EUR 7,000 and cryptoasset transfers at EUR 1,000 ( newsletter of 24 November 2022 ).

Above those limits, companies obliged under anti-money laundering laws will be required to identify their customers, among other things.

3.

“Golden passports” banned In view of the considerable risk of abuse, parliamentarians want to ban all “trading” in citizenships so as to prevent citizenships (“golden passports”) and residence (“golden visas”) of EU Member States being granted in exchange for investment.

4. More transparency through beneficial ownership registers In future, Member States are to collect and make available more information on beneficial owners.

Competent authorities (particularly the AMLA and national FIUs) are to be given the ability to access beneficial ownership registers, bank accounts, and land and property registers, for example.

Additional information on their ownership is to be collected and made available for certain commodities that are particularly susceptible to money laundering – including high-value goods such as yachts, planes and cars worth more than EUR 200,000 and goods stored in free zones.

5. Lower beneficial ownership thresholds Individuals who hold more than 15% of the capital or voting rights or other direct or indirect ownership interest in a company will in future be considered beneficial owners.

For companies in the extractive industry or other high-risk areas, a threshold of 5% is to apply.

6. Legitimate interest in accessing beneficial ownership registers Following the latest European Court of Justice ruling ( newsletter of 25 November 2022 ) , MEPs decided that persons with legitimate interest – such as journalists and higher education institutions – should also be able to access Member States’ beneficial ownership registers.

Their right of access will be valid for at least two and a half years.

Member States are to automatically renew access, but will also be able to revoke or suspend it if abused.

7. New EU Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) to ensure consistent enforcement The new EU Money Laundering Authority will monitor compliance as well as risks and threats within and outside the EU, and directly supervise specific high-risk credit and financial institutions.

It will also be able to impose sanctions (in particular fines of several million euros) for material breaches.

The EU has not yet decided on the seat of the authority.

8. Outlook The vote in the European Parliament is another step in the EU’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.

The new regulations are provisional and may still change during the ongoing legislative process.

However, they underline the thrust of European legislature to take (even) stronger action against violations of anti-money laundering laws in the future."
Gleiss Lutz,ANOTHER STEP IN THE EU’S FIGHT AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING,"However, they underline the thrust of European legislature to take (even) stronger action against violations of anti-money laundering laws in the future.

Businesses obliged under AML laws are therefore advised to implement adequate precautions to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and to critically review existing structures.

The vote in the European Parliament also provided a mandate for the trilogue negotiations to be announced in the plenary session scheduled for 17 April 2023.

In the subsequent trilogue procedure, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will negotiate a final version of the legislative texts."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: BUNDESTAG ADOPTS WHISTLEBLOWER ACT WITH FEW CHANGES,"As the first agenda item in its final session of 2022, the German Bundestag adopted the “Act to Improve the Protection of Whistleblowers and Transpose the Directive on the Protection of Persons who Report Breaches of Union Law” (“Whistleblower Act”) on Friday morning (16 December 2022).

Two days earlier, on 14 December 2022, the Committee on Legal Affairs had submitted a corresponding decision recommendation ( BT Printed Paper 20/4909 ) in response to an amendment application from several parliamentary groups concerning the government bill from July 2022 (see our article of 3 August 2022 ).

The attempt to place the Act on the agenda of the Bundesrat’s last plenary session on Friday at short notice and with shortened time limits was rejected.

The second round in the Bundesrat is therefore likely to take place in the first session next year on 10 February 2023 (concerning the Bundesrat’s statement in the first round on 16 September 2022 ( BT Printed Paper 372/22 ) ).

The good news:

The adopted changes are not major.

In light of recent events, the Bundestag and, prior to that, also the Committee on Legal Affairs, initially addressed the issue of the protection of persons who report anti-constitutional statements made by civil servants (keyword “ Reichsbürger ”).

In addition, the now adopted Whistleblower Act contains some changes introduced by the Committee on Legal Affairs which are also relevant for corporate practice and setting up internal reporting channels: Finally – (late) agreement regarding anonymous reports One for all – the Committee on Legal Affairs also advocates the group solution What was two is now three – extension of the retention period Who is the fairest of them all?

Bullying, stalking & co. – monetary payment for non-material damage 1.

Finally – (late) agreement regarding anonymous reports Under the amended Whistleblower Act, as of 1 January 2025, both internal and external reporting channels will, after all, have to provide means for making an anonymous report and for conducting the subsequent anonymous communication with the whistleblower.

Whereas the processing of anonymous reports was merely recommended in the initial draft, the government bill contained a “should” provision.

The processing of anonymous reports is now obligatory (cf. section 16(1), sentences 4-6 Whistleblower Act).

From a compliance perspective, this change is welcome since it eliminates another potential barrier that makes employees reluctant to blow the whistle.

This change will entail costs for those companies whose reporting channel has so far been a traditional “complaints box” (mailbox).

Such a mailbox is unlikely to satisfy the requirement of anonymous communication.

It remains to be seen whether using a simple e-mail address as a reporting channel will (still) satisfy these requirements.

According to the transitional provision, the obligations pertaining to anonymous reports will not take effect until 1 January 2025 (section 42(2) Whistleblower Act).

As justification for the later entry into force of this obligation, the legislator refers to the additional costs for the necessary technical devices or the commissioning of an ombudsperson as well as the extra work involved in actually setting up the reporting office (cf.

Whistleblower Act decision recommendation, p. 61).

2. One for all – the Committee on Legal Affairs also advocates the group solution It is particularly encouraging that the “group solution” is once again being touted.

This possible solution has been explicitly addressed and welcomed by the Committee on Legal Affairs – without any specific reference to the proposed changes (cf.

Whistleblower Act decision recommendation, p. 56).

According to the group solution, individual group companies that generally do not have a compliance officer – much less a compliance department – of their own can outsource their internal reporting office to another company within the group."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: BUNDESTAG ADOPTS WHISTLEBLOWER ACT WITH FEW CHANGES,"This assumes that the reporting office at the level of the group company complies with confidentiality obligations and is independent.

In addition, the use of a group-wide central reporting office must not create any hurdles for the whistleblower, i.e. especially not any language barriers.

It should therefore be possible to make a report in the working language of the individual company in question.

The German legislator compares having a central, group reporting office to “outsourcing” the function to an external law firm; both are “third parties” within the meaning of Article 8(5)

Whistleblowing Directive (EU) 2019/1937.

The original responsibility to investigate, stop and punish the reported incident in any case remains with the individual group company.

However, cross-border companies with a central compliance office continue to face challenges from the European patchwork of national transpositions which, in some cases, require separate reporting offices for each group company.

3.

What was two is now three – extension of the retention period The original bill provided that the records documenting the report had to be deleted two years after the procedure was completed.

In order to be consistent with the regular limitation period under civil law, section 11(5)

Whistleblower Act now provides for a retention period of three years (cf. decision recommendation, p. 59).

This still does not resolve the issue of how the seven-year retention period for the reporting procedure according to the Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains is going to be handled in light of the three-year period under the Whistleblower Act.

Companies will thus have to establish and maintain a strict deletion plan in the future.

Who is the fairest of them all?

The newly introduced section 7(3), sentence 1 Whistleblower Act calls upon employers who have whistleblower protection obligations to create incentives for whistleblowers to first contact their respective internal reporting office before making a report to an external one.

This appeal is likely a final offshoot of the question of the priority of the internal reporting office, which was already hotly disputed when the EU Whistleblowing Directive was adopted.

However, with this mere “should” provision, the Whistleblower Act only echoes what is already common consulting and corporate practice: making one’s own reporting channels as attractive as possible so that they will be preferable to the central, external (official) reporting channels.

The decision recommendation is extremely reticent when it comes to the question of how such incentives could actually be created.

It merely mentions the optimisation of internal reporting channels, a good communication culture, the promotion of social responsibility, effective action against violations and protection from retaliation (cf. decision recommendation, p. 58).

In addition, employers must provide employees with clear and easily accessible information on the use of the internal reporting procedure (section 7(3), sentence 2 Whistleblower Act), and the possibility of reporting to an external channel must not be restricted or impeded by a system of incentives promoting the use of internal reporting channels (cf. section 7(3), sentence 3 Whistleblower Act).

Bullying, stalking & co. – monetary payment for non-material damage The provision on damages has been enhanced: In the future, whistleblowers will be able to invoke a separate rule, namely section 37(1), sentence 2 Whistleblower Act and claim monetary compensation for damages that are not financial losses.

In this way, an explicit statutory provision within the meaning of section 253(1) Civil Code has been created."
Gleiss Lutz,WHISTLEBLOWING: BUNDESTAG ADOPTS WHISTLEBLOWER ACT WITH FEW CHANGES,"In this way, an explicit statutory provision within the meaning of section 253(1) Civil Code has been created.

Retaliation can take many different forms and, in the case of psychological methods such as bullying or stalking, it is often difficult to prove that the legal interests referred to in section 253(2) Civil Code have been violated, particularly since the courts find it difficult to classify the necessary assessment factors in these cases anyway.

Full compensation takes sufficient account of the European requirements (Article 21(8) and recital 94 EU Whistleblowing Directive) and, through far-reaching protection of whistleblowers, also strengthens the trust of the latter in whistleblower systems, thereby also increasing their effectiveness.

Having a proper whistleblower system in place is important and should not be put off any longer.

Gleiss Lutz,TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE EU'S FIRST HYDROGEN AUCTION PUBLISHED,"On 29 August 2023, the European Commission published the terms and conditions of its first hydrogen auction, scheduled to begin in November 2023.

A total of EUR 800 million has been made available from the Innovation Fund for the pilot auction, which invites bids from hydrogen producers and is aimed at ramping up the hydrogen economy.

Goal The EU’s hydrogen auctions are intended to financially support the transition to more green hydrogen and reduce the price gap with fossil fuels in the transition’s initial phase – with the objective of mobilising the hydrogen market and facilitating expansion of the market for green hydrogen.

Over the terms and conditions’ 16 pages, the European Commission outlines the criteria, assessment mechanism, steps in the award procedure, and many other key elements of the upcoming auction.

What are the procedure’s framework conditions?

The procedure involves a one-stage auction in which companies can bid for financial support for green hydrogen production.

The financial support takes the form of a fixed premium paid in EUR/kg of green hydrogen produced; this premium is in addition to market revenue generated by the companies.

The support is therefore exclusively output-based , i.e. the premium is only paid for the volumes of hydrogen actually produced.

This contrasts with the Innovation Fund’s previous financing programmes, in which payments were made for the purpose of pre-financing or before production facilities entered into operation.

The project is financed by the Innovation Fund, which in turn is funded by the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”).

The auction procedure is run by the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (“CINEA”), which has managed projects of similar scope and size in the past.

What projects are covered?

Projects admitted to the auction must be based in the European Economic Area (EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and produce green hydrogen classified as a renewable fuel of non-biological origin (“ RFNBO ”) in accordance with the Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU) and its delegated acts.

The green hydrogen must be produced through water electrolysis using renewable energies.

Grey hydrogen from fossil fuels is excluded from the auction, and the terms and conditions provide that bidders be prevented from cross-subsidising their grey hydrogen production through the green hydrogen they receive financial support for.

To qualify, projects must have a minimum new electrolyser capacity of 5 megawatts and be in the pre-construction phase .

The published criteria indicate that ordering the requisite technical equipment is considered start of works , whereas buying land or obtaining permits is not.

Companies do not need to have received the permits at the time of bidding, but they must have already applied for them.

Hydrogen projects may be excluded from the auction if they are already receiving financial support from other national or EU funds.

Such projects are only permitted to the auction in certain cases, such as when financial support has been received for project and capacity development or for transport and storage infrastructure.

What are the bid components and the award criteria?

A bid must include the bid price, the expected average yearly volume of hydrogen over a ten-year production period, on the basis of which the maximum grant amount can be calculated, and the electrolyser capacity that will be installed and ready for operation by the time of entry into operation.

However, the bids will then only be assessed on the basis of the actual bid price , which must be indicated in EUR/kg and is capped at EUR 4.50/kg .

Moreover, a bid can only be awarded a maximum of EUR 266.7 million, i.e. 1/3 of the total budget of EUR 800 million.

The approved bids are arranged according to price (from lowest to highest) until the limit of EUR 800 million is reached."
Gleiss Lutz,TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE EU'S FIRST HYDROGEN AUCTION PUBLISHED,"The approved bids are arranged according to price (from lowest to highest) until the limit of EUR 800 million is reached.

If and to the extent bids exceed this limit, they are added to a reserve list.

The contract is then awarded to the most competitive bids , i.e. those that can produce green hydrogen with the least amount of financial support.

Hydrogen auctions can therefore be compared to German auctions under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (especially for onshore wind and photovoltaic projects), where financial support is also awarded on the basis of the lowest market premium offered.

For proposals with the same bid price, those with an overall smaller maximum grant required, i.e. whose maximum grant amount is the lowest, are given priority.

This is likely to include, in particular, smaller production facilities.

If priority cannot be determined on this basis, proposals from Member States with fewer funds awarded previously under the Innovation Fund are considered to have higher priority.

Since Germany, compared to other European countries, has already financed a relatively large number of projects through the Innovation Fund, it is unlikely that German companies will be prioritized.

Finally, the bids can also be ranked according to which projects can start producing hydrogen the soonest.

What happens after a bid is awarded?

If a bid has been selected in accordance with the procedure described, the bidder will receive a letter inviting it to prepare a grant agreement .

No later than two months after receiving the invitation, the bidder must submit a completion guarantee from a bank or financial institution covering 4% of the maximum grant amount.

This guarantee serves as a safeguard for CINEA in the event that hydrogen production does not commence on time (more on this below).

Before the grant agreement is signed, it is assessed whether the bidder has stable and sufficient financial resources.

Once the grant agreement is signed, a grant is generally provided for a period of ten years from the start of hydrogen production .

The maximum time to enter into operation is five years after the grant agreement is signed.

If the project does not enter into operation within five years, the grant agreement will be terminated and CINEA will call the completion guarantee.

The financial support is paid semi-annually – after production commences – as a fixed premium in EUR/kg of the verified and certified RFNBO hydrogen produced, in addition to the market revenue generated.

After the grant agreement is signed, the awarded companies are obliged to prepare reports periodically alongside their payment requests (semi-annually) on the volume and certification of the hydrogen produced.

If more hydrogen is produced than initially specified in the bid, the premium is generally also paid for this surplus.

However, this flexible adjustment of the production volume is capped at 140% of the semi-annual production.

This means that an increase in the semi-annual production volume by up to 40% compared to half of the expected annual average volume will be supported; a premium will not be paid for a production volume above 140%.

If production falls short of the production volumes specified in the bid, CINEA may reduce financial support and terminate the grant agreement.

Outlook

The first auction is set to begin on 23 November 2023 .

The bidding phase is expected to end on 8 February 2024 .

In future, late-stage auctions will be held each year.

In such an auction, bidders can see the bids of the other parties and revise and increase their own bids during the course of the auction.

The EUR 800 million budget reflects both the high expectations of the EU for green hydrogen projects and the central role to be played by hydrogen in navigating the energy transition.

The auctions planned for November 2023 are only the beginning."
Gleiss Lutz,TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE EU'S FIRST HYDROGEN AUCTION PUBLISHED,"The auctions planned for November 2023 are only the beginning.

The Bundesnetzagentur has announced that the first bidding deadline for hydrogen auctions will be 15 December 2023 – the first milestone: 800 megawatts of green hydrogen.

These initial auctions will give all parties involved a good idea of what additional financial and regulatory efforts will be required in future.

The Commission and the Member States will carefully monitor to what extent this approach could also be used for other climate-friendly technologies and products.

It will be important to keep an eye on the effects on the market as well as on possible legal challenges."
Gleiss Lutz,COMMERCIAL LEASE INDEXATION CLAUSES IN TIMES OF INFLATION,"Indexation clauses that link rents to the consumer price index (CPI) have long been common in commercial lease agreements.

After receiving only little attention in past years due to rather moderate index changes, such clauses are becoming increasingly significant as high inflation means the revenue commercial tenants can generate is often unable to keep pace with the scale and frequency of rent increases.

Legal basis for the agreement of indexation clauses Whether or not indexation clauses are permitted in commercial lease agreements is primarily determined on the basis of the Price Clause Act ( Preisklauselgesetz , “PrKG”) .

According to this Act, indexation clauses are lawful if (i) they are sufficiently specific, (ii) the relevant agreement has been concluded for a period of at least ten years or the landlord waives the right of ordinary termination for this period/the tenant has the right to extend the term of the agreement to at least ten years, (iii) the rent is determined by the change in the CPI or a price index prepared by a state statistical office or the Statistical Office of the European Community and (iv) the parties are not unreasonably disadvantaged by the agreed clause.

Such a disadvantage exists in particular if an increase in prices results in a rent increase but a drop in prices does not result in a rent reduction (so called ‘upwards only’ clauses).

If an indexation clause violates the above requirements, it is considered to be invalid as of the time of the legally binding determination of the violation.

However, the PrKG does not contain any provisions that place a limit on rent adjustments in the event of an unusually large change in the index.

Moreover, commercial lease agreements rarely provide for such clauses either, because there has been little reason to do so to date.

What options do the affected tenants have?

Ultimately, termination for cause without notice (section 543 Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , “BGB”)) is likely to be impermissible, since the interference with the agreement is not attributable to the landlord – let alone the landlord’s fault – but is rather due to external circumstances beyond the parties’ control.

Moreover, it is rarely in the interest of the parties to terminate leases prematurely when more flexible solutions can be found instead.

One option that can be considered is asserting a claim for amendment of the agreement according to the principles of interference with the basis of the transaction (section 313 BGB) .

Such interference is deemed to have taken place if (i) circumstances that became the basis of the agreement have subsequently changed significantly (so called factual element), (ii) the parties would not have concluded the agreement or would have concluded it with different content had they foreseen this change (so called hypothetical element) and (iii) the party demanding the amendment cannot, taking account of all the circumstances of the specific case, reasonably be required to adhere to the unchanged agreement (so called normative element).

The Federal Court of Justice has not yet clarified whether the principles of interference with the basis of the transaction apply in cases involving dynamic changes in the CPI.

It is true that in cases where an agreement did not contain an indexation clause, the court ruled that the risk of an usual decrease in purchasing power is generally borne by the tenant, so that such a decrease does not trigger any rights under section 313 BGB and consequently does not provide the basis for interpreting the lease as if it contained an indexation clause.

However, no conclusions can be drawn from this for scenarios in which the agreed indexation clauses ultimately prove to be “too effective”.

It is ultimately unlikely that the principles developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic can be applied."
Gleiss Lutz,COMMERCIAL LEASE INDEXATION CLAUSES IN TIMES OF INFLATION,"It is ultimately unlikely that the principles developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic can be applied.

Firstly, the pandemic situation was an unexpected, singular event for which parties typically made no contractual provisions, while inflation is usually subject to fluctuation.

Secondly, it is doubtful whether the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are comparable to those of high inflation.

Whereas in the coronavirus cases it was at times not possible to use the leased premises at all or only to a very limited extent – so that what was received in exchange for the rent had essentially been reduced in value – rent increases based on an indexation clause can be (at least partially) offset by increasing sales or passing the higher costs on to customers.

All things considered, there are probably better arguments for not applying the principles of section 313 BGB: It is questionable whether it can indeed be presumed – and how it can be proved – that the parties expected only a moderate increase in the CPI (or at least, that the landlord was able to discern that the tenant didn’t expect more than a moderate increase).

Moreover, if the parties’ expectations concerning price fluctuations are already integrated into the agreement itself through the inclusion of an indexation clause, they become part of the agreement’s content and cannot simultaneously serve as its basis .

Also, amending the agreement is not an option when a risk materialises that one party alone must bear.

As a general rule, the landlord bears the risk for monetary devaluation, while the tenant bears the risks associated with securing funds and financing.

This means, however, that the tenant also bears the inflation risk.

The fact that section 313 BGB also encompasses what is known as the fundamental basis of the transaction – including the expectation that the key political, economic and social circumstances underpinning the agreement will not change due to war, hyperinflation or natural disasters – ultimately does not help, either.

Instead, it is evident from relevant case law that this provision is only concerned with significant upheavals that directly impact the specific agreement, such as revolutions and wars (in Germany) or inflation rates substantially exceeding the present level.

It is therefore more than doubtful whether a period of elevated inflation triggered by various factors qualifies as interference with the fundamental basis of the transaction – especially if it is (presumably) of manageable duration.

After all, there must have been a serious change of circumstances.

If an indexation clause was agreed in the lease, then fluctuations in inflation were intentionally and explicitly incorporated into it, meaning that the pertinent circumstances have ultimately remained unchanged.

Rights under section 313 BGB moreover only exist if the party affected by the interference with the agreement cannot reasonably be expected to adhere to the agreement.

This presupposes that performing the agreement would lead to an intolerable outcome that is simply incompatible with law and justice – something that must be determined by weighing up all the interests involved and taking all the circumstances into account.

Although it could be argued that a drastic increases in energy prices, for example, were almost impossible to foresee, only the risk of price fluctuation – and not the specific factor triggering that inflation – needs to be apparent.

Tenants already know from their own experience that the inflation rate changes from time to time and can rise sharply under certain circumstances.

So the fact that the parties decided to include a specific indexation clause makes it clear that they were aware of the opportunities and risks involved."
Gleiss Lutz,COMMERCIAL LEASE INDEXATION CLAUSES IN TIMES OF INFLATION,"So the fact that the parties decided to include a specific indexation clause makes it clear that they were aware of the opportunities and risks involved.

Finally, it should not be forgotten that tenants have definitely benefited from index-linked leases in the recent past because of the moderate inflation rate, which means that the current rent increases are only of limited significance in the overall context.

Amending the agreement by mutual consent Since this means that neither the premature termination of the agreement nor a claim for amendment according to the principles of interference with the basis of the transaction is likely an option, it is up to the parties to reach agreements on the amendment of the lease, which take their respective interests adequately into account.

There are many ways of doing this, but they all raise numerous legal questions.

The most obvious way of dealing with unusually large index fluctuation is to amend the contractual indexation clauses.

It can be agreed, for example, that the rent may only be adjusted if a certain threshold is reached or exceeded or only after certain periods have expired.

It can also be stipulated that only part of the index change will be passed on to the tenant.

Such contractual amendments are, however, only permitted within the limits laid down in the PrKG.

The parties can also leave the indexation clauses as they are, while agreeing that they will not apply or will be replaced by another adjustment mechanism (such as graduated or sales-based rent) for a limited period.

However, it is important to specify when the suspension of the indexation clause will take effect and end and how the suspension will work – for example, by clearly stating what index level will apply to rent changes once the indexation clause has come back into force.

Finally, it may be possible to agree on a form of commercial compensation that reduces the tenant’s payments while maintaining the contractual indexation clauses, for example by granting rent-free periods, rent reductions or deferrals, assuming the costs for modernisation work and/or investments or capping operating and other ancillary costs.

Many potential incentives can be considered here.

Which one is chosen and how it is implemented will depend on the circumstances of the individual case, in particular the landlords’ financial room for manoeuvre as well as the pressure on tenants to reduce costs.

Summary and conclusion Since the legislator has not yet laid down any provisions governing an unusually large change in the CPI and the Federal Court of Justice has not yet ruled on the associated legal issues, it is up to the parties to ensure that indexation clauses are amended appropriately.

When doing this, they must in particular stay within the limits set by the PrKG.

They must also ensure that the contractual amendments do not violate the statutory written form requirements, which would result in a right to terminate the agreement prematurely.

This ultimately represents a stress test for many lease agreements – with both parties facing opportunities and risks in equal measure."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"The EU, Switzerland, the U.S. and numerous other countries have once again expanded their sanctions against Russia due to its continuing attacks on Ukraine. 

The EU adopted what is officially its fourth sanctions package on 16 March 2022.

The new sanctions package follows the packages of 24 and 26 February 2022 ( newsletter of 28 February 2022 ) and 28 February/2 March 2022 ( newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) and includes bans on all transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises, new investment in the Russian energy sector, the export of a wide range of luxury goods to Russia and the import of certain iron and steel products from Russia.

This fourth sanctions package was preceded by the adoption of further sanctions against Russia and Belarus on 9 March 2022.

Switzerland and the U.S. have also expanded their sanctions.

Russia, in turn, is broadening its response with additional countermeasures over and above the initial steps approved by the Russian government on 28 February.

A Russian draft bill provides for much more far-reaching measures under certain conditions, including freezing assets and liquidating undertakings – measures that could also affect subsidiaries of Western companies.

Such companies should take precautionary measures as a matter of urgency – also with a view to possible legal protection later on.

EU sanctions The EU already introduced the following additional economic sanctions on 9 March 2022:

The list of persons who are no longer allowed to enter the EU, whose assets have been frozen and who are subject to the ban on providing funds or economic resources (see newsletter of 28 February 2022 and newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) was expanded to include a further 160 individuals, namely 146 members of the Federation Council and 14 “oligarchs”/businesspersons (see Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/396).

Restrictions were imposed on the export of maritime and radio-communication technologies (whether or not originating in the EU) to Russia (see Regulation (EU) 2022/394).

According to the new Article 3f Regulation (EU) 833/2014, it is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, the maritime navigation goods and technology listed in the new Annex XVI to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia, for use in Russia, or to be placed on board a Russian-flagged vessel.

Also prohibited are direct and indirect services of any kind in connection with the aforementioned goods and technology or their provision, manufacture, maintenance and use, as well as the direct or indirect provision of financing or financial assistance related to the aforementioned goods, technology and activities.

These bans do not however apply in certain situations, for example if the goods and technology are intended for humanitarian purposes.

In addition, special authorisation may be granted for non-military use and non-military end-users if it has been determined that the goods and technology or related technical or financial assistance are intended for maritime safety.

The Council also added the maritime sector to the list of legal persons, entities and bodies subject to bans in respect of investment services, transferable securities, money market instruments and loans, by including the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping in Annex XIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

The term “transferable securities” within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 was broadened to specifically include crypto assets, seeArticle 1, letter (f) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2022/394.

Sector-specific sanctions against Belarus were expanded (The Regulation (EU) 2022/398 amending Regulation (EC) 765/2006) to include the following financial sanctions: General ban on transactions with the Central Bank of Belarus related to the management of reserves or assets, including transactions with any person, entity or body acting on behalf of or at the direction of the Central Bank of Belarus."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"As for the financial sanctions against Russia, special authorisation may only be granted for such transactions if they are necessary to ensure the financial stability of the European Union or a Member State.

General ban on the provision of public financing for trade with and investment in Belarus.

This ban does not apply to binding commitments established prior to 10 March 2022, the provision of public financing or financial assistance up to a total value of EUR 10,000,000 per project for small and medium-sized enterprises established in the EU or to the provision of such financing or assistance for trade in food and for agricultural, medical or humanitarian purposes.

Ban on the listing and provision of services in relation to shares of Belarusian state-owned entities on EU trading venues as from 12 April 2022 (see newsletter of 28 February 2022 for the corresponding sanctions against Russia).

Restriction of financial inflows from Belarus to the EU by generally prohibiting the acceptance of deposits (as defined in the new Article 1, point (21) Regulation (EC) 765/2006) from Belarusian nationals or residents that exceed an amount of EUR 100,000.

One exception to this ban is if the deposits are necessary for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between the EU and Belarus.

As for the financial sanctions imposed on Russia (see Article 5c(1), letter (b) Regulation (EU) 2022/328), special authorisation may be granted in certain cases, for example if the deposit is intended exclusively for the payment of reasonable professional fees in connection with the provision of legal services.

The sanctions also include a ban on accounts of Belarusian clients being held by EU central securities depositories as well as on the sale of euro-denominated transferable securities issued after 12 April 2022 to Belarusian clients (see re corresponding sanctions against Russia: newsletter of 28 February 2022 ).

General ban on the provision of euro-denominated banknotes to Belarus or any Belarusian person, entity or body, including the Belarusian government and the Central Bank of Belarus, for use in Belarus.

Exclusion of the Belarusian banks listed in the new Annex XV to Regulation (EC) 765/2006 (currently: Belagroprombank, Bank Dabrabyt, Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus ), as well as legal persons established in Belarus more than 50% of which are directly or indirectly owned by one of the financial institutions listed in Annex XV, from specialised financial messaging services such as SWIFT as from 20 March 2022 .

With its Federal Council’s decision of 16 March 2022, Switzerland has once again (see newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) adopted the sanctions imposed by the EU on 2 and 9 March 2022 and will be revising the Ordinance on Measures against Belarus for this purpose.

By Ordinance of 15 March 2022, Annex 8 to the Ordinance on Measures connected with the Situation in Ukraine was also amended to include more than 200 additional natural persons and entities that will henceforth be subject to travel restrictions and/or financial sanctions.

In its fourth sanctions package of 16 March 2022 , the EU has again amended and tightened Regulations (EU) 269/2014 and 833/2014.

Compared to the situation on 9 March 2022, the comprehensive personal sanctions adopted by the EU have been extended to include a further 15 persons and nine entities, bringing the current totals to 893 and 65 respectively (see Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/427).

Of particular importance is the amendment of Regulation (EU) 2014/833 by Regulation (EU) 2022/428 in the form of a ban on engaging “ directly or indirectly

[...] in any transaction ” with specified companies and persons (see the new Article 5aa Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

Until 15 May 2022, this ban does not apply to the execution of existing contracts that were concluded before 16 March 2022 (“ wind down period ”)."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"Until 15 May 2022, this ban does not apply to the execution of existing contracts that were concluded before 16 March 2022 (“ wind down period ”).

It also does not apply to transactions that are absolutely necessary for the supply of fossil fuels and certain other raw materials to the EU, or to certain energy projects.

This new provision could be extremely significant, although some of the details are still somewhat vague.

Based on an initial assessment, the following can be said in this regard: The new provision first of all applies to the – currently twelve – companies listed in the new Annex XIX (including Rosneft , Transneft , Gazprom Neft and Kamaz ).

According to Article 5aa(1), letter (a) Regulation (EU) 833/2014, these are state-owned enterprises established in Russia and companies in respect of which Russia, its government or Central Bank has the right to participate in profits or with which Russia, its government or Central Bank has other substantial economic relationships.

In our view, the new Annex XIX is conclusive in this respect.

This means that companies that fulfil the above-mentioned requirements are only subject to the ban if they are listed in the Annex.

The direct and indirect ban on transactions also applies to subsidiaries of the companies listed in Annex XIX , provided that the listed companies hold more than 50% of the shares and the subsidiary is established outside the EU (Article 5aa(1), letter (b) Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

Subsidiaries within the EU are therefore not subject to the ban.

Finally, transactions with companies acting on behalf or at the direction of a listed company or a subsidiary subject to the ban are also prohibited (Article 5aa(1), letter (c) Regulation (EU) 833/2014).

“ Indirect ” transactions within the meaning of Article 5aa(1) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 are likely to cover scenarios in which the goods or services being traded – in the sense of a third-party sale – are ultimately passed on in economic terms to a listed company, its subsidiary or persons acting on their behalf or at their direction within the meaning of Article 5aa(1), letters (a) to (c) Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

The new ban on transactions is arguably a separate sanction mechanism that is independent of the ban on providing funds or economic resources under Article 2(2)

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 .

Although the two bans do not cover exactly the same ground, there is some overlap and they do complement one another.

For example, the ban on transactions under Article 5aa(1) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 also covers entities that are not subject to the ban on providing funds or economic resources under Article 2(2)

Regulation (EU) 269/2014.

The material scope of the ban on transactions under Article 5aa(1) Regulation (EU) 833/2014 may also differ from the scope of the ban on providing funds or economic resources in that it covers “transactions” that do not necessarily involve “economic resources” in the sense of the latter ban (e.g. the purchase of everyday goods).

Pursuant to the new Article 5j Regulation (EU) 833/2014, it will be prohibited as of 15 April 2022 to provide credit rating services to any Russian national or natural person residing in Russia or any legal person, entity or body established in Russia or to provide them with access to any subscription services in relation to credit rating activities.

This does not apply to nationals of a Member State or natural persons who have a temporary or permanent residence permit in a Member State.

Annex IV of Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 was also expanded.

It lists persons and companies connected to Russia’s defence technological and industrial base on whom tighter export restrictions regarding dual-use goods, as well as goods and technologies which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector, are imposed."

Prohibition of export to Russia or for use in Russia of luxury goods listed in Annex XVIII to Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, such as clothing, furnishings and sports equipment, the value of which exceeds EUR 300 per item, unless otherwise specified in the Annex (for vehicles, for example, the limit is EUR 50,000 per item).

U.S. sanctions Since our last Foreign Trade Law Update of 7 March 2022 , the U.S. has also expanded its economic sanctions against Belarus and Russia.

These include in particular: The further expansion of personal sanctions by supplementing the SDN list (“ specially designated nationals list” ).

Expansion of goods-related restrictions : Import bans from Russia will in apply in future to fish (products), spirits and non-industrial diamonds .

Added to this will be import bans in the energy sector with regard to crude oil, petroleum, petroleum fuels and oils, including distillation products, liquefied natural gas, coal and coal products.

In addition, “U.S. persons” (regarding this term, see newsletter of 7 March 2022 ) will be prohibited from investing in Russian energy products .

Moreover, U.S. persons may not assist foreign persons in carrying out acts of the aforementioned nature.

No banknotes denominated in US dollars may be exported from the United States or by a U.S. person to the Russian government or to a person resident in Russia.

U.S. persons are also prohibited from assisting foreign persons in acts of the aforementioned nature (e.g. payment in U.S. dollars or use of a U.S. bank)."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"U.S. persons are also prohibited from assisting foreign persons in acts of the aforementioned nature (e.g. payment in U.S. dollars or use of a U.S. bank).

As of 11 March 2022, export restrictions will apply on luxury goods to Russia and Belarus and – regardless of their location – to SDN-listed Russian and Belarusian “oligarchs” or “malign actors” who support the Russian or Belarusian governments.

The term “luxury goods” is broadly defined and – unlike under EU law – not limited by a minimum value.

They include, among other things, certain spirits, tobacco, ceramic and leather products, jewellery, watches and handbags, and certain items of clothing.

Items that were already in transit on 11 March 2022 are not subject to the new regulations.

Suspension of concessions to Russia at WTO level Independently of the fourth EU sanctions package, the Council gave the Commission the green light to co-sign a multilateral declaration on behalf of the EU that is to be published under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework.

This can include WTO measures to suspend concessions or other obligations vis-à-vis the Russian Federation, such as the suspension of most-favoured nation status for goods and services from the Russian Federation .

This would pave the way for tariff increases and further trade restrictions at WTO level.

Additional countermeasures proposed or implemented by Russia On the Russian side, as well, further countermeasures have been proposed or adopted since our last Foreign Trade Law Update of 7 March 2022 : From 8 March 2022 on, for example, restrictions on imports from and exports to “unfriendly states” will apply to certain products and raw materials .

This is meant to ensure the “security of the Russian Federation and the uninterrupted functioning of industry”.

However, this does not affect imports and exports for personal use.

Furthermore, as of 7 March 2022, it will be possible to suspend compensation payments to rights holders from “unfriendly states” for the use of patents without consent.

Russian parliament has additionally passed a draft bill allowing the executive branch to exempt certain goods from intellectual property rights protection .

This measure could presumably apply in particular to certain agricultural, medical and similar goods that can no longer be imported due to the sanctions and would therefore have to be produced in Russia itself in connection with substitution programmes.

This may severely affect the ability to protect commercial rights, but it is not yet clear which specific goods are affected by the measures.

A draft bill has been introduced in response to declarations by foreign companies that they will discontinue operations in Russia.

While it is not clear at present whether it will be adopted, this could happen at any time.

Courts would then be able to impose “ external management ” on Russian subsidiaries of foreign parent companies if applied for by a board member or the state authorities.

This only applies to companies that are at least 25% controlled by a natural person or legal entity from an “unfriendly state” such as, for example, the EU, Switzerland, the UK or the U.S., had a carrying amount of more than one billion roubles on the last balance sheet date and/or an average of more than 100 employees: The courts may order external management if the management bodies or shareholders have actually ceased managing the company .

This can in particular be the case if the (local) management and/or shareholders exited Russia after 24 February 2022, leaving the company without management or have committed acts that have significantly reduced assets, resulted in insolvency or led the company to cease business operations .

As a result, external management may be introduced for up to three months, and not terminated even if the company were to go back on its decision to stop doing business in Russia."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"As a result, external management may be introduced for up to three months, and not terminated even if the company were to go back on its decision to stop doing business in Russia.

External management can also be imposed if measures are taken that may lead to an “unjustified” discontinuation of activities, liquidation or the insolvency of the company.

This may especially be the case if, after 24 February 2022, the management bodies of the company have publicly announced the company’s discontinuation of business without any apparent economic reason, terminated material contracts of the company or notified more than one third of its employees that their jobs will be terminated.

The resulting external management can last up to six months, but may be terminated if the company revises its decision to stop doing business in Russia.

The court has to decide within seven days of receiving the application.

If petitioned, it can also decide to freeze all of the company’s assets.

Currently, Vnesheconombank (VEB) is expected to be appointed as external manager for the non-financial sector, and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency as external manager for the financial sector.

It should be noted that VEB itself is subject to a number of sanctions, particularly from the EU and the U.S.

The external management assumes all management powers.

The powers of all other management bodies, including all previously granted powers of attorney and all previously filed petitions for voluntary liquidation and/or bankruptcy, are suspended and opposing contracting parties cannot unilaterally terminate their contracts out of court.

The objective is to transfer all assets to a new company, which is then sold by public auction to new owners .

The original company would then be forcibly wound up.

For this purpose, the external management is granted extensive rights, similar to those of an insolvency administrator under German law.

It is also possible to recover assets that have already been transferred.

Prior to the court hearing, the company’s CEO or a shareholder holding more than 50% of the shares with voting rights may file a motion to dismiss, which must include a commitment to resume the company’s operations in Russia.

In this context, it would also be possible for the company to be sold to or held in trust by persons from states that Russia has not classified as “unfriendly” .

(International) legal protection against Russian countermeasures If these measures are implemented as announced or in a similar form, legal remedies may be available.

However, preliminary injunctions and direct legal remedies against the measures will most likely be almost impossible and could probably only be obtained from Russian courts.

But it is generally possible to assert compensation claims under the bilateral investment treaty between Germany and Russia of 13 June 1989, which has been in force since 5 August 1991 (the “ BIT ”).

The BIT protects investments of German investors in Russia , whereby investments comprise “all types of assets”.

This also includes, among other things, the assets in Russia which are likely to be affected by the measures outlined above, such as property, shares and other forms of participation in commercial enterprises copyrights, patents and trademarks, and claims to money or services.

Even if Russia were to terminate the BIT, investments already in existence at the time of expiration of the BIT would remain protected for another 20 years.

Under the BIT, investments of German investors are protected from expropriation and restrictions on the transfer of funds, among other things.

Expropriation in this context means not only direct expropriation, but also forms of indirect and de facto expropriation.

A de facto expropriation may exist if formal ownership remains, but all rights of use and disposal typically associated with ownership are withdrawn or substantially restricted ."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"A de facto expropriation may exist if formal ownership remains, but all rights of use and disposal typically associated with ownership are withdrawn or substantially restricted .

With regard to the planned Russian measures, this means the following: Should the Russian countermeasures provide for direct expropriation or seizure of foreign assets , German investors may be entitled to compensation.

If compensation is not paid (which is to be expected) or the amount is too low, this may constitute a breach of the BIT.

Insofar as Russia orders a receivership of foreign companies or businesses as a countermeasure or deliberately or consciously drives foreign companies into insolvency through other and similar measures – depending on the circumstances of the individual case and the specific form of the Russian measure – this may constitute de facto expropriation, which would likewise be subject to compensation.

The withdrawal or restriction of intellectual property (such as copyrights or patent rights) can also constitute a de facto expropriation and be subject to compensation.

This is particularly the case if the rights of use and disposal are restricted or adversely affected to such an extent that the intellectual property becomes economically virtually worthless.

But this, too, will depend on the specific Russian measures and the individual case.

A possible ban on the export of funds related to or generated by the investment or similar restrictions on payment transactions could be in violation of the right to the free transfer of funds, depending on the structuring of the Russian measures and the circumstances of the individual case.

This, too, would be subject to compensation.

However, as is typical for BITs concluded by Russia, the BIT only allows German investors to assert claims against Russia with regard to the “ extent and procedure of compensation

[due to expropriation] or the free transfer [of payments related to investments]” before an international ad hoc arbitral tribunal .

Thus, according to the wording of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal does not, at first glance, have jurisdiction to find that investments have been expropriated.

However, published decisions of arbitral tribunals against Russia do indicate that, in accordance with principles of international law, the BIT is to be construed to mean that the arbitral tribunal may also decide on the question of “whether” an expropriation has taken place.

International arbitral tribunals that have to decide on investment disputes are generally efficient and can conduct proceedings even if the respondent host state does not participate in the proceedings .

This was shown by the proceedings against Russia due to the expropriations that took place as a result of the annexation of Crimea.

Given the European and U.S. sanctions, however, hardly any assets will be available for enforcement at present, nor will Russia voluntarily comply with arbitral award against it in the future.

However, it will still be possible to enforce an arbitral award after the sanctions have ended (in Germany, for 30 years after the issuance of the award).

Furthermore, it is currently not out of the question that the sanctions regime could be changed to make it possible to enforce arbitral awards against sanctioned assets even if these awards were obtained after the sanctions were issued.

Conclusion and recommended actions The extended sanctions, especially those imposed by the EU and the U.S., are having an even greater impact on the Russian business of German/European companies than ever before.

A general ban on transactions of all kinds with widespread networks of Russian companies, above all with their non-European subsidiaries, along with bans on importing many iron and steel products are particularly relevant in practice and difficult to implement."
Gleiss Lutz,FOREIGN TRADE LAW UPDATE: FURTHER EU AND U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ENTER INTO FORCE; RUSSIA PLANS ADDITIONAL COUNTERMEASURES,"Any decision to exit or discontinue business activities in Russia as BP, IKEA, H&M, OBI or McDonalds have done, now needs to be weighed against potentially drastic retaliatory measures by the Russian state, putting considerable assets at risk.

Given the dynamic situation and the – as yet – uncertain extent of Russian measures, it is advisable to safeguard key documents and records now, regardless of whether investment protection applies.

This is especially true regarding possible claims for compensation.

For example, documents should be saved concerning the establishment of companies, businesses or branches, key performance indicators of the company or the operation (including the latest company valuations), contracts and other agreements, official authorisations and permits, copyright and patent rights and other intellectual property and expertise, profit projections and business plans as well as documents on the measures proposed by Russia and their implementation.

In short, it is advisable to prepare and save documentation providing information on the value of the company and how it is affected by Russian measures."
Gleiss Lutz,IS THE EUROPEAN WORKS COUNCIL DIRECTIVE ABOUT TO BE AMENDED?,"On 2 February this year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to initiate a legislative procedure to amend the European Works Council Directive (Directive 2009/38/EC).

Among other things, the resolution provides for extending the rights of European Works Councils, involving trade unions, requiring company managements to consult more with European Works Councils and facilitating the enforcement of the Directive for European Works Councils by enabling judicial appeals and imposing financial penalties.

I.

What does the European Works Council Directive regulate?

The European Works Council Directive aims to improve employees’ rights to information and consultation in Community-scale undertakings with more than 1,000 employees, of whom at least 150 must be employed in at least two Member States.

To that end, the Directive lays down a procedure whereby employees – represented by a special negotiating body – negotiate jointly with the central management of an undertaking or group of undertakings to reach an agreement on establishing a European Works Council.

Should the negotiations fail and no such agreement be reached or procedure for employee information and consultation be agreed, a European Works Council will be established by national law.

II.

Current legal situation and status of the legislative procedure The rules and requirements for establishing European Works Councils have been regulated since 6 May 2009 in the EU Directive 2009/38 and in the national legal acts implementing them which, in Germany, is the European Works Council Act (Europäische Betriebsrätegesetz, “EBRG”).

The European Parliament has now voted in favour of completely revising the Directive.

By resolution of 2 February 2023, the European Parliament adopted a report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calling on the European Commission to submit a proposal for a revised European Works Council Directive by 31 January 2024.

The Commission now has three months, i.e. until the beginning of May, to either report to the European Parliament on the specific next steps to be taken in this project or to explain why it will not be pursuing the proposed amendment.

If this is to be further pursued, the Commission’s proposal initiating the legislative procedure will then have to be submitted by 31 January 2024.

This proposal need not be identical to the resolution of the European Parliament; the Commission has broad discretionary powers in such matters.

III.

Content of the European Parliament’s resolution The resolution of the European Parliament (2019/2183(INL)) includes the following proposals to amend the European Works Council Directive: Extension of the information and consultation requirements The term “transnational issues” will cover all situations where decisions are taken in one Member State with a direct or indirect effect on another Member State.

Mandatory response of central management to European Works Council’s opinions The central management of the undertakings or groups of undertakings will be required to give a reasoned response to each opinion of the European Works Council.

Reinforcement of role of trade unions Trade union organisations will be authorised to assist the special negotiating body and the European Works Council in their relations with central management.

Gender balanced composition in the European Works Council At least 40% of the seats on the European Works Council and any committee will be required to be held by underrepresented genders.

Reduced timeframe for negotiations In future, negotiations between central management and the special negotiating body will begin within twelve months (instead of six months) following the request.

Instead of the current three-year period, the subsidiary requirements for establishing a European Works Council will be met by operation of law 18 months after the request if the parties are unable to conclude an agreement within this period."
Gleiss Lutz,IS THE EUROPEAN WORKS COUNCIL DIRECTIVE ABOUT TO BE AMENDED?,"Clearer rules on confidentiality Member States will clearly define the conditions under which central management is not required to inform the European Works Council or the Committee.

Central management will inform the European Works Council in the specific case of the existence of these confidentiality requirements and their duration.

Clearer rules on the timing of consultations between central management and the European Works Council Member States will ensure that the information and consultation procedure is held within a timeframe that allows the European Works Council to consult the representatives of the respective employees concerned in the national and local establishments before the end of the information and consultation procedure.

If there is a dispute between central management and the European Works Council as to whether an information and consultation procedure should be held, central management will issue a written statement explaining why no such procedure will be required.

Legislation and penalties Member States will be under an obligation to introduce legislation and penalties to effectively enforce the Directive, in particular: - The option of requesting a preliminary injunction for the temporary suspension of central management decisions.

- Judicial appeal procedures against the unlawful application of confidentiality exceptions or any other failure by central management to inform and consult.

- Financial penalties, exclusion from public aid or subsidies and exclusion from public invitations to tender in the event of infringements of this Directive or of agreements concluded thereunder.

Applicability of revised Directive All agreements of a European Works Council, regardless of their original date, will fall within the scope of the new revised Directive and be subject to its new regulations.

Amendment of the rules for a European Works Council applicable under national law The rules applicable to a European Works Council under national law will be amended as follows: - The European Works Council will hold meetings with central management twice instead of once every year.

- There will be more detailed duties of central management to inform and consult in exceptional circumstances.

- The role of representatives of recognised Union-level trade union organisations will be enhanced under these rules.

IV.

Outlook Should the Directive be implemented in accordance with the European Parliament’s resolution, this would significantly enhance the opportunities for involving European Works Council bodies, giving them far greater powers in key respects.

It remains to be seen whether the Commission will decide to pursue this further and submit a legislative proposal by 31 January 2024 and, if so, what amendments will be proposed."
Gleiss Lutz,EU COMMISSION PRESENTS PROPOSAL FOR GAS EMERGENCY PLAN,"On 20 July 2022, the EU Commission presented the proposal of its so-called Gas Emergency Plan.

This plan sets a 15 percent savings target for gas consumers in the Member States and should also allow for a forced reduction in gas consumption in all EU Member States in the event of a gas shortage in order to secure their gas supply throughout the winter.

The Gas Emergency Plan also provides criteria for a cut-off order for non-protected (industrial) customers.

The Commission stresses that the gas savings targets can be achieved not only by reducing gas consumption within industry or households, but also, for example, by substituting fuels used - thus the Commission again opens the discussion on the further use of nuclear power.

Gleiss Lutz - Comment The EU sets a target for Member States to reduce gas consumption by public authorities, households, energy suppliers and industrial customers by 15 percent until 31 March 2023.

In order to achieve this target, the Commission is initially relying on voluntary action and individual responsibility on the part of the Member States.

If it becomes apparent that the Member States will not achieve this target, the EU Commission can issue a so-called Union Alert.

By issuing a Union Alert, the savings target of 15 percent becomes mandatory in all Member States.

This savings target - should the proposal become a legally binding Regulation - may have an impact on the gas consumption behaviour of large parts of the industry.

This became apparent shortly after the proposal was published: The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection announced another energy security package and already referred to the 15 percent target.

It is therefore increasingly likely that there will be fixed savings targets for the gas-consuming industries in the coming days and weeks, so that Germany will meet its own and the European gas savings targets.

The proposal is also relevant for industrial companies because the Commission provides prioritisation criteria according to which a cut-off order for non-protected industrial consumers can be established.

Although the catalogue of criteria, which focuses in particular on the overall social importance of the company and aims to protect sensitive supply chains, is neither conclusive nor fully specified, it does give the criteria mentioned a particular weight in the establishment of a national cut-off order.

Principle of voluntariness and responsibility of the Member States The Regulation proposal on coordinated demand reduction measures for gas is based on Article 122 TFEU.

In essence, it provides for the Member States to initially reduce national gas consumption (in particular in the public, commercial and household sectors) on a stand-alone and voluntary basis between 1 August 2022 and 31 March 2023 by 15 percent compared to the average of the past five years.

The Member States are requested to update their national emergency plans by the end of September 2022 and to outline how they intend to achieve the 15 percent reduction target (compared to the average of the past five years).

The Commission is thus initially relying on the principle of ""voluntariness"" and leaving the responsibility for gas reduction with the Member States for the time being.

Union Alert Should it become clear, however, that this target will not be met or that there is a significant risk of a severe gas shortage, a so-called Union Alert can be declared.

The Union Alert would impose on all Member States a mandatory 15 percent reduction in gas demand in the period from 1 August to 31 March (compared to the average of the previous five years).

The aim of the Union Alert is to ensure the supply of gas to households and public consumers, such as hospitals, but also to industries that are crucial for the provision of essential products and services to the economy, as well as to the EU's supply chains and competitiveness."
Gleiss Lutz,EU COMMISSION PRESENTS PROPOSAL FOR GAS EMERGENCY PLAN,"Implementation of the gas consumption reduction The Commission's current proposal provides - both in the phase of voluntary gas reduction and after the Union Alert has been issued - that the Member States are in principle free to take appropriate measures to reduce gas consumption.

However, the measures must be transparent, proportionate, non-discriminatory and verifiable.

Furthermore, the measures should not lead to an undue distortion of competition, an impairment of the functioning of the internal gas market or endanger the security of gas supply of the other Member States.

The framework thus set is double-edged for Member States and companies: on the one hand, it leaves considerable scope for Member States to decide which measures they will use to reduce gas consumption; on the other hand, the EU framework is only defined by a large number of undefined legal terms, so that it will be difficult for companies to adequately prepare for a gas shortage situation and to legally monitor government measures taken.

The Regulation proposal also stipulates that Member States should think ""more broadly"" than just strictly reducing gas consumption.

In the text of the Regulation, the Commission mentions, for example, the possibility of using alternative fuels (coal, oil, nuclear power), of carrying out a national energy saving campaign or of implementing incentive systems for the change of energy sources or the reduction of consumption within industry.

Prioritisation of non-protected customers The Regulation proposal also provides for criteria on the basis of which the Member States can apply the gas reduction for non-protected customers.

The Commission thus defines guidelines for the Member States to ensure the application of objective and transparent principles in the selection process, which also takes into account the economic importance of the companies concerned.

In addition, further, non-exhaustive criteria are to be used in the prioritisation: the impact of a disruption on supply chains that are critical for society; the possible negative impacts in other Member States, in particular on supply chains of downstream sectors that are critical for society; the potential long-lasting damage to industrial installations; the possibilities to reduce consumption and substitute products in the Union.

The Regulation proposal thus largely fits into the context of the already ongoing discussion about possible (national) cut-off criteria.

The criteria named in a (legally binding) EU Regulation would be given special weight within this discussion, so that gas-consuming companies should check whether they fulfil individual criteria of the above list.

At the same time, it should also be recognised that this list is not exhaustive and that other criteria can also be used for the cut-off order.

This also applies, for example, to the regional distribution of gas in gas shortage areas, which follows technical specifications in particular.

Control mechanisms envisaged According to the proposal, the Member States are initially required to monitor their gas demand reduction measures themselves.

They are to report to the Commission every two months on the measures taken and the gas savings achieved.

If it becomes clear that a Member State's measures cannot ensure that it will voluntarily reduce its gas consumption by 15 percent, the Commission will require it to submit a plan setting out a strategy and measures to effectively fulfil the demand reduction obligation.

Solidarity in the event of a gas shortage In addition, Member States can already apply for so-called gas solidarity supplies under Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 if they face a gas shortage even though they have demonstrably taken all possible measures to reduce their domestic demand."
Gleiss Lutz,EU COMMISSION PRESENTS PROPOSAL FOR GAS EMERGENCY PLAN,"In this case, the immediate neighbouring states are obliged to supply the state in shortage with enough gas from their own reserves so that its vulnerable users can continue to be supplied with gas.

For these gas supplies, the neighbouring states receive financial compensation from the supplied state.

So far there has been no practical application of this; in view of the tense gas supply situation throughout the EU, gas solidarity will probably become a political point of controversy among the Member States.

Conclusion With the announced proposal, the EU Commission has now introduced an EU-wide Gas Emergency Plan into the discussion.

This contains, in particular, specific criteria for prioritising unprotected customers, which can be an indicator for gas-consuming companies for a gas cut-off order.

However, initial reactions indicate that the proposal will still undergo some changes.

It therefore remains to be seen in which form this EU Gas Emergency Plan will come into force and what implications it will have for the Member States and companies.

In any case, this development should be closely monitored, as the EU gas emergency plan could come into force at short notice and have a timely effect within the economy.

Close monitoring is also important with regard to the national measures, as since the publication of the Commission's proposal, the local discussion on gas supply security has also gained new momentum.

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection has already announced a further energy security package and since 22 July 2022 it has also been clear that a gas levy to support gas importers will be activated from 1 October 2022."
Gleiss Lutz,THE UK COMPETITION AUTHORITY INTRODUCES A NEW SUBSIDY ADVICE UNIT WHICH PROVIDES NON-BINDING ADVICE TO AUTHORITIES AND REPLACES THE FORMER NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT,"For many Britainophiles in the EU, the noise of the Brexiteers and their shouting about “world-beating Britain” during the last five years of the departure process have been hard to bear.

Gleiss Lutz,DYNAMIC GERMAN CANNABIS MARKET: RISING MEDICAL USE TODAY | RECREATIONAL USE TOMORROW,"I. The German cannabis market in Summer 2022

In just a few years, Germany has developed into an important sales market for medical cannabis.

In 2021 alone, statutory health insurance (SHI)-accredited physicians working in the statutory health insurance system prescribed cannabis-based medicines to the tune of some EUR 185 million, marking a growth of slightly more than 12% over the previous year.

In 2018, sales stood at EUR 74 million.

In 2021, the number of prescriptions for medical cannabis rose to 372,000, compared to 340,000 in 2020.

Unprocessed cannabis flowers accounted for almost EUR 70 million and cannabinoid-containing medicines for a further EUR 46 million.

No reliable figures are available for self-payers and private patients.

Sales may actually be higher than the statistics for the SHI system indicate because medical cannabis is only prescribed for SHI patients subject to very strict requirements – many of them obtain it on private prescription and pay for it themselves.

But there are further major changes on the horizon – the cannabis market is set to be liberalised to allow the use of cannabis for recreational purposes.

In June 2022, the Federal Government’s Drug and Addiction Commissioner held a large number of consultations on the subject of the coalition government’s decision to allow the sale of cannabis for recreational purposes.

The Federal Government is expected to publish a draft bill at the end of the year.

There is no saying at this stage, however, whether liberalisation will actually end up boosting sales of medical cannabis as well, especially since June 2022 also saw major changes in the price framework for medical cannabis dispensed within the German health system.

There follows an overview of the current legal framework for medical cannabis by Enno Burk, Dilara Puls and Xiao Chen , who will also provide a summary of the picture as regards the upcoming liberalisation of cannabis for recreational purposes.

They are members of Gleiss Lutz’s Berlin-based Healthcare practice group and one of their focuses is pharmaceutical and narcotics law and the statutory health insurance system.

II.

Legal classification of medical cannabis 1.

Medical cannabis as a medicinal product From importation and production right through to prescription within the statutory health insurance system and charging of the costs for prescribed medicines, the German market for medical cannabis is strictly regulated.

Even when used for medical purposes, therefore, cannabis is regarded as a non-marketable narcotic that is subject to the German Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz, “BtMG”). 

For that reason, import into Germany, wholesale distribution in Germany, processing steps within the meaning of the Medicinal Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz, “AMG”), storage, and advertising, are governed by rules and licensing requirements spread across various different laws.

In addition to that, medical cannabis must be prescribed by a doctor, and the doctor must draw up a detailed case history of the patient in an in-person consultation.

Cannabis may not be prescribed for the first time on the basis of a tele-consultation.

Only for certain serious illnesses may doctors prescribe cannabis for reimbursement by the statutory health insurance system.

Otherwise, they could find themselves facing recourse claims.

Under narcotics law, prescribing medical cannabis has to be a “means of last resort”.

Prescribing cannabis for recreational purposes without a compelling medical indication (usually chronic pain relief) is not permitted.

Approval by the health insurance fund is also required.

2. Growing, importing, producing and selling medical cannabis – what permits/licences are required?

The permits/licences required depend on the type of business activity and are shown in the following chart.

Please find the overview in high resolution here ."
Gleiss Lutz,DYNAMIC GERMAN CANNABIS MARKET: RISING MEDICAL USE TODAY | RECREATIONAL USE TOMORROW,"The permits/licences required depend on the type of business activity and are shown in the following chart.

Please find the overview in high resolution here .

3. Pharmacy-only for medical cannabis – sale as a magistral preparation or a proprietary medicinal product Medical cannabis may only be provided to patients by a pharmacy – including by mail order if they have a mail-order licence – and on presentation of the relevant prescription.

Section 21(1)

AMG stipulates a marketing authorisation for proprietary medicinal products, but this does not apply to medical cannabis sold in the form of dried flowers.

This is because the flowers are not produced, packaged and sold in advance as a proprietary medicinal product, but are the starting material to be used by pharmacies to produce a patient-specific magistral preparation.

Where a proprietary medicinal product prepared in advance contains active substances from the cannabis plant, on the other hand, this is subject to the usual marketing authorisation requirement under medicinal products law.

In the German pharmacy market, there are meanwhile a few dozen mail-order pharmacies that focus on supplying prescribed medical cannabis and have the necessary supply relationships with specialised wholesalers and importers.

III.

Reimbursement of costs, and new pricing rules introduced in SHI system in June 2022 1.

Statutory health insurance Under section 31(6) German Social Security Code, Book V ( Sozialgesetzbuch, “ SGB V ” ), patients with a serious illness are entitled under certain circumstances to receive medical cannabis in the form of dried flowers or extracts.

In addition, where a patient is prescribed cannabis for the first time, this requires approval by the health insurance fund, which may only be refused in justified exceptional cases.

Until now, based on the price agreements with pharmacies applicable to the health insurance funds, the chargeable rate for cannabis flowers of all varieties in their unprocessed state as well as in preparations was EUR 9.52/gram, regardless of the variety.

However, according to an arbitral award issued in June 2022, different charging rules are to apply retroactively as from 1 June 2021 : The chargeable rate is the ex-factory price of EUR 4.30/gram announced by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut für Arzneimitel und Medizinprodukte , “ BfArM ”), plus pharmacy markups.

Since BfArM cannabis flowers are only placed on the market in 50-gram packages and the shelf life is often less than six months, the arbitration board has laid down a rule for the charging of destroyed BfArM cannabis flowers: Between five and a maximum of 45 grams of destroyed BfArM cannabis flowers from a package may be charged at EUR 4.30/gram.

Pharmacies must cancel any charging done for magistral preparations since 1 June 2021 on the basis of the previous rules and charge them again.

2.

Private health insurance and self-payers For patients with private health insurance, there is no requirement for authorisation for the prescribing of medical cannabis.

Nevertheless, depending on the reimbursement rates agreed in their contract, their health insurance funds may refuse to assume the costs – e.g. if the therapy is not deemed medically necessary in the particular case.

Patients insured under the statutory health system can also have medical cannabis prescribed on a self-paying basis if, for example, they want to use it for palliative purposes before the health insurance company has given its approval, as the approval procedure often takes several weeks.

For pricing purposes, the provisions of the Medicinal Products Price Ordinance ( Arzneimittelpreisverordnung ) for magistral preparations apply.

The price per gram of cannabis flowers in magistral preparations is always based on the lowest purchase price paid by the pharmacy.

The purchase prices are freely negotiable between wholesalers and pharmacies.

Which authorities are responsible?

1.

Cannabis Agency The Cannabis Agency , a department of the BfArM, is responsible for the supervised cultivation and harvesting, processing and quality inspection, storage, packaging and sale of medical cannabis flowers produced in Germany.

The Cannabis Agency sells the cannabis flowers produced in Germany to pharmacies in its own name as a pharmaceutical entrepreneur and wholesaler and therefore also sets the ex-factory price for cannabis flowers that the pharmacies have to pay.

However, the Cannabis Agency is not responsible for the import of cannabis flowers.

Cannabis products are imported and sold through private pharmaceutical wholesalers and importers.

2.

Federal Opium Agency

The Federal Opium Agency is also a department of the BfArM and it monitors the trade in narcotics and precursors in Germany.

It issues licences for the import and export of narcotics (incl. psychotropics) and precursors from the EU.

It also monitors the movement of narcotics and precursors among licence holders (manufacturers, traders, importers, exporters, growers and scientific institutions) and carries out inspections of premises and storage facilities.

3. State authorities responsible in the case of imports from third countries When medical cannabis is imported from non-EU countries, the import permit required by the customs office is granted by the responsible state authority of the federal state into which the cannabis is being imported (cf. section 72a(1), sentence 1, no. 2 AMG).

The state authority also assesses whether the production in the third country is in compliance with GMP standards and checks whether a body equivalent to the German Cannabis Agency is monitoring the cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes.

4. Germany as an import market for medical cannabis Following a tender procedure in 2019, the Cannabis Agency awarded a contract for the cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis for medical purposes in Germany.

The contract was awarded to three companies and covered a total of 10.4 tonnes to be produced and sold over four years.

This amount does not even come close to covering the annual demand in Germany.

In 2021, around 20.6 tonnes of cannabis in the form of dried flowers and extracts was imported from EU states such as the Netherlands or third countries like Canada.

Thus, the amount imported is almost ten times that of the cannabis quantities produced each year in Germany (approx.

2.6 tonnes p.a.).

However, the BfArM cannabis is cheaper than imported cannabis: the price per gram is EUR 4.30 (for 50-gram packages).

V. Legalisation of cannabis for recreational purposes expected in 2023 On 25 October 2022, the German government adopted a key proposals paper outlining the material provisions of the intended law on the liberalisation of the consumption of cannabis for recreational purposes.

This paper is now to be submitted to the EU Commission for review and, if no concerns are raised, a draft bill will be presented.

According to the latest information from the Federal Ministry of Health, the bill should be ready by the end of the first quarter of 2023 and could therefore be presented to the Bundestag in the second half of the year.

In order to prove to the EU Commission that the proposals comply with European and international law, an expert report is to be prepared in parallel to the drafting process, which is to answer two crucial questions in particular.

One, will it be possible to curb the black market without expanding consumption through legalisation?

And two, how well will children and adolescents be protected?

It is still uncertain whether the Commission will give the go-ahead.

Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA POOLING BETWEEN COMPANIES,"Data pools are becoming increasingly important in the digital economy, giving rise to specific legal problems.

This article outlines the legal requirements and restrictions to be observed when setting up and operationalising data pools and looks at ways of structuring them.

Background Data pools, through which different companies combine and share data, are becoming increasingly important.

There are manifold reasons for establishing a common data pool.

For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, combining patient, clinical study and health data can provide far-reaching insights for fighting diseases or minimising health risks.

Similarly, companies in the financial sector, for example, can achieve significant efficiency gains by bringing together disparate financial data, both personal and non-personal in nature.

Of course, merging data from different sources and across company boundaries raises a number of legal issues, not least in the areas of data protection, contract and antitrust law.

Contractual aspects First, the companies concerned must lay down the terms and conditions under which the data will be collected, shared and used in a contract.

This is particularly important especially because there is no exclusive right to the individual pieces of data as such.

It is true that depending on the individual case, information contained in data may constitute business secrets within the meaning of section 2, no. 1 German Act on the Protection of Business Secrets (insofar as this is secret information of economic value which is protected by appropriate measures to maintain confidentiality).

Data collections may also be protected as databases within the meaning of section 87a German Copyright Act (whereby it is in particular unclear to what extent the generation of data is also to be regarded as an investment performance worthy of protection within the meaning of the provision and acts of infringement are limited to essential parts of the database).

However, there is to date no clear allocation in rem that would give the holder ownership or a comparable right to the respective data.

Consequently, there is generally no clear answer to the question as to whom the data should be allocated – the owner, the machine generating the data, the manufacturer of such a machine or the user.

Against this background, it is usually not any allocation in rem of the data that determines who can dispose thereof in practice, but rather the de facto control over such data.

When it comes to opening data assets so that they can be accessed and used by third parties – as is also the case with data pooling – the focus is therefore on solutions governed by the principle of private autonomy and thus questions pertaining to contract drafting.

With regard to data use and exploitation, data pooling contracts should contain the following provisions, among others: Classification of the contract type (relevant in particular for the applicable liability regime);"
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA POOLING BETWEEN COMPANIES,"As precise a definition as possible of the subject matter of the contract , including the data to be provided; in view of the data protection implications, the data pool should be limited as far as possible to the generation of non-personal data (machine data and/or anonymised data) (see below for details); Technical provisions for granting access, in particular laying down a common data format and transmission standard as well as the interfaces to be used (API); Any requirements for the quality of the data (this will generally be determined by the accuracy of the information contained in the data) or provision of the data “as is” and without any warranties; Safeguarding with regard to conflicting rights of third parties to the generated data; because of the uncertain legal situation concerning the allocation of the data (and possible defensive claims), the participants in the data pool should each ensure that they in turn obtain the consent of third parties involved in the generation of the data – e.g. owners/users of the devices generating the data for the comprehensive (commercial) use and application of the data; Structuring of the data pool participants’ rights of use and exploitation in respect of the generated data and the results produced on the basis of the data provided; copyright licences can generally be used as a guide in this regard (in particular, specification of the individual rights of use and exploitation and any restrictions on use, licence territory, licence term, sub-licensing and transferability).

When granting exclusive rights of use or making other exclusivity arrangements, the restrictions imposed by antitrust law must be observed in particular (see below for details);

Agreement of confidentiality obligations ; such a clause serves, on the one hand, to protect the information contained in the data provided, irrespective of whether this information falls within the scope of application of the German Act on the Protection of Business Secrets in the individual case (for the requirements for protection, see above).

On the other hand, confidentiality obligations can provide clarity on permitted and prohibited acts under the German Act on the Protection of Business Secrets.

This is because a breach of contractual restrictions on use can at the same time constitute a breach, in particular, of the prohibition of action in section 4(2), no. 2 German Act on the Protection of Business Secrets and trigger claims for injunctive relief and, if applicable, damages.

Therefore, the data use agreements drawn up within the framework of the data pool should clearly define the respective restrictions on use and confidentiality obligations, so that the participants can easily identify any unauthorised use of the data in breach of the German Act on the Protection of Business Secrets.

Legal requirements and restrictions to be observed when establishing and structuring data pools Both the establishment of a data pool and its subsequent management are subject to legal restrictions.

Data protection aspects The question of whether personal data should (also) be shared is a key factor to be taken into account when designing a data pool.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) permits the exchange of personal data only for clearly identified legitimate purposes and only if there is a legal basis for the data transfer.

“Sensitive” data such as health information or biometric or genetic data may generally only be processed and shared for research projects or similar purposes if the data subjects have given explicit consent for this in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.

Therefore, when designing a pooling project, it should be carefully examined whether the purpose pursued by the data pool cannot also be achieved if the exchange of personal data is dispensed with altogether or if the data to be shared are anonymised in advance."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA POOLING BETWEEN COMPANIES,"It should be noted that data are only considered anonymised in the legal sense if it is technically impossible to restore the link to specific persons or this can only be achieved with disproportionate effort.

If the processing of personal data is unavoidable, compliance with the following requirements in particular must be documented (Article 5(2) GDPR): Examination and correct classification of the roles of the participants .

If several parties involved in the data pool act as “joint controllers” (Article 4, no. 7, Article 26 GDPR) or if a service provider or platform operator is involved as a “processor” (Article 28 GDPR), data protection agreements covering the content prescribed by law must be concluded; Specification and description of the categories of data subjects and personal data which are the subject of the data pool, as well as the purposes and legal bases of the data processing and the data recipients; Description and implementation of technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of data security appropriate to the risk (Article 32 GDPR); Carrying out of a formal data protection impact assessment if this is necessary, for example, due to the sensitivity of the data (Article 35 GDPR);

Implementation of an erasure plan that ensures the erasure of personal data that are no longer needed for the specified processing purposes (Article 5(1)(e), Article 17 GDPR);

Information to be provided to the data subjects (Articles 13, 14 GDPR).

Antitrust aspects It has to be checked on a case-by-case basis whether the data pool itself and its structure are permissible under antitrust law.

There is no specific case law or official decision-making practice in this area yet, but the following general comments can be made based on various scenarios.

Requirements and restrictions to be observed when accessing and participating in data pools When a data pool is set up, it must first of all be determined which companies are to be granted access to the pool and under which conditions.

From an antitrust law perspective, the question of who has access to a data pool is of particular relevance.

Access restrictions may constitute a barrier to market entry depending on how important the data pool is for participation in the market.

Generally speaking, access rules that meet the following requirements are unobjectionable: Access to the data pool is open to all interested companies on the basis of objectively justified and uniform criteria.

Access to data is granted under FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) conditions.

The participating companies are involved in determining the relevant data pool specifications/standards, for example in connection with the data taxonomy or the data format used.

If these conditions are not met, however, this does not necessarily mean that the pool has an anticompetitive structure.

Even a restricted group of participants may be justified under certain circumstances.

However, this always requires careful consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, with the importance of the data pool and its effects on the market position of participating companies being some of the key aspects.

For example, in the case of a pool with market power, an obligation to admit competitors seeking access may arise from the abuse of dominance prohibition under antitrust law.

Conversely, a data pool of smaller companies can also be permissible as a closed shop precisely as a counterweight to the market power of larger competitors.

Requirements and restrictions to be observed for the data made available The ban on cartels enshrined in Article 101 TFEU/section 1 German Act against Restraints of Competition gives rise to additional mandatory restrictions to be observed when structuring data pools."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA POOLING BETWEEN COMPANIES,"Here, too, a case-by-case assessment is necessary, as the permissibility of an exchange of data depends on an overall consideration of various factors (such as the nature of the data and the relevance thereof for competitors, the respective market conditions, the market concentration, the level of detail of the data and how up to date they are, as well as the frequency of the exchange).

Special requirements may also have to be observed, for example, if the exchange of data may have the effect of aligning prices, for example in interaction with price algorithms, or enables price discrimination.

Irrespective of the need to consider these issues on a case-by-case basis, the following general statements can be made: Competitively sensitive, strategically relevant data (such as prices, specific customer offers, individual marketing strategies) must not be shared with competitors, as such an exchange can, as a hardcore antitrust law violation, result in substantial fines.

In contrast, it is essentially unproblematic to share data originating from a technical context or required to ensure interoperability between applications and/or devices, e.g. in the IoT area or to enable Industry 4.0 applications in technical terms.

For antitrust law reasons, too, it is generally the case that only data that are absolutely necessary for the respective purposes should be shared ( minimisation principle ).

In addition, it has to be ensured that antitrust restrictions are observed when structuring how access is to be granted to the pooled data.

State-of-the-art safeguards should be put in place for this purpose.

Among other things, the following should be ensured: Clear guidelines should be laid down as to what kind of data may be shared via the pool and the extent to which such data has been processed .

The specific way in which access to the pool is granted should be set up in a way that compliance with the antitrust safeguards is already ensured by technical means ( compliance by design ).

Uniform pseudonymisation and/or anonymisation procedures should be developed to ensure that the exchange of information is permissible under antitrust law (and data protection law).

In addition, it should always be borne in mind that extended data access via the pool may also have individual consequences for the participating companies.

According to section 18(3), no. 3 and section 18(3a), no. 4 German Act against Restraints of Competition, access to data is to be used as an assessment factor for determining market power, so that participation in a data pool and the access to data obtained via this pool may affect the assessment of the market position of a company under competition law.

Requirements and restrictions during the implementation of the cooperation It is not only the access to and structure of the data pool as such that are subject to antitrust law restrictions, but also the cooperation of the participating companies in the context of the pool.

The following points in particular should therefore be taken into account: Participants must not be told what prices they are to charge for services enabled by the shared data (for example, marketing advertising space using shared targeting data).

Nor may the pool participants coordinate their activities relating to other strategic aspects , for example by dividing up among themselves the customers who can be approached using the data in question.

Apart from agreeing on compliance with legal requirements, the pool participants may not agree on who is to use the shared data and how.

If the participants commit themselves exclusively to the pool, the permissibility of such an arrangement under antitrust law must be examined in each case on the basis of the specific circumstances.

The same applies to measures that at least indirectly have a lock-in effect for the participants."
Gleiss Lutz,DATA 360° – DATA POOLING BETWEEN COMPANIES,"The same applies to measures that at least indirectly have a lock-in effect for the participants.

The participants’ ability to share their data individually with each other and/or with other companies in addition to the pool should not be restricted.

If the agreements on the data pool contain so-called grant back and/or forward feed clauses , these should be checked to ensure that they are permissible under antitrust law.

Outlook The draft “Data Governance Act” presented by the EU Commission could introduce new regulations relevant to data pools.

The draft contains provisions relating to “data intermediaries”.

These data intermediaries will be monitored by the state and must make the data pools they have built up accessible to all interested users on a non-discriminatory basis.

At the same time, they are to protect the right of “data donors” to determine what information is made available by ensuring that the data are only made accessible for purposes for which the data subjects have given consent in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.

In a similar way to the “Data Governance Act”, the “Data Act”, which is also still moving through the EU legislative process, is intended to ensure fairness of data access and use in B2B situations by way of new provisions.

It will be necessary to keep an eye on these and other legislative developments in the European Union.

However, there is no question that the (economic) importance of data pools will continue to grow in the future."
Gleiss Lutz,CHANGES IN THE STATUS DETERMINATION PROCEDURE,"In September 2021, we had already informed you about the new version of section 7a German Social Security Code, Book IV ( Sozialgesetzbuch, Viertes Buch , “SGB IV”) which will come into force on 1 April 2022.

We would now like to present the most important changes which are meant to simplify and expedite the procedure.

Current situation The applicability of labour law provisions depends on whether or not a person is classified as an “employee” as defined in labour law.

Social security law, on the other hand, takes the existence of employment within the meaning of section 7 SGB IV as a basis.

The definitions of the term “employee” under labour law and under social security law are largely identical, but not entirely so.

Since an incorrect classification, for example in connection with pseudo self-employment, gives rise to considerable financial and even criminal liability risks for the employer, section 7a SGB IV provides for a “status determination procedure” with which the principal and the contractor can have the German Statutory Pension Insurance ( Deutsche Rentenversicherung , the “DRV Bund”) examine and ascertain in an administrative procedure whether or not compulsory insurance applies.

New rules The new provision in section 7a SGB IV does not affect the substantive legal demarcation between dependent employment and self-employment, but makes significant changes with regard to the procedure: Employment status: As of 1 April 2022, the DRV Bund will no longer determine whether an obligation to insure exists, but rather what the employment status is, i.e. dependent employment or self-employment.

Predictive decision: In the future, it will be possible to have the employment’s status determined even before the employment commences.

The review will be performed primarily on the basis of the contractual agreement, but the contracting parties must additionally provide information on the intended practical implementation of the contractual provisions.

Oral hearing: While up to now, the entire status determination procedure had only been conducted in writing, in the future, the parties involved in an objection procedure against a status determination by the DRV Bund will have a right to an oral hearing in which they can explain the circumstances of the employment relationship.

Determination of status in three-party relationships: Up to now, whenever external staff were used, the relationship between the principal and the contractor, as well as that between the contractor and the third party, had to be examined separately.

In the future, it will be possible to examine three-party relationships in a uniform procedure, in which the existence of covert personnel leasing can be investigated.

Group determination: While up to now the DRV Bund had always determined employment status for a specific individual case, in the future it will also be able to determine the employment status of several persons at once by way of an expert opinion, provided that they perform an activity based on a uniform contract which is identical in terms of type and circumstances.

Such a group determination can only be requested by the principal and has no binding effect on the DRV Bund or other insurance providers.

Gleiss Lutz comments The changes, most of which are initially limited until 30 June 2027, pursue the objective of a simplified and expedited procedure.

It remains to be seen whether these changes will in fact ease the DRV Bund’s workload and reduce the time needed to perform a status determination.

It is a welcome development that the question of employment status, which often remained open in the previous determination procedure, will in future be decided by the DRV Bund, thus creating more legal certainty for the parties involved."
Gleiss Lutz,CHANGES IN THE STATUS DETERMINATION PROCEDURE,"The newly created possibility of predictive decisions and status determinations in three-party relationships, as well as the binding effect of the DRV Bund’s decisions, are also of central importance in providing legally certainty for the parties involved."
