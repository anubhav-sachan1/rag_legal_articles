Hengeler Mueller,Additional compliance burdens to be expected,"In November 2021, Germany's new governing parties, the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), presented their coalition agreement.

It was formally signed in December.

On three key compliance issues – corporate sanctions, whistleblower protection and human rights protection in supply chain management – there are indications that, in the medium term, implementation of the new Government's plans will create significant additional regulatory burdens for German business.

Corporate sanctions According to their agreement, the coalition parties intend to review the provisions on corporate sanctions, including those on sanction amounts, in order to increase legal certainty for companies with regard to their compliance obligations and to create a precise legal framework for internal investigations.

Even from an initial review, one cannot help thinking that the new provisions will be principally designed to introduce higher sanctions for companies.

Even though the primary reason given for their introduction is to create greater legal certainty, this does not necessitate a corporate sanctions law, as apparently favoured by representatives of the SPD and the Greens.

By the same token, discussion on the draft German Act on the Sanctioning of Entities ( Verbandssanktionengesetz ) during the last legislative term showed that lawmakers very quickly reached their limits in providing for specific compliance obligations due to the diverse nature of the parties affected by the regulations.

The same is likely to apply to the establishment of detailed provisions on internal investigations: among other reasons, this is because of the immediate relevance to labour and co-determination law, as well as to data protection law, which is primarily established by European law.

Whistleblower protection – implementation of the EU Whistleblower Directive Another item on the Government's agenda is the legal certainty and practical transposition of the EU Whistleblower Directive.

Whistleblowers are to be protected against any legal disadvantages - not only when reporting breaches of EU law, but also when reporting significant rule breaches or other significant misconduct where detection is notably in the public interest.

During the last legislative term, implementation of the EU Whistleblower Directive failed due to opposition from the Conservatives to overachieving the transposition of the Directive into national law (also known as ""gold-plating"").

Now, gold-plating will be carried out, i.e. statutory whistleblower protection, not only in the case of breaches of EU law as provided for in the Directive, but also in cases far beyond that.

What might seem appropriate from the whistleblower's viewpoint raises serious questions from the perspective of other affected parties.

In some cases, whistleblower protection may entail far-reaching encroachments on the affected companies' fundamental rights (and possible restrictions on the functions of relevant government bodies).

The coalition agreement appears to provide for such protection even where there has been no violation of law but (lawful) ""considerable misconduct"".

–If this policy decision would be transposed into law, the transposition act's conformity with constitutional law would require a thorough review.

Supply chains Furthermore, the new Government is backing an effective EU Due Diligence Act based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights that does not place undue strain on SMEs.

Moreover, the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains is to be implemented without alteration and will possibly be improved.

From a company perspective, keeping the current version of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains and implementing it unaltered can be viewed as being in the interests of legal certainty and predictability."
Hengeler Mueller,Additional compliance burdens to be expected,"Supporting an ""effective EU Due Diligence Act"" will, however, probably result in further increases to the administrative burden and create sanction risks for companies.

In light of how the European law-making process has evolved, it is anticipated that obligations beyond those which are applicable under national law – in particular for SMEs – will be included at the EU level.

Outlook Implementation of the amendments, as proposed in the coalition agreement with regard to current compliance matters, would materially change the legal framework for the companies concerned.

Currently, it appears probable that this will result in an additional burden on them for preventive compliance and possibly lead to subsequent stricter sanctioning as well.

Companies should therefore assess the draft legislative proposals in good time and address any necessary concerns.

Equally, this may also present opportunities, particularly with a view to refining compliance management systems and taking account of ESG considerations.

Companies should exploit these opportunities at the earliest possible stage."
Hengeler Mueller,ESG update: Hydrogen's role on the path to climate neutrality,"Hydrogen hast vast potential to transform our economy in a sustainable manner on the path to achieve climate neutrality by 2045.

For the industrial sector, which is very energy-intensive, or freight transport it could be the key to a balanced carbon budget.

But what are the related challenges and what legal frameworks and fundamental issues must be addressed in the process?

Hengeler Mueller counsel Dr Moritz Rademacher, an expert in energy law and regulated industries, discusses these and many other key questions in the interview.

Hengeler Mueller,Protecting human rights and the environment along supply chains,"Starting this year, the protection of human rights and the environment along German companies' supply chains will become even more important not just in terms of impact on their reputations, but as a legal obligation as well.

The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act The Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – or LkSG – took effect on 1 January 2023.

A last-minute effort by opposition parties to delay the law's entry into force appears to have failed.

On 15 December 2022, the alliance of Christian Democrats/Christian Socialists (CDU/CSU) submitted a motion in the Bundestag to postpone the enactment of the LkSG by two years because of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war was putting on the Germany economy.

The motion is scheduled to be discussed further this month, even though the LkSG has already taken effect.

Under the new law, large companies with more than 3,000 employees based in Germany now have to comply with far-reaching due diligence obligations relating to the protection of human rights and certain environmental goods along their global supply chains.

The obligations include a comprehensive risk assessment, implementation of a risk management system, publication of a senior management declaration on the company's human rights strategy, taking remediation measures where required, and the operation of a complaint mechanism.

From 1 January 2024, the law will also apply to all companies with 1,000 or more employees in Germany.

As the new law includes fairly broad, complex and vaguely worded legal concepts, guidance on its implementation issued by the relevant government agency, the Federal Office of Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA), carries significant weight: that guidance has been intensely debated by German companies in recent months.

So far, BAFA has published two handouts and a questionnaire.

The handouts contain useful information for companies, but are unspecific on certain provisions of the law.

To some extent, they adopt an interpretation of the law that is perceived as being unreasonably broad and challenging for affected companies.

The questionnaire is designed to be used by companies for generating a complete report to be submitted to BAFA in order to fulfil their reporting obligations, as outlined in the law.

Containing numerous closed or multiple-choice questions, the questionnaire is supposed to make the process easier for companies, but it also creates a risk: such a narrow structure cannot always do justice to the required nuances of implementation at a company-wide level.

It remains to be seen how BAFA will deal with the (still considerable) legal uncertainty of how companies are supposed to achieve compliance with the law and whether this will be reflected in BAFA’s enforcement approach during the initial phase after it enters into force.

A proposed European Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD)

In addition to requirements under national law, it is likely that human rights due diligence will also become regulated by EU law.

In February 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence to complement the existing legal framework, which is based predominantly on ESG reporting obligations such as those defined in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Recently, the Council adopted its position, which the European Parliament is expected to concur with in May 2023, paving the way for negotiations on the final language of the CSDD later this year.

The Commission and the Council are largely in agreement on the scope of the CSDD's application.

Companies established under the laws of an EU member state are to be covered by the directive if they have an average of more than 500 employees and a worldwide net turnover of more than EUR 150 million in the previous business year."
Hengeler Mueller,Protecting human rights and the environment along supply chains,"If they are active in so-called 'high impact sectors', companies with an average of more than 250 employees and an annual worldwide turnover of more than EUR 40 million can also fall within its scope.

Non-EU companies incorporated under the laws of a third country will be obliged to comply with the CSDD if they had a net turnover in the Union of more than EUR 150 million in the previous financial year.

As it stands, the draft directive imposes far-reaching corporate due diligence obligations.

Companies will be required to identify potential or actual negative impacts on human rights and the environment linked to their business activities, those of their subsidiaries and those of their direct and indirect business partners who are part of the ""chain of activities"" and they will have to avoid or eliminate them, respectively, as far as possible.

The draft directive also provides for an obligation to establish and maintain a complaints procedure, as well as an obligation for companies to evaluate their own activities and actions regularly in addition to those of their subsidiaries.

In the event of violations, enforcement measures, including fines, will apply.

In contrast to the LkSG, the proposed directive explicitly provides for civil liability if a company has not fulfilled its obligations.

German companies will have to devote significant resources in the coming years to ensure that they are compliant with the new regulatory framework for protecting human rights and the environment, to avoid regulatory enforcement and litigation risks, and to protect their reputations."
Hengeler Mueller,Climate litigation as a business risk,"The rise in climate-related litigation over recent years (particularly following the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement) has resulted in increased litigation risks for companies.

Since 2020, about 500 such cases have been registered globally (a quarter of the total number of climate actions recorded).

The majority originate from the US, while Australia, the UK and the EU are increasingly popular jurisdictions.

Pro-regulatory claims for more climate protection Most claims seeking greater climate protection are directed against states, but they are increasingly being brought against companies in a variety of sectors, including energy, transport, food and agriculture, and finance.

In March 2021, the Federal Constitutional Court required the German legislature to amend the Climate Protection Act.

The court considered the climate protection measures in the Act to be insufficient to protect future generations, finding the Act to be unconstitutional in this respect.

The court assumed a constitutional duty of the state to protect citizens from climate change risks, thereby making climate protection actionable to a certain extent.

Increasingly, claimants are also seeking to compel companies to meet certain climate targets through private law actions.

In May 2021, the District Court of The Hague issued a widely publicised ruling ordering the oil and gas company Shell to reduce its global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 compared to 2019.

It is noteworthy that the court not only looked at Shell's own emissions, but also assumed a best-efforts obligation on Shell to work towards a reduction of emissions in business relationships with its suppliers and end users.

The ruling is under appeal.

Following the Shell ruling, the main claimant in the case, the NGO Milieudefensie, called on 30 other companies, including the airline KLM, the bank ABN Amro and the consumer goods manufacturer Unilever, to submit emission reduction plans.

In Germany, four climate claims were filed in 2021 that attempt to follow up on the argument of the Federal Constitutional Court by making a right to climate protection actionable in relation to companies.

The claims, which were filed by the NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe (""DUH"") and Greenpeace, are directed against BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen, demanding that the German auto manufacturers commit to a tighter carbon emissions budget, and discontinue the worldwide sale of cars with internal combustion engines by 2030.

A climate change claim has also been filed against Wintershall Dea to prevent the Norwegian gas and oil producer from developing any new natural gas or oil production after 2026.

On 13 September 2022, the Stuttgart Regional Court dismissed the action against Mercedes at first instance.

The court found insufficient proof that the claimants' personal rights would be impacted.

In addition, the court emphasised that the courts are prohibited from taking legislative decisions.

DUH filed an appeal.

In the Shell case, the Dutch court relied on a provision of Dutch law, pursuant to which a breach of an unwritten standard of care (in this case, among other things, knowledge about climate change) can result in liability towards third parties.

German tort law does not have such a far-reaching general clause.

Instead, claimants in a German claim must show: (i) damage to a legal interest protected under the German Civil Code; (ii) a causal link between a company's actions and the alleged damage; and (iii) that the respondents are liable, even while acting in compliance with applicable law.

It is unlikely that these hurdles can be easily overcome.

Compensatory claims The best-known climate-related compensatory claim in Germany is that of Saúl Lliuya's (""SL"") against RWE, the German multinational energy company."
Hengeler Mueller,Climate litigation as a business risk,"Compensatory claims The best-known climate-related compensatory claim in Germany is that of Saúl Lliuya's (""SL"") against RWE, the German multinational energy company.

As a resident of Huaraz, a Peruvian city situated below a glacial lake, SL claims that climate change has caused increasing glacial melt, which has led to a significant rise in the lake’s water level.

In order to protect Huaraz from flooding, various protective measures have to be implemented.

SL is seeking a declaration that RWE will contribute to the cost of these measures.

The lawsuit claims that the share of the costs to be paid by RWE must be based on the proportionate share of greenhouse gas emissions caused by RWE worldwide since the beginning of industrialisation, which is claimed to amount to 0.47 per cent.

On appeal, the Hamm Higher Regional Court considered the action to be sound in principle and has since entered the evidentiary stage.

It remains to be seen whether German courts will find a causal link between emissions, climate change and the alleged damage, and how they will approach the fact that the emitter complied with applicable law.

Conclusion Climate litigation is on the rise (and is widely anticipated to increase further, particularly as a result of extreme weather events), presenting a real risk for companies.

Potential climate claims pose significant strategic, financial and reputational risks.

A transition plan detailing the company's intended contribution to achieving the Paris climate goals may help to limit these risks."
Hengeler Mueller,Diversity within the Firm: Our Commitment to a More Colourful Future,"One of our goals as a law firm is to attract exciting personalities to work with.

Valuing diversity in all its dimensions, we treat one another based on mutual respect and using constructive communication.

Combined with a high degree of diversity, this creates new perspectives and benefits all of us – both in the quality of our work and in how we interact with each other.

For that reason, fostering greater diversity among our staff is an important objective for everyone at Hengeler Mueller.

To achieve this, we have built strong internal and external networks in addition to starting various initiatives and organising events to promote an inclusive environment.

We pursue our goals in a strong, dedicated and collegiate team: equal opportunities for women and men are a matter of course, continuously supported and fostered through various programmes that further equalise career opportunities.

This includes monthly lunch meetings for female lawyers, as well as our annual Hengeler Mueller Women's Day, during which we encourage dialogue between female lawyers through training, workshops and panel discussions.

We have also welcomed partners from our Best Friends network at these events.

In addition, we organise special hiring events for female lawyers, a leadership programme for women in management positions in cooperation with our Best Friends affiliates, and professional coaching for selected female associates with the aim of strengthening and advancing their careers.

HM Pride is an internal LGBTQIA+ and friends network at Hengeler Mueller.

This network’s mission is to support and foster an inclusive working environment in which everyone feels at ease and can develop their potential as well as contribute their individual talents – regardless of their sexual identity or orientation.

International networking is also important to us, which is why we work closely with our international Best Friends affiliates.

For example, we organise regular LGBTQIA+ inclusion events together with our Best Friends.

Our Cultural Diversity network regularly initiates a range of different formats and events to promote intercultural dialogue.

For example, this network has set up a Cultural Calendar – using a blog to draw attention to various holidays and festivals of all cultures on the firm-wide intranet in order to strengthen cultural awareness in our day-to-day work even further.

We have arranged 'Diversity Talks’ internally for years, typically attracting around 100 participants.

At these events, we invite interesting personalities from outside the firm who are strongly committed to diversity and inclusion to describe their own careers and share with us their experiences, perspectives and ideas for promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace.

For many years, we have been active in the German employer initiative ' Charta der Vielfalt ' and since the start of 2023, we have also been a partner of the General Counsel for Diversity & Inclusion (GCD&I).

We are committed to the initiative's guiding principle: ""We promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Legal Sector"".

Through GCD&I, we are expanding our commitment to greater diversity beyond our firm and in particular to our relationship with our clients' legal departments.

We embrace diversity in all of its dimensions – be it gender, cultural and social background, ethnicity, religion/worldview, sexual orientation, disability, or age.

Together with our Best Friends affiliates, we are also part of the Stonewall Global Diversity Champions programme.

Our participation in various work shadowing programmes and our support for short-term internship programmes also contribute to strengthening our firm’s intercultural diversity.

For example, we took on interns from Ukraine at short notice in 2022 via the 'Safe Harbour' programme.

The same programme also helped female VIS MOOT students leave war zones in Ukraine."
Hengeler Mueller,Diversity within the Firm: Our Commitment to a More Colourful Future,"For example, we took on interns from Ukraine at short notice in 2022 via the 'Safe Harbour' programme.

The same programme also helped female VIS MOOT students leave war zones in Ukraine.

Since 2023, we have also been supporting the internship programme of the German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (IRZ), which works on behalf of the German government.

Under this framework, we host interns for several weeks, who familiarise themselves with life in the German legal profession.

During short lunch talks, our lawyers also gain an insight into the legal system in their countries of origin.

Following our first ever diversity survey in 2022, we adopted a number of suggestions and implemented them over the course of the past year.

For example, the establishment of a distinct scholarship programme for students with obstacles in their educational background was one suggestion that emerged from the survey.

The first round of 'Chancen@Hengeler' scholarships started in the 2023 winter semester.

Eight students who, for various reasons, such as coming from a family without university experience, having a refugee background or for financial reasons, do not have the same start in life as their fellow students, will receive financial and non-material support.

In addition to financial assistance, they will receive personal guidance from a mentor and access to exclusive law firm events.

These are just a few of the initiatives we are pursuing to promote diversity within our firm.

We are very much aware of our social and corporate responsibility and will therefore continue to develop initiatives in this area in the coming years."

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Sharing is caring - Data Governance Act meets DG COMP,"January 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Sharing is Caring: Data Governance Act Meets DG COMP

As we welcome 2022 and set New Years resolutions that we will never keep, it is out with the old and in with another piece of Commission legislation concerning the digital sector.

Please welcome the Data Governance Act (DGA).

According to the Commissions calculations, between 2018 and 2025, the amount of data generated by public bodies, businesses and citizens is expected to multiply by five.

As a result, the Commission came with the DGA legislative proposal to allow these data to be harnessed and pave the way for sector-specific European data spaces to benefit society, citizens and companies.

After a brief overview of the current draft, we will discuss whether it facilitates cartels, and if the DGA will impact EU merger control.

New Kid on the Block The DGA aims to increase trust in data sharing, creates new EU rules on the neutrality of data marketplaces and facilitates the reuse of certain data held by the public sector.

It sets up common European data spaces in strategic domains, such as health, environ- ment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and professional services.

Also, according to the Commission, the potential of artificial intel- ligence cannot be unlocked without data sharing, which helps start-ups and businesses develop an ecosystem based on EU standards.

In a nutshell, the DGA seeks to achieve the following goals:  Making public sector data available for reuse,  Sharing of data among businesses,  Allowing personal data to be used with the help of a personal data-sharing inter- mediary (designed to help individuals exercise their rights under the General Data Protection Regulation),  Allowing data use on altruistic grounds.

Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

January 2022 2

The initial draft was published on 19 February 2020, while the current draft dates back to 25 November 2021.

On 30 November 2021, the European Parliament ITRE committee reached an agreement on the draft DGA.

Due to further delay from an internal scrutiny board, the updated draft is due to be published on 23 February 2022.

Going forward, the informal agreement will have to be formally endorsed by the European Parliament and Council to come into force.

Carte blanche for Cartels?

Although the wording sharing of data among businesses sounds like a perfect cartel storm, that is clearly not the case  the Commission painstakingly weaved into the DGA a number of firewalls, in order to prevent any loopholes.

For instance, the draft specifies that it does not interfere with the application of EU competition rules, in particular rules on the exchange of competitively sensitive information between actual or potential competitors through data sharing services.

The DGA provisions arrive just in time for certain industries which are based on data- pooling, such as the financial sector or the insurance sector.

In relation to the latter, for example, the Italian competition authority was recently confronted with a number of cases.

In October 2021, the Associazione Nazionale fra le Imprese Assicuratrici (ANIA) managed to avoid a fine by offering commitments on its anti-fraud project for the life and non-life sectors, which include the creation of databases and common algorithms to determine fraud risk indicators.

The commitments by ANIA include limiting the possible uses of the databases, providing safeguards to guarantee their correct use, and allowing the widest possible adherence to the project.

As recently as January 2022, insurers in Italy (i.e. Allianz Direct, Zurich Insurance, Compagnia Italiana di Previdenza, 6Sicuro, CercAssicurazioni.it and Daina Finance) offered a series of commitments, seeking to close an investigation over whether they exchanged sensitive information on the condi- tions for the direct sale of car insurance."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Sharing is caring - Data Governance Act meets DG COMP,"However, the DGA might actually have some skeletons in its shiny new closet, in the shape of data intermediaries.

Put in the spotlight, the data intermediaries  which, according to the DGA, should be neutral and independent  are meant to facilitate the aggregation and exchange of substantial amounts of relevant data.

Even more, the data intermediaries are due to offer services that connect the different actors having the potential to contribute to the efficient pooling of data as well as to the facilitation of bi- lateral data sharing.

We dont know about you, but it seems to us that the provisions give out some serious AG Treuhand / Article 101 vibes.

However, the DGA draft is still in its early days and before we jump to cartel facilitation conclusions, we should keep the faith in the Commissions always-vigilant eye.

Going forward (and according to the crystal ball we got for Christmas), the DGA provi- sions are expected to complement the Commissions revised guidance on information sharing, scheduled for 2022, and which is expected to generally provide more clarity on pro-competitive information sharing and will allow companies to seek guidance from the Commission.

January 2022 3 A Million Euro Question

As already mentioned, the DGA is part of the Commissions digital package deal, togeth- er with the Digital Markets Act, which directly targets merger control proceedings.

The DGA draft itself already includes a clin doeil to gatekeepers and the discussions sparked by data mergers, when it states that public sector bodies, when establishing the princi- ples for reuse of data they hold, should avoid the conclusion of agreements which might have as their objective or effect the creation of exclusive rights for the reuse of certain data.

However, going forward, we could not help but wonder whether and to what extent, since the DGA facilitates the sharing of data, that will impact concepts like: theories of harm, efficiency defenses or remedies.

For that, we peered again into our crystal ball and asked a few questions: For example, since the DGA seeks to increase data portability, could that help to reduce or lower barriers to entry in industries where access to data is crucial?

Quite likely, since the whole point of the DGA is to make data more easily available and accessible to the private sector, the direct consequence of which is the lowering of such barriers to entry.

Could the DGA make it easier to implement, and for the EC to accept, data access reme- dies (in Google/Fitbit type of cases)?

The discussion about behavioral remedies in data mergers is all the rage now, particularly in the aftermath of Google/Fitbit, and following in the footsteps of Intel/McAffee and DriveNow/Car2Go (admit it, you read the best comparative assessment in our July 2020 newsletter).

The Commission has been toying with the idea and the switch in its practice and the DGA might just be the push it needs.

Of course, that comes with a host of changes, the most important of which is the delicate question of the monitoring of remedies  the main reason for which the Commission usually shies away from behavioral remedies.

Could the DGA help turn rivalrous into non-rivalrous data?

That is possible, especially since the DGA expressly prohibits the conclusion of exclusive agreements related to the reuse of data, for example.

Will that bring about a change in the competitive environ- ment in certain data-intensive sectors?

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 2),"September 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR La Rentre 2022  Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 2) Now, that the first post-Covid summer has come and gone, its time to put up your surf board, pack the kids lunch boxes and plan for the months ahead.

Admittedly, we cant rival with the masters of bento boxes, but we can give you a short overview of les must of this fall in terms of antitrust, cartels, merger control, foreign subsidies and State aid.

After kicking off our La Rentre 2022 edition with Antitrust and Cartels yesterday, its time to turn to Merger Control:

Merger Control: Illumina and the (unholy) GRAIL  the Saga continues In July 2022, we reported on the General Courts Illumina/GRAIL judgment, backing the Commissions new approach to Art.

22 EUMR referrals and bringing the so-called killer acquisitions within the scope of its merger review.

But that confirmation (pending ECJ appeal) was only the beginning of more bad news.

Quickly after, the Commission served the parties a statement of objections on the grounds that they breached the EUMR by prematurely implementing the acquisition during the ongoing Phase II investigation.

And the Phase II investigation delivered another blow: The acquisition was prohibited, since, according to the Commission, the transaction would stifle innovation and reduce choice in the emerging market for blood-based early cancer detection tests.

The Commis- sion found that there is an innovation race and that the parties strong (and expected growing) position would significantly impede effective competition.

The decision is somewhat of an outlier: Typically, companies are able to address vertical foreclosure con- cerns by way of remedies, but the package offered by the parties was found insufficient in that regard.

So whats the next chapter in the saga?

An educated guess: More decisions (and appeals) to come.

For one, the Commission is determined to sanction the gun-jumping and might impose fines of up to 10% of both companies annual global turnover.

In addition, the Commission already announced to issue a separate decision ordering the transaction Markus Roehrig, Laura Stoicescu and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

September 2022 2 to be unwound, aiming to restore GRAILs independence for blood-based early cancer detection tests.

In the meantime, another decision to order interim measures can be ex- pected, with a first charge sheet aiming to extend the applicable measures for now being sent out on 20 September.

Illumina already announced that it will defend its position vigorously and will, if need be, challenge such decisions before EU courts.

So this case might well break the record for cases with most decisions and appeals in history.

And procedure-wise, it will be interesting how this cascade of different decisions, starting with the referral requests, would be affected by potential annulment decisions.

That might well lead to a domino ef- fect: If one decision up the chain, e.g. the referral upon appeal by the ECJ or the decision to block the vertical merger, were to be declared void, the subsequent decisions should logically be affected too.

WHATS NEXT?

Some of the Commissions upcoming decisions on gun-jumping, divestiture / unbundling of the deal and potential interim measures might arrive before years end.

And we can expect the appeals to be served up right after.

So buckle up for more  legally exciting  episodes of this long-standing saga.

Merger Control: The TowerCast Case  Art.

102 TFEU as yet another Entry Door to review Killer Acquisitions?

While we are  somewhat  on the topic of non-notifiable mergers: The soon to be ex- pected ruling by the ECJ in the case C-449/21  TowerCast might be another addition to the Commissions killer acquisition toolbox."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 2),"The case follows a preliminary ruling request by the Paris Court of Appeal and a dispute around a rejected complaint by Tow- erCast to the French competition authority Autorit de la Concurrence (AC).

In 2017, TowerCast complained that TDFs acquisition of rival Itas constituted an abuse of TDFs dominant position in the upstream and downstream markets for digital terrestrial TV broadcasting.

In its complaint and the following court proceedings, TowerCast relied on the ECJs 1973 Continental Can ruling, in which the ECJ held that that laws prohibiting abuse of domi- nance could be applied to mergers.

Since TDFs acquisition at stake here was non-notifi- able, TowerCast asked the AC to review the merger under abuse of dominance rules.

But the AC rejected that complaint, arguing that the Continental Can case law does not apply any longer, as it was handed down prior to the EU introducing an independent merger control system of its own.

Therefore, competition authorities are precluded from apply- ing Article 102 TFEU to a merger, which is governed solely by the EUMR and national merger control regimes, even if it falls below any notification thresholds.

What is maybe most interesting is the Commissions involvement in the case, having intervened in support of TowerCasts position that Article 102 TFEU is applicable to mergers falling below any notification thresholds.

The EU watchdog seems intent to use, following a favorable outcome, Article 102 TFEU as another way to review killer acqui- September 2022 3 sitions.

To that end, in the oral hearing, the Commissions representative specifically stated that notification thresholds are imperfect and that  besides Article 22 EUMR the possibility of ex post application of Article 102 constitutes another safety net to catch non-notifiable mergers.

So the ECJs upcoming judgment could provide competition authorities with an addi- tional tool to tackle killer acquisitions, particularly when they see the acquisition as part of an overall anticompetitive strategy to extend an undertakings dominant position.

So if TowerCast prevails, dealmakers might have to add another item to its growing check list when seeking EU approval.

A first hint which direction this immensely rele- vant case might take will be given soon, with AG Kokotts opinion just around the corner.

WHEN?

AG Kokotts opinion will be delivered on 13 October 2022, with the final judgment expected in early to mid-2023.

Merger Control: Revision of Market Definition Notice On 12 July 2021, the Commission published a staff working document that sets out the findings of the evaluation of the current Market Definition Notice (Notice).

The evaluation indicated that the Notice adopted in 1997 is still a relevant instrument in antitrust and merger cases, provides comprehensive and clear guidance on key issues of market definition, but may not sufficiently reflect the developments in best practices in market definition, especially in light of digitalization and globalization.

The evaluation identified potential areas that may be subject to changes, namely (i) the use and purpose of the SSNIP (small significant non-transitory increase in price) test in defining relevant markets; (ii) digital markets (iii) the assessment of geographic markets in conditions of globalization and import competition; (iv) quantitative techniques; (v) the calculation of market shares; and (vi) non-price competition (including innovation).

The Commission called for evidence for the evaluation of the Notice, a consultation which took place between January and February 2022.

While we are waiting for the Commission to decant the result of its consultation, we did get a glimpse of what we might expect.

For instance, commissioner Vestager revealed in September this year that the Wieland1 and the thyssenkrupp2 judgments will feed into the review of the Notice."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 2),"For instance, commissioner Vestager revealed in September this year that the Wieland1 and the thyssenkrupp2 judgments will feed into the review of the Notice.

The reason is that both judgments saw debates about the implementation of the Commis- sions definition of relevant markets, as well as their flexible approach and use of qualita- tive evidence.

September 2022 4 Merger Control: Implementing Regulation and Notice on simplified Procedure And the Commission seems to work non-stop on overhauling the bigger part of its competition law framework.

On 6 May 2022, the Commission published a draft revised Implementing Regulation and a draft Notice on Simplified Procedure for public consul- tation.

The underlying goal is to simplify merger control procedures for straightforward cases: According to the Commissions numbers, approximately 93% of notified transac- tions receive unconditional clearance and do not give rise to any competitive concerns.

Logical conclusion: Easing the administrative burden, both for itself and companies, and focus resources on more complex and relevant cases (go big on big as the Commission often calls it), inter alia by:  Expanding and clarifying cases that qualify for simplified review, e.g. transac- tions involving certain vertical relationships (e.g. individual or combined upstream market share below 30%) and to introduce flexibility clauses for cases that do not fall under such categories (e.g. combined market share of 20  25%; joint ventures with turnover between EUR 100 and 150m in the EEA);  Simplifying the Short Form CO and reducing the amount of information to be provided in simplified cases.

To do so, the Commission proposes a revised Short Form CO with tick-the-box format, which  rather than the usual open text boxes  includes multiple choice options and tables (e.g. on horizontal overlaps) to be filled;  Introducing a so-called super simplified procedure, allowing parties to formally notify a transaction without any pre-notification contacts (i.e. no informal guidance).

This would for instance apply to transactions involving joint ventures without turno- ver/assets in the EEA or without any horizontal overlaps or vertical relationships;  Limiting information requirements in non-simplified cases, i.e. under the usual Form CO.

This includes the possibility to request waivers for certain (sub-) sections of the Form CO, limiting information requirements for markets falling under the aforementioned flexibility clause and new tables to ease collecting information regarding pipeline products.

More good news: Some parts are to be eliminated com-

pletely, e.g. on cooperative agreements and trade associations;  

Switching from the old, analog notification system (4 hard copies and 2 CD cop- ies) to a new electronic system.

The pandemic showed that an electronic notification has little to no effect on the merger registry, meaning that going with the time, the Commission aims to implement a digital system for all documents and notifications.

The public consultation closed on 3 June 2022, but the Commissions proposal already provides us with good news, particularly with a view to transactions without any (sig- nificant) impact on competition in the EEA.

In an environment of increased regulatory approval processes (e.g. with the upcoming Foreign Subsidies Regulation, FDI proceed- ings), simplified procedures such as the proposed ones will come as a welcome develop- ment to dealmakers and can nothing but benefit investments.

The transformation of our society towards sustainability is picking up steam more and more.

German companies have also recognised the challenges presented by this impending and profound transformation, and are taking them head on.

This is the result of a study conducted by Deutsches Aktieninstitut and the law firm of Hengeler Mueller that polled the CFOs and supervisory board chairmen of the biggest players in the German corporate landscape, which we have summarised on the following pages.

A detailed German-language version of the study is available at www.hengeler.com/esg2022.

3 A. Introduction The subject of sustainability, with its environmental, social and governance (ESG) facets, has gained in importance significantly over the last few years.

A multitude of areas of our lives have since been affected as a result of societal expectations and legal regulations.

Even companies have recognised the necessity of planning their strategy and actions around this defining issue.

The reason for this is not just the regulatory pressure from national and European legislatures regarding sustainability.

The public is also increasingly expecting corporate strategy and governance to additionally account for ecological and social aspects.

But what adjustment processes have corporates undertaken specifically so far, and what adjustments are they planning?

How are they assessing the status quo and the progress of their efforts?

What is driving the decision-makers, and how do they feel about the regulatory framework?

On these and other aspects, the study Companies in the Transformation Process  Challenges and Opportunities of Sustainability published jointly by Deutsches Aktieninstitut and the law firm of Hengeler Mueller will provide you with an overview.

A total of 61 supervisory board chairmen, CFOs and/or their staff responded to the survey on which our study is based.

The studys findings provide answers to questions such as how much of the transformation towards sustainable business has already been implemented?, what mechanisms are companies using to monitor and steer this process?

and what governance trends are taking shape?

The published study therefore offers both management and supervisory boards the opportunity to have a look at the status quo of corporate governance in respect of sustainability issues, shows them what instruments can be used to review their own efforts at sustainability, and sensitises them for the upcoming regulatory changes.

B. The studys most important findings 1.

Companies in transformation The first part of the study examines what changes have already taken place overall at companies as a result of ESG development.

The central drivers of that development and the means used by companies to achieve their self-set ESG goals have also been analysed.

A considerable dynamic was palpable when performing that analysis.

The status quo and its background Three-quarters of respondents (76%) reported to have changed the strategic ori entation of their organisation and to have established a sustainability strategy.

Nearly all respondents to the survey (93%) indicated that they have expanded their reporting due to ESG development."
Hengeler Mueller,ESG Study: Companies in the Transformation Process,"Nearly all respondents to the survey (93%) indicated that they have expanded their reporting due to ESG development.

The increased awareness of, and com mitment to, a more sustainable alignment is also expressed by the expansion of risk management systems, as well as by the creation and enhancement of personnel resources and expertise both at the executive level and among em ployees.

Finally, stronger coordination and collaboration among a companys various business divisions is also a reflection of this clear trend: 70% of respond ents confirmed that there is, in general, an intensified internal dialogue taking place within their organisations as a result of sustainability developments.

Table 1: ESG impact on the company (figures in %)*

The causes of this dynamic in the transformational development are found not just in external factors, but also come from internal motives.

That is to say, respondents find that, on the one hand, investors and regulators, but also society in general, are increasingly expecting more sustainable approaches from companies.

This means that the transformation process is being propelled by companies own efforts to improve, or at least maintain, their reputation both within society and among potential employees in particular.

No other factor is ascribed as great an influence by so many companies.

Hengeler Mueller,ESG Study: Companies in the Transformation Process,"Nearly half of respondents (45%) expect cost savings in the medium to long term, based on a more sustainable orientation through the implementation of ESG measures  for instance through a reduction of risks that goes along with such measures or by mitigating the negative impacts on corporate earnings associated with the burdens of climate change.

Measuring and evaluating ESG target achievement Companies are setting concrete ESG goals for themselves and using a wide array of tools to ensure that their sustainability measures do not miss their targets.

Ratings and benchmarking are the tools currently used most by respondents to assess their companies current situation and the progress that has been made.

However, the survey signals that integrating ESG key performance indicators (ESG KPIs) into corporate governance will be one method used more often in the future to monitor the advancement towards ESG goals.

98% of the respondents stated that they are already using this method or are planning its use in order to influence how resources are managed and investments are made accordingly.

Thus, through their integration into corporate governance, ESG KPIs are having a systematic effect on steering practices and conduct.

In addition, companies are also employing organisational elements of corporate governance in order to address the cross-cutting issue of ESG: in over half of the companies surveyed, there is a corporate sustainability board dealing specifically with the subject of ESG.

These boards may be composed of management board members and executives from individual business units and central function departments.

Even the tools available to the supervisory board are being devoted to achieving sustainable business practices.

While six in ten respondents reported that ESG performance metrics are considered in the determination of management board remuneration, this will be the case at nine out of ten companies in the future.

Furthermore, a major leap is imminent in the shape of establishing a special sustainability committee at the level of supervisory boards.

The number of ESG committees will more than triple: 14% of companies are currently utilising this tool already and a further 35% wish to use it in the future, bringing the total to 49%.

However, this anchoring of ESG topics at the supervisory board level remains far behind the number of companies that have already instituted, or are planning to institute, corporate sustainability boards at management board level: 82%, currently 58% with an additional 25% (rounded) planned.

This difference may be due to the fact that supervisory boards delegate reporting duties to the audit committee, but strategic matters to the strategy or investment committee, or deal with them as an entire body.

This may also depend strongly on the individual sector and on the innovation intensity of a company or its industry.

At any rate, there is no apparent objective justification to treat sustainability on all supervisory boards only in one single, very specific way.

Regulatory projects put to the test of actual business practice The second part of the survey focussed on companies upcoming challenges that are mounting in the area of sustainability regulation.

3 projects were central in this regard: 1.

In April 2021, the European Commission published a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) designed to amend and expand the previously applicable corporate social responsibility directive, which was transposed into German law through the CSR Directive Implementation Act.

These changes are to take effect by 1 December 2022.

2.

In addition, companies are currently preparing for the reporting duties under the EU Taxonomy Regulation.

3.

In the summer of 2020, the European Commission announced an initiative on sustainable corporate governance and, following a consultation in February 2022, presented a proposal for a directive now known under the title Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence.

The draft of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive dated 23 February 2022 was not yet on hand at the time the survey was conducted.

Proposed additional reporting duties When asked about the CSRD draft, corporate representatives generally show great openness to the proposed expansion of sustainability reporting duties.

More than 70% view the indirect obligation to establish a sustainability strategy, which must then be reported on, positively.

Even the duties to report information on the companys effects on society and to publish statements on the compatibility of the companys corporate planning with the Paris climate goals are welcomed by more than two-thirds of respondents.

At the same time, however, companies are voicing great uncertainty.

Almost one-third of respondents take a negative view on the proposed reporting duty on the proportion of green turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) according to EU taxonomy.

This is possibly a reflection of the common criticism that the specific requirements of the EU are not tailored to every kind of business activity and, moreover, that they do not cover all of the business activities of all corporate divisions, which is especially problematic in the case of conglomerates.

In addition, transition technologies are not given enough consideration.

Incorporating sustainability reporting into management reports The EU Commission intends to make it mandatory for sustainability reporting to be incorporated into management reports in future.

More than half of respondents view this allocation (rather) positively, meaning that they deem the expenditure caused by it, as well as the necessary timing coordination with financial reporting, justified by the benefits.

One in four companies assesses this differently, however.

Bolstering the sustainability report through a review by the companys statutory auditor or an independent assurance services provider with a limited assurance opinion is viewed positively by a narrow majority.

Assigning the task of assurance to audit committees, along with the monitoring of the companys quality control system regarding sustainability reporting, is also seen as a positive by many.

Extending the scope of the balance sheet oath (Bilanzeid), by which the management board explicitly assumes responsibility towards third parties for the reporting, to include the sustainability report received considerably more negative reviews, as did expanding the scope of regulatory enforcement to include sustainability reporting.

Table 6: Evaluation of the enforcement of reporting obligations (figures in %)

Challenges posed by the draft of the CSRD and the EU Taxonomy Regulation

The surveyed company representatives find the adjustment or abandonment of corporate governance KPIs as an indirect effect of the new reporting obligations to be the greatest challenge.

These KPIs include, for instance, CapEx as prescribed under the EU Taxonomy Regulation.

Companies will be required to report on their CapEx performance.

Companies seeking to continuously improve the green proportion of their investments will have to think about compatibility and conformity with the EU Taxonomy Regulation as measured against the prescribed screening criteria.

This means that companies investment decisions may under certain circumstances have to be aligned systematically with EU taxonomy, which is difficult for the reason alone that the technical screening criteria under the Taxonomy Regulation are to be regularly reviewed, i.e. possibly toughened, every three years.

Not only does the question arise as to how companies are dealing with the conflicting aims of improving the three prescribed KPIs (CapEx, OpEx and turnover) and other performance indicators, but also whether there are targeting conflicts between these very three ESG KPIs themselves and how they can be resolved.

Another big question will certainly be how investors are positioning themselves on any targeting conflicts between the different KPIs.

In addition, nearly half of respondents deemed the compatibility of corporate planning with the Paris climate goals as particularly challenging."
Hengeler Mueller,ESG Study: Companies in the Transformation Process,"In addition, nearly half of respondents deemed the compatibility of corporate planning with the Paris climate goals as particularly challenging.

Although companies want to foster these goals, this will likely require a complex analysis of the interdependencies and considerations relating to the specific objectives.

Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence The European Commission is planning to improve the EU regulatory framework on company law and corporate governance in order to enable companies to focus on long-term sustainable value creation rather than short-term benefits.

Although the Commissions legislative proposal on Sustainable Corporate Governance developed to that end was postponed several times, the draft of the directive was published on 23 February 2022 (no longer under the watchword Sustainable Corporate Governance but under the title Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, CSDDD).

The draft of the CSDDD, parts of which differ from the version submitted by the EU Commission in the consultation, was not yet available at the time of our survey.

Nevertheless, the answers given during our survey remain relevant either because the bill submitted for the EU Commissions consultation period and the current CSDDD draft do not differ, or because the answers also point the way for the CSDDD draft or endorse the view, as revealed by the questions posed during the consultation last year, that corporate managements should be induced to conduct business more sustainably through the imposition of (sanctioned) positive duties (margin no. 21).

The new CSDDD draft also provides for this, albeit in altered form.

In addition, the CSDDD draft also contains due diligence requirements for companies regarding their supply chains (margin no. 22).

Lastly, the latest draft of the CSDDD provides for the greater inclusion of stakeholders in enforcing the new rules: no longer through an advisory committee composed of stakeholders, like the consultation version had proposed and which we had therefore asked about in our survey, but only by requiring their involvement without prescribing its form.

A whistleblower mechanism to address/prevent negative ESG effects is also contained in the CSDDD draft.

A right of the stakeholders to sue corporate bodies directly (margin nos.

23 et seq.) is no longer found in the current draft of the CSDDD.

Companies must provide 12 a whistleblower mechanism for individuals, trade unions and NGOs and must be available to whistleblowers for discussion.

There are provisions for supervision by authorities.

a) Directors duty of care For most companies, subjects such as a sustainability strategy are nothing new because they have already devised one voluntarily.

An EU directive would therefore in many cases only formalise into law what is already being done.

Hence, only six out of ten companies think such a legal obligation makes sense.

One in five companies even views this negatively.

This may be because, as with the KPIs, they fear a formalisation in this respect  that could proceed all the way to standardisation or even a binding obligation to comply with the EUs taxonomy for the purpose of unifying the definition of sustainability.

This possible concern now seems to have materialised in the new draft of the CSDDD.

Companies are to no longer be obliged to have a general sustainability strategy.

Rather, more concretely, large companies are to formulate a plan that ensures that their business model and strategy are compatible with the limiting of global warming to 1.5C in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.

This explicit, substantive duty of care supplements the reporting obligation found in the CSRD draft we asked about in our survey.

If a company is facing or causing climate risks, its plan must contain emission reduction targets.

Both are to be taken into account when determining the management boards variable remuneration."
Hengeler Mueller,ESG Study: Companies in the Transformation Process,"If a company is facing or causing climate risks, its plan must contain emission reduction targets.

Both are to be taken into account when determining the management boards variable remuneration.

Additionally, management boards and supervisory boards are to be required to consider the impacts of their decisions on human rights, climate change and the environment when fulfilling their duty to act in the companys interests, meaning not just as regards strategy, but  as we understand it  quite specifically in their daily decision-making.

b) Due diligence requirements regarding supply chains More than half of the companies surveyed welcomes a European-level regime of due diligence requirements regarding their supply chains because it might foster more legal clarity and a level playing field.

One third of respondents, however, believes it makes little sense to institute such requirements.

The reason for this might be that companies run into practical and legal difficulties in ensuring compliance with due diligence requirements outside of their corporate spheres.

c) Enforcement by stakeholders

The considerations to involve stakeholders by mandating the formation of advisory committees and in the enforcement process are viewed negatively to an overwhelming extent.

Although many companies see a dialogue with their 13 stakeholders as a positive, its formalisation in the shape of legally mandated committees meets with wide disapproval.

The draft of the CSDDD that has since been published does not provide for any formal advisory bodies but it does impose the obligation on company managements to acknowledge relevant input from stakeholders and civil society organisations when setting up and monitoring their due diligence processes.

Only 2% of the respondents to our survey support granting stakeholders a right to sue corporate bodies.

This is certainly due to the fact that the outcome of a court review of any entrepreneurial decision is difficult to predict even under normal circumstances.

The outcome would become even more difficult to predict in this scenario because, in any review of compliance with the business judgement rule, entrepreneurial decisions would in future require examination of the extent to which sustainability aspects were included in the information that served as the basis of those decisions.

Given that sustainability criteria are hardly concretely formulated, such an examination would likely be difficult, if not entirely impossible.

The draft of the CSDDD assigns to corporate bodies the task of setting up and overseeing the implementation of due diligence processes (in supply chains and elsewhere) and integrating due diligence requirements into the corporate strategy.

Failing to perform these duties is to be deemed a failure to comply with the due diligence requirements under national law of the Member States, is to result in penalties  and is to entail regulatory supervision.

This would be the first instance of there being official supervision of the strategic processes and decisions of corporates.

C. Conclusion Companies, management boards and supervisory boards see themselves as participants and drivers of the sustainable transformation of our society.

They have recognised and taken on the challenges of the transformation of the economy towards more sustainable corporate governance.

This goes equally for strategy, organisation, transparency and internal monitoring.

In this context, companies regard ESG as a cross-cutting issue, have modified their strategic orientation, or have developed a sustainability strategy.

The inclusion of ESG KPIs in corporate governance and as an anchor in management board remuneration systems has been accepted.

Respondents are open to expanded transparency and more due diligence requirements.

Hengeler Mueller,ESG Study: Companies in the Transformation Process,"Respondents are open to expanded transparency and more due diligence requirements.

However, there are also obvious criticisms.

Most of all, companies are expressing scepticism towards regulatory measures already being taken  such as EU taxonomy  and about imminent legislative projects  like the European Commissions proposals relating to sustainable corporate governance.

Based on our survey, we can deduce the following recommendations to government policy-makers:  Corporate managements have embraced the transformation process.

In this respect, corporate regulation may have a more counterproductive and restrictive impact.  

The survey has shown that there is a desire for individual solutions when it comes to organising the work of supervisory boards.

There is no recognisable advantage of a statutory regulation in this regard.  

Unclear statutory requirements, inchoate reporting standards, a de facto softening of the business judgment rule and opening up the possibility of direct legal action against corporate bodies could equate to an unrestricted expansion of corporate and D&O liability.

There is also the threat of a de facto introduction of a liability for failure, which must be avoided.

It is precisely at this moment that courageous entrepreneurial decisions are needed  especially during the transformation process.  

With a view to formulating reporting standards and classification criteria, the following should apply:  Involving the private sector in the process is essential.  

The time frame for formulating and coordinating standards and criteria as well as the initial reporting obligation must be reasonable.

To date, this timeframe has always been too short.  

Only clear, reasonable and reliable criteria justify the effort for taxonomy reporting and guarantee a prudent allocation of resources.  

To do justice to the global relevance of climate protection, there need to be uniform global reporting standards.

In order to realise the ambitious and necessary international sustainability goals, joint efforts on the part of all stakeholders are imperative.

As a society, we will not be able to afford unneeded drag and, as a result, a loss in ESG dynamic.

Politicians and companies should therefore come together and develop pragmatic as well as goal-oriented solutions.

Our study shows that companies are, at any rate, willing to take this step.

Hengeler Mueller,EU competition law and policy outlook for 2023,"The year 2022 brought about many significant developments in EU competition law and policy, including the adoption of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the revision of the Block Exemption Regulation for vertical agreements.

We expect that 2023 will also be an action-packed year.

Below, we highlight some legislative initiatives and enforcement trends to watch out for.

Scrutiny of foreign subsidies on the rise The EU's new Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) is expected to take effect in mid-2023.

It addresses the Commission's concern that subsidies by non-EU member states may distort the EU's internal market, including by providing recipients of foreign subsidies with an unfair advantage to acquire companies or obtain public procurement contracts in the EU.

The FSR will enable the Commission to review a variety of financial contributions following a mandatory notification of certain M&A transactions and public procurement bids, or an ex-officio investigation of transactions that fall below the notification thresholds.

Financial contributions which are found to be distortive of the EU's internal market may result in structural or non-structural remedies, such as the divestment of certain assets or providing access to infrastructure; the Commission can also prohibit the subsidised M&A transaction or the award of a public procurement contract to the subsidised bidder.

For companies benefitting from non-EU member states' financial contributions, the FSR will no doubt – in addition to merger control and Foreign Direct Investment control – create another significant regulatory hurdle for deal-making.

Companies are well-advised to track foreign subsidies they receive carefully and to have appropriate compliance mechanisms in place.

Stretching the jurisdictional thresholds for merger review According to its new approach taken in the Illumina/Grail case and new Guidelines, the Commission can take merger control jurisdiction over a transaction following a referral request by an EU member state under Article 22 EU Merger Control Regulation (EUMR), even if this transaction fails to meet the notification thresholds under the EUMR or the EU member states' national merger control laws.

After the General Court upheld the Commission's new approach in the Illumina/Grail case, it remains to be seen whether the Court of Justice will follow suit.

Building on its previous Article 22 EUMR Guidelines, the Commission has in the meantime published additional FAQs in December 2022, which are intended to provide further guidance under what conditions the Commission considers a transaction to be a suitable Article 22 EUMR candidate and certain procedural issues.

The Commission's shift in applying Article 22 EUMR creates significant hurdles, which need to be taken into account early on in the deal-making process.

Undoubtedly at greatest risk of being called in by the Commission under Article 22 EUMR upon an EU member state's referral request are acquisitions by large players of smaller competitors in the healthcare and digital sectors with low or no turnover, but high growth potential.

Companies potentially having a dominant position in the relevant markets should also watch out for the Towercast case: according to Advocate General Kokott's recently published opinion, already completed acquisitions may still be challenged ex-post under abuse of dominance rules if they have not been reviewed (and cleared) ex-ante under merger control laws because the transaction did not require a merger control notification.

The European Court of Justice's decision is expected in the course of 2023.

Enforcement of the DMA On 1 November 2022, the DMA was signed into law and will become applicable on 2 May 2023.

DMA enforcement will be one of the top priorities for the Commission in 2023."
Hengeler Mueller,EU competition law and policy outlook for 2023,"Enforcement of the DMA On 1 November 2022, the DMA was signed into law and will become applicable on 2 May 2023.

DMA enforcement will be one of the top priorities for the Commission in 2023.

As a first step, the Commission will, until around August/September 2023 designate so-called 'gatekeepers', i.e., large providers of so-called 'core platform services' (e.g., online search engines, app stores, or certain messaging services), which meet certain (rebuttable) quantitative thresholds in terms of turnover, market valuation, and monthly active users.

Six months after the designation decision (i.e., around February/March 2024), gatekeepers must fully comply with Dos and Don'ts laid down in the DMA (e.g., a ban on so-called 'self-preferencing' or obligations on interoperability with third-party services and portability of end user data).

Gatekeepers must also inform the Commission about intended M&A transactions involving targets active in the digital space or enabling the collection of data, even if such a transaction is not notifiable under the EUMR.

The information provided will enable the Commission to reach out and potentially encourage EU member states to request a referral under Article 22 EUMR.

On 5 December 2022, the Commission kicked off a series of workshops to gather insights from stakeholders on the difficulties in implementing the DMA.

In addition, on 9 December 2022, the Commission published a Draft DMA Implementing Regulation for public consultation, which addresses procedural issues.

It will be adopted later in 2023.

More guidance and comfort for coordination in times of crisis Climate change, COVID-19, Russia's invasion of the Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis – policymakers and companies alike are facing tremendous challenges.

Cooperation between (competing) companies – e.g., agreeing on more sustainable production methods or supply chains – makes a huge contribution to overcoming these challenges in a swifter and more efficient manner.

However, legal uncertainties about competition law compliance can sometimes frighten off companies from entering into such crisis cooperation Just as it did in 2022, we expect the Commission to take an active role in the EU-wide debate on how competition policy can increase legal certainty for companies to engage in collaboration.

For example, the Commission's revised Draft Guidelines on Horizontal Agreements (which is expected to be adopted in 2023) will include a dedicated chapter on the legal framework for sustainability agreements.

While this certainly provides helpful guidance to companies' self-assessment, some national regulators and competition authorities (e.g., in the Netherland and Austria) took bolder steps in providing even greater comfort to companies.

In addition, the Commission will continue its 'open door' policy, i.e., providing informal guidance ('guidance letters') to interested companies on the legality of their plans.

The Commission recently updated its Informal Guidance Notice, part of which also included some (some say: not enough) improvements to the informal guidance process and the (evidentiary) value of guidance letters.

Cracking down on anti-competitive collusion and abuse of dominance The Commission will continue to be highly alert to and aggressively enforce anti-competitive collusion and abuse of dominance, and – as Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager put it in a policy speech in October last year – 'not shy away from novel theories of harm' where considered relevant.

One example is the Commission's ongoing investigation into suspected antitrust breaches by Teva in the market for multiple sclerosis medicine.

Here, the Commission is, inter alia, concerned that Teva 'gamed' the patent system by artificially prolonging its market exclusivity, resulting in the delayed market entry of other medicines."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Market Definition Notice is coming to Town – 3rd Advent,"December 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR The Market Definition Notice is coming to Town  3rd Advent The third instalment of our Advent special looks at the new Market Definition Notice, a revamp of the old and tried 1997 provisions.

Perhaps more eagerly awaited than Santa, the draft was put forward by the Commission just in time for the stockings-stuffing time of the year.

In todays issue, we discuss some of the innovations that the draft brings.

The draft Market Definition Notice has been in the making for two years.

When the Commission commenced the work on the new draft, the feelings of antitrust practitioners and policy makers were running high in the wake of the Siemens/Alstom case, with some promoting the idea that the EUs competition laws should play a role in protecting European champions and that the Commission should take more of a global perspective on competition and market definition.

The draft Market Definition Notice indeed offers more guidance on geographic market definition, including the conditions under which markets might be defined globally.

However, unsurprisingly (and rightly so), market definition in the draft continues to be based on economic considerations.

Other areas that the new draft sheds more light on include digital and innovative-intensive markets.

Beginning November 2022, the Commission published the draft update to the Notice, which is now open for feedback until 13 January 2023.

Growth Pains Given its old age, practitioners found it increasingly difficult to obtain specific guidance in the 1997 Market Definition Notice for some of the pressing issues of our time, especially against the background of the development of multi-sided platforms, such as hotel-booking websites, search engines and online marketplaces, where the traditionally primary assessment element for demand substitution, prices, has taken a significant hit.

Instead, zero monetary prices became a crucial factor.

Additionally, time-tested instruments like the SSNIP-test showed their limitations when applied to these markets and also the shortcomings of their strict interpretation and enforcement.

Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

December 2022 2 Being more than a mere face lift, the Commission implemented (limited) changes to those parts of the Notice that have proven to have worked well in the past, re-drafted the parts that needed clarification or updating and it added some parts in particular on specific constellations of market definition including in relation to novel issues, such as the digital sector.

The general principles of market definition remain largely the same, though (for good reasons).

According to the text, the definition is fact-based, it comprises the product and the geographic dimensions and the outcome of the assessment might differ depending on parameters of competition, the undertakings and the time period.

Going forward, the draft also confirms that the Commission may leave the market definition open and it introduces the idea that in certain cases, temporal considerations may also be relevant when defining the relevant product and geographic market (for example, seasonality, peak / off-peak times).

Overall, the new draft Market Definition Notice offers an updated and useful framework for practitioners, including additional guidance and more practical examples.

A Quest for the Relevant Product Market

The new draft reacts to the rise of non-price competition in the digital economy and calls for the analysis of various parameters of competition including a products price, but also non-price elements such as innovation and sustainability."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Market Definition Notice is coming to Town – 3rd Advent,"In particular, the Commission will not rely solely on the SSNIP test but, in the context of zero monetary price products and innovative markets, may apply the standard of the Google Android case, i.e. whether and to what extent customers would switch away from the undertakings product in response to a small but significant non-transitory decrease of quality.

The Draft Notice also clarifies that  while there is no obligation on the Commission to use a quantitative test  the SSNIP test can generally be applied at the prevailing market price and its argument cannot be simply dismissed with reference to the cellophane fallacy without assessing it in its specific context.

Regarding supply-side substitution, the new draft provides guidance also regarding the timeliness of such substitution.

More precisely, the draft states that the condition for the market to be broadened from this point of view is that all suppliers be able to switch production between products in the range of related products (with insignificant additional sunk costs), have the incentive to do so when prices and demand change and can market them effectively in the short term.

The notion of short term is explained as being the period of time allowing the producer to market the product to the customer in a timeframe that is not significantly longer than the timeframe the customer needs for switching to the other product(s) in the candidate market.

This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The new draft also implements the Commissions take-away from the assessment of the market for metallic coated steel of the Tata Steel/ThyssenKrupp case of 2019.1 In this respect, the draft notes that when only some of the suppliers are able to switch their production, it will not include the product range in the same relevant market.

1 Case M.8713, Tata Steel/ThyssenKrupp/JV.

December 2022 3 However, in the competitive assessment, the Commission will take into consideration the constraint exercised by the few suppliers who are able to switch production.

In forward- looking assessments, the possibility that those few suppliers are likely to expand their sales of the relevant products in the future will also be taken into consideration.

When defining the relevant market, the Commission may also carry out a forward- looking assessment to take into account expected structural market transitions which affect the general dynamics of supply and demand  such as impending technological or regulatory changes.

However, the evidentiary standard remains high.

The structural transition needs to take effect with sufficient probability within the time period that is relevant for Commissions competitive assessment, in order for it to influence the market definition.

Go Big or Go

Home  Geographic Market Definition

The relevant geographic market continues to be defined by the area in which the undertakings involved supply or demand relevant products and in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous.

In the wake of the Siemens/Alstom case in 2019,2 some antitrust policy makers, particularly at the Member State level, had been advocating that the Commissions merger enforcement should take into account European companies competitiveness in a globalizing economy and that the relevant geographic market should more often be defined as being global to reflect competition from China and elsewhere (the European champions argument).

While the new draft offers more guidance on geographic market definition, it remains firmly rooted in economic theory (rightly so).

Over time, the Commission has developed other tools to ensure a level playing field for European and non-European companies competing in the EU such as, most notably, its foreign direct investments and foreign subsidies packages.

In the new draft the Commission explicitly recognises that geographic markets can range from a local to a global dimension."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Market Definition Notice is coming to Town – 3rd Advent,"In the new draft the Commission explicitly recognises that geographic markets can range from a local to a global dimension.

The Draft Notice focuses on distance (in terms of travel or delivery) as the main factor to differentiate the market geographically.

The Commission is likely to define global geographic markets when customers around the world have access to the same suppliers on similar terms, regardless of the customers location, due to the lack of trade barriers and costs.

And, as an indirect response to the European champions debate, the new draft underlines the fact that the term market in EU competition law is different from the use of the term market in other contexts, in particular in business contexts.

For instance, undertakings may say that they are active in a global market where they consider that they compete globally for revenues against undertakings from all continents.

However, that does not mean that the products of all globally active undertakings are substitutable for customers in the EEA or that customers face sufficiently homogeneous conditions of competition globally, which is the relevant perspective for the Commissions market definition.

In response to calls to consider the competitive restraints caused by imports, the Commission commits to analyse demand substitution patterns  such as switching to imports.

But to define the relevant geographic market, the key criterion remains the 2 Case M.8677, Siemens/Alstom.

December 2022 4 sufficient homogeneity of the conditions of competition.

The Commission will therefore consider two areas as part of the same geographic market particularly when customers in both areas consider mostly the same suppliers as alternatives and can readily switch volumes between them.

In circumstances characterized by significant imports but absent sufficiently homogeneous conditions of competition, the Commission generally will not extend the relevant geographic market to include areas of origin of imports but take into account the competitive restraint from imports at later stages of the competitive assessment, i.e. in the calculation of market shares and the assessment of a restriction of competition.

The draft Notice offers helpful guidance also in cases where markets are local, particularly where markets are typically being defined based on the notion of catchment areas.

Preferably, these should be drawn around individual customer locations but, given that this will often not be feasible, the Commission will work with catchment areas around individual supplier locations.

Typically, the Commission will consider catchment areas covering 80% of sales or customers as a starting point.

However, relevant catchment areas may also be defined based on a coverage of 70-90% of sales or customers.

The Proof is in the (Christmas) Pudding  Gathering the Relevant Evidence

The new draft Notice provides a consolidated overview of the evidence that the Commission will consider when defining the relevant market, including extra descriptions of case practice and of quantitative techniques and their limitations.

For example, the new draft expands on the gathering and evaluation of the evidence, aspects previously spread across different sections."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Market Definition Notice is coming to Town – 3rd Advent,"For example, the new draft expands on the gathering and evaluation of the evidence, aspects previously spread across different sections.

According to the document, while there is no rigid hierarchy in terms of sources of information and types of evidence used, the following types of evidence will generally be considered for purposes of product market definition:  Product characteristics, prices, intended use and general customer preferences, including the underlying reasons as to why customers would substitute one product for another;  Evidence of past substitution such as, e.g., in case of exogenous events of shocks; where sufficient data is available, this could also include quantitative analyses (e.g., diversion ratios between products, an implementation of the SSNIP test);  Evidence of hypothetical substitution from RFIs, provided responses are sufficiently reliable, complete and accurate; and  Industry views on competitive constraints and evidence on barriers and costs of switching demand and/or supply.

December 2022 5

And in case of geographic market definition:  Identity of available suppliers, market shares and prices in various regions;  Customer preferences and purchasing behaviour;  Barriers and costs associated with supplying customers in different areas;  Transport costs, catchment areas and other distance related factors; and  Trade flows and shipping patterns.

Special Guidelines for Special Circumstances The Draft Notice gives additional guidance for very specific types of markets, reflecting the digitalization of the economy and the Commissions shift in enforcement focus.

This includes market definition in the presence of significant R&D investments, multi-sided platforms and digital ecosystems.

In innovation-intensive markets with frequent and significant investments in research and development, innovation is a key parameter of competition.

The Commission may factor in all potential outcomes of the uncertain R&D processes in a forward-looking assessment for the purpose of market definition.

Especially, pipeline products  which are not yet available to customers, but sufficiently far along the R&D process  and their projected substitutability may play a role in determining the relevant product and geographic market.

The draft makes the difference between pipeline products which are related to a specific existing or new product market and the R&D processes not closely related to any specific product, but related to earlier stages of research, which may serve multiple purposes (or not), with a longer-term perspective.

In order to identify the boundaries of the latter types of markets, the draft suggests considering factors such as the nature and scope of the innovation efforts, the objectives of the different lines of research, the specialisation of the different teams involved or the results of the undertakings past innovation efforts.

In the presence of multi-sided platforms, the Commission may define a relevant product market for the platform as a whole, encompassing all (or multiple) user groups or it may define separate relevant product markets for the products offered on each side of the platform, allowing for either a holistic or a more isolated competitive assessment.

Depending on the facts of the case, it may be more appropriate to define separate markets where there are significant differences in the substitution possibilities on the different sides of the platform.

The new draft also flags the presence of indirect network effects and provides examples of indicative elements to assess substitution possibilities on the different sides of the platform, such as product differentiation, homing decisions, etc.

The new draft also looks into the so-called after-markets  where, in certain circumstances, the consumption of a durable product (primary product) leads to the consumption of another connected product (secondary product)."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Market Definition Notice is coming to Town – 3rd Advent,"According to the new draft, as far as after-markets are concerned, there is the possibility of defining either (i) a system market comprising both the primary and the secondary product, December 2022 6 (ii) multiple markets, namely a market for the primary product and separate markets for the secondary products associated with each brand of the primary product, or (iii) even dual markets, namely the market for the primary product on the one hand and the market for the secondary product on the other hand.

The draft provides guidance on the scenarios where each of the three market configurations are most likely.

For example, the definition of a system market may be more appropriate the more likely it is that customers take the whole-life costs into account when purchasing the primary product.

Concerning bundles, the draft hints at the possibility of considering them as a separate relevant product market.

The draft looks at after-markets and bundles, by considering a primary core product and a secondary (digital) product whose consumption is connected to the primary product by tech links or interoperability.

Regarding digital ecosystems, the new draft states that in certain circumstances they can be thought of as consisting of a primary core product and several secondary (digital) products whose consumption is connected to the core product, for instance, by technological links or interoperability.

When considering digital ecosystems, the Commission may thus apply similar principles to the ones applied to after markets to define the relevant product market(s).

Hengeler Mueller,German Federal Court of Justice declares intra-EU arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention to be inadmissible,"On 27 July 2023, the German Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) ruled that EU member states may rely on proceedings under § 1032 (2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) to determine the admissibility of intra-EU ICSID arbitration proceedings initiated under Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) (FCJ, case No.

I ZB 43/22, I ZB 74/22

and I ZB 75/22).

Diverging decisions of the lower courts The FCJ decided on appeals in three parallel cases in which the two lower courts had reached opposite conclusions.

The three cases concerned arbitration proceedings initiated by companies based in member states of the European Union (EU) against other member states.

The member states had changed their legislation on renewable energies (case No.

I ZB 43/22) or had decided on a future ban of coal-fired power plants respectively (case No.

I ZB 74/22

and I ZB 75/22).

The companies claimed that the new legislation led to an unlawful expropriation of their investments and initiated ICSID arbitration proceedings in accordance with article 26 ECT.

Relying on the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the Achmea (case no. C-284/16) and Komstroy (case no. C-741/19) cases, the member states argued that the ICSID arbitration was inadmissible due to the lack of a valid arbitration agreement.

The member states initiated proceedings under § 1032 (2) ZPO at the Berlin Appellate Court and the Cologne Higher Regional Court.

The special mechanism of § 1032 (2) ZPO allows a party to a pending arbitration until the arbitral tribunal has been constituted to apply for a declaration that the arbitration proceedings are inadmissible.

The Berlin Appellate Court dismissed the application as inadmissible (case no. 12 SchH 6/21).

It held that according to article 41 (1) ICSID Convention, only the arbitral tribunal is competent to decide on its own jurisdiction and the validity of the arbitration agreement.

Article 41 (1) ICSID Convention therefore excluded any review of the admissibility of the arbitration proceedings by national courts.

The Cologne Higher Regional Court reached the opposite conclusion (case no. 19 SchH 14/21 and 15/21).

It found the respective applications under § 1032 (2) ZPO to be admissible and declared the arbitration proceedings to be incompatible with EU law.

As an exception, the FCJ finds applications under § 1032 (2) ZPO regarding ICSID arbitrations to be admissible in intra-EU disputes The FCJ sided with the Cologne Higher Regional Court.

It ruled that intra-EU arbitrations under the ICSID Convention can be declared inadmissible by national courts in proceedings under § 1032 (2) ZPO.

Although the ICSID Convention generally provides for an exclusive competence of the arbitral tribunal to decide upon its own competence to hear a case, in intra-EU disputes the primacy of EU law forces to deviate from this principle.

As a result, ICSID awards in the intra-EU context must be reviewable by state courts.

According to the ruling of the FCJ, this review must also be possible at the beginning of the proceedings under § 1032 (2) ZPO.

The FCJ also held that intra-EU ICSID arbitrations based on article 26 ECT are inadmissible.

It relied on the case law of the ECJ to conclude that the underlying arbitration clauses violate articles 267, 344 TFEU and are, therefore, invalid.

Primacy of EU law forces FCJ to recognize an exception from the self-contained regime of the ICSID Convention In the decisions, the FCJ applied the Achmea case law of the ECJ to find ICSID arbitrations between member states and EU investors are incompatible with EU law.

It allowed member states to block arbitrations proceedings at an early stage of the proceedings based on the procedure under § 1032 (2) ZPO.

In the Komstroy case, the ECJ had clarified that intra-EU arbitrations based on the ECT were inadmissible."
Hengeler Mueller,German Federal Court of Justice declares intra-EU arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention to be inadmissible,"In the Komstroy case, the ECJ had clarified that intra-EU arbitrations based on the ECT were inadmissible.

Other decisions of the ECJ ( European Food (C-638/19 P) and Romatsa (C-333/19)) indicated that this also applied to arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention.

The majority of arbitral tribunals, however, assumed that arbitration agreements between EU member states and investors from other member states were valid due to the self-contained regime of the ICSID Convention.

The FCJ had no doubts that the Achmea case law renders also ICSID proceedings inadmissible and refrained from referring the case to the ECJ.

According to the FCJ, EU law prevails over a member state's obligations under the ICSID Convention.

From the perspective of EU law, this is consistent.

With its decision, the FCJ follows the case law of ECJ putting an end to investor-state arbitration proceedings based on international investment protection agreements between EU member states.

The conclusions drawn for German procedural law are consistent.

If arbitration proceedings are not compatible with EU law, member states must be able to challenge awards before German courts.

It is efficient to allow such review at the beginning of the arbitration proceedings under § 1032 (2) ZPO.

However, the ruling is a setback for the dispute resolution system of the ICSID Convention.

The system is exclusively rooted in public international law and the strictly limited review by state courts is one of its cornerstones.

Being aware of the implications for the ICSID system, the BGH emphasizes that its ruling applies exclusively to intra-EU disputes."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Sempre Con Te – The European Court of Justice’s Judgment in Servizio Elettrico Nationale,"June 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Sempre Con Te  Always With You The European Court of Justices Judgment in Servizio Elettrico Nationale  Merit- based Competition and Non-price Exclusionary Abuses under Article 102 TFEU Intel, Google Shopping, Qualcomm  Judgments on Article 102 TFEU have recently been raining down on us.

Unfortunately, there is yet another instalment to be added to that list.

But do not fear, for we are always with you.

The same slogan was put forward by Ital- ian ENEL Group in 2017.

However, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) did not join into this collaborative spirit and imposed a fine on ENEL for abusing its dominant market position.

After some procedural back and forth before national courts, the Euro- pean Court of Justice now had the opportunity to shed light on a far-reaching question in Case C-377/20.1 What constitutes abusive conduct and in that context, what can be considered competition on the merits?

How is merit-based competition related to the as efficient competitor test and how does all of that apply to non-price exclusionary abuses?

Pairing these questions with the formerly regulated Italian power market and  at least for EU law aficionados  a known name from an old landmark decision (Costa v ENEL rings a bell?), and you have got yourself a recipe for a potential new landmark decision.

Protectionism vs. Liberalization Admittedly, the dispute at hand has a rather specific background, revolving around the gradual liberalization of the formerly monopolized Italian electricity market.

Under the specific details of the market liberalization, a last cluster of protected customers  bene fitting from preferential prices  were allowed to access the free market in recent years.

To compete for those customers on the liberated market, the former monopolist ENEL Group and incumbent operator for such protected customers via its subsidiary Servizio Elettrico SpA (SEN), set up a private energy company called Enel Energia (EE).

1 European Court of Justice, Judgment handed down on 12 May 2022, Case C-377/20  

Servizio Elettrico Nationale SpA et al. / Autorit Garante Concorrenza e del Mercato et al.

Markus Roehrig and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

June 2022 2 To retain and transfer its former customer base to EE, in March 2017, ENEL launched the Sempre Con Te (Always with you) program aiming to make special commercial offers to its existing clients.

To that end, SEN reached out to its customers seeking consent to share their data with private energy companies (including EE) so the later could submit such offers to SENs customers.

However, SEN used two physically separated consent forms.

The first form sought consent to the customers data transfer from SEN to EE, whereas the second one asked for consent to transfer the customers data to privately operated competitors of EE.

Given that most customers were familiar with their current provider SEN, they largely tended to give consent to SEN and EE only.

As a result, SEN created a comprehensive list of consenting customers and only provided this list to its subsidiary EE and not to other competitors.

The other competitors only received the (much shorter) list of costumers having consented for the transfer to other companies.

According to the AGCM, SEN, EE and ENEL (as ultimate parent and coordinator of such practice) had designed the process for obtaining customer consent in a manner that exploited their position as former monopolist to the detriment of privately operated competitors, giving rise to an abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU.

After sub- sequent appeal procedures before Italian Courts, the Consiglio di Stato decided to stay proceedings and to refer several questions relating to the interpretation and application of Article 102 TFEU to the ECJ."

To start with, the ECJ recalls the main and ultimate objective allocated to Article 102 TFEU, which in the past was not always a question easy to answer, in particular under the more-economic approach from the Commis- sion.

However, the ECJ did not leave home soil: primary objective of Article 102 TFEU  and competition law in general  is the well-being and protection of consumers.  

Capacity to restrict competition, efficiency defence.

Following that reminder, the ECJ held that a competition authority just needs to prove that the practice of a dom- inant company, by using resources departing from those of normal competition (more later on what normal merit-based competition means), could adversely affect the ef- fective competition structure on the respective market.

Unlike AG Rantos in his opin- ion from December 20212, the ECJ does not think that is incumbent on competition authorities to demonstrate that an exclusionary practice causes actual or potential harm to consumers.

So again, nothing new under then sun and the burden of proof remains the same.

Nevertheless, the ECJ, having recourse to AG Rantos opinion and the Intel judgment, re-affirmed that dominant companies may escape Article 102 TFEU by establishing pro-consumer benefits beyond prices (e.g. in terms of choice, quality and innovation).

2 Advocate General Rantos, Opinion of 9 December 2021, Case C-377/20  

Servizio Elettrico Nationale SpA et al. / Autorit Garante Concorrenza e del Mercato et al.

June 2022 3  Lack of actual exclusionary effects.

Furthermore, the Consiglio di Stato sought guidance from the ECJ whether and to what extent the Commission was required to consider concrete evidence put forward by the undertakings involved and proving a lack of anti-competitive effects.

According to the ECJ, such evidence, showing that the desired result of an exclusionary practice (here: transfer of SENs customer base to EE) has not been  fully  achieved, is in itself not sufficient to escape Article 102 TFEU.

The ECJ points out that an analysis of Article 102 TFEU is in principle pro- spective in nature and the authorities thus do not need to establish whether such prac- tice actually restricted competition, but that it is capable of doing so.

In other words: Abusive conduct  even if only intended and proven unsuccessful  remains abusive.

On the other hand, the Commission cannot simply disregard any evidence countering alleged anti-competitive effects, but has to take this and other supporting evidence into careful consideration.

That follows the line taken by the Union Courts in the Intel judgments, and referred by the ECJ.

If such supporting evidence showing that the alleged conduct was incapable of restricting competition is produced, the competition authority bears the burden of showing that in in fact the practice in question was capable to have exclusionary effects.

The fact that particular conduct did not actually have an exclusionary effect, while in and of itself not defence, can be taken as a indicia that the conduct was not capable of having such an effect.  

Intent to exclude competitors.

Additionally, the ECJ addressed the doubts expressed by the Consiglio di Stato whether it should include the intention of the undertakings involved into consideration when assessing an abuse in accordance with Article 102 TFEU.

The requirement to show exclusionary effect of a measure is  without demon- strating any sort of intent towards that effect  by itself enough to qualify as an abuse of a dominant position."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Sempre Con Te – The European Court of Justice’s Judgment in Servizio Elettrico Nationale,"The requirement to show exclusionary effect of a measure is  without demon- strating any sort of intent towards that effect  by itself enough to qualify as an abuse of a dominant position.

However, the ECJ specifies that evidence of such intention is nevertheless a factor that may be taken into account for the purposes of establishing such abuse.  

Conduct that is permissible outside of the competition law realm.

Finally, the ECJ reaffirmed that the unlawfulness of abusive conduct within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU is unrelated to the classification of this conduct in other areas of law.

Therefore, perfectly legal practices in other areas of law can be (and often are) abusive practices.

The Competition on the Merits Element in Abuse Cases While Servizio Elettrico Nationale in many ways relies on well-established Article 102 TFEU doctrine, the judgment addresses another issues that goes back to first principles, namely whether an allegedly exclusionary practice can amount to an abuse of dominance on the basis of its capacity to bring about anticompetitive effects alone or, as a cumulative element, the Commission must also establish that the conduct as such departs from nor- mal competition on the merits.

The latter, the ECJ unambiguously holds.

The notion of competition on the merits taking center stage is quite remarkable, also given the concept had remained somewhat blurry in the Union courts case law.

So did the ECJ give a conclusive definition of what such normal competition is?

As AG Rantos put it that is not an easy task, since competition on the merits is abstract, since it does not correspond to a specific form of practices and cannot be defined in such a way as June 2022 4 to make it possible to determine in advance whether or not particular conduct comes within the scope of such competition.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ECJ chose to focus on defining what is not normal merit-based competition, setting out two categories or tests:  Anticompetitive object.

The dominant firms conduct has an anticompetitive object, that is to say the dominant firm has no plausible economic purpose to purse the con- duct other than to eliminate competitors and, once it has obtained monopoly power, to raise prices to customers.

The most prominent example of such conduct would be predatory pricing, e.g. a pricing below average variable costs.

Other examples might be loyalty rebates or margin squeezing, all of which are based on hard facts and can be more easily proven by competition authorities (but  as Intel has shown  the devil lies in the details).  

Conduct cannot be replicated.

A hypothetical equally efficient, but not dominant, competitor is not capable of replicating the dominant firms conduct because that conduct is enabled by the specific resources and means that come with a dominant position.

As the Unions courts have established in previous cases, with respect to price-related conduct, the lack of competitors capability to replicate the dominant firms conduct can in principle be established based on the as-efficient-competitor (AEC) test, i.e. by examining whether the same conduct could be implemented by a (hypothetically) similarly strong competitor, i.e. whether that would be economically viable for such competitor.

If not, it is assumed that competitors of the dominant undertaking suffer exclusionary effects from such pricing practices, as they cannot  in an economically meaningful way  proceed the same and match the dominant firms offers.

On the other hand, if an as efficient competitor could proceed the same, a dominant companies acts within the ambit of normal competition (on the merits).

Servizio Elettrico Nationale adds that the AEC test equally applied to non-price-relat- ed conduct such as, e.g., a refusal to supply."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Sempre Con Te – The European Court of Justice’s Judgment in Servizio Elettrico Nationale,"Servizio Elettrico Nationale adds that the AEC test equally applied to non-price-relat- ed conduct such as, e.g., a refusal to supply.

This, then, is the key takeaway from Servizio Elettrico Nationale: Under Article 102 TFEU, a practice constitutes an abuse of dominance only if, in addition to having the ca- pacity to exclude competition, it departs from the competition on the merits, either by (i) having anticompetitive effects or (ii) if it cannot be replicated by an as efficient compet- itor, regardless whether the practice is price-related or pertains to non-pricing conduct.

However, some may take the view that Servizio Elettrico Nationale should be read more narrowly.

As set out above, the case revolves around the liberalization of a formerly pro- tected market and in its reasoning, the ECJ has had specific recourse to ENELs unique position as incumbent operator.

Contrary to other non-regulated markets, the dominant position of ENEL was not achieved through normal means of competition but by default.

No other competitor could enter the market and compete  or replicate  ENELs practic- es.

So one might argue that the ECJs findings are limited to the peculiar set of facts that were before it in this specific case.

Nonetheless, there is no explicit language in Servizio Elettrico Nationale suggesting by any means that the analytical framework that the ECJ sets out for the application of Article 102 TFEU, the AEC test and the unruly track field of normal merit-based competition should be limited to regulated markets and (former) monopolies.

June 2022 5

The Future of Article 102 TFEU, Unresolved Issues It remains to be seen what the Commission will have to say about the application of the principle of competition on the merits and the transposition of the AEC test to non-pric- ing practices.

It can be reasonably assumed that they would not be happy with having to undertake  in a burdensome manner, see again Intel  a full-fledged AEC analysis.

In any case, the judgment could prove helpful particularly with respect to non-pricing practices, allowing dominant companies to rely on the AEC test to ascertain whether envisaged practices do not fall under Article 102 TFEU.

The case at hand might not be the ideal example, as there are few remaining regulated markets about to be liberalized, but there might be other sectors and specific non-pricing practices where the judgment might come in handy (e.g. in a Big Tech context, one might think of data harvesting and collection).

Finally, some further food for thought Servizio Elettrico Nationale only deals with exclusionary practices, but how about exploitation cases?

Can these categories or tests to determine abuse also be transposed to exploitative abuse practices (e.g., sudden and excessive price increases or imposing unfair trading conditions)?

Hengeler Mueller,Innovative risk protection through captive insurance,"Whether it be increasingly difficult-to-insure risks like cyber incidents, business interruptions, supply chain disruptions or natural events, tougher access to insurance protection for certain industries, considerable premium increases, more rigorous risk exclusions or sharply rising retentions – companies in various sectors are facing growing challenges when it comes to protecting themselves against risks with the conventional coverage provided by traditional insurers.

Against that background, 'captive insurance' has been attracting more and more attention: captive insurers make 'alternative risk transfer' possible, in combination with greater independence from the conventional primary insurance market.

There are estimated to be between 6,000 and 7,000 captive insurers worldwide – with the number trending upwards over the past few years.

A study recently published by PricewaterhouseCoopers' German branch found that roughly one-third of the companies surveyed had an interest in establishing a captive insurance vehicle in the next two to three years.

What is captive insurance?

Captive insurers are insurance undertakings set up and wholly owned by one or more entities with the sole purpose of assuming the risks arising to the parent(s) and other group entities from their business operations.

Captives offer full-value insurance coverage and can supplement, or even replace, third-party insurance solutions according to the insured's needs.

From a regulatory perspective, a captive insurer requires a (re‑)insurance licence and is subject to continuous compliance with the regulatory requirements imposed by the European legal framework under 'Solvency II'.

These requirements pertain to the captive insurer's own funds (the minimum capital requirement and the solvency capital requirement, known as Pillar I), its risk management system (Pillar II) and supervisory reporting obligations (Pillar III).

There is a variety of design options available for developing needs-specific solutions for companies of different sizes, sectors and regional orientations.

These options range from models for both primary insurance and reinsurance, to onshore and offshore schemes, all the way to mechanisms for financing only the owner's or parent group's own internal risks (called 'pure captives') or for diversifying a risk portfolio by accepting risks in addition to those placed by the parent(s) and any affiliates (referred to as 'diversified captives').

For medium-sized enterprises in particular, strategies that do not involve establishing their own genuine (re)insurer are also worth considering, like rent-a-captive models and 'protected cell captives', which make it possible for insureds to bear their own risks via contractual arrangements with third‑party insurance companies.

Beyond that, companies can also concertedly fill gaps that the conventional insurance market does not cover adequately by forming a joint captive, otherwise known as a mutual captive or association captive.

For example, a collaboration of international companies recently founded the insurance undertaking Mutual Insurance and Reinsurance for Information Systems (MIRIS) to enable its members to access cyber insurance capacity.

What advantages can captive insurance offer?

Despite the regulatory hurdles, captive insurance can offer a wide array of benefits.

In addition to making up deficits in the risk coverage offered by the conventional insurance market by providing needs‑based solutions tailored to the specific exposure of the insured, a captive insurer can strengthen the insured's independence from third-party insurance undertakings.

Moreover, captive insurance may afford access to the reinsurance market with favourable outcomes in risk pricing.

These features can enable insureds to achieve greater autonomy in their risk protection and risk management, which can also translate into stability in their risk costs."
Hengeler Mueller,Innovative risk protection through captive insurance,"These features can enable insureds to achieve greater autonomy in their risk protection and risk management, which can also translate into stability in their risk costs.

Similarly, captive insurance can be beneficial in relation to insureds' balance sheets.

Unlike setting aside provisions for retentions, with a captive, insureds provide for their risks off their core balance sheets.

This protects the core balance sheet from losses arising in insured events and can yield tax advantages.

And not least of all, captive insurance has the potential to improve cash flow at the group level because paying the premium does not result in any outflow of cash at the group level."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Christmas (Tax) Break – 2nd Advent,"December 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR A Christmas (Tax) Break  2nd Advent After kicking off our four-part December issue last Monday with the most recent develop ments in the field of Cartels and leniency applications, its time to turn towards State aid.

This Monday, to continue our Advent series, well be talking about the ECJs recent and widely- syndicated judgment regarding tax rulings.

We know, this might not be the christmas present you hoped for, but we hope your loved ones will make up for this on 24 December.

In the meantime, we suggest to head over to your local christmas market and digest the news with one or two cups of mulled wine (remember: drink responsibly!).

The 8 November 2022 judgment (Joined Cases C-885/19 P and C-898/19 P  Fiat  Chrysler Finance Europe v Commission) granted the ECJ its first chance to weigh in on the Commissions controversial and much-discussed stance towards so-called tax  rulings.

At the core of this  and several other  disputes stands the question of taxation of multi-national companies and whether transfer pricing practices to reduce tax burdens amount to illegal State aid.

Tax rulings and State aid But first, lets rewind a bit: What are tax rulings and why are they scrutinized under State aid rules?

To begin with, it must be noted that multi-national companies and business groups often pay their taxes across a number of jurisdictions, each of them governed by separate and often diverging tax systems.

In order to optimize their tax structure, multi-national companies often allocate profits to jurisdictions where lower corporate taxes are due, e.g. by way of transfer pricing agreements regarding intra-group trades.

To that end, in various of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are willing to hand out specific letters (the so-called tax rulings) fitted to a companys specific business model and clarifying how the authority will treat intra-group transfer pricing agreements.

Such tax rulings thus provide multi-national companies with comfort on the exact calculation Markus Roehrig and Joachim Hannes Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

December 2022 2 of their profits and the corporate taxes due.

While such tax rulings are common practice and absolutely legal in nature, they may nonetheless violate State aid rules if the underlying methodology (e.g. to determine the transfer prices for intra-group trades) bears no economic justification and  as Commissioner Vestager puts it  merely allows to artificially reduce a companys tax burden.

In such cases, tax rulings grant the benefitting company an unduly edge over their competitors, which pay higher taxes on their respective profits.

So, particularly after the 2014 Luxembourg Leaks when several hundred tax rulings became known to the public, the Commission decided to open several in-depth investigations into tax rulings handed out by Luxembourg as well as other Member States.

The list of subsequent decisions reads like a Whos Who of globally active business groups (e.g. Starbucks, Amazon, Fiat, McDonalds), including the maybe most (in)famous decision dealing with an Irish tax ruling in favor of Apple and concerning unpaid corporate taxes of EUR 14.3bn.

As the issue of tax rulings and the individual cases raise a number of delicate questions (e.g. tax authority of Member States vs. the Commissions review, diverging assessment of the applicable national tax structures and the correct reference system), it is no surprise that most of these decisions were and are challenged before the Union courts.

While Apple succeeded to overturn its decision  on grounds of an insufficient statement of reasons  before the General Court and is awaiting the ECJs appeal judgment, one of the most pressing and consequential questions was answered in the ECJs 8 November judgment regarding a tax ruling in favor of Fiat."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Christmas (Tax) Break – 2nd Advent,"The ECJs 8 November Judgment Some ease of mind before we dive into the details: We are sparing you the ins and outs oftax law, but rather focus on the key takeaways from the ECJs judgment and its implications for ongoing and future State aid cases concerning tax rulings.

The ECJs 8 November judgment revolves around a decision from 2015, in which the Commission found that a tax ruling by Luxembourgs tax authorities setting out the calculation of a Fiat financing subsidiarys taxable profits amounted to unlawful State aid.

In the decision, the Commission examined whether intra-group transfer prices applied to treasury and financing services and accepted in the tax ruling conferred a selective advantage on Fiat.

To determine this, the Commission applied  as it did in other tax rulings cases  the so-called arms length principle (the ALP).

Under the ALP, a selective advantage arises if a tax ruling sets out a transfer price below or above the price that would normally be applied (at arms length) between independent companies in similar transactions, thereby minimizing the taxable profits and resulting in an artificial reduction of a companys tax burden.

According to the Commission, that was the case for the transfer prices applied between Fiats financing subsidiary and other Fiat group companies.

December 2022 3 One of the key questions raised in this and other proceedings however is whether the ALP as applied by the Commission is the correct reference system to determine a selective advantage.

Fiat, supported by Luxembourg and Ireland, argued that the Commission cannot apply an abstract ALP.

Rather, an ALP is only binding to the extent the respective Member States incorporated that principle into domestic law.

In its 8 November judgment, the ECJ endorsed that view and found that the Commissions reasoning, which was upheld by the General Court, was vitiated by an error of law.

The Commission has erred by using an abstract ALP (as for instance laid out in the OECDs Transfer Pricing Guidelines) as a reference framework instead of fully examining how and to which extent Luxembourg has incorporated an ALP of its own into its  national tax system:  

In identifying the correct reference system, the ECJ held that only a national tax system and its interpretation must be taken into account and the Commission cannot transpose an abstract ALP on a given national tax system.

This follows directly from the Member States sovereignty in tax matters, under which they enjoy a broad discretion on how to implement an ALP and treat transfer pricing agreements thereunder.

In other words: If a Member State has incorporated an ALP of some kind into its own legal order, the ALP and its interpretation under national law prevails over an abstract principle as applied by the Commission (e.g. the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines or other non-domestic standards).

Consequently, tax rulings that comply with an ALP as incorporated into applicable national law do not confer a selective advantage.  

According to the ECJ, a tax ruling can therefore only constitute State aid in very exceptional circumstances.

Insofar, leaving the door open slightly, the ECJ states that the Commission might apply a non-domestic, abstract ALP of its own only if the parameters laid down by national law are manifestly inconsistent with the objective of non-discriminatory taxation of all resident companies, whether integrated or not, pursued by the national tax system, by systematically leading to an undervaluation of the transfer prices applicable to integrated companies or to certain of them, such as finance companies, as compared to market prices for comparable transactions carried out by non-integrated companies."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Christmas (Tax) Break – 2nd Advent,"In other words: If a Member State can show that the applicable ALP as incorporated into national law and a differentiated treatment of multi-national companies thereunder is justified in light of the objectives pursued by national law, the Commission cannot apply an ALP of its own (but would have to determine a selective advantage based on the parameters as laid down in national law).

The End of the Commissions Quest against Tax Rulings?

By and large, the judgment and its limitation of the ALPs application delivered a clear blow to the Commissions stance towards tax rulings.

But does this mean that companies benefitting from tax rulings and Member States can now simply lean back or even begin to hand out more tax rulings?

Perhaps not if you listen closely to Commissioner Vestagers December 2022 4 reaction immediately following the judgment: While admitting to a big loss for efforts directed at more tax fairness, a written statement specifically noted that the judgment confirmed that action by Member States in areas that are not subject to harmonization by EU law is not excluded from the scope of the Treaty provisions on the monitoring of State aid and that the EC is committed to continue using all the tools at its disposal to ensure that fair competition is not distorted in the single market through the grant by member states of illegal tax breaks to multinational companies.

And at a 01 December conference, Commissioner Vestager added that the Commissions enforcement should continue within the clarified limits of the courts that has given us.

So the Commission seems determined to continue its quest against tax rulings, albeit it undoubtedly would need to spend a significant amount of time and resources to that end.

This is all the more true now given that the requirements from the ECJs recent judgment add on to the already extensive and evidence intensive work that has to be carried out to determine a selective advantage of tax rulings.

So while this may not be the complete end of the Commissions fight against tax rulings, it will certainly slow it down and force the Commission to pick suitable cases carefully (i.e. cases in which jurisdictions have not  or not sufficiently  transposed the ALP into national law, as noted by the ECJ).

On top of that, it is certainly not too far-fetched to describe the judgment as a game-changer with major implications for parallel pending cases, such as the highly anticipated appeal in the Apple case.

So, the Commissions corporate tax crusade, as Politico called it, promises to keep on delivering no matter what  stay tuned for more!

While we know that not everyone is a fan  be assured we are not either  of taxes, we nonetheless hope that you enjoyed our short excursion into the interplay of tax rulings and State aid.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Gaslighting by Any Other Name…,"November 2023 BRUSSELS  JOUR Gaslighting by Any Other Name As Jon Snow would put it, winter is coming.

And with it, a new Article 102 TFEU General Court judgement in the field of gas (fittingly enough).

In Bulgarian Energy Holding1, the General Court delves into the Bronner criteria and builds upon its assessment in cases such as Servizio Elettrico Nazionale and Lithuanian Railways (for more details on these, check out our June 2022 and August 2022 issues, respectively).

Overview of the Case

The addressee of the Commission decision  Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH)  is a Bulgarian state-owned company; its subsidiary Bulgargaz is the countrys public gas supplier, while its subsidiary Bulgartransgaz was, at the time of the alleged infringement, the operator of the gas transmission network and of the only natural gas storage facility in Bulgaria (the Chiren storage facility).

At the time, Bulgaria mainly relied on gas imports from Russia transported via Ukraine and Romania through three pipelines.

Among them, Romanian Transit Pipeline 1 (Transit Pipeline 1) was the pipeline through which most of Bulgaria was supplied with gas.

Transit Pipeline 1 was not owned by BEH, but by the Romanian system oper- ator Transgaz.

Transgaz had granted Bulgargaz the exclusive right to use the pipeline until the end of 2016, for which Bulgargaz paid a fixed annual fee.

Under the agreements, Bulgargaz was also able to control third-party access to Transit Pipeline 1.

Overgas, another gas supply operator in Bulgaria, sought access from BEH to Transit Pipeline 1, the Bulgarian gas transmission network, and the Chiren gas storage facility.

In 2010, Overgas lodged a complaint with the Commission, claiming that BEH had de- nied its access request.

In 2018, the Commission held that BEH had indeed abused its dominant position, and thus infringed Article 102 TFEU, by refusing third-party access to those three facilities between 2010 and 2015, and imposed a fine of EUR 77 million.

1 General Court, Judgement of 25 October 2023, Case T-136/19, Bulgarian Energy Holding et al. v European Commission et al.

Markus Rhrig, Christoph Sielmann and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

November 2023 2 BEH appealed the Commission decision before the General Court, which, on 25 October 2023, annulled the Commission decision.

The Court held that the Commission was right to apply the Bronner test (i.e., the essential facilities doctrine) in order to determine whether or not BEHs conduct was abusive within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, but that it had failed to factually establish several of its requirements.

To Have or Not to Have: The Revival of Bronner?

The first take-away of Bulgarian Energy Holding is that Bronner is here to stay.. and  possibly  even to apply to a broader set of cases.

First, the Commission used the Bronner criteria in the contested decision in order to assess Bulgargazs conduct on the market for capacity services on Transit Pipeline 1.

The Court followed suit, confirming that the Bronner case-law is the principal framework to assess cases that concern access to, in the Courts words, infrastructures or services that are often described as an essential facility.

This, in itself, is noteworthy since in the recent past, it seemed that the courts had more and more narrowed down the scope of application for Bronner (see, for example, the ECJs Deutsche Telekom and Lithuanian Railways judgements, and the General Courts Google Shopping judgement).

In passing, the Court also explicitly confirmed that the Bronner criteria apply to services, not only to infrastructure.

Second, the Court assessed whether Bronner was applicable even though the Commis- sions decision was not addressed to the owner of Transit Pipeline 1, but to the company that had an exclusive right to use it, namely Bulgargaz."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Gaslighting by Any Other Name…,"In other words, the case raised the question whether a dominant company that is not the owner of the essential facility can be held responsible under Article 102 TFEU to grant access to that facility.

The Court affirmed, holding that legal ownership was not required.

Instead, according to the Court, a dominant company that had an exclusive right comparable to a situation of control over the essential facility could be obligated to grant access.

Third, the extension of Bronner to dominant companies which are not the essential facil- itys legal owner raised another question.

The Bronner criteria are rather narrow, there- fore privileging the dominant company compared to other circumstances involving a potential abuse of market power.

This is because the owner has usually made significant investments to build the essential facility, and the incentives to make such investments should not be undermined by the antitrust laws.

It is in this context that the Court of Justice decided, in Lithuanian Railways, that the Bronner doctrine did not apply where the infrastructure was financed by public funds and where the dominant undertaking was not the owner of the infrastructure.

However, in Bulgarian Energy Holding, the General Court now held that, although Bulgargaz was not the owner of the facility, its exclusive right was comparable to the control exercised by an owner, and although it had not developed the facility, the fixed annual fee it had paid amounted to an investment in the said infrastructure.

Therefore, according to the Court, the Bronner criteria did apply.

This is particularly remarkable since the Court did not analyze, in detail, whether that fixed annual fee was equivalent, or at least came close to, an investment that called for the privilege afforded by Bronner  let alone to the amount that would have been need- ed to establish the facility from scratch.

Bulgarian Energy Holding, therefore, suggests November 2023 3 quite a broad reading of Bronner, unfortunately without setting out the legal test as to when usage fees paid by the non-owner qualify as investments within the essential facili- ty doctrines framework.

How to (Not) Deny Access One of the main reasons for the Commissions case to ultimately fail in front of the Gen- eral Court was evidentiary.

This, first, concerned the requirements for requesting and denying access.

When discussing whether Overgas had in fact made a request for, and BEH had in fact refused, access to Transit Pipeline 1, the General Court set rather high standards, providing some valuable practical guidance.

As regards requesting access, the Court held that any requests that were addressed to Transgaz (the pipelines operator), and not Bulgargaz, could not be attributed to Bul- gargaz, at least if these requests were not forwarded to them.

Furthermore, the Court held that only raising the question of possibly providing part of the unused capacity on the pipeline merely qualified as a preliminary request (read: not an actual request, although the Court ultimately left this question open).

As regards denying access, the Court explored the requirement of the reasonable period of time within which access must be granted after a request: The Court found that the Commission did not prove that Bulgargaz had delayed access to the pipeline, arguing that the parties concluded an ex novo agreement within less than ten weeks in spite of a complex legislative landscape that needed to be observed.

The Court compared this to the periods of negotiation of similar agreements between the parties, which had lasted longer.

The Court also highlighted Bulgargazs constructive attitude towards Overgas, arguing that Bulgargaz had replied to Overgas letters within days, organized several meetings within a short period, and granted Overgas provisional access to the pipeline even before finalizing the agreement.

Yes, But Can You Prove It?"
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Gaslighting by Any Other Name…,"Yes, But Can You Prove It?

The General Court then went on to discuss the Commissions assessment of the conducts (potential) competitive effects.

In particular, the Court built upon Servizio Elettrico Nazionale (and Intel), confirming that the Commission had the burden of proving that the undertakings conduct constituted a refusal of access capable of eliminating all com- petition.

Such exclusionary capability cannot be purely theoretical.

On the contrary, the Commission had to demonstrate that the potential new entrant had the firm determi- nation, the very capacity to enter the markets, and that it had taken sufficient steps to enable it to enter those markets within such a period of time as would impose competi- tive pressure on Bulgargaz.

The Commission, the Court found, failed to do so.

The Court thus confirmed the high evidentiary standard when it comes to the enforce- ment of the Bronner doctrine  an aspect already highlighted by Advocate General Ran- tos in his opinion in Lithuanian Railways  but also the fact that essential procedural requirements are gaining more and more traction in the Courts practice.

November 2023 4 Riding Into the Sunset This latest judgement confirms not only that the Bronner doctrine is here to stay, but also that the Court is still fine-tuning its details, which might offer further interesting reads in the future.

These challenged clauses were based partly on the samples provided by the German Investment Funds Associ- ation (BVI) that had been agreed on with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.

The judgment therefore potentially affects a significant number of fund providers operating in Germany that have used these or similar clauses at least to some extent in their own business.

However, this judgment is also relevant to foreign fund providers who market their products in Germany.

Besides the uncertainty as to what costs a fund may incur going forward if one of its fee clauses is invalid, there are also legal risks surrounding fees charged in the past.

Investor lawsuit against management companys fee deduction The judgment was handed down on the action brought by an investor against the man- agement company of a UCITS investment fund.

The investor demanded the repayment of distribution fees that the management company had deducted from the assets under man- agement inter alia for the payment of retrocession fees.

In its defence, the management company based its arguments on a clause in its Special Fund Rules that permitted it to deduct from the UCITS fund assets [] a daily flat fee of 1.5% p.a. of the value of the UCITS fund assets calculated based on its asset value as determined on an exchange-trading-day basis (see clause 18 of the GFR)

[].

In addition, that all-in-one fee was to cover all re- muneration and refundable expenses owed to the management company, including for the fund management and administration, distribution costs and service fees.

FEE DEDUCTION BGH: REMUNERATION PERIODS AND CALCULATION METHODS UNCLEAR EFFECTS ON FUND PROVIDERS UNCERTAIN CONTACT 2 December 2023

For the purposes of calculating the daily flat fee, according to the cited clause 18 of the GFR, the market values of the assets belonging to the UCITS fund are determined less any loans taken out and other liabilities (net asset value) and divided by the number of outstanding units.

The amount so calculated then served as the fee assessment basis.

While that determination was made on an exchange-trading-day basis, the management com- pany and the depositary were permitted to forego any determination of the value on public holidays that are exchange trading days, as well as on 24 and 31 December of any year.

BGH: remuneration periods and calculation methods unclear The BGH also criticised that the clauses did not make explicitly clear to a well-informed investor at what intervals the management company was to receive the remuneration in question, nor the specifics of how it was to be calculated.

The court therefore found them invalid pursuant to Sec.

307(1) sentences 1 and 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

Furthermore, the clauses did not sufficiently explain how the remuneration was to be cal- culated on days that were not exchange trading days.

According to the judgment, it was unclear whether the per annum calculation was to be based on an average value or a value as of a record date, whether it be a day on which exchanges are open for trading or not.

Moreover, the deduction clause identified the asset value as the relevant amount, but without clearly defining what that term meant."
Hengeler Mueller,Federal Court of Justice rules fund fee clause in general and special fund rules invalid,"Moreover, the deduction clause identified the asset value as the relevant amount, but without clearly defining what that term meant.

The court found that the term was unclear also because clause 18 of the GFR, which is merely referenced using the qualifying abbre- viation vgl.

(see), used the different term net asset value, which gave rise to doubts as to whether the term was to be equated with asset value.

The BGH left the question unanswered whether a reference to an investment prospectus might dispel this uncertainty  the same as it did the questions regarding whether the clauses additionally violate either the rules of conduct obligations under Sec.

26 of the Ger- man Capital Investment Code (KAGB) or the transparency requirements under Sec.

162 KAGB or under what circumstances fund rules become part of an investment agreement if and when funds are merged.

Effects on fund providers uncertain The BGH has set aside the appeals court judgment that dismissed the action and has sent the case back to the appeals court to be retried.

That court must now determine whether the investor has a claim against the management company for the refund of the deducted distribution fees for lack of a valid deduction clause.

The extent to which the management company might have a claim to the fees remains an unanswered question.

In principle, pursuant to Sec.

306(2) BGB, the clauses invalidity now results in statutory provisions applying.

Pursuant to Sec.

93(3) KAGB applied mutatis mutandis in conjunction with Sec.

670 BGB, a management company could demand reimbursement only of necessary ex- penses incurred for its services.

This judgment marks a continuation of the trend among courts and regulators to make more rigorous demands on the transparency of financial investment products expense ratios.

In principle, not even the managers of foreign funds, including Luxembourg UCITS, are immune to the possible consequences.

Only recently, in March 2023, the BGH (case no.

III ZR 108/202) ruled that the principle of monitoring consumer contracts (AGB-Kon- trolle) applied to Luxembourg fund rules on the basis of Art.

6(1) of the Rome I Regulation.

Fund providers should check whether or not the fee clauses they have used or are using pose similar issues.

The judgment is expected to lead to further court cases.

Class actions such as representative actions brought by consumer associations or mass litigation waged by legal tech debt-collection providers are also conceivable.

Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"Steps are underway to streamline and conform national regulatory frameworks in some areas, particularly as EU policy influences national frameworks of EU member states.

The EU has adopted a strategic approach for the development of a low carbon hydrogen economy described in the EU Hydrogen Strategy and supplemented by the EU Energy System and Integration Strategy, each focusing predominantly on green hydrogen.  

The UKs policy is distinct from that of the EU and adopts a technology neutral approach to low carbon hydrogen production.

However, the UK market KEY TAKEAWAYS will inevitably be influenced by decisions in the EU due to the UKs close connection with European energy markets and supply chains, as well as its significant trading relationships with EU member states.  

The emergence of a regional or international hydrogen standard will be needed to support the development of a coherent hydrogen economy.

In the meantime national standards and eligibility requirements for accessing support are emerging, creating a patchwork of different requirements for organisations to comply with.

For first movers, making early investments following these national requirements, there may be a risk if more stringent regional or international standards are introduced without appropriate transition or grandfathering provisions.

All jurisdictions under review have set out their hydrogen production ambitions, but differ in relation to the level of ambition and production method, which is of course influenced by the size and focus of the economy of each country (e.g. the size of its industrial sector) as well as its underlying energy mix.

As national strategies bed-down, distinct import and export markets are beginning to emerge.

All countries have established grant funding schemes to support hydrogen production projects in their jurisdictions, with funding also available at the EU level.

Some jurisdictions such as the Netherlands and the UK have already taken steps to introduce operating support schemes seeking to incentivise low carbon hydrogen production by increasing its competitiveness compared with high carbon fuels.

The development of hydrogen transport networks and storage is generally less well advanced in all jurisdictions.

However this is expected to rise up the policy priorities once production volumes and market demand increase.

End uses All jurisdictions reviewed are prioritising the use of hydrogen in the industrial and transport sectors.

The focus on other sectors varies, with some jurisdictions attributing higher potential to heat and power than others.

Transport and storage Production COUNTRY ANNEX FOREWORD KEY TAKEAWAYS END USES GLOSSARY CONTACTS CONTENTS INTRODUCTION POLICY OVERVIEW EXISTING REGULATION PRODUCTION STANDARDS INFRASTRUCTURE THE POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN:

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 5 Net zero pledges have resulted in a raft of policies and proposals for regulation focused on developing production and demand for low carbon hydrogen.

The attraction of clean hydrogen for EU and UK policy makers is particularly driven by its potential to reduce emission in sectors which cant be readily electrified.

Low carbon hydrogen may also help solve the issue of the variability in renewable power generation.

Production of electrolytic hydrogen, using electricity generated by intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar, means the resulting hydrogen molecules can be stored and subsequently reconverted into electricity or used outside of the electricity sector (such as in transport or industry), although not without losses in conversion.

Finally, as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, ambition for low carbon hydrogen in the EU and in the UK has increased sharply.

Low carbon hydrogen has the potential in due course to reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports, including reliance on Russian gas INTRODUCTION:

imports, and to address security of supply concerns.

The emergence of a global low carbon hydrogen economy Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on earth, but there are no hydrogen deposits to exploit, it has to be produced.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in its Hydrogen Tracking Report (November 2021), todays hydrogen production is reported to be produced mainly from fossil fuels, resulting in close to 900Mt of CO2 emissions per year.

It is, for example, currently used to process oil in refineries and in industry.

However, low carbon hydrogen is seen as a potentially important energy carrier for the energy transition.

Unlike electricity, which is hard to store and transport over distance, hydrogen could be more similar to fossil fuels, enabling a global market in low carbon fuel to develop.

COUNTRY ANNEX FOREWORD KEY TAKEAWAYS END USES GLOSSARY CONTACTS CONTENTS INTRODUCTION POLICY OVERVIEW EXISTING REGULATION PRODUCTION STANDARDS INFRASTRUCTURE THE POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN:

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 6 Forecasts for the potential of hydrogen in the future energy mix vary.

However all agree that there is a role for low carbon hydrogen in the energy transition.

The role that low carbon hydrogen plays varies by country and by region.

In its Global Hydrogen Review 2021, the IEA noted that to deliver its estimates by 2050 requires US$1 200 billion of investment in low carbon hydrogen supply and use through to 2030.

As well as the emergence of national markets, the IEA envisages the development of global trade in hydrogen in its net zero scenario, with large volumes exported from gas and renewables-rich areas in the Middle East, Central and South America, and Australia to demand centres in Asia and Europe.

This scale of low carbon hydrogen production poses significant technical, economic and regulatory challenges including:  developing sufficient electrolyser manufacturing capacity  ensuring the availability of sufficient renewable and low carbon electricity generation capacity and the grid capacity to transport the electricity produced  the deployment of carbon capture and storage capacity  the development of demand for low carbon hydrogen  the development of hydrogen storage and distribution capacity, including dedicated hydrogen pipelines or non- pipeline distribution capacity  promoting the adoption of low carbon hydrogen and addressing the price differential between existing grey hydrogen and low carbon hydrogen production methods.

In its Global Hydrogen Review 2021, the IEA reported that the levelised cost of production of hydrogen from natural gas ranges from US$0.5 to US$1.7/kg, compared US$1 to US$2/kg for blue hydrogen and US$3 to US$8/kg for green hydrogen.

As a result of these challenges, electrification is, in many cases, the preferred decarbonisation option.

However, where this is not possible, policy and regulatory intervention is required to overcome these challenges, and to develop appropriate frameworks and regulation to support low carbon hydrogen across the hydrogen value chain.

WHY THE HYPE ABOUT HYDROGEN?

The colours of hydrogen It has become common practice to colour-code hydrogen.

The colour depends on how its produced, and whether residual emissions are captured.

This colour-coding system is still not universally accepted and is not used in many jurisdictions.

However, for the purposes of this guide, we will use the colours below to refer to the different production methods.

GREY Produced by stripping hydrogen from methane using steam methane reformation (SMR).

Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"GREY Produced by stripping hydrogen from methane using steam methane reformation (SMR).

This is the prevailing, existing hydrogen production method.

BLUE Produced in a similar fashion to black or grey hydrogen but uses CCS to capture up to 95% of emissions (but not a zero emissions process).

BLACK Produced from other fossil fuels such as coal or oil.

PINK Produced from electrolysing water using nuclear power.

GREEN Produced by using renewable electricity to electrolyse water.

It can also be produced by SMR, converting biogas or biomass, with carbon capture and storage (CCS).

TURQUOISE Produced from natural gas, but by bubbling it through a molten metal in a process called pyrolysis with no CO2 gas emissions.

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 8 Hydrogen policy in Europe varies by jurisdiction, presenting a challenge for international investors.

However, despite sometimes fragmented and divergent policy, steps are underway towards harmonisation in some areas, particularly as EU policy influences national frameworks.

Nevertheless, there remain significant differences in the scope and ambition of each countrys hydrogen strategy.

European ambition influences national policy National policies adopted in EU member states need to be considered against the backdrop of the wider EU strategy.

The EU has adopted a strategic approach for the development of a low carbon hydrogen economy described in the EU Hydrogen Strategy and supplemented by the EU Energy System Integration Strategy.

Focused on green hydrogen, the plan envisages the following milestones: POLICY OVERVIEW: EXPANDING THE ROLE OF HYDROGEN IN EUROPE The EU Hydrogen Strategy milestones were further supplemented by the European Commissions REPowerEU Plan published in May 2022, which envisages 10M tonnes of domestic green hydrogen production and 10M tonnes of green hydrogen imports by 2030 (subject to its adoption by the EU institutions).

The UKs policy, although distinct from that of the EU due to its technology neutral approach, will inevitably be influenced by decisions in the EU due to the UKs close connection with European energy markets and supply chains, as well as its significant trading relationships with EU member states.

2030 - onwards: Green hydrogen technologies will be fully implemented in all hard-to- decarbonise sectors.

2025 - 2030: At least 40GW of electrolyser installed capacity and production of up to 10M tonnes of green hydrogen.

Present 2024:

At least 6GW of electrolyser installed capacity and production of up to 1M tonnes of green hydrogen.

Figure 1 highlights the stated hydrogen production ambitions of each country, with the UK and Germany having the highest goals for 2030 of the countries reviewed.

However, the level of ambition cannot be viewed in absolute terms, but must be considered in the context of the economy of each country (e.g. the size of its industrial sector).

Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"None of the countries reviewed had a stated policy goal beyond 2030, although many had published forecasts of the potential of the sector beyond this date.

In order to avoid giving rise to any legitimate expectations, which may increase the risk of administrative review in the event of a change of policy, all countries reviewed have not fixed legally binding targets but rather expressed their 2030 goals as ambitions.

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 10 Countries also differ as to the production method, or colour of hydrogen, they are seeking to promote.

For example, the Netherlands and Italy are focusing on both blue and green hydrogen.

Germany, Portugal and Spain are focused primarily on promoting green hydrogen, whilst France is promoting the deployment of electrolytic hydrogen.

The UK is adopting a technology neutral approach.

The difference in approach can also be partly explained by differences in each countrys available energy resources (e.g. renewable resources, nuclear fleet) and its CCS policy.

Finally, the pace of policy adoption and development of regulation differs according to jurisdiction.

For example, France has adopted a national strategy which is supported by an underlying ordinance to provide the necessary regulatory framework and is underpinned by a funding commitment of around 9 billion by 2030.

Germany has adopted a national strategy but is taking a step-by-step approach, focused initially on establishing an R&D strategy to encourage investment in the sector, whereas the Netherlands and the UK have already taken steps to introduce operating support schemes seeking to incentivise low carbon hydrogen production by increasing its competitiveness compared with the high carbon fuels.

Italy has adopted Preliminary Guidelines on the National Strategy for the Development and Use of Hydrogen but is yet to set a national hydrogen strategy although one is expected soon.

One of the key challenges, however, is the problem of growing hydrogen production capacity and demand simultaneously.

On the one hand, the business case for producing low carbon hydrogen is limited by its comparatively higher production costs which means, without support, it cannot compete with the market prices offered for conventional, high carbon hydrogen or fuels.

On the other, hydrogen users face limited volumes and higher prices for low carbon hydrogen, restricting demand development.

A supportive regulatory environment is essential for project development Support for hydrogen production may take the form of financial or non-financial support.

In addition to financial support (described further below), the importance of the policy and regulatory frameworks cannot be underestimated.

Public funding, ranging from grants and tax exemptions, to operating support is available.

However, the type of support available, the eligibility criteria and conditions of the support vary by jurisdiction.

In addition, depending on the nature of the support, state aid or subsidy control approvals may be required.

A summary of measures is found below, with more detailed information available in the country annex.

This is to be supported by:  a public support system for the production of electrolytic hydrogen that meets the required emissions threshold research activities regarding the mass manufacturing of electrolysers (H2Giga) as well as the offshore production of hydrogen (H2Mare)  of approximately 900 million for non- EU production projects for import into Germany under H2 Global.

At least for an interim phase, these funds will also be available to offset the difference between the prices for foreign production and the domestic sale price, each price being established based on an auction mechanism and  under an exemption for producers of green hydrogen from the obligation to pay the renewable energy levy, a general surcharge to the electricity price.

EU Support will also be available from the EU from different sources and programmes included in the Hydrogen Public Funding Compass (e.g. NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe, Innovation Fund, InvestEU, etc.) to support the development of green and low carbon hydrogen projects across the hydrogen value chain within the EU.

In addition, the proposal for the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive 2003/96/EC (currently in the process of approval) aims to promote the production and consumption of green and other low carbon hydrogen by establishing a minimum tax rate of 0.15/ GJ which will be applicable both to green hydrogen and, for a 10 year transitional period, to other low carbon hydrogen used in motor fuels.

This is a more favourable tax rate than that applicable to conventional fossil fuels which, by way of comparison, are proposed to be subject to the highest minimum rate of 10.75/GJ when used as a motor fuel.

SCALING UP HYDROGEN PRODUCTION What is the Hydrogen IPCEI?

Important Projects of Common European Interest (or IPCEIs) address market failures or other important systematic failures in the EU.

Projects spanning the entire low carbon hydrogen value chain (production, storage, transmission, distribution and industrial applications) may become Hydrogen IPCEIs.

A project must ordinarily involve at least four EU member states and its benefits must extend to a wider part of the EU."
Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"A project must ordinarily involve at least four EU member states and its benefits must extend to a wider part of the EU.

Projects declared as IPCEIs are more likely to receive state aid and may be subject to a simplified notification process as common requirements for the grant of state aid (such as the existence of a market failure) will have already been recognised in relation to these projects.

To date, EU member states have selected national projects and these are currently subject to a matchmaking process to develop a coherent overall package that will then be notified to the European Commission.

Assessment of the first Hydrogen IPCEIs will be completed in summer 2022.

Whilst there are a number of voluntary hydrogen standards (e.g. CertifHy and TV SD), there is growing recognition that an international standard for low carbon hydrogen is required.

However, this will take time to develop and for consensus to form.

In the interim, we are seeing national and regional standards develop.

Whilst policy-makers recognise the value of harmonisation, it is essential that this proliferation of standards does not create a barrier to the development of a global low carbon hydrogen economy.

In this section, we consider proposals for low carbon hydrogen standards both nationally and at the EU level.

Initially national approaches are being developed With many EU member states actively engaged in developing both national and international hydrogen markets  for example, the Netherlands is setting up a HyXchange, and Germany is developing the H2Global initiative  the need for clear standards is widely recognised."
Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"However, whilst EU-wide standards are under development (see further below), most countries are requiring evidence of the low carbon quality of hydrogen in order for hydrogen projects to be eligible for public grants or public funding.

Two main approaches may be discerned (used separately or in combination): 1.

Reference to the carbon emissions intensity of the hydrogen produced; and/or 2.

Reference to the production methods and the source of energy used.

These requirements may be imposed either in a national hydrogen standard or as part of the eligibility criteria within the application process for a public support regime.

For example, the Spanish RTR Plan includes a requirement that the electricity used by a hydrogen producer must be of renewable origin, and that the supply of electricity to the hydrogen producer must be carried out through direct lines or through long-term PPAs with electricity sourced from newly commissioned generation projects.

By contrast, in France a CO2 emissions threshold is proposed rather than the qualification of product as low carbon being based on the source of electricity used.

It should be noted, however, that the threshold is expected to be met by production using grid electricity, as the generation mix in France is dominated by nuclear power.

Similarly, the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard requires that hydrogen production meets an emissions threshold of 20gCO2e/MJ(Lower Heating Value) in order to be considered low carbon.

Where a national standard is proposed, the purpose of the standard, production methods permitted and application differs by jurisdiction.

A summary of approaches used or under development is found below.

The EU will play an important role in the longer term in establishing a regional standard Currently, there are no clear rules in force at the EU level specifying which standards and requirements must be met by hydrogen producers in order for their hydrogen output to qualify as renewable or low-carbon.

However, work is underway to define the qualities of both low carbon and green hydrogen.

The proposal for an EU directive on common rules for the internal markets in renewable and natural gases and in hydrogen (COM/2021/803 final) of 15 December 2021, part of the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package, defines low-carbon hydrogen as hydrogen the energy content of which is derived from non-renewable sources, which meets a greenhouse gas emission reduction threshold of 70%.

This is intended to apply both to hydrogen produced in the EU and to imports.

In relation to green hydrogen, article 27 of RED II currently outlines the requirements for renewable fuels of non-biological origin to count towards the target for a minimum share of renewable energy within the transport sector.

RED II provides that only electricity obtained from direct connection to a renewable generation plant may count as renewable transport fuel unless it can be demonstrated that the grid-derived electricity is from purely renewable sources and is claimed only once and only in one end use sector.

The European Commission is currently consulting on a delegated act to clarify and further develop these rules (see box to the right).

Although under the proposals many of the requirements would not come into force until 2027, some industry players consider these requirements as controversial, highlighting the risk that they may inhibit the development of a green hydrogen market in the EU.

Focus on the draft delegated act relating to article 27 RED II Key points which industry will need to engage on in relation to the European Commission consultation include whether the renewable electricity used by the hydrogen production facility must be generated by a generation facility commissioned no earlier than 36 months before the hydrogen production plant (the additionality principle).

Also, where a hydrogen production facility is using renewable electricity via the grid, whether the requirement for a temporal and geographical correlation between the electricity generated and the hydrogen produced is appropriate.

By contrast, it is notable that the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard does not include any equivalent additionality requirement.

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 21 In July 2021, in the context of the Fit for 55 Package to update the EUs commitments to align with the EUs climate target for 2030, the European Commission proposed amendments to RED II (COM (2021) 557 final).

Although these are still undergoing the approval process, if adopted, the changes would mean the provisions on the calculation of renewable fuels of non- biological origin produced from electricity apply regardless of the sector in which such fuels are consumed.

Adoption is expected by the end of 2022, and the proposals may be seen as paving the way for an EU green hydrogen standard.

Article 19 of RED II also includes provisions regarding the establishment of a guarantee of origin scheme for the purposes of demonstrating to end consumers the share or energy from renewable sources in a suppliers energy mix.

Guarantees of origin with respect to renewable electricity have been established in many countries (including the UK) for a number of years.

As mentioned above, some EU member states, such as France and Spain, are however now extending these rules to cover renewable gases, including green hydrogen."
Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"As mentioned above, some EU member states, such as France and Spain, are however now extending these rules to cover renewable gases, including green hydrogen.

RED II also provides for mutual recognition of guarantees of origin, as between EU member states.

Separately, the Climate Delegated Act (2021/2139 of 4 June 2021) approved by the European Commission in the context of the EU Taxonomy Regulation  intended to provide investors with tools to assess which economic activities should be deemed as sustainable  provides greenhouse gas thresholds in connection with hydrogen production and other hydrogen-related activities.

It is expected that further work will be undertaken to align and streamline the different definitions of low carbon and green hydrogen amongst EU member states.

In the meantime, industry must navigate the patchwork of requirements applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.

For first movers making early investments according to national requirements, there may be a risk if more stringent regional standards are introduced without appropriate transition or grandfathering provisions.

THE POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN: A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 22 Scale up of production and demand for low carbon hydrogen is required prior to the roll out of significant hydrogen infrastructure.

As a result, policy and regulatory progress towards hydrogen storage and transport networks is generally less well developed in all jurisdictions.

However strategic network planning is underway in all jurisdictions.

At the national level, the development of hydrogen transport networks and storage is expected to rise up in the policy priorities at a later stage, once production volumes increase.

However, security of supply concerns have re-focused efforts to consider national infrastructure requirements and to coordinate cross- border hydrogen infrastructure in order to meet revised targets.

A summary of measures to stimulate low carbon hydrogen storage and distribution in key markets is found below.

Please see the country annex for further details.

INFRASTRUCTURE:

THE NEED FOR HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE France Goal?

No The Government is authorized to make an ordinance relating to the regulation of the underground storage of hydrogen and to organise tenders relating to the development of hydrogen storage.

France has adopted a framework for the injection of hydrogen in the existing gas grid, and has made government grants available in the context of the Hydrogen IPCEI.

Germany Goal?

Under consideration Projects identified under the Hydrogen IPCEI include establishing a pure hydrogen grid network of approximately 1,200 km (a so called starter network).

In addition, government funded research is exploring different hydrogen transport options as part of the TransHyDE project including high-pressure vessels, existing gas pipelines, ammonia-bound transport and liquid organic hydrogen carriers.

A new regulatory framework for the development of pure hydrogen grids has been adopted.

Italy Goal?

Under consideration To date, the NRRP provides for a 300 million investment in the railway sector, which includes the development of high capacity storage systems with the possibility of using metal hydrides or liquids, and a 160 million investment to improve knowledge of hydrogen-related technology for the production, storage and distribution.

The Netherlands Goal?

Yes  four caverns for hydrogen storage to be developed before 2030 (the first as early as 2026)

In addition to hydrogen storage, the Government is also reviewing together with the Dutch transmission system operators Gasunie (gas) and TenneT (electricity), whether and under what conditions part of the gas network might be used for the transport and distribution of hydrogen.

Preparations for the national hydrogen backbone have started and a budget of 750 million has been reserved.

However, pilot projects will require a temporary amendment of the Gas Act as currently hydrogen is not defined as a gas regulated by the Act, and so system operators are not entitled to transport hydrogen using the current gas networks.

The Netherlands has the ambition of becoming a hydrogen hub.

A national hydrogen backbone is planned to connect regional backbones with large clusters of industrial consumers, port facilities, storage facilities and grids, both within and also outside the Netherlands.

International co-operation will be intensified.

Portugal Goal?

Yes  for gas grid blending:  2025: 1% - 5%  2030: 10% - 15%  2040: 40% - 50%  2050: 75% - 80% The PT H2 Plan includes a tentative plan for auctions of production rights to inject hydrogen into the existing gas grids.

The new Gas Distribution Grids Regulation provides a regulatory framework for the operation of gas grids using 100% natural gas or 100% renewable-source or low carbon gases (such as biomethane and low carbon hydrogen).

Support is available under the Environmental Fund (which supports projects that contribute to environmental public policies) and the Supporting Innovation Fund (which supports technological development and investments into renewable energy and efficient energy use) may cover storage and distribution costs.

Where storage and distribution costs are necessary for the production of green hydrogen, these costs are covered by the Scheme of Incentives to Support the Production of Green Hydrogen and Other Renewable Gases.

Spain Goal?

No

The Spanish Government is considering development and innovation in relation to hydrogen storage (both liquid and gas), distribution and direct supply to consumers or other users (such as road transport vehicles) through hydrogen re-fuelling stations.

The Spanish Hydrogen Roadmap also aims to review the technical rules applicable to natural gas infrastructure to allow a higher blending of hydrogen within the gas system.

Support will be initially focused on low-scale storage and distribution facilities as green hydrogen production will be primarily located within areas with industry or transport.

Large-scale hydrogen storage requirements are also under review.

New business models for hydrogen transportation and storage will be developed by 2025, to be in place by 2030.

Decisions on blending up to 20 per cent hydrogen into the natural gas grid will be taken by the end of 2023.

The focus on particular sectors is driven largely by each countrys economy.

For example: Germany has a strong focus on road transport as well as the chemicals and steel industries, the Netherlands is developing hydrogen hubs, France and Italy are researching the use of hydrogen in rail transport that has not been electrified, and the UK is considering plans to blend hydrogen into its already extensive gas network.

Each of these sectors present their own challenges in relation to incorporating hydrogen and countries are adopting various levels of ambition (whether that be demonstration projects or a full-scale rollout).

Below, we highlight some of the commonalities and areas of divergence in national approaches to hydrogen use cases in the jurisdictions reviewed.

Further details of measures applicable in each country may be found in the country annex.

Industry Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK are promoting the development of industrial clusters, siting low carbon hydrogen production close to end users.

Both the Netherlands and the UK are also supporting blue hydrogen production, and so these industrial clusters will also be connected to a CO2 transport and storage network.

The number of industrial clusters may increase following the adoption and implementation of the European Commissions REPowerEU Plan, which envisages funding to double the number of so called hydrogen valleys.

Stimulation of demand in industry is particularly supported via the Hydrogen IPCEI.

In France, sites such as an ArcelorMittal steel factory in Dunkerque or a Vicat cement site, will be used to trial the adoption of low carbon hydrogen.

Similarly in Germany, 16 of the German projects under the Hydrogen IPCEI are focused on low carbon steel production and hydrogen transformation in the chemical industry.

The REPowerEU Plan and the EU Hydrogen Strategy envisage innovation funding and the roll-out of carbon contracts for difference to support hydrogen fuel- switching in industrial processes."
Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"The REPowerEU Plan and the EU Hydrogen Strategy envisage innovation funding and the roll-out of carbon contracts for difference to support hydrogen fuel- switching in industrial processes.

The carbon CfD would pay the difference between the CO2 strike price and the actual CO2 price under the EU Emissions Trading System, bridging the cost gap compared to conventional hydrogen production.

Germany and Portugal are currently considering specific industrial sub-sector support and market intervention.

For example, in Germany the introduction of a demand quota for green steel is being discussed.

Transport Due to the target of 14% of renewable transport fuels in consumption by 2030 under RED II, all countries (including the UK due to historic EU membership) are stimulating the adoption of renewable transport fuels, with many having adopted a sub-target for renewable transport fuels of non-biological origin (including electrolytic green hydrogen).

As noted in the section on standards, an EU delegated act is currently subject to consultation to establish the criteria for electricity used in green hydrogen production in order for the hydrogen to be classified as a renewable transport fuel and counted towards these targets by EU member states.

In July 2021, as part of the FiT for 55 Package, the European Commission published a proposal (COM(2021) 557 final) amending article 25 of RED II to provide END USES: HYDROGEN USES ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY COUNTRY ANNEX FOREWORD KEY TAKEAWAYS END USES GLOSSARY CONTACTS CONTENTS INTRODUCTION POLICY OVERVIEW EXISTING REGULATION PRODUCTION STANDARDS INFRASTRUCTURE THE POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN: A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 27 for a greenhouse gas intensity reduction target of at least 13 % by 2030 compared to a baseline.

Fuel suppliers will demonstrate compliance with this obligation by the surrender of tradable credits.

Some jurisdictions propose to exceed the RED II requirements.

For example, Germany and France have set their national targets at the higher level of 25% by 2030 and 28% by 2030 respectively.

As part of the REPowerEU Plan and the EU Hydrogen Strategy, the European Commission is currently consulting on a delegated act to establish a methodology for assessing greenhouse gas emissions savings from renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non- biological origin and savings from recycled carbon fuels.

The use of low carbon hydrogen is envisaged in all jurisdictions in road transport, particularly for heavy goods vehicles, with measures focused on the development of fuel cell technology, vehicles and re-fuelling stations underway.

Support for projects is expected to be available via the Hydrogen IPCEI as well as via certificate trading, which is already in place in the UK and may be established pursuant to RED II proposals (as noted above).

Hydrogen will play a role in other transport sub-sectors, although the extent of that role is overall less clear.

Initiatives are underway in many countries to trial hydrogen in aviation, maritime and rail.

For example, the Netherlands has negotiated an aviation sector commitment to reach 14% blending of sustainable fuels in the sector by 2030 and 100% by 2050 (although this is still in draft form), whilst France and Italy have launched initiatives focused on using low carbon hydrogen in the rail sector, where electrification is not feasible.

Heat in buildings The Netherlands and the UK have the greatest focus on hydrogen in the heating sector of the countries reviewed.

However, the ambition here is longer-term, and the focus in the next decade will be on understanding the viability of hydrogen as a heating fuel through a variety of demonstration projects.

Power

The potential role of low carbon hydrogen in the power sector has been acknowledged within the hydrogen strategies of the Netherlands, Spain and the UK."
Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"Power

The potential role of low carbon hydrogen in the power sector has been acknowledged within the hydrogen strategies of the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.

It has potential to provide valuable system flexibility services either as firm, dispatchable generation or by acting as long-duration storage.

However, the contribution of hydrogen in the power sector is still being explored.

As a result, many jurisdictions will be trialling power- related pilot schemes during the 2020s and exploring the implications of hydrogen blending.

This use case is likely to scale up however in the 2030s.

Agriculture Despite the potential for hydrogen to contribute to low carbon ammonia production and agricultural transport vehicles, agriculture is a sector omitted from many countries strategies.

The use of low carbon hydrogen in agriculture forms part of the Netherlands Hydrogen strategy, and support schemes for pilot projects have been launched for the sector, however no concrete targets are set out in the NWP.

For information regarding fuel switching in transport (including agricultural vehicles), please refer to the transport section above.

At least 40GW of installed capacity in electrolysers and production of up to 10M tonnes of green hydrogen.  

2030  onwards: green hydrogen technologies will be fully implemented in all hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

The EU Hydrogen Strategy is one of the measures approved in connection with the European Green Deal, with the objective of delivering the EU climate targets: The EU Hydrogen Strategy was further supplemented by the European Commissions REPowerEU Plan, which envisages 10M tonnes of domestic green hydrogen production and 10M tonnes of  to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2030 (with regards to 1990 levels) and  to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

In December 2021, the European Commission adopted two legislative proposals (a proposed directive and a proposed regulation) that, when approved, will recast the Third Energy Package on natural gas to, among other objectives, support the development and integration of green hydrogen projects.

In particular, they will provide a regulation for the decarbonisation of the gas and hydrogen markets and establish an internal market for hydrogen on similar terms to those applicable to the natural gas internal market.

In addition, financing support may also be obtained from the EU country funds, which are funding programmes available to each EU country where the relevant hydrogen project may be deployed.

Renewable hydrogen projects may also fall within the scope of Important Projects of Common European Interest, which address market failures or other important systematic failures.

Production of green hydrogen, and storage and distribution projects have both been declared as IPCEIs.

The REPowerEU Plan and the EU Hydrogen Strategy envisage innovation funding and the roll-out of carbon contracts for difference to support hydrogen fuel- switching in industrial processes.

The carbon CfD would pay the difference between the CO2 strike price and the actual CO2 price under the EU Emissions Trading System, bridging the cost gap compared to conventional hydrogen production.

Storage and transport The revision of the TEN-E regulation was proposed by the European Commission on 15 December 2020.

The TEN-E regulation sets guidelines for cross border energy networks.

In relation to hydrogen, the revision includes a new focus on hydrogen networks (new and repurposed) and ensures that these are included in ENTSO-Gs ten-year network development plans.

Provisional agreement was reached by EU institutions in December 2021, paving the way for the regulation to be in place by 2023, providing a framework for greater coordination of hydrogen infrastructure between EU member states.

As part of the REPowerEU Plan, the European Commission announced plans to facilitate the import of up to 10M tonnes of renewable hydrogen, by supporting the development of three major hydrogen import corridors via the Mediterranean, the North Sea area and, as soon as In particular, RED II includes an obligation for transport fuel suppliers to ensure that the quota of renewable energy consumed is at least equal to 14% of the total energy consumed in the transport sector by 2030.

There is also a mandate for member states to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions savings due to the use of renewable liquids and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin in the transport sector are at least of 70% from 1 January 2021 (a revised version of RED II is in the process of being approved and such targets are expected to be updated and increased).

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 38 Hydrogen standard?

France is developing a hydrogen standard to be applied at the point of production to all production methods that meet the required emissions threshold.

Renewable hydrogen is defined as hydrogen:  produced exclusively using renewable energy sources  produced by electrolysis (which most production will be overwhelmingly  if not exclusively  in practice) or using another technology allowing direct recovery (such as pyrogasification or thermolysis of biomass, steam reforming of biogas) and  where the production process does not emit per kilogram of hydrogen produced a quantity of CO2 emissions greater than or equal to a certain threshold (still to be defined pending the adoption of a specific decree).

Strategy states that it would take the form of a contract for difference scheme for the sale of hydrogen.

In the context of the Hydrogen IPCEI, France has selected 15 projects in the industrial sector for support.

A significant number of these projects focus on the mass production of carbon-free hydrogen.

The projects also focus on: the decarbonisation of industrial sites through the use of carbon-free hydrogen, the construction of key equipment gigafactories (such as electrolysers, fuel cells and storage tanks) and R&D. Storage and transport A number of regulations and government initiatives focus on storage and distribution."
Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"The law n2021-1104 dated 22 August 2021 (the Climate and Resilience Law)

establishes the framework for calls for tenders relating to the development of hydrogen storage (Article 85 of the Climate and Resilience Law).

Low-carbon hydrogen is defined as hydrogen where the production process generates emissions less than or equal to the same threshold, but which is not produced solely using renewable energy sources.

Meeting the standard is an eligibility requirement for projects and businesses seeking to benefit from the public support system.

Production The Hydrogen National Strategy aims for 6.5GW of carbon-free hydrogen produced through water electrolysis by 2030.

The Hydrogen Ordinance established a public support system for the production of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen by water electrolysis in the form of financial operating support or a mix of operating support and financial support for investment.

An implementing decree will specify the practical details of this state support, but the Hydrogen National The Climate and Resilience Law authorised the Government to make an ordinance relating to the regulation of the underground storage of hydrogen (Article 81 of the Climate and Resilience Law).

A call for tenders regarding technological building blocks and hydrogen demonstrators will allocate 350 million until 2023 for projects developing or improving the distribution of hydrogen.

In the context of the Hydrogen IPCEI, projects selected by France focus on the construction of gigafactories to produce key equipment for the storage and distribution of hydrogen, such as fuel cells and storage tanks.

The Hydrogen Ordinance provides a framework for the injection of hydrogen into the existing gas grid, and states that if hydrogen is injected within the existing gas grid, gas grid operators must implement the necessary measures to ensure the proper functioning and balancing of the COUNTRY ANNEX:

Sector specific measures The Hydrogen National Strategy identifies several priorities: Electrolysis As previously mentioned, the Hydrogen National Strategy aims for France to reach 6.5GW of carbon-free hydrogen produced through water electrolysis by 2030.

In this context, France wants to develop large capacity projects related to electrolysis technology in order to reach the industrial scale needed to achieve profitability.

As mentioned above, the public support system for the production of hydrogen will only be available for the production of hydrogen through water electrolysis, and several projects selected by France in the context the Hydrogen IPCEI focus on the production of hydrogen through electrolysis and the construction of electrolyser gigafactories.

Industry

The Hydrogen National Strategy also aims to replace carbon-intensive hydrogen by renewable or low-carbon hydrogen in order to decarbonise certain industrial processes and products in high carbon- emitting sectors such as steel, cement and petrochemicals.

France supports several projects designed to decarbonise certain industrial sites through the Hydrogen IPCEI, such as an ArcelorMittal steel factory in Dunkerque or a Vicat cement site.

Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"Mobility The Hydrogen National Strategy made the development of clean mobility through the use of carbon-free hydrogen, in particular for heavy vehicles, one of its priorities.

Hydrogen technologies also have the potential to provide an alternative to storage capacity in addition to electric batteries.

Hydrogen has application in high engine power or long-distance vehicles, especially for captive fleets that travel long distances in light traffic flows, light commercial vehicles, lorries, buses, waste collection vehicles, and in regional or inter-regional trains in non-electrified areas of track.

The French Government believes that investing in this sector is essential because it is a very dynamic market which needs alternative technological solutions that provide greater autonomy than batteries.

It also represents a major economic opportunity with an estimated annual turnover of 100 billion, and supports 225,000 jobs in the automotive manufacturing and equipment supply sectors.

The state mainly supports the sector through the Hydrogen IPCEI by selecting projects relating to fuel cells for mobility, hydrogen vehicles or hydrogen trains.

R&D and skill development The Hydrogen National Plan identified R&D and skills development as one of its three main priorities.

R&D is supported through the Hydrogen IPCEI but also through a strong public framework and, in particular, the priority research programme on hydrogen applications that promotes upstream research and prepares the next generation of hydrogen technologies (batteries, tanks and electrolysers) with} a budget of 65 million.

Skill development is also encouraged in order to support the development of hydrogen uses within French territory through the creation and conversion of jobs, as well as training courses.

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 41 Policy overview Initially, Germany aimed for 5GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030 as outlined in the National Hydrogen Strategy adopted by the Federal Government on 10 June 2020.

Following the general federal elections in September 2021, the political parties forming the new Federal Government agreed to raise the target to 10GW by 2030.

However, none of these targets have legally binding effect.

Germanys hydrogen policy is based on direct funding of research and of specific projects, and shaping supportive market conditions by establishing a regulatory framework for hydrogen.

A major part of the available funding (8 billion) was awarded to 62 IPCEI projects covering the entire hydrogen value chain, from production to transport and use of hydrogen.

All German projects under the Hydrogen IPCEI are still pending approval from the European Commission.

With regards to market conditions, the legislative focus to date has been on reducing production costs of green hydrogen as well as implementing pure hydrogen network regulation.

Recently, legislators have also started to address the conditions for offshore production of hydrogen.

Currently, an advisory group (H2 Compass) is identifying research and development needs, which will culminate in the Federal Governments roadmap for the further development of the German hydrogen market.

Key regulatory reforms Although the regulatory framework is still fragmented, several basic regulations are already in place: licensing of hydrogen production installations (except for offshore electrolysis), standard requirements for hydrogen to qualify as green hydrogen, partial exemption / reduction of electricity taxes for hydrogen production, and voluntary opt-in GERMANY COUNTRY ANNEX:

The overall framework will be revised in accordance with the EUs upcoming Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package.

Further reforms are under discussion; in particular, a more comprehensive reform of taxes and levies on electricity used for electrolysis as well as market-specific instruments.

Currently a CfD scheme to incentivise the carbon to hydrogen transition in industry is currently being prepared at the federal level.

A green steel demand quota has also been discussed, but no specific legislative steps have been taken.

Hydrogen Standard?

Germany is developing a hydrogen standard for hydrogen produced by electrolysis from renewable energy.

To meet the standard, the following requirements must be met:  start of operations prior to 1 January 2030  connection to the grid via own metering point  limited to first 5,000 used hours p.a.

for electrochemical production of hydrogen and  production from electricity sourced from renewable energy must not already be supported under another public support scheme.

This standard entitles the producer to an exemption from the payment of the renewable energy levy on electricity used for electrolysis.

Although the repeal of this levy will take effect as of 1 July 2022, this may provide a precedent for the exemption/reduction of further levies and charges in respect of the electricity price or other benefits.

This standard will eventually have to be aligned with EU requirements, once adopted.

COUNTRY ANNEX:

GERMANY Production Regarding the production of hydrogen, support in Germany is focused on green hydrogen by way of electrolysis.

The German projects under the Hydrogen IPCEI alone aim to contribute more than 2 GW to the overall capacity target of 10GW by 2030.

An additional funding programme, known as Hydrogen Technologies 2030, aims at accelerating research activities regarding the mass manufacturing of electrolysers (H2Giga) as well as the offshore production of hydrogen (H2Mare).

Another project, H2 Global, provides funding of approximately 900 million for non-EU production projects importing hydrogen to Germany (Germany will not be able to meet its future hydrogen demand with domestic production alone).

At least for an interim phase, these funds will also be available to offset the difference between the price of foreign production and the domestic sale price, each price being established based on an auction mechanism.

The regulatory framework for hydrogen production in Germany consists of permit requirements and operational support.

In 2021, the production of green hydrogen was exempted from the obligation to pay the renewable energy levy, which is a general surcharge on the electricity price.

However, a comprehensive reform of the various levies on the electricity price to further reduce production costs for green hydrogen is yet been initiated.

In addition, the Ordinance on Allocation of Other Energy Production Areas in the German Exclusive Economic Zone allows for assigning offshore areas for the practical testing of offshore hydrogen production, for which tender procedures are envisaged to start in 2022.

In addition, the German Government is funding research activities that explore hydrogen transport with a view to import conditions.

The related project, TransHyDE, focuses on hydrogen transport in high-pressure vessels, in existing gas pipelines, bound in ammonia, and by means of liquid organic hydrogen carriers.

Apart from the support schemes, the legislature revised the German Energy Industry Act to provide grid operators with a basic regulatory framework incentivising the development of pure hydrogen grids, which can also include the conversion of former gas pipelines.

The legislature chose not to merely extend the existing regulation of natural gas, but to introduce a separate regulation for hydrogen as a third energy category.

The regulation is based on a voluntary opt-in and covers certain unbundling rules, network access and network fee regulation, including high returns on equity rates of 9% for new assets and 7.73% for old assets under a new Hydrogen Network Fee Ordinance.

Sector specific measures Within the industry sector, 16 of the German projects under the Hydrogen IPCEI focus on low carbon steel production or hydrogen transformation in the chemical industry.

In addition, the funding programme Decarbonisation of the Industry, which started in January 2021, incentivises the transition to green hydrogen.

Another funding programme for climate protection contracts incentivises low greenhouse gas processes based on the concept of CfDs and is planned to start in 2022, with 3 billion available until 2024.

This will have a particular focus on the steel industry.

In addition, the introduction of a demand quota for green steel is also being discussed.

COUNTRY ANNEX:

GERMANY Interestingly, the German Government has been funding research activities for fuel cell technology since as early as 2006.

In addition to multiple smaller initiatives, 12 projects under the Hydrogen IPCEI focus on developing fuel cell technology, hydrogen vehicles and hydrogen refuelling stations.

The funding focuses on areas where electrification is not a viable option (such as for buses, trains, air, sea and heavy transport).

Besides direct funding, further market incentives can be expected as a result of the EU greenhouse gas reduction ratio for renewable transport fuels.

Germany is set at 25% by 2030, thereby exceeding the requirements of RED II.

In contrast to the chemical industry, the steel industry and certain areas of the transport sector, the German Government only sees limited potential for the use of hydrogen in the heating market.

This is because hydrogen is in an exclusive position to contribute to national environmental objectives  especially if produced from renewable energy sources through electrolysis.

As stated in the Preliminary Guidelines, a detailed Italian hydrogen strategy was expected to be published in 2021; however, the detailed Italian hydrogen strategy is still under discussion and has not yet been published (but it is expected soon).

Italy plans to support a variety of production methods, including green and blue hydrogen.

There is currently no definitive policy goal beyond 2030.

However, the Preliminary Guidelines suggest that Italy could require up to 20% of overall energy demand to be met by hydrogen in 2050, and forecast that the long-term Italian strategy, once approved, will also set the Italian targets for 2050.

Key regulatory reforms The legislative decree no. 199/2021

simplified the authorisation process for the construction and operation of electrolysers for hydrogen production.

However, two main reforms are still expected: the first on the technical norms (such as production safety, transport and storage of hydrogen); and the second on measures to incentivise production and consumption.

Italy has not (yet) formulated its own standard but is in favour of regulating this at the EU (or even international) level.

Production

According to the Preliminary Guidelines, in order to implement the low-carbon hydrogen strategy in Italy and to meet the hydrogen demand target, it is estimated that up to 10 billion of investment will be required between 2020 and 2030 (net of the investments in renewable projects).

This amount includes a specific allocation for hydrogen production investments of around 5-7 billion.

The Italian National Energy and Climate Plan also provides for the promotion of the production and use of hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.

At the time of writing, support is available under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), which allocates  among the 23 billion funding to promote and develop the green transition  a dedicated amount to support hydrogen production.

In particular, the NRRP allocates:  500 million for the redevelopment of brownfield sites for the production of hydrogen to be used for local transportation and industry and  450 million for the start-up of a large industrial plant for the production of electrolysers with approximately 1GW of electrolysis capacity by 2026 and the development of further technologies needed to support hydrogen end-use (e.g. fuel cells for trucks).

In addition to the above, the NRRP supports research and promotes all necessary legislative reforms to facilitate the production (as well as use, transport, and distribution) of hydrogen with a dedicated amount of 160 million.

COUNTRY ANNEX:

ITALY Storage and transport According to the Preliminary Guidelines, investments in hydrogen distribution and consumption facilities expected are to be around 2-3 billion.

To date, the NRRP provides for:  a 300 million investment in the railway sector, which encompasses the development of high pressure electrolysers as well as high capacity storage systems with the possibility of using metal hydrides or liquids and  a 160 million investment to improve knowledge of hydrogen-related technology for production, storage and distribution in order to increase competition and to gradually reduce costs.

Hengeler Mueller,The potential of hydrogen: A guide to key European markets,"Support for specific sectors is currently available under the NRRP as set out below.

Transportation  The NRRP allocates 230 million to increase the use of hydrogen in road transport, promoting the creation of truck and car hydrogen re-fuelling stations, reaching at least 5-7% of the internal market by 2030.

The development of approximately 40 refuelling stations is expected, giving priority to strategic areas for heavy goods vehicles (e.g. along highways, close to ports and near logistics terminals).

The introduction of hydrogen as an energy carrier will require two reforms to:  the technical norms (such as production safety, transport and storage of H2) and  measures to incentivize production and consumption.

COUNTRY ANNEX:

ITALY Rail The NRRP allocates 300 million for the conversion to hydrogen of non-electrified railway lines in regions characterised by high passenger traffic with high usage of diesel trains.

The most advanced projects envisage this being done in an integrated manner, including the production and distribution of hydrogen and the procurement of hydrogen trains.

Hard-to-abate sectors The NRRP allocates 2 billion for the transition towards zero emission green hydrogen in industries that are energy- intensive and hard-to-abate, such as steel mills and petroleum refining, as well as the chemical, concrete, glass and paper sectors.

Hydrogen valleys The NRRP allocates 500 million for the redevelopment of brownfield sites for the production of hydrogen to be used for local transportation and industry.

In this regard, the NRRP aims to create 10 hydrogen valleys (industrial areas whose economy is based partly on hydrogen) in order to promote, at the local level, the production and use of hydrogen in industry and transport.

To minimise costs in the first phase, brownfield sites already connected to the electrical grid will be used to install electrolysers for hydrogen production using excess renewable electricity or dedicated renewable electricity production in the area.

As a result of cross- sector cooperation, a National Hydrogen Programme 2022-2025 (NWP) has been developed which provides further detail.

The NWP forms part of the National Climate Agreement.

For blue hydrogen, the NWP aims for 1.5-1.8 Mton of production by 2030.

A goal beyond 2030 has not been specified, but hydrogen is seen as an indispensable part of the gas energy carriers that will be needed to provide at least 30% of Dutch energy consumption in order to achieve a climate-neutral energy supply and economy by 2050.

Key regulatory reforms A number of general reforms will have implications for the hydrogen market in the Netherlands:  on 1 January 2023, the Dutch Environment and Planning Act (Omgevingswet) is expected to enter into force and  a draft for a new Energy Act has been prepared (internet consultation took place in 2021, but a formal proposal is yet to be introduced to Parliament).

The proposal aims to replace the current Gas Act and Electricity Act 1998, implement new European regulations and give substance to agreements made in the Climate Accord of 2019.

However, the provision on hydrogen projects (including the role of system operators) is subject to debate.

Improvements to the (new) Energy Act are therefore still under consideration.

The Netherlands has not (yet) formulated its own standard but is in favour of regulating this at EU (or even international) level.

In this respect, the Netherlands is part of the Pentalateral Forum (comprising Benelux, Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland) and, together with Austria, has taken the initiative to develop common approaches to critical issues such as standards, market incentives and market regulations ahead of the discussions at an EU level.

Furthermore, the Netherlands is committed to lobbying within the EU on amended definitions in the RED II that increase the opportunities for green hydrogen, responding to concerns that the current standards are too restrictive for the scaling up of green hydrogen.

THE NETHERLANDS However, the Dutch authorities have stipulated that green hydrogen is eligible under SDE++ subject to certain conditions including that the hydrogen is produced by a plant that produces hydrogen by electrolysis with a nominal capacity of at least 500 kW, and has a connection to the electricity grid or has a direct connection to an installation that produces renewable electricity (wind or solar).

Production Hydrogen production in the Netherlands is focused on green and blue hydrogen, using large-scale electrolysers linked to wind or solar energy facilities or using production plants with CCS in the coastal regions.

The Governments first priority in the coming years is to reduce the production costs of clean hydrogen by upscaling production plants in so-called regional hydrogen clusters (Port of Rotterdam area, Zeeland/Flanders and in the North of the Netherlands).

Different support schemes are being introduced to facilitate this development.

Stimulating the production of blue hydrogen (e.g. the Porthos Project in the Port of Rotterdam area) will contribute to the emissions reductions needed by 2030 and also supports the accelerated development of green hydrogen.

The Government announced that the production of hydrogen and operation of electrolyser facilities should be reserved to private/commercial market parties and should not be open to transmission and distribution system operators (TSOs and DSOs) (unless only temporarily and if necessary).

Precise locations of electrolysers will be chosen, on the basis of the guidance in the Main Energy Infrastructure Programme (Programma Energiehoofdinfrastructuur), by the Government in close consultation with industry.

Key factors in determining the location will be the proximity to gas infrastructure, space for the electrolysers and the space for and capacity of electricity infrastructure.

THE NETHERLANDS Overview of the SDE ++ SDE++ support scheme subsidizes the unprofitable component in order to render a technology competitive.

The unprofitable component is the difference between the base rate and the market value of the output generated by the technology in question (the corrective amount).

The base rate is fixed for the entire subsidy period but the corrective amount is set annually.

The base rate differs per technology and is calculated by Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving, PBL), commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

The base rate is the cost price of the technology: the calculation is based on a reference installation where the majority of projects are profitable.

The unprofitable component decreases when the market value rises, reducing the amount of the subsidy received.

Subsidies are granted for periods of 12 or 15 years.

The duration of the subsidy depends on the technology used (see below).

A GUIDE TO KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS PAGE 50 To complement support under the SDE++, there are plans for a temporary scaling- up support scheme for green hydrogen to support electrolyser construction construction (expected to open from autumn 2022).

Currently the Netherlands has 2MW of electrolyser capacity but by 2025 is aiming to develop 50 to 100MW of electrolysis capacity with a reserved budget of 250 million.

A public consultation was held in early 2022 and the aim is to open this extra support scheme in the second half of 2022.

Apart from support schemes, the fiscal aspects of hydrogen are important to facilitate further development.

Currently an energy tax has been levied on the electricity and mineral resources necessary for hydrogen production but not on hydrogen itself.

Clarity on future taxation is, however, important for business cases (e.g. double taxation of resource and end product should be avoided).

Storage and transport The aim of 3 to 4GW of electrolysis requires hydrogen storage of approximately 3-5 caverns according to the NWP.

The ambition is to develop four sites before 2030 (the first already in 2026) with a budget of 35 million set aside for this purpose.

The possibility of hydrogen storage in depleted gas fields also needs to be researched further.

In addition to hydrogen storage, the Government is also reviewing together with the Dutch transmission system operators Gasunie (gas) and TenneT (electricity), whether and under what conditions part of the gas network might be used for the transport and distribution of hydrogen.

It has been decided that the operation of a future hydrogen transport network will be reserved to public operators such as Gasunie.

Preparations for the national hydrogen backbone have started and a budget of 750 million reserved.

COUNTRY ANNEX:

THE NETHERLANDS Network operators will begin collaborating with market participants to launch hydrogen pilot projects, in order to research a workable supply chain.

However pilot projects will require a temporary amendment of the Gas Act.

Hydrogen is not defined as a gas regulated by the Gas Act, and so TSOs are not entitled to transport hydrogen by using the current gas networks.

A proposal was formulated in June 2021 but the Council of State advised against it and it was therefore abandoned.

Sector specific measures The NWP contains a detailed gaps analysis with specific goals per sector.

Ports and industrial clusters Currently the industry uses about 0.8Mton/ year of hydrogen which is estimated to increase to approximately 2.5kilotonnes by 2030.

In the short term (by 2025), the first applications for low carbon hydrogen is in ammonia production, methanol production, petrochemicals, refining and steelmaking furnaces.

In the longer term, ports and industrial clusters will accelerate their efforts in developing blue hydrogen by means of studies, business cases and investments, with grey hydrogen being replaced by blue hydrogen.

Most of these projects will be local either producing hydrogen by capturing CO2 emissions from existing hydrogen production within the five industrial clusters (as showcased by the Porthos Project and H-Vision in the Port of Rotterdam) or by accelerating offshore wind energy production and new build electrolysers to produce green hydrogen.

The availability of a hydrogen infrastructure in the near future, however, will be key for hydrogen to become a success according to the HyWay27 study, published by PricewaterhouseCoopers / Strategy& in June 2021.

Currently the technology necessary for hydrogen fired-generation is being developed but should be commercialised before 2030.

Scaling up demonstration projects is feasible.

If the supply of zero- carbon hydrogen can be scaled up in time, this would help achieve CO2 reductions in the electricity sector in the long term.

At a local and regional level, initiatives are currently being undertaken to combine local generation with the production, use and storage of hydrogen.

Important factors for successful scale up include the availability of CO2-neutral hydrogen and a sufficient hydrogen network.

Transport The Netherlands has the ambition to deploy 50 refuelling stations, 15,000 fuel cell vehicles and 3,000 heavy-duty vehicles by 2025, which is expected to increase to 300,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2030.

For aviation, the Netherlands is firmly committed to a European blending obligation and will even pursue a national obligation as of 2023 if progress is delayed at the European level.

The negotiated (draft) Sustainable Aviation Agreement with the sector included a commitment to reach 14% blending of sustainable fuels by 2030 and 100% by 2050.

This consists largely of synthetic fuels requiring the sufficient availability of (blue or green) hydrogen.

In the period 2025-2030, more and larger-scale projects will follow, taking into account the lessons learned from, for example, H21, and the projects targeted up to 2025.

During this first period, hydrogen will be added to the guidelines for municipalities on sustainability and the phasing out of natural gas in the built environment.

An amendment of the current Gas Act and Environmental Act is necessary for the phase out of natural gas, with an online consultation held on this subject at the end of 2021/beginning of 2022.

Agricultural sector As part of the Hydrogen strategy and support schemes, pilot projects using hydrogen have started in the agricultural sector.

However, no concrete targets are specified in the NWP.

Since many farms are already generating sustainable energy from solar, wind and biomass sources, this locally produced energy can be also be used for hydrogen production for use in heavy transport, such as tractors and other agricultural equipment, and in trucks in the agro-logistics sector.

The PNEC 2030 is designed with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Aligned with the PNEC 2030, the Portuguese Government approved the PT H2 Plan.

According to the PT H2 Plan, by 2030 Portugal expects to achieve the following goals:  10% to 15% injection of green hydrogen into natural gas networks  2% to 5% of green hydrogen in the industrial sectors energy consumption  1% to 5% of green hydrogen in the road transport sectors energy consumption  3% to 5% green hydrogen in the national shipping sectors energy consumption  1.5 % to 2 % of green hydrogen in the energy final consumption  2 GW to 2.5 GW of installed capacity in electrolysers  Setting up 50 to 100 hydrogen refuelling stations.

Key regulatory reforms Reforms are mainly underway through Decree-Law 62/2020, of 28 August, which approved the new legal framework applicable to the gas sector allowing for the production and grid blending of renewable gases and the new Portuguese Energy Services Regulator (ERSE) Regulation on the Natural Gas Distribution Grid.

The main areas of focus of reforms are the regulatory framework for green hydrogen production, hydrogen blending into gas grids and the extension of guarantees of origin to renewable gases, including green hydrogen.

The amount of hydrogen to be auctioned is set so that the share of hydrogen in the gas grids grows steadily until it reaches the 15% target in 2030.

On 19 January 2022 ERSE approved the new Gas Distribution Grids Regulation, which allows and regulates the operation of gas grids using 100% natural gas or 100% of gases of renewable origin or low carbon content, such as biomethane or hydrogen.

A maximum share of hydrogen content in the national gas distribution grid of 20% by volume is permissible, although this limit may alter depending on the place of consumption or the group of users.

Industry The PT H2 Plan establishes a target of 2% to 5% of green hydrogen in the industrial sectors energy consumption by 2030.

To achieve this, the PT H2 Plan sets out measures to regulate the installation of hydrogen production, storage and supply in industrial installations, and to implement industrial scale pilot projects for the introduction of hydrogen in the various industry sub-sectors (such as refining, chemicals, metallurgy, cement and glass).

The PT H2 Plan also aims to use hydrogen to decarbonise an industry sub-sector representing a strategic opportunity for Portugal, which will be selected on the basis of its importance in the national economy and its impact in terms of greenhouse gases emission reductions.

The Sines Project The PT H2 Plan envisages the implementation of the Sines Project, an industrial-scale project under development for the production of green hydrogen, which is expected to have a total capacity in electrolysers of at least 1 GW by 2030.

The objective is for the project to be a green hydrogen hub for national consumption and, ultimately, hydrogen exports.

It is also envisaged that the project will include an manufacturing facility for the production of electrolysers, which, in the first phase, will meet the demand generated by this project, and in COUNTRY ANNEX:

Transport The PT H2 Plan establishes a target of 1% to 5% of green hydrogen in the transport sectors energy consumption by 2030, with the aim of decarbonizing the transport sector, in particular, road transport (heavy freight, urban logistics and passenger vehicles).

Various measures are set out to achieve this, such as regulation for the roll-out of hydrogen vehicle refuelling stations, green hydrogen supply infrastructure, and the procurement of hydrogen-powered vehicles by the public sector and public transport companies, among others.

Projects like Power-to-Mobility (the production of green hydrogen for the supply of vehicles refuelling stations) and Mobility by Hydrogen (the manufacturing of hydrogen buses) are currently being developed, with the delivery of the first hydrogen refuelling station expected in 2021.

Water The PT H2 Plan also promotes the implementation of measures to encourage the synergies between the water and energy sectors, in order to incorporate the use of both domestic and industrial wastewater in green hydrogen production.

Under the RTFO, transport fuel suppliers have an obligation to provide a volume of sustainable renewable fuel which is calculated as a proportion of the overall volume of fuel they supply for road transport and non-road mobile machinery.

A sub-target was introduced in January 2019 for development fuels, including fuels of non-biological origin such as green hydrogen.

Compliance is evidenced via a certificate trading regime.

Industry

The UKs Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy aims to create four low carbon industrial clusters by 2030 which will involve a mix of blue and green hydrogen production projects together with the development of carbon capture and storage T&S networks.

Two clusters have been identified as part of a CCUS competition: HyNet (in the North West of England) and the North East Cluster (in Humber and Teeside) for delivery by the mid-2020s, with a reserve cluster in Scotland.

Hydrogen also features strongly in the Governments policy for industrial fuel switching, alongside electricity and bioenergy.

Heat As part of the UK Hydrogen Strategy, there are plans for a hydrogen neighbourhood and town this decade.

However, a strategic decision on the role of hydrogen for heating is not expected to be taken until 2026.

Power

The potential for hydrogen to be used directly in power generation or as long duration storage (so called power- hydrogen-power projects where the hydrogen is produced by electrolysis) is acknowledged in the UKs Hydrogen Strategy, but remains under investigation.

Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Our (Ware)House, in the Middle of Our Street","May 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Our (Ware)House, in the Middle of Our Street The General Court handed down on 18 May its judgment in Canon v Commission, clarifying how the Court of Justices landmark ruling in Ernst & Young applies to warehousing structures in M&A deals.

The Canon/Toshiba saga is one of those examples that, in life, you cannot have the cake and eat it.

Although the merger was cleared, the Commission took issue with a warehousing structure the parties had put in place to address Toshibas urgent need to receive the purchase price before the required regulatory approvals had been obtained.

The Commission considered the interim transaction, which placed the target company in the hands of a vehicle specifically created for that purposes (the parking transac- tion), as gun jumping and imposed an aggregate fine in the amount of EUR 28 million on Canon for a failure to notify the deal prior to implementation, Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation, and for implementing the deal prior to clearance, Article 7(1) of the EU Merger Regulation.1 In the wake of the Court of Justices landmark ruling in Ernst & Young,2 there was hope within the antitrust and M&A communities that there might be some (or more) wiggle room for parties to design warehousing structures that would survive the Commissions scrutiny.

The General Courts (GC) judgment Canon v Com- mission,3 upholding the Commissions decision, frustrates these hopes for nowsubject to what the Court of Justice might have to say on appeal.

The Merchant of Venice On 12 August 2016, Canon notified the Commission of its plan to acquire Toshiba Med- ical Systems Corporation (TMSC) from Toshiba.

The transaction was unconditionally cleared by the Commission on 19 September 2016.

At the time, Toshiba experienced fi- nancial difficulties.

In order to avoid having to report negative results for the 2015 finan- 1 For each of these two separate infringements, the Commission imposed a fine of EUR 14 million.

May 2018, Ernst & Young P/S v Konkurrencerdet.

3 Case T609/19, 18 May 2022, Canon v Commission.

Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

May 2022 2 cial year, the company had initiated an accelerated bidding process for the sale of TMSC and had proposed to bidders a so-called 80/20 structure pursuant to which the buyer would acquire 20% of the shares of TMSC minus one share (20% minus one) by the end of March 2016, and simultaneously pre-pay the price for the rest of the shares (80% plus one).

Toshiba would have continued to own the remaining 80% plus one shares (which would have been pledged to the purchaser as collateral), and therefore control TMSC, until all competition authorities had cleared the transfer of the remaining shares.

If the required merger control clearances would not have been obtained by 14 June 2016, the purchaser would have retained the 20% minus one TMSCs shares and terminate the pledge over the 80% plus one.

In turn, Toshiba would have refunded to the purchaser the provisional payment made for the 80% plus one TMSCs shares, minus a reverse break- up fee of YEN 35 000 million (EUR 29.1 million).That structure was intended to allow Toshiba to remove TMSC from and include the purchase price for TMSC in its accounts for the 2015 financial year, irrespective of the time it would take to obtain merger control approval.

During the bidding process, Canon proposed an alternative two-step transaction (ware- housing) structure involving an interim buyer (a special-purpose vehicle) that would allow the parties to achieve the same results.

In accordance with Canons (winning) proposal, TMSC converted its common shares into three different categories of shares, namely 20 class A shares (voting shares), one class B share (non-voting share) and 100 class C shares (voting shares with a redemption option exercisable by TMSC)."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Our (Ware)House, in the Middle of Our Street","As a first step, Canon and Toshiba entered into a share transfer agreement whereby Canon acquired the class B non-voting share (which gave it veto rights over any deci- sion to sell the target to any other purchaser), and 100 class C voting share options for EUR 5.28 billion (representing the entire value of TMSC).

On the same day, the inter- im buyer (MS Holding) and Toshiba entered into a share transfer agreement, whereby MS Holding acquired the remaining 20 class A voting shares of TMSC for EUR 800.

MS Holding had not existed prior to the bidding process and had been set up by a Jap- anese law firm which selected its three (independent) shareholders without seeking the approval of Canon or Toshiba.

This first step was carried out prior to notification to or approval by the Commission.  

As a second step, following approval of the merger by the Commission, Canon exer- cised its 100 class C share options, acquiring the underlying voting shares of TMSC, while TMSC acquired Canons class B non-voting share and

the remaining class A vot-

ing shares of MS Holding.

The ability to invoke the options was dependent on having secured the necessary regulatory approvals.

In June 2019, the Commission concluded that Canon had breached the notification requirement and standstill obligation imposed by the EU Merger Regulation, and fined the company for both infringements a hefty total of EUR 28 million.

In September 2019, Canon appealed the fine before the GC, saying the transaction structure was in line with existing and recently reconfirmed jurisprudence of the European courts (meaning E&Y).

On 18 May 2022, the GC confirmed the Commissions decision.

May 2022 3 House of Cards M&A dealmakers have from time to time turned to warehousing structures where the parties thought they could notor simply did not want towait to close their transaction until all required merger control approvals have been obtained.

Warehousing structures allow for a quick sale and payment of the purchase price, which may be come in handy if the seller is in financial difficulties.

They also allow the parties to shift the merger con- trol risk entirely to the buyer, which will typically need to pay the purchase price before merger control clearances have been obtained and will not be entitled to a refund if the deals gets prohibited or cleared only to subject to remedies.

In the past, publicly available guidance on warehousing structures has been fairly scarce, raising the question whether and to what extent the Commission and other antitrust reg- ulators might be willing to accept them at least in certain circumstances.  

The Commissions Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice of 2008 explains that, if an interim buyer acquires shares on behalf of the ultimate acquirer, the Commission will treat the interim warehousing transaction as the first step of a single concentration comprising the acquisition of control by the ultimate buyer.

Consequently, implemen- tation of that warehousing stage will amount to gun-jumping in the eyes of the Com- mission, even if it does not itself confer control over the target.4  The other piece of guidance that practitioners turned to was the GCs judgment in the Editions Odile Jacob case, which saw Odile Jacob challenging a Commission clear- ance decision of Lagardres acquisition of Vivendis book-publishing business (VUP), which involved Natexis Banques Populaires (NBP) as a middleman between Lagardre and Vivendi to accelerate the deal.5 As VUP was seeking a quick sale and payment, prior to merger control approval, Lagardre requested NBP to act in its place and, by means of a subsidiary set up for that purpose, to acquire the target assets from VUP, to hold them provisionally and to sell them to Lagardre once the latter had obtained clearance."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Our (Ware)House, in the Middle of Our Street","The GCs reply to the applicants allegation that the first step of the trans- action formed, together with the second step, a single concentration, was to examine whether the ultimate buyerLagardrecould exercise control over the target at the first stage.

The GC looked into whether the interim acquisition by NBP had, as such, transferred control to the ultimate purchaser, i.e. Lagardre.

The GC concluded that it had not because, according to the underlying purchase agreement, title to VUP was to pass to Lagardre only at the date of clearance by the Commission, and not before.

Pursuant to this agreement, NBPs subsidiary only took the place of Lagardre in acquiring and holding the target assets for the sole purpose of transferring owner- ship thereof to it, once Lagardre has obtained authorization from the Commission.

Lagardre did not have any influence / control over the target during the parking operation.

Furthermore, the parking structure fell within the scope of Article 3(5)(a) of Regulation 4064/89.

Therefore, the standstill obligation had not been infringed by Lagardre.6 However, on appeal, the Court of Justice stressed the GCs on the ware- housing aspects of the case were no more than an obiter dicta, missing the opportuni- ty to provide guidance on such deal structures.

May 2022 4 As with so many things, the devil may well be in the details when it comes to ware- housing structures and their prospects of surviving the Commissions scrutiny from a gun-jumping perspective.

Hence, the antitrust and M&A communities eagerness to see whether the GC might shed more light on whats possible and whats not.

Domino Effect

The crux of the Canon case is whether the first step of the warehousing transaction required merger clearance or not.

In its assessment, the GC looked at whether the two steps amounted to one single concentration and the first step could be considered partial implementation of a concentration, as the Commission had labelled it.

The GC upheld the Commissions assessment on both aspects.

According to the GC, the first transaction contributed to the acquisition of final control over TMSC by Canon, which occurred with the second transaction.

In the context of the transaction structure chosen by the companies, the first transaction was necessary for Canon to gain control over TMSC.

In reaching that conclusion, the Commission (confirmed by the GC) mainly relied on three elements.

First, the first step was only carried out in view of the second step.

Secondly, the sole purpose of MS Holding was to facilitate the acquisition of control of TMSC by Canon.

Thirdly, Canon was the only party able to determine the identity of the ultimate purchaser through its veto share (although it did not control TMSC during the first step), and assumed the economic risk of the entire transaction from the time of the first step.

Throughout the judgment, the GC further elaborates on these and touches upon a num- ber of other aspects that lead it to confirm the Commissions decision, although it is not always entirely clear to what extent these aspects relate to the first prong of the test (sin- gle concentration), the second prong of the test (partial implementation), or both.  

The GC confirmed that Canon did not control TMSC during the interim period (which was undisputed)."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Our (Ware)House, in the Middle of Our Street","The GC confirmed that Canon did not control TMSC during the interim period (which was undisputed).

However, that did not save Canon from the allegation of having jumped the gun because, as the Court of Justice had said, Article 7 of the EU Merger Regulation also prohibited the partial implementation of a concentration, which will occur in warehousing scenario if the first step (the parking transaction) contributes, in whole or in part, to the change of control over the target.7  

According to the GC, the first and second step can qualify as a single concentration, and the first step might thus amount to gun jumping, even if the interim buyer does not formally act on behalf of the ultimate purchaser (which is the language used in the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice).  

The interim buyer, MS Holding, was a special purpose vehicle that lawyers had specif- ically set up on behalf of the parties.

Apparently, the lawyers had also brought in the investors that held the shares in MS Holding.  

The arrangements between the parties were essentially of a tripartite nature.

While the initiative for a warehousing arrangement was initially taken by Toshiba (the 80/20 structure), the structure was ultimately put in place in the interest of both 7 The GC also confirmed that the concept of partial implementation also applies in the context of obligation to notify a concentration prior to implementation, Article 4(1) of the EU Merger Regulation.

May 2022 5 parties: Toshibasto remove TMSC from its accounting by end-March 2016 and rec- ognise the sale price, and Canonsto win the Toshiba tender to acquire TMSC.  

Canonand not MS Holdingbore the entire financial risk associated with TMSCs performance in the interim period.

At the closing of the first step, Canon paid a pur- chase price of EUR 5.28 million to Toshiba, representing essentially the entire value of TMSC.

Upon the closing of the second step, title of the Class A would pass to Canon at a price that was fixed ex ante and, therefore, did not take into account TMSCs performance.

Notwithstanding the fact that MS Holding was entitled to receive some dividends, MS Holdings financial interest in the transaction was limited to receiving the pre-agreed purchase price.  

While it held 100% of the voting rights in TMSC during the interim period, MS Hold- ings freedom to exercise these voting rights was limited in several ways, including by virtue of certain veto rights that Canon enjoyed and the fact that MS Holding was not free to choose for how long it would own the shares (which depended on Canon exer- cising the options attached to the Class C shares).

Apparently, there was also evidence that MS Holding had exercised its voting rights very little.

MS Holdings ownership of the voting rights in TMSC was only temporary, a fact that TMSCs management was well aware of.

While there was no evidence, according to the GC, that MS Holding had exercised the usual function of a controlling shareholder, Canon had apparently been in touch with TMSCs management during the interim period.  

Even if the Commission had not cleared the merger, Canon retained exclusive right to determine the identity of the (alternative) ultimate purchaser of TMSC, for which it had already paid the full purchase price to Toshiba.  

The warehousing structure was not saved from the gun jumping verdict by virtue of the second step being structured as an option, as opposed to a binding share purchase agreement.

According to the GC, Canon did not get a genuine option affording it the right to buy TMSC at a later stage, but had already paid the full price at closing of the first step in exchange for a de facto automatic mechanism to acquire TMSC in the second step.

What the GC makes abundantly clear is that it will always look at the economic reality of whats happening rather than the formalities of how the parties have chosen to set up their structure."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Our (Ware)House, in the Middle of Our Street","What the GC makes abundantly clear is that it will always look at the economic reality of whats happening rather than the formalities of how the parties have chosen to set up their structure.

And that look became more restrictive in the Canon judgment, as com- pared to Odile Jacob.

In the Following Episode

So what does the GCs judgment mean, going forward?

Is this the end of warehousing?

The judgment indicates a distrust of the GC regarding warehousing, in line with the Commissions equal lack of enthusiasm for parking structures, already laid out clearly in the 2008 Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice.

Technically, a warehousing structure would not infringe the standstill obligation8 if (i) the two steps of the warehousing transaction do not constitute to a single concentration, and (ii) the first step of the transaction (i.e. 8 That is, as far as the ultimate purchaser is concerned.

Whether or not the interim buyer needs merger control approval is a separate issue.

May 2022 6 the parking) does not amount to partial implementation of a concentration.

In theory, there might be deal structures that avoid either the first or the second requirement, or both.

The parties will likely need to consider ways to ensure, at the very least, that:  The interim buyer, not the ultimate purchaser, bears the financial risk associated with the targets business operations while parked at the warehouse.

At the very least, that risk should not be borne by the ultimate purchaser;  The ultimate purchaser does not get to decide the identity of an alternative buyer if merger control approval should not be obtained;  The interim buyer should have generally unrestricted control over the target, while the ultimate purchaser should not have any governance or even minority protection rights that might work to limit the interim buyers control (both de jure and de facto).  

The second step should preferable be structured as a genuine option, neither as pre- agreed purchase agreement nor as an option that is, in reality, tantamount to mech- anism that will automatically transfer control to the ultimate buyer.

Devising a mechanism that would allow the seller to receive the purchase price upon closing of step one would seem to be particularly challenging.

Even if the parties take these precautions, there is likely to remain a meaningful risk that the Commission might take an issue with their structure.

Moreover, in practice a low-risk structure may not be overly attractive for the parties and it might prove difficult, if not impossible, to find a warehouse that would be willing to help in these circumstances.

Warehousing has never been easy, and Canon certainly has not made it easier.

What kinds of infringement has the antitrust authority been focusing on recently?

Have any industry sectors been under particular scrutiny?

Markus Rhrig: The Commission finally broke cover, conducting its first dawn raid since the start of the pandemic.

The subject of the raid was a German company active in the sector of garment manufacturing and distribution.

The dawn raid in question was all the more relevant since on this occasion the Commission departed from its usual approach of only confirming inspections once a company makes them public.

Instead, it confirmed the inspections in a press release, without naming the company involved, before the company put forward any press release.

Throughout the rest of the year, the Commission undertook two other unannounced inspections regarding cartel suspicions in the field of wood pulp (October) and defence (November).

The three cartel-related dawn raids are part of a larger upswing in the Commissions antitrust enforcement activity, which also included inspections related to a potential abuse of a dominant position in the animal health sector.

Commissioner Vestager herself had already warned in October that more antitrust inspections were on the horizon.

She specifically referred to a number of types of conduct the Commission would likely target, including procurement cartels, no-poach agree- ments and collusion on sustainability.

Stephanie The: Both the European Commission and national competition authorities of the EU member states are focusing on a transition to a greener and more digital economy.

Those policy goals are broader than competition law alone.

But these priorities effect the enforcement priorities.

The Commission and their European counterparts are, therefore, developing guidelines to give comfort to undertakings when they want to cooperate with their competitors to genuinely pursue green goals.

On the other hand, infringements related to these policy goals are also on the radar.

For example, the Commission has settled with German car manufacturers restricting competition on the quality of emission-cleaning technology in their cars.

2 What do recent investigations in your jurisdiction teach us?

MR:

Apart from a very obvious increase in the Commissions cartel enforcement activity in the past year, we noticed more and more chatter in the institutional sphere about buyer cartels  where buyers collude to fix prices of the goods they are buying, eliminate competition for their purchases or otherwise control suppliers market conditions.

According to the Commission, going forward, it will not make any distinc- tion between the purchasing cartels and selling cartels when assessing them and imposing fines, since  according to the Commission  purchasing cartels are just  Law Business Research 2022 59 European Union

The Commission finally broke cover, conducting its first dawn raid since the start of the pandemic.

Stephanie The Anna Lyle-Smythe  Law Business Research 2022 60 European Union Cartels 2022 as serious as selling cartels.

Apparently, the Commission is taking a particular interest in the buyer cartels because recent years had seen a new wave of these cartels.

Two examples are the Car Battery case and an investigation started in 2017 into purchasers of ethylene.

ST:

Leniency applications still seem the most important trigger for the Commission to start a case.

The investigation into emission cleaning technology was triggered by a leniency application by a German car manufacturer.

Next to that, the instrument of a sector inquiry seems to be an important source for starting new cases."
Hengeler Mueller,Recent European and German cartel enforcement trends,"Next to that, the instrument of a sector inquiry seems to be an important source for starting new cases.

At least that is what the e-commerce sector inquiry has shown us.

Last year, the European Commission finished its sector inquiry into the consumer internet of things.

Anna Lyle-Smythe: The leniency regime remains key in the Commissions enforcement toolkit.

That said, the Commission and other agencies are talking more and more about own initiative investigations and exploring tools they can use or develop to detect potentially anticompetitive activity even in the absence of a whistle-blower.

The growth of dawn raids is, I agree, also a noteworthy development, particularly since they took place when travel and teleworking restrictions were in place to some extent in the relevant jurisdictions.

It will be interesting to see how those experiences shape the Commissions dawn raid policy in the years to come, particularly in terms of being able to access information held in home offices and to use their interview powers for staff who are not located on-site.

3 How is the leniency system developing, and which factors should clients consider before applying for leniency?

ALS:

There have been no formal changes to the leniency regime but the very clear drop in cases  which has been seen both at the EU and member state level  is raising some interesting questions about what is behind that and whether anything can be done to reverse the trend.

MR:

Companies have certainly stepped up their compliance efforts in recent years, which must be a contributing factor.

But the risk of follow-on damages claims is also putting pressure on the leniency system.

A new solution would be offering protec- tion to immunity applicants (ie, offering companies exemptions from civil damages).

According to the Commission itself, it is currently in the process of considering tweaks to the leniency notice to make it more attractive.

The potential immunity for such applicants is strongly backed by the German Federal Cartel Office, which saw its yearly number of leniency applications drop from around 50 to only 16.  

Law Business Research 2022 61 European Union www.lexology.com/gtdt/intelligence ST:

The leniency landscape is also quite fragmented in the EU, and there is still no one-stop-shop leniency programme at EU-level.

In my view, the European legislator missed the boat on that when it enacted the ECN+ Directive, which has to be trans- posed in all member states, meaning that undertakings must decide whether to apply for leniency to the Commission only, or also to other competition authorities.

4

What means exist in your jurisdiction to speed up or streamline the authoritys decision-making, and what are your experiences in this regard?

ST: Both settlement and commitments offered by the undertakings under suspicion can speed up the process significantly.

With regard to cartels, settlements are more used than commitments.

The latter are more used in abuse of dominance cases.

That being said, 2021 has shown that commitment decisions are also used to solve competition law issues with anticompetitive agreements.

This happened in relation to the network sharing agreements between mobile phone operators in the Czech telecoms market.

The leniency regime remains key in the Commissions enforcement toolkit.

That said, the Commission and other agencies are exploring tools they can use or develop to detect potentially anticompetitive activity even in the absence of a whistle-blower.  

Law Business Research 2022 62 European Union Cartels 2022 MR:

The settlement procedure started out as a way of streamlining the Commissions decision-making, but with the advent of the hybrid cases (ie, where only a part of the participants to the cartel agree to settle, while others continue along the regular procedure), the question of timing became quite sensitive and unclear."
Hengeler Mueller,Recent European and German cartel enforcement trends,"However, in 2021, the Commission showed it can be flexible when faced with a cartel probe where some companies cooperate while others fight.

Just weeks apart, the Commission wrapped up two cartel probes in very different ways.

First, for Forex-fixing banks, the regulator waited until it could pin the case on all participants before imposing a fine.

But for makers of canned vegetables, the companies that settled got out early, while another company fought on alone.

The two contrasting outcomes show that the Commission has options in how it runs its probes, and ends a period of uncertainty in the wake of the ICAP judgment, a period during which EU court rulings had cast doubt over the fairness of such hybrid probes.

As a result of the ICAP ruling, the Commission preferred to avoid the risk of split proceedings.

Consequently, it still ran hybrid probes but adopted decisions against the settlers and the holdout at the same time.

By wrapping everything up on the same day, there was no risk that an initial decision would prejudice a later one.

ALS:

Particularly in light of ICAP, the Commission will have been pleased by the General Courts recent endorsement of hybrid settlements when it rejected Scanias appeal against the Commissions cartel decision.

Scania had argued that the Commissions hybrid approach infringed its rights of defence, the principle of good administration and the presumption of innocence.

The Court found that the Commission had not prejudged Scanias liability, that the settlement decision against the other cartel participants could not be read as a premature expression of Scanias liability, and that when examining evidence submitted by Scania, the Commission was not bound by the findings it adopted in the settlement decision.

ST:

Yes, the European Court of Justice had similarly decided on that question in the Pometon case where it held that stating the factual circumstances around Pometons behaviour without deciding on whether that led to an infringement was not contrary to the principle of a fair trial.

5 Tell us about the authoritys most important decisions over the year.

What made them so significant?

MR:

On 8 July 2021, the Commission finally handed down its decision in the ground- breaking AdBlue case against Daimler, BMW and VW.

This cartel fine is the first of its kind  unlike previous sanctions, it did not punish the companies for colluding to increase prices.

Rather, it targeted contacts between the carmakers technical  Law Business Research 2022 63 European Union www.lexology.com/gtdt/intelligence experts who met regularly to discuss the implementation of technological devel- opments.

In the case at hand, the Commission focused on discussions related to technology called selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which eliminates harmful nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel passenger cars through the injection of urea (also known as AdBlue).

The decision states that the collusion meant the compa- nies did not compete to offer better solutions than those mandated by environmental law.

This included an agreement on tank sizes and ranges, as well as a common understanding on the average estimated AdBlue consumption.

Even more innovatively, the same day, the Commission sent another letter to the addressees of the first decision to explain what kind of contacts between technicians are unlikely to raise antitrust concerns.

Those include the joint development of a soft- ware platform for AdBlue dosing, which each carmaker implements individually.

This does not seem to restrict the effectiveness of the SCR system, according to the letter.

Hengeler Mueller,Recent European and German cartel enforcement trends,"Were there any notable challenges to the authoritys decisions in the courts over the past year?

ALS:

We have mentioned a few cases already, including on the topic of hybrid settle- ments.

Another interesting development last year was the ECJs judment in Printeos and the GCs judgment in Deutsche Telekom, which relate to the level of interest payment the Commission needs to pay to companies who have paid their fines which are then later overturned in the courts.

This has implications both for cartel and antitrust cases but, given the duration of the court proceedings in both types of cases, has potentially significant financial implications for the Commission.

ST:

There were also some notable decisions with the review of procedural issues as well.

One case concerned Slovak Telekom, which was confronted with parallel enforce- ment procedures regarding abusive behaviour.

The ECJ ruled that parallel enforcement was not contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem, since the enforcement procedures concerned different markets.

Similarly, Amazon was confronted with parallel enforce- ment.

Since the Commissions procedure concerned the same market, the European Commission carved out the Italian market on which the Italian competition authority was focusing its enforcement actions.

As for judicial review, this procedural carve-out could not be reviewed by the General Court of the EU since it decided that that proce- dural act did not produce legal effects vis--vis Amazon.

Therefore, that act could not be reviewed on the merits and the action was dismissed as inadmissible.

How is private cartel enforcement developing in your jurisdiction?

ST: Follow-on damages claims are litigated before the national courts of the member states, but some cases make their way to the ECJ in the event of referrals for a preliminary ruling.

Each member state typically has its own procedural issues and developments because the majority of national civil procedural law has not been harmonised by the Cartel Damages Directive.

Those cases that reach the ECJ often concern fragmented issues of the case at hand, such as standing before the national courts under international private law, time limitation periods, etc. MR:

The Court of Justices Sumal case was one of those preliminary ruling cases and ranked high on the watch list for antitrust litigators.

The Courts judgment certainly lived up to the expectations.

The notion that subsidiaries can be liable for antitrust violations committed by their parent entity, or possibly other companies of the same corporate group (top-down liability) marks a major milestone for private antitrust litigation across the EU and could have spillover effects in the Commissions cartel  Law Business Research 2022 65 European Union www.lexology.com/gtdt/intelligence enforcement and impact the scope of due diligence that companies will want to conduct in M&A deals.

What developments do you see in antitrust compliance?

ALS:

We saw a lot of interest from clients in updating their antitrust compliance policies and refreshing their internal training programmes over the pandemic.

The announcements on dawn raids have prompted many companies to make sure their own policies on inspections are up-to-date and fit-for-purpose in a hybrid working world.

For me, corporate culture is still the number one issue in terms of making those policies and training programme effective.

That compliance is endorsed by the very highest levels of the organisation is critical.

MR: Generally speaking, companies are stepping up their compliance programmes, a trend that we have been observing for a number of years."
Hengeler Mueller,Recent European and German cartel enforcement trends,"MR: Generally speaking, companies are stepping up their compliance programmes, a trend that we have been observing for a number of years.

However, the Commission is firmly following its 2010 line that no fine reductions are granted for compliance programmes, although the number of jurisdictions around the world that grant credit Follow-on damages claims are litigated before the national courts of the member states, but some cases make their way to the ECJ in the event of referrals for a preliminary ruling.  

Law Business Research 2022 66 European Union Cartels 2022 for compliance programmes has significantly increased since 2011, according to a 2021 OECD report.

Following their example would signify a turn in the Commissions policy, but we believe that nothing is off the table.

ST:

We have also seen a shift that companies sometimes prefer a thematic approach to compliance training sessions.

For example, when it comes to the use of personal data for commercial purposes, the session will look not only at compliance with competition law, but also with consumer law and data protection law.

Similarly, when a company is active in a bidding market, both compliance with competition law and anti-bribery rules are important.

We see an increase in these more cross- expertise compliance trainings.

What changes do you anticipate to cartel enforcement policy or antitrust rules in the coming year?

What effect will this have on clients?

MR:

In line with Commissioner Vestagers October announcement regarding the cartel enforcement priorities of the Commission, we are expecting a new series of dawn raids and can expect to see more enforcement on issues such as no-poach agreements, following a wave of these investigations in the US and Portugal, for example.

ALS:

I agree that we can expect to see more enforcement  whether this year or in the coming years  on the less traditional cartel structures such as buy-side cartels and no poach agreements, I also think we will see more and more enforcement of anti- competitive information exchange, as the authorities grapple more with the question on where to draw the line on that topic.

Of course, were a price-fixing, market-sharing or bid rigging case to come to light, the Commission would not hesitate to enforce that very strictly.

ST:

On a different note, both the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and block exemptions on R&D and specialisation will expire this year.

We expect new ones to be adopted.

They will be accompanied by revised guidelines.

We expect the vertical guide- lines to take into account newly developed distribution models due to e-commerce.

As for the horizontal guidelines, the Commission recently launched a consultation; they must definitely include guidance how competitors can cooperate to genuinely pursue green goals.

This fits the broader goals of the Commission on the transition to both a greener and more digital economy.  

Law Business Research 2022 67 European Union www.lexology.com/gtdt/intelligence 10 How has the covid-19 pandemic affected cartel enforcement in your jurisdiction?

MR:

The impact of covid-19 on EU cartel enforcement in 2021 shifted the focus to less immediate consequences of the virus, and here we are talking about the shipping industry.

Already in January 2021, European shippers and freight-forwarders were considering filing a formal EU antitrust complaint against the maritime shipping industry, since the freight shipping industry has seen prices soar during the covid-19 crisis.

Fast-forward to November, the Commission stated that price hikes in the ship- ping industry do not appear to be anticompetitive as the evidence stands, an opinion shared by its key counterparts in China and the US.

That being said, the December 2021 move from Maersk and Hamburg Sd to deal directly with shippers has attracted competition warnings from freight forwarders and logistics companies once again."
Hengeler Mueller,Recent European and German cartel enforcement trends,"That being said, the December 2021 move from Maersk and Hamburg Sd to deal directly with shippers has attracted competition warnings from freight forwarders and logistics companies once again.

We also saw a reduced number of antitrust inspections since the start of the pandemic, from the side of the Commission.

However, in October 2021, Commissioner Vestager announced that the Commission would reverse the trend, with the strict respect of the hygiene measures, of course.

The Commission has also insisted that companies not use the pandemic as a cover or a pretext for collusion.

For instance, the two matchmaking events in 2021 for speeding up the development and production of covid-19 medicines were organ- ised and closely monitored by the Commission.

Before the events took place, the Commission issued a comfort letter providing guidance on how the matchmaking and exchanges between participating companies, including direct competitors, can take place in compliance with EU competition rules.

ST:

Due to the various coronavirus health and safety measures established by the EU member states, the number of dawn raids by the Commission has seriously dropped in the past few years.

Not only for the Commission by the way, but also for the national competition authorities of the EU member states.

During the various lockdowns, dawn raids even seemed impossible.

In 2021, the Commissions dawn raids picked up again.

It published press releases about four unannounced inspec- tions it made last year, whereas the Commission was silent on that in 2020.

ALS:

On a practical note, the pandemic has changed some of the Commissions practices, for example, on how to conduct oral hearings and access to file.

And no doubt the Commission was relieved to have introduced the e-leniency system well ahead of the pandemic so such applications could still be made notwithstanding their offices being closed.

I think we can expect to see some of the measures adopted during the pandemic becoming standardised even as businesses and the Commission return to the office.  

Law Business Research 2022

The Inside Track What was the most interesting case you worked on recently?

ST:

One of the most interesting cases I worked on last year was referred from the Dutch court for a preliminary reference from the ECJ in the Air Cargo follow-on damages litigation.

The Commissions decision had not established an infringement, simply put, prior to 2004 because the Commission lacked the competence under the applicable transitional regime of articles 104105 TFEU.

Still, the ECJ found that article 101 TFEU had direct effect and that claimants could nonetheless rely on article 101 TFEU when suing for damages before the national courts.

ALS:

Without going into specifics given the confidential nature of the work, I think some really interesting questions are coming up on issues of information exchange and where to draw the line on what is and is not permitted.

I am also watching out for any impact the Courts judgments (both those already delivered and ones still under appeal) on interest payments have on how the Commissions practice develops in this area.

If you could change one thing about the area of cartel enforcement in your jurisdiction, what would it be?

ALS:

I would be keen to see a one stop shop for leniency in the EU.

I think this would serve both the enforcers and the business community much better than the current system.

MR:"
Hengeler Mueller,Recent European and German cartel enforcement trends,"ALS:

I think this would serve both the enforcers and the business community much better than the current system.

MR:

We support the line of thought of the German Federal Cartel Office regarding the shielding of immunity applicants, in order for the leniency gap to be filled.

As the situa- tion stands right now, there are very few incentives (if any) for an immunity applicant to come forward to the Commission.

ST:

I agree.

I am not sure the system is currently striking the right balance between public and private enforcement.

A perceived enforcement gap was one of the reasons for adopting the EU Directive that in essence facilitated claimants to bring follow-on damages claims.

The risk and costs associated with defending follow-on damages claims can nowadays be many times the amount of the fine for the infringement.

This seems skewed and, therefore, has a real impact on a companys decision to apply for leniency or not.

One way of making the pendulum swing back in the right direction is having the Commission carefully consider the nature of the infringement in the reasoning of its decision and being conscious of the significance of the wording in the decision in potential follow-on litigation.

Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Unboxing 2023, the DMA is about to happen – 4th Advent","December 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Unboxing 2023:

The DMA is About to Happen  4th Advent After the first three editions of our four-part Brussels  Jour December issue have provided you with food for thought on recent developments in the fields of cartels, State aid, and Merger Control, Christmas Eve and New Years Day are just around the corner.

So maybe time  best with some Christmas cookies to spur your creativity  to come up with some resolutions for 2023?

While we know this is a touchy subject for many, the Commissions ambitions for the new year are pretty clear: 2023 will bring the long-awaited Digital Markets Act (DMA).

It will apply from 2 May 2023 on and is about to reshape the regulatory framework for the digital tech industry.

Today, we provide you with an overview of the DMA enforcement roadmap for 2023.

The Commissions DMA Enforcement Roadmap at a Glance The first task on the Commissions DMA enforcement agenda will be the designation of so-called gatekeepers.

Gatekeepers are undertakings providing so-called core platform services (e.g., search engines, social networks, or operating systems, among others) if they meet certain quantitative thresholds in terms of turnover, market capitalization, and number of end and business users (Article 3(2) DMA).

If they do, they have to notify the Commission within two months after those quantitative thresholds are met, and provide the Commission with information to assess the thresholds for each of their core platform services.

The notifying undertaking can present, with its notification, arguments to demonstrate that it, although it meets the quantitative thresholds, does not meet the substantive gatekeeper criteria, i.e., it does not have a significant impact on the internal market, does not provide a core platform service that is an important gateway for business users to reach end users, and/or does not enjoy an (actual or future) entrenched and durable position.

Markus Rhrig, Christoph Sielmann and Christoph Wilken report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

December 2022 2 It is expected that the Commission will complete the first gatekeeper designation proceedings in August/September 2023.

Following the Commissions gatekeeper designation decision, gatekeepers have six months time to comply with (most of) the Dos (i.e., obligations) and Donts (i.e., prohibitions) outlined in the DMA.

These concern, for example, issues such as: Interoperability between gatekeepers platforms and third party services, processing of data, communication between business users and end users, ban on self-preferencing the gatekeepers own services over third- party services, granting users free choice to switch from gatekeepers to competitors services, or FRAND access to core platform services for business users, among others.

Furthermore, gatekeepers must (immediately upon the designation decision) inform the Commission about intended M&A transactions involving targets active in the digital space or enabling the collection of data, even if the transaction is not notifiable under the European Merger Control Regulation (EUMR).

The information provided will enable the Commission to reach out and potentially encourage EU member states to request a referral under Article 22 EUMR.

Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Unboxing 2023, the DMA is about to happen – 4th Advent","It is intended to set the procedural framework for the application of the DMA, including aspects regarding the gatekeeper designation process, guidance on the format of submissions and information that the Commission expects gatekeepers to provide, as well as gatekeepers procedural rights.

Stakeholders can provide feedback on the draft DMA Implementing Regulation until 9 January 2022.

The adoption of the DMA Implementing Regulation is planned for the first quarter of 2023.

The draft DMA Implementing Regulation takes inspiration from the EU Merger Control procedure.

For example, like the Form CO in merger cases, the draft DMA Implementing Regulation provides for a Form GD regarding the gatekeeper designation notification.

The Form GD calls for detailed information to enable the Commission to assess whether the quantitative gatekeeper thresholds are met.

The Commission encourages undertakings concerned to submit a pre-notification draft Form GD well before the notification deadline.

Like in EU Merger Control proceedings, notifying undertakings will, during the pre-notification process, likely need to deal with information requests from the Commission before it confirms the completeness of the Form GD (only a complete Form GD will start the 45 working days review period).

1 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13540-Digital-Markets-Act-implementing-provisions_en December 2022 3

On the other hand, the draft DMA Implementing Regulation draws from European Court procedures in that it imposes stringent page limits on submissions made by the gatekeepers.

For instance, the page limit for the Form GD is 50 pages per core platform service; for submissions to rebut the gatekeeper status, the draft DMA Implementing Regulation only allows for 25 pages.

Given the complexity of such submissions, it is obviously difficult to meet these page limits.

The Commission only allows derogations if the notifying undertaking can show that it is objectively impossible to deal with particularly complex legal or factual issues within the relevant page limits (Article 4 draft DMA Implementing Regulation).

The Commissions apparent intent to set out a rapid process comes with significant limitations to the gatekeepers right to be heard: In addition to the page limits, the draft DMA Implementing Regulation does not provide for the opportunity of an oral hearing, and in contrast to the EU Merger Control procedure, gatekeepers cannot turn to a Hearing Officer for an independent review of the matter.

All in all, the draft DMA Implementing Regulation raises questions whether it sufficiently ensures a fair process for gatekeepers.

Lets Talk Substance  the Commissions Interactive Approach to DMA Enforcement The Commission has announced to host a series of workshops with stakeholders to hear their views on various aspects regarding the implementation of the DMA, such as what measures would be sufficient to comply with and what technical issues arise from the DMA rules.

On 5 December 2022, the first workshop was held on the self- preferencing ban (Article 6(5) DMA).

The recording and presentations are available on the Commissions website2.

The topic for the next workshop will be announced in early 2023.

It is still unclear whether the Commission will, at some point, adopt guidelines on substantive DMA issues; in any event, for such guidelines the Commission will presumably need to first get some case work experience.

The Great Reshuffle  the Commission Gets Ready for the DMA Enforcement Implementing the DMA requires, no doubt, a great deal of time and effort  not only from large digital undertakings, but of course also on the part of the Commission.

DG COMP and DG CONNECT will equally share the burden of the DMAs enforcement, with the former being responsible for legal and administrative matters and the latter for technical issues."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Unboxing 2023, the DMA is about to happen – 4th Advent","DG COMP and DG CONNECT will equally share the burden of the DMAs enforcement, with the former being responsible for legal and administrative matters and the latter for technical issues.

This goes in hand with the shared responsibility between Commissioners Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton.

The Commission is currently in the process of assembling and structuring its DMA squad.

Recent talk of the town is that Alberto Bacchiega has been approved as head of a new Directorate J. Bacchiega is a well-experienced Italian economist who is currently heading Directorate C at DG COMP, responsible for Information, Communication and Media.

Directorate J will consist of three units responsible for DMA enforcement and also investigations into digital tech companies under traditional competition rules.

Reportedly3, one unit will be headed by Thomas Kramler (currently head of DG COMPs 2 https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops_en 3 https://content.mlex.com/#/content/1435228?referrer=search_linkclick December 2022 4 unit C.6 responsible for antitrust investigations in the e-commerce and data economy sector), another unit will be headed by Lucia Bonova (who until recently was part of Vestagers advisor team), while the head of the third unit is still vacant.

The Commission is also still on the search for a Chief Technology Officer, who will oversee DG COMPs tech-related work.

The Commissions doubled-down approach towards Big Tech is also emphasized by the recent opening of its Silicon Valley Office in San Francisco.

The office is headed by Gerard de Graaf, who was involved in the legislation process of the DMA and its sister regulation, the Digital Service Act.

It is apparent that the Commission will also need to hire additional workforce: In its original DMA draft proposal4 from 2020, the Commission expected to need 80 additional full-time staff for the handling of the DMA.

Some, including Parliaments DMA rapporteur Andreas Schwab, suggested5 that the Commission would need to recruit about twice as much.

The Commission is the sole enforcer of the DMA; at the same time, the DMA provides for close cooperation and coordination between the Commission and EU Member States national competition authorities (NCAs).

Where provided by national law, NCAs may also conduct investigations into potential breaches of DMA rules and report their findings to the Commission.

However, it remains to be seen how much help the Commission will actually get (and want) from NCAs; all the more so considering that resources of NCAs are bound by national cases, not least complex proceedings against digital tech firms under traditional competition laws or new rules for digital companies such as Section 19a of the German Act Against Restraint of Competition, which was introduced in in 2021.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 3),"September 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR La Rentre 2022  Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 3) Now, that the first post-Covid summer has come and gone, its time to put up your surf board, pack the kids lunch boxes and plan for the months ahead.

Admittedly, we cant rival with the masters of bento boxes, but we can give you a short overview of les must of this fall in terms of antitrust, cartels, merger control, foreign subsidies and State aid.

Sadly, it is already Day 3 and the end of our La Rentre 2022 edition, concluding with our outlook on Foreign Subsidies and State aid: Foreign Subsidies Regulation: A regulatory Storm and its Impact on Businesses Most of our readers will already know it: Following a political agreement reached on 30 June 2022, another regulatory storm from Brussels called Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) is just miles away.

Following the expected formal adoption in Q4/2022, the noti- fication obligations for M&A transactions and public procurement bids falling in scope of the FSR will apply after a grace period of 9 months, i.e. at some point in the second half of 2023.

So whats to expect?

It is certainly no stretch to say that this ground-breaking regulation will heavily impact M&A deals (timelines, closing conditions, interplay with simultane- ous FDI / merger control proceedings) and public procurement.

The first details how the FSR will pan out in practice will however only emerge in December, when the Commis- sion aims to publish a Draft Implementing Regulation for public consultation.

A welcome invitation for a #Brusselsajour edition on the most pressing questions right after  stay tuned for that!

In the meantime, lets look at the key tools of the new FSR:  Mandatory notification of all M&A transactions which are deemed as a con- centration under the EUMR (meaning an acquisition of a non-controlling minority stake, maybe the prime example of foreign investment, does not trigger a review!).

A concentration is notifiable if (1) the turnover of one the undertakings concerned Markus Roehrig, Laura Stoicescu and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

September 2022 2 exceeds EUR 500m within the EU and (2) all of the undertakings concerned have re- ceived an aggregated (!)

financial contribution exceeding EUR 50m in the last three calendar years before the notification in one or more non-EU countries.

Note that the term financial contribution is defined extremely broad and is more or less aligned with State aid law and Art.

107 (1) TFEU.

Unfortunately, in practice, this will bring a number of state support measures in favour of companies (e.g. capital in- jections, tax rebates, direct grants, state guarantees, R&D support, COVID aid) in the scope of the FSR.

If an M&A transaction is notifiable, it may not be closed prior to Commission approval (standstill obligation).

Otherwise, the Commission can, similar to the EUMR, im- pose fines of up to 10% of the parties annual global turnover.

And also timing-wise the FSRs deal review will follow the EUMR (Phase I: 25 WD, Phase II: 90 WD).

But regardless of such similarities, one of the most relevant questions for practitioners is how the Commission intends to deal with simultaneous EUMR and FSR proceedings (e.g. regarding informal guidance, stop the clock, remedies).

Hopefully, the Draft Implementing Regulation will provide further insights and also clears up the organi- sational set-up within DG COMP: Will companies have to deal with two separate case teams for parallel merger control and FSR reviews?

How will such proceedings be aligned to avoid delays impacting the overall deal timeline?"
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 3),"How will such proceedings be aligned to avoid delays impacting the overall deal timeline?  

Mandatory notification of public procurement bids, where the estimated value of a (only EU) public tender exceeds EUR 250m and the participating economic operator, i.e. the bidding company, received aggregated foreign financial contributions in the three calendar years prior to notification of at least EUR 4m. Operators will have to report such contributions to the contracting authority, which will pass it on to the Commission for review whether this enabled an unduly advantageous offer.  

Ex officio investigation tool if a concentration or public tender does not meet the thresholds set out above (e.g. greenfield investments) and the Commission nonetheless suspects that foreign subsidies involved have distortive effects in the internal market.

Provided these conditions are met, the Commission can order the parties to notify the transaction and otherwise impose redressive measures.

And most noteworthy, it can investigate, e.g. on the basis of third-party complaints, foreign subsidies granted up to five years before the FSR entered into force (e.g. up to some point in 2018).

Since financial contributions are assessed on an aggregated basis (i.e. all non-EU finan- cial contributions for all undertakings concerned added up) and with an extremely low threshold, a number of deals and procurement bids might be scrutinised.

So the key question is: how do businesses best prepare before the FSR enters into force in mid to late 2023?

Unfortunately, tangible insights will be delivered only with the Commissions Draft Implementing Regulation in December.

Based on the Commissions initial views, our #Brusselsajour edition coming right after (i.e. December or January) will dive into the most pressing questions, inter alia: September 2022 3  How to identify and compile non-EU financial contributions (and since when).  

Criteria when a financial contribution above the relevant thresholds has no distortive potential and will thus not fall in scope of the FSR.  

If a financial contribution is however at risk of being classified as distortive, how to as- sess the impact on the internal market and the substantive assessment in future deals.

WHEN?

Adoption end of 2022, entry into force after mid-2023.

Draft Implementing Regulation in December 2022  watch out for the #Brusselsajour edition following that publication for an in-depth guidance!

State aid: The best is yet to come  was one of the headlines in a recent DG COMP presentation relating to the fitness check of State aid rules launched in 2019 and the Commissions ambitious 2012 State aid modernisation package.

As part of these efforts to focus resources on the most pressing cases (go big on big as you might have heard), over the last years, the Commission was hard at work overhauling the vast majority of its State aid related regulations, guidelines and working papers (just to name a few: IPCEI, CEEAG, Risk Finance, Broadband guide- lines set for adoption in 2022 and many more).

But as the headline said, maybe the best is yet to come: One of the underarching themes of this presentation  and the keynote speech of EVP Vestager at the EStALI Autumn Conference  was that State aid rules should foster and enable good and transpar- ent aid.

The Commission believes that the mere fact that Member States are providing increased support to companies is not a problem in itself, as long as such public sup- port follows clear policy principles and complies with State aid rules.

To that end, the Commissions representatives repeatedly pointed towards the Covid crisis, in which (see the recently published State aid scoreboard on approved State aid spending by Member States in 2020) huge amounts were disbursed under the Commissions supervision, en-

suring that distortions of competition were limited and the level playing field remained intact."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 3),"suring that distortions of competition were limited and the level playing field remained intact.

That, in the Commissions view, proves that the revised and new rules should facilitate good aid related to certain policy objectives, in particular the so called twin transition (Green Deal & Digital Agenda).

So as part of the fitness check and State aid modernisa- tion, the last of the mohicans not yet overhauled will be revised in light of these princi- ples.

One of the most important will follow soon with the General Block Exemption Regu- lation (GBER), which is set for expiry at the end of 2023.

The Commission in particular aims to align the GBER with other revised guidelines (e.g. the CEEAG to facilitate green investments or Risk Finance guidelines) and to simplify the increasingly complex legal text.

As the GBER accounts for almost 95% of all aid measures by Member States, this will be of huge practical relevance for Member States and businesses alike.

Other guidelines to be revised or evaluated in the short- to mid-term are the De-Minimis Regulation, the Rescue & Restructuring Guidelines, the Railway Guidelines, Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines, the Banking Communication and several rules for agriculture and fishery.

So a lot to come  some of it still expected this year and more in 2023.

September 2022 4 State aid: Amendment of the Temporary Crisis Framework The extensive and ongoing efforts on State aid modernisation were and are maybe some-

what overshadowed by the continuous crisis mode DG COMP finds itself in since 2.5 years: After the immense inflow of cases during the Covid crisis seemed to stop, it was topped off by the energy crisis following Russias invasion of Ukraine.

So the Commission is very aware that there is  unfortunately  no time to take a breather, as rising costs will require Member States to increasingly support struggling businesses and individual households alike.

The Commission is eager to play its part, with Commissioner Vestager just announcing last week that the key ingredient of any crisis response is flexibility.

With that buzzword in mind, she announced a new Member State survey to see if the Temporary Crisis Framework is still up-to-date and in line with needs and announced further amend- ments in the months to come.

Since a number of businesses will need increased state support to survive the winter, the Commission will in particular need to look into the maximum aid amounts possible (per beneficiary), straighten eligibility criteria (so far, often undertakings in difficulty are excluded, even though their difficulties are not intrinsic and solely stem from the Covid crisis) and prolong the existing rules.

In addition, in light of increasing rescue measures by national governments to important energy suppliers, some even considering nation- alisations, the Commission will also face more and more requests to include a similar chapter as the Temporary Framework had on equity measures and recapitalisations.

WHEN?Amendment to the Temporary Crisis Framework expected still before year end (comparable amendments in Covid crisis often happened within weeks).

and on that note, we end our three day tour of La Rentre 2022.

Hengeler Mueller,Higher Administrative Court of Hesse backs BaFin's publication practice,"In a decision taken in an interim relief procedure in August 2022, the Higher Administrative Court of Hesse has confirmed BaFin's recent administrative practice on the publication of measures and fines for violations of the German Banking Act.

In one of his first major interviews in October 2021, the newly appointed president of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) Mark Branson told leading German business daily Handelsblatt that BaFin will establish a new supervisory culture including testing boundaries, where necessary.

Since then, BaFin has started to turn words into deeds.

At an increasing pace, BaFin has taken administrative measures and sanctions against regulated financial institutions, in particular banks, often for shortcomings in their business organisation or AML compliance.

More than that, BaFin tends to publish such measures and sanctions once they have become incontestable in a non-anonymized way, i.e. including the addressee's name.

While the orders to mitigate shortcomings or other administrative actions are a burden themselves, institutions are usually more concerned about publications of these measures.

Institutions fear the reputational harm BaFin's ""naming and shaming"" may cause vis-à-vis relevant stakeholders, in particular customers, business partners, and investors.

As a result, addressees of BaFin orders increasingly consider not only to challenge these orders, but also their publication.

Judicial backing A recent decision by the Higher Administrative Court of Hesse (VGH Kassel, case no.

6B 134/22), a second instance court competent for the judicial review of BaFin actions, has now backed BaFin's administrative practice.

The court's decision confirms that the German Banking Act generally requires BaFin to publish administrative measures and sanctions in a non-anonymized way.

Only in exceptional circumstances, BaFin may decide to refrain from such publication or to publish the order on an anonymized basis.

The most relevant of these exceptions in practice are measures against managing directors due to the disproportionate harm to their reputation a non-anonymized publication may cause.

In its ruling, the court emphasized that the legislature intended the publication to have also a negative economic impact on the addressee so that it would have a deterrent effect.

Naming and shaming becomes new normal Although the court's decision has only been taken in an interim relief procedure, it is a strong sign that the administrative courts will in most cases uphold BaFin's decision to publish its enforcement action.

Even more than before, addresses of BaFin measures must therefore expect BaFin to make use of its ""naming and shaming"" powers and legal remedies against them having a little chance of success.

This will strengthen compliance incentives for institutions.

At the same time, the reputational harm caused by BaFin publications may decrease over time as the number of publication increases and publication of BaFin measures becomes the new normal."
Hengeler Mueller,Will Finance Minister Lindner 'Catch the Big Fish'?,"Based on recent estimates, around 100 billion euros are laundered in Germany each year, making it a 'money laundering paradise'.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering organisation, has given Germany a mediocre rating in its most recent audit report.

In particular, Germany was criticised for how it has conducted financial investigations in complex cases.

According to the FATF, cooperation between law enforcement authorities and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) did not run smoothly in practice, with prosecutors focusing too much on predicate offences and too little on subsequent financial crime.

It found that prosecutors had inadequate resources and there were deficiencies in AML supervision in the non-financial sector.

Against this background, a key objective of Germany's three-party governing coalition is stepping up the fight against financial crime.

In September 2023, the Federal Ministry of Finance published a draft bill to combat financial crime (Combating Financial Crimes Act), which the Federal Cabinet has since adopted without any significant changes.

The draft law has been recently debated in Federal Parliament ( Bundestag ) and is now under review by its Finance Committee.

Federal Minister of Finance Lindner stated that the improved legal framework will allow Germany to 'catch the big fish' in the future.

But will Lindner really achieve the 'big success' that he announced?

The bill, which is intended to step-up the fight against financial crime in Germany, provides for the establishment of the Federal Financial Crime Agency (FFCA) as a new specialised federal authority.

Financial flow analyses, criminal and administrative investigations, and supervisory powers are to be bundled under the FFCA’s umbrella.

At the core of the FFCA will be the new Money Laundering Investigative Centre (MLIC), where the most significant cases of international money laundering with links to Germany will be investigated.

This approach involves a shift in focus: applying the 'follow the money' principle, the MLIC will take suspicious financial flows as a starting point to uncover crimes, its 'masterminds' and criminal networks.

In 2025, the Central Office for Sanction Enforcement and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), previously part of the German customs authority ( Zoll ), will be integrated into the FFCA creating synergy between sanctions enforcement and combating money laundering.

This is also intended to improve co-operation between law enforcement agencies.

In addition, the Central Office for AML Supervision will be established under the FFCA’s umbrella.

Its aim is to strengthen a standardised, strict risk-based approach to AML supervision in the non-financial sector, and to support nationwide coordination and supervisory measures under AML law.

In discussions about the Combating Financial Crimes Act, the focus on money laundering has been criticised.

Financial crime includes several criminal offences, including commercial fraud, subsidy fraud, tax evasion and VAT fraud.

However, under the current draft bill, investigating tax crimes falls entirely outside the scope of the MLIC.

Furthermore, establishing a new agency initially sounds like a reasonable measure to counter the fragmentation of competencies, which has also been criticised by the FATF.

However, there are increasing concerns that this will lead to even more red tape and inefficient parallel structures as no real centralisation or effective bundling of competencies is envisaged under the draft law.

Subordinate to the FFCA, the MLIC is primarily structured as a separate organisation that must rely on the resources of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) in key areas.

A similar issue arises with the proposed Central Office for AML Supervision.

Each of the federal states (forming the Federal Republic of Germany) will in principle remain responsible for AML supervision tasks."
Hengeler Mueller,Will Finance Minister Lindner 'Catch the Big Fish'?,"Each of the federal states (forming the Federal Republic of Germany) will in principle remain responsible for AML supervision tasks.

The Central Office for AML Supervision will merely have a coordinating role.

This approach of the draft law does not sufficiently address the patchwork of supervisory authorities still operating in the individual federal states – something which the FATF has also criticised.

Likewise, the extent to which the bill takes into account specific characteristics of the various entities subject to obligations under AML law remains unclear.

By comparison to the financial industry, the non-financial sector is very diverse with many different areas of activity.

To perform their supervisory duties properly, it is essential for the public authorities in charge to be familiar with these specific activities and the associated professional rights and obligations.

Accordingly, it would be preferable for the Central Office for AML Supervision to have an organisational structure reflecting individual sectors.

In addition to organisational changes, the bill extends the scope of the existing AML regulations and introduces stricter documentation and reporting obligations.

For instance, whenever a criminal complaint or an application for prosecution is filed in addition to a suspicious activity report (SAR), the FIU must be notified.

Whether this will increase efficiency is questionable.

The Anti-Money Laundering Act is currently pursuing an all-crimes approach and the entities in the relevant industries must also report many minor incidents as suspicious activities.

Because of the risk-based approach pursued by the FIU, these SARs are frequently not forwarded to the law enforcement authorities, or at least they are not investigated or eventually do not lead to a prosecution.

Therefore, this new approach may entail significant additional work both for the industry and the FIU.

It may mean that the objective of increasing efficiency may not be achieved, overall.

Instead, it may be preferrable to pursue an 'all-serious crimes approach', similar to the approach taken by other European countries.

This would also be in line with the FATF recommendations.

To combat financial crime, the draft bill aims to improve the data flows as well.

From 2027, data that is recorded in the Transparency Register must also include the beneficial owner’s place of birth.

Likewise, companies are to be incentivised to voluntarily disclose their ownership and control structures in the Transparency Register.

The registrar will be authorised to retrieve the data to be entered in the Transparency Register by requesting the relevant information from other registers, such as the land registry.

The establishment of a new real property transaction register is also proposed, enabling digital access to data on real property sales in order to combat money laundering and enforce sanctions.

In future, public authorities, notaries and courts will be obliged to transmit data to this register related to real property sales that have a purchase price of more than EUR 100,000.

Combating financial crime in Germany is a goal which all stakeholders can support, and in particular the relevant industries will be happy to work towards this end.

After all, it will make Germany more attractive as a business centre.

However, the cost-benefit ratio must always be considered.

The costs incurred by the relevant industries for complying with the numerous existing obligations are high, even before the bill is passed.

Introducing additional obligations is therefore justified only if this actually leads to the 'big fish' being caught.

To this end, the bill should be improved significantly in the legislative process."
Hengeler Mueller,Climate change litigation as a business risk,"The amount of climate change litigation worldwide has increased dramatically in recent years.

This results in litigation risks and liability risks for companies from numerous industries.

Supervisory boards should be aware of the risk.

What is climate change litigation?

The term ""climate change litigation"" is generally used as an umbrella term for a wide range of legal proceedings in which climate protection plays a role.

Climate change litigation is a current and a global phenomenon.

[1] While the first climate litigation cases were filed in the late-1980s, the number of climate related claims has increased dramatically since the conclusion of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015.

Between 2020 and today alone, around 500 climate litigation cases have been registered worldwide – that is a quarter of the total number of completed and ongoing climate litigation cases recorded.

[2] Approximately three quarters of the climate litigation cases on record originate from the USA.

[3] In addition, Australia, the UK and the EU member states, as well as increasingly the so-called Global South, are regions where a significant number of climate litigation cases have been brought.

[4] There is no such thing as a prototype climate claim.

Climate litigation cases differ, amongst other things, in their objective, the type of plaintiff and defendant, and the legal basis on which the claim is based.

Aims of climate action The strategies pursued by litigants in climate change cases are diverse.

Many cases seek to advance climate action, and these are often referred to as ""pro-regulatory"" cases.

There are also, however, many recorded cases in which litigants challenge the introduction of regulations or policies that would lead to ""positive"" climate outcomes, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (""anti-regulatory"" cases).

In this article, we will focus on those pro-regulatory actions that aim to advance climate-friendly or climate-protection measures, or to restrict climate-damaging behaviour, as well as actions that seek compensation for alleged contribution to climate change damage.

Excluded for the purposes of this paper are claims of failure to adapt (that challenge a defendant for failure to take the impacts of climate change into account when developing policies or facilities) and failure to disclose risks related to climate change, which include claims of greenwashing.

Lawsuits for more climate protection Most climate change litigation seeking increased climate protection is directed against states.

The lawsuit filed by the Dutch non-governmental organisation (""NGO"") Urgenda against the Netherlands played a pioneering role.

The Dutch government had planned to reduce emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.

In a lawsuit filed in 2015, Urgenda, together with numerous citizens, demanded that the Netherlands reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020.

The plaintiffs relied, among other things, on their human rights (the right to life and well-being of residents of the Netherlands).

The judgment granting the claim was upheld by the highest court in the Netherlands (the Dutch Supreme Court) in 2019.

In Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court required the German legislature to amend the Climate Protection Act in March 2021.

The court considered the climate protection measures laid down in the law to be insufficient to protect future generations from the risks of climate change, and thus found the law to be unconstitutional in this respect.

The ruling has received a great deal of attention, as the Federal Constitutional Court has in principle assumed a constitutional duty of the state to protect citizens from the dangers of climate change and has thus made climate protection actionable, at least to a certain extent.

Increasingly, plaintiffs are also seeking to compel companies to meet certain climate targets through private law actions."
Hengeler Mueller,Climate change litigation as a business risk,"Increasingly, plaintiffs are also seeking to compel companies to meet certain climate targets through private law actions.

In May 2021, the District Court of The Hague issued a widely publicized ruling, which garnered much attention, in response to a class action lawsuit filed by several environmental organisations and thousands of private individuals, ordering the oil and gas company Shell to reduce its emissions by 45 percent by 2030 compared to 2019.

It is noteworthy that the court not only looked at Shell's own emissions, but also assumed a best-efforts obligation on Shell to work towards a reduction of emissions in business relationships with suppliers and end users.

Shell has appealed against the ruling.

Following the Shell ruling, the main plaintiff in the case, the NGO Milieudefensie, has since called on 30 other companies including the airline KLM, the bank ABN Amro and the consumer goods manufacturer Unilever to submit a climate plan to track the reduction of their emissions.

In Germany, four climate claims were filed in 2021 that attempt to follow up on the argumentation of the Federal Constitutional Court and make a right to climate protection usable in relation to companies as well.

The lawsuits, which were filed by the NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe (""DUH"") and Greenpeace, are directed against BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen, demanding that the automobile companies commit to a tighter carbon emissions budget, and discontinue worldwide sale of cars with internal combustion engines by 2030.

A climate change claim has also been filed against the gas and oil producer Wintershall Dea, to prevent it from developing any new natural gas or oil production after 2026.

On 13 September 2022, the Stuttgart Regional Court dismissed the action against Mercedes (Case No. 17 O 789/21) at first instance.

The court referred to the lack of tangible proof as to how the plaintiffs' personal rights would be impacted in the event of the continued sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines.

In addition, the court emphasized the constitutional division of duties between the legislature and the courts, which prohibits the courts from taking legislative decisions.

The DUH has said it plans to appeal the decision.

The Dutch court in the Shell case based its decision on a general clause from Dutch tort law.

According to this far-reaching general clause, a breach of an unwritten standard of care (in this case, among other things, knowledge about climate change) can also give rise to liability towards third parties.

German tort law does not have such a far-reaching general clause.

Rather, the plaintiffs in a German claim must show that they have suffered damage to a legal interest protected under Section 823 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB).

The plaintiffs will then need to prove a causal link, that without the contribution of these companies, the alleged disruption would not exist.

In addition, the defendant companies would have to be found liable even though they are complying with applicable law.

These hurdles are unlikely to be easily overcome.

Actions for compensation of damages The best-known climate litigation in Germany for the consequences of climate change that have already occurred is Saúl Lliuya's lawsuit against RWE.

Saúl Lliuya lives in the Peruvian town of Huaraz below a glacial lake.

He claims that climate change has caused increasing glacial melt, which has led to a significant rise in the water level of the glacial lake.

In order to protect the city of Huaraz and Saúl Lliuya's house from flooding, protective measures have to be implemented.

Saúl Lliuya is seeking a declaration that RWE will contribute to the costs of the protective measures.

The lawsuit claims that the share of the costs to be paid by RWE must be based on the share of greenhouse gas emissions caused by RWE worldwide since the beginning of industrialisation, which is claimed to amount to 0.47%."
Hengeler Mueller,Climate change litigation as a business risk,"In contrast to the court of first instance, the Higher Regional Court of Hamm considered the action to be conclusive in principle and has entered into the evidentiary stage.

At the end of May 2022, hearings in relation to the taking of evidence took place in Peru.

Among other things, it remains to be seen whether German courts will accept evidence of a scientific causal chain between carbon dioxide emissions, climate change and the occurrence of damage, and how the courts will deal with the aforementioned objection that the emitter acted within the framework of applicable law.

Diversification of defendants Constitutional claims against governments and states are still the most common type of climate change litigation.

However, climate change claims against companies are on the rise, and it is no longer just companies from the fossil fuel sector that are affected.

Companies from the transport, food and agriculture, plastics and finance industries are also increasingly on the defendant side.

Litigation risks must also be considered globally.

The Dutch NGO Milieudefensie, for example, has announced its intention to hold even those companies with a small presence in the Netherlands accountable for their global emissions in Dutch courts.

A recent international development is that of climate change litigation being brought against board members.

For example, the NGO ClientEarth, as a shareholder, is taking action against Shell's Board of Directors (in the United Kingdom) by way of a so-called derivative action on behalf of the company.

ClientEarth accuses Shell's board members of having breached their duty to act in the best interest of the company by failing to develop and implement a climate strategy in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Conclusion Climate change litigation is increasing, and climate claims against companies are a real risk.

It is expected that claims for the compensation of damages will increase in the future, including with regards to extreme weather events and their consequences such as floods, heatwaves and forest fires.

Climate claims pose significant risks to a company's strategy, as well as financial and reputational risks.

Climate protection should therefore always be considered when assessing corporate governance measures.

The existence of a plan on how a company intends to make an appropriate contribution to achieving the Paris climate goals (a transition plan) can help limit climate change litigation risk.

Hengeler Mueller,New Whistleblower Protection Bill in Germany,"August 2022 1 LEGAL UPDATE New Whistleblower Protection Bill in Germany On 27 July 2022, Germanys Federal Cabinet approved a bill on whistleblower protection (German Whistleblower Protection Act), that aims to transpose the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive (EU) 2019/1937 into national law.

As the previous government had been unable to agree on a bill by the deadline (17 December 2021), the European Commission initiated an EU infringement procedure.

The draft law will now enter the legislative process in the German Parliament and is expected to enter into force  according to the current draft  three months after its promulgation.

The German Whistleblower Protection Act sets out far-reaching obligations for legal entities in both the private and public sectors to provide whistleblowers with comprehensive protection.

Scope and Purpose  

While the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive only applies to the reporting of EU law violations, the German Whistleblower Protection Act is broader in scope, covering certain violations of national law as well.

In particular, the Acts protections extend to reports on any and all criminal violations as well as administrative violations (Ordnungswidrigkeiten) if the law concerned protects the life, health or rights of employees or their representative bodies.

Violations of German antitrust law are also in scope as well as certain other legal violations of German and EU law.

A violation only falls within the scope of the draft law if it relates to an occupational, business or official activity.  

The purpose of the draft law is to protect individuals who come into possession of information on such violations, as mentioned above, in a broadly defined work-related context (including e.g. the recruitment process), and who then report that information via the reporting channels defined in the law or who disclose it to the public.

The bill also aims to protect individuals who are the subject of such reports or who are otherwise affected by whistleblowing.

August 2022 2 Internal Reporting, External Reporting and Public Disclosure  

The German Whistleblower Protection Act obliges certain employers to set up internal reporting units (interne Meldestellen), while requiring certain public authorities at the federal and state level to implement external reporting units (externe Meldestellen).  

Whistleblowers may choose freely between reporting either to an internal or an external unit.

Internal reporting units need to provide whistleblowers with clear and easily accessible information on external reporting channels and on how to report violations to EU institutions.  

A whistleblower disclosing information to the general public is protected under the draft law if the whistleblower previously submitted a report via an external channel, i.e., a channel operated by public authorities, and no proper follow-up measures were taken or no feedback was given to the whistleblower.

Public disclosure is also protected if making an external report appeared inappropriate for narrowly-defined reasons.

Reporting Channel Requirements  Subject to certain thresholds, employers in all industries and sectors (companies with at least 50 employees and municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants) will be required to set up an internal reporting unit and the necessary channels.

This requirement applies to employers in certain sectors, e.g., capital management companies, regardless of the number of their employees.

Should the Act take effect, these obligations will immediately apply to all employers except for those with between 50 and 249 employees, which will become subject to them starting 17December 2023.  

The internal reporting unit can be operated by the employers staff or by a third party.

Employers with between 50 and 249 employees may operate reporting units together with other employers."
Hengeler Mueller,New Whistleblower Protection Bill in Germany,"The internal reporting unit can be operated by the employers staff or by a third party.

Employers with between 50 and 249 employees may operate reporting units together with other employers.

Corporate groups can also establish reporting units centrally, rather than at each entity  subject to certain requirements.  

The reporting channels have to accommodate both oral and written reporting.

Whistleblowers can also request an in-person meeting to make their reports.

While the German Whistleblower Protection Act does not include an obligation to enable anonymous reporting, it does protect individuals who report information on breaches anonymously  even if they are subsequently identified.

Internal and external reporting units have no obligation to follow-up on anonymous reports but are supposed to follow-up on them if they have sufficient resources to do so in addition to dealing with reports from named individuals.  

Among their obligations, both internal and external reporting units must assess reports, give feedback to the whistleblower within specified time limits and take appropriate follow-up measures, such as initiating an investigation.

The identity of the whistleblower has to be kept confidential unless one of the exemptions set forth in the law apply.

Officials operating external reporting channels may request information from companies and public authorities to verify the validity of reports.

They can also transfer the case to a competent authority for further investigation.

August 2022 3 Protection Measures and Enforcement  Under the draft law whistleblowers are protected if they made a report to an internal or external channel or publicly disclosed information as provided for in the law and had reasonable grounds to believe that they were reporting or publicly disclosing true information relating to a legal violation within the scope of the Whistleblower Protection Act.  

The whistleblower cannot be held liable for acquiring or accessing the relevant information unless the acquisition or accessing of that information is a criminal violation.  

Reporting or disclosing information is not considered a violation of non-disclosure obligations and does not result in any legal liability if the whistleblower had reasonable grounds to believe that reporting or publicly disclosing the information was necessary to reveal a violation within the scope of the Whistleblower Protection Act.  

The draft law prohibits any kind of retaliation against whistleblowers.

If a whistleblower suffers a disadvantage in a work-related context after making a report or public disclosure, the disadvantage is presumed to be an act of retaliation.

In such cases, the burden of proof lies with the person who caused the disadvantage to demonstrate that the measure was duly justified or that it was not in retaliation for the report or public disclosure.

If the whistleblower is retaliated against, he or she is entitled to compensation for any damage suffered.  

Individuals who deliberately report incorrect information or do so with gross negligence are not protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act and are liable for damages resulting from the inaccurate or misleading information.  

Violating certain obligations under the German Whistleblower Protection Act will be an administrative offence.

Administrative fines of up to EUR 100,000 can be issued for hindering or attempting to hinder reporting, retaliating against whistleblowers and failing to keep the identity of whistleblowers confidential.

The competent authorities can impose a fine of up to EUR 20,000 for a failure to set up internal reporting channels.

If and when the Federal Cabinets bill is enacted, companies in Germany are likely to check whether their existing reporting channels meet the new legal requirements and, where necessary, to accelerate their efforts to implement whistleblowing systems."
Hengeler Mueller,New Whistleblower Protection Bill in Germany,"Companies are well-advised to incentivize employees to report any suspected violations internally.

Such internal reporting gives a company the opportunity to investigate any alleged wrongdoing in-house, to take swift remedial action and, if it is required by law or in the interests of the company, to self-report to the authorities on an adequate factual basis.

Hengeler Mueller,M&A Outlook 2024,"A myriad of geopolitical uncertainties, a demanding regulatory environment and macroeconomic forces, including persistently high inflation, rising interest rates and concerns of potential recession, weighed heavily on dealmaking last year.

Unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East, combined with an ensuing increase in energy prices, have further hampered European businesses.

Given the over-aggressive monetary policies followed by central bankers around the world, the financing and the syndication markets have also remained subdued.

Simultaneously, now that the multi-billion stabilisation measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have been substantially cut back, the number of restructurings, distressed financings and M&A transactions could increase because many companies need to increase liquidity and reduce debt.

As financing has become more expensive, companies that were hit hard by the pandemic restrictions, and do not (yet) have a business model that fits in the post-COVID-19 era, are likely to suffer most.

In addition, greater volatility in financial markets, the large debt burden of many states and higher financing costs are expected to increase the number of restructurings as well as insolvencies, even of companies not substantially affected by the pandemic.

These factors, seen in 2023, will continue to weigh on activity levels in 2024.

Carve-outs are expected to remain important levers for companies since circumstances have not reduced their need to transform themselves.

This is particularly true for much of the industrial sector in Germany, especially chemical and automotive companies which are struggling to get back to pre-pandemic level margins.

The automotive sector also has to manage the transformation from petrol and diesel to electric engines, along with intensifying competition from their US and Asian-based peers.

For sponsors, public markets are likely to continue to provide an attractive hunting ground for deals this year.

While actively participating as bidders in auction processes, sponsors have been cautious and selective, focusing on sectors where they have strong expertise given the reduced availability of leverage.

The technology sector has been their primary focus.

This has been driven by an expectation that demand would broaden out to other sectors, such as healthcare and business services, with investors being more likely to place greater weight on a target's underlying fundamentals regardless of the industry.

Sponsors have also shown a greater appetite for co-invests and minority investments than before, with significant transaction activity set to continue in these investment structures in the medium term.

Corporates that have strong balance sheets are expected to play a pivotal role in driving deal activity.

We are likely to see more Private Equity exits with sales being made to strategic buyers.

M&A is now a more important growth driver than in the recent past, and business leaders are using it as a key tool to help them reposition their businesses for future growth.

On the other hand, lower valuations make corporate separations more likely—especially for high-value assets trapped inside larger corporates.

Companies that have a valuation overhang from mis-priced assets within their portfolio will seek to spin off, or sell parts of their business to unlock overall value for shareholders.

Challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2024 are expected to further test the resilience of the M&A market: we expect that dealmakers will act more cautiously before new trends become more discernible.

They are scrutinising business models closely and, above all, relying on experienced partners with a track record in project development.

Nevertheless, we also anticipate that the market will stabilise.

We can certainly imagine that this year will deliver a number of exciting transactions, a growing trend of focussing on the core business, and an increase in spin-offs of business areas."
Hengeler Mueller,From Honorary Post to Profession,"Supervisory Board Survey 2023 SEPTEMBER 2023 3 Foreword Over the last few years, aspects relating to sustainability and the ESG criteria have turned into critical factors for commercial enterprises to consider, and as a result supervisory board agendas have been devoting more and more attention to them.

This year, in general, posi- tioning the company to be fit for the future counted among the central topics addressed by supervisory boards.

Additionally, globally persistent geopolitical instability and supply-chain disruptions, triggered by bottlenecks, unrelenting inflation and energy pricing, continue to dominate in the German corporate landscape.

But what has this meant for supervisory boards and the work they do in concrete terms?

What further topics are defining supervisory boards' agendas at present?

How are these to- pics impacting the skills and expertise profiles of supervisory boards?

And what significance does the greater professionalisation of supervisory board work have in times of crisis?

To- gether with AdAR, the Arbeitskreis deutscher Aufsichtsrat e.V. (German Supervisory Board Working Group), we explored these and many more questions in this year's supervisory board survey.

We hope you find this reading enlightening and inspiring.

Therefore, in indivi- dual cases, total sums might not come out to 100 (per cent).

Moreover, not all respondents answered all of the questions, meaning that there may be different survey sample sizes for individual questions.

6 7 In general, like last year, the supervisory board members attached the greatest import- ance to setting their companies up to be ready for what the future brings.

In contrast to the results of the 2022 survey, while the subject of digitalising or digitally transforming their companies no longer ranks first this year, it still remains greatly relevant (with 84 per cent of respondents saying so)."
Hengeler Mueller,From Honorary Post to Profession,"With a view to positioning their companies for the future, sustainability issues have kept the supervisory boards of listed companies somewhat busier than their counterparts at unlisted companies (92 per cent versus 79 per cent), while digitalisation is an almost equally common consideration at both listed and unlisted companies (83 per cent versus 84 per cent).

Because crises around the world are still ongoing, geopolitical instability also continues to loom over supervisory boards' agendas.

In the respondents' order of priority, this concern currently ranks third and rose slightly in importance compared to last year (82 per cent versus 77 per cent).

Overall, the three top issues for the work done by supervisory boards (sustainability/ESG, digitalisation and geopolitical instability) are equally relevant, and the differences in their weighting are marginal.

A. .Topics and agendas

The 2023 supervisory board agenda The subject of sustainability is growing into an ever more important competitive aspect for commercial enterprises.

And the ESG criteria figure centrally in that development.

In light of increasingly more stringent environmental laws and compliance and quality directives, but also considering companies' own ethical objectives, it is hardly astonishing that those factors are also impacting supervisory boards' agendas.

Eighty-five per cent of the super- visory board members we surveyed consider the subject of ESG and the transformation of their companies towards more sustainability the central matters on their agendas.

What subjects are defining your supervisory board's agenda in 2023?

What subjects have been on your agenda in particular in 2023 (compared to 2022)?

This year, for the very first time, our study asked supervisory board members whether they thought their internal control systems (ICS) and risk management systems (RMS) were effective.

Sixty-eight per cent of respondents said that they were.

The German Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity introduced the requirement that management boards of publicly traded companies must implement adequate and effective ICS and RMS.

The 2022 update of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) urges also taking sustainability aspects into consideration when complying with that requirement and has formulated tighter disclosure rules.

It is therefore unsurprising that this subject is also highly significant in the work supervisory boards do (with 74 per cent of the surveyed officers of listed companies and 64 per cent of those from unlisted companies saying so).

This was followed by succession planning (55 per cent), management board and supervi- sory board remuneration (44 per cent), diversity (43 per cent) and co-determination (17 per cent), some of which trail the one before it by a considerable margin.

In this regard as well, the order of the priorities is different at listed and unlisted com- panies.

Succession planning is given somewhat higher priority by the supervisory board members of publicly traded companies (63 per cent) than by their counterparts at unlisted companies (51 per cent).

The difference between listed and unlisted companies is greater with regard to manage- ment board and supervisory board remuneration."
Hengeler Mueller,From Honorary Post to Profession,"The difference between listed and unlisted companies is greater with regard to manage- ment board and supervisory board remuneration.

According to 52 per cent of the respon- dents from listed companies, this is a far more established topic there than on the super- visory boards of unlisted companies (38 per cent).

Differences between the respondent groups can also be seen in their opinions regarding diversity.

Forty-seven per cent of the surveyed officers of listed companies reported having this subject on their agendas, while only 37 per cent of the respondents from unlisted companies said the same.

Distinct differences between the respondent groups are also apparent on the subject of co determination.

Survey responses are showing a consistent trend in this respect: like last year, unlisted companies considered co-determination to be far more preoccupying than publicly traded companies did (40 per cent versus 21 per cent in 2023 and 25 per cent versus 9 per cent in 2022, respectively).

This difference may be due to the fact that co-determination is enshrined at listed companies and tends to be part of the routine.

Supply chains have remained just as relevant in 2023.

Even though supply chains are now more stable again and, accordingly, the subject's significance has lessened margi- nally compared to last year (70 per cent of respondents calling them relevant in 2023 versus 79 per cent in 2022), they continue to preoccupy supervisory boards because of bottlenecks and the changes in energy prices influenced by unremitting inflation.

The entry into force of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains at the beginning of this year and the associated compliance measures have made the subject even more relevant.

The supervisory board members of both listed and unlis- ted companies deem this topic to be important to almost the same degree (71 per cent versus 69 per cent).

A greater disparity becomes apparent between the two respondent groups when it comes to compliance, which has been dominating the agenda of listed companies' supervisory boards to a far greater degree (83 per cent) than it has for their counterparts at unlisted companies (66 per cent).

By virtue of the German Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity, these profiles have additionally gained new meaning.

Financial expertise constitutes a central aspect when providing holistic advice to and monitoring management boards.

1.

Financial expertise on supervisory boards The German Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity underscores the significance of financial know-how as a component of the skills and expertise profiles of listed companies' supervisory boards.

Since 1 July 2021, the Act requires public-interest entities to have at least two members on their supervisory boards with expertise in accounting or auditing.

Which is why it is not shocking that, like last year, most of the supervisory board members we surveyed (81 per cent overall) either agreed or strongly agreed that professional expe- rience as a CFO was important.

Besides that, obtaining the German public auditor (Wirt- schaftsprfer) qualification or working as one (66 per cent) and a membership on the audit committee of another company (65 per cent) were given nearly the same heavy weighting.

These were followed by long-term experience as an advisor in the field of auditing (61 per cent) and general expertise (59 per cent).

Working as a tax consultant was rated rather low as proof of expertise, the same as last year."
Hengeler Mueller,From Honorary Post to Profession,"Working as a tax consultant was rated rather low as proof of expertise, the same as last year.

The supervisory board members of listed companies attached greater importance to pro- fessional experience as a CFO when gauging proof of financial expertise than their peers at unlisted companies did (82 per cent versus 77 per cent).

The same was true for obtaining public auditor qualification or working as one (68 per cent versus 60 per cent), just as it was for membership on the audit committee of another company (70 per cent versus 58 per cent) and long-term experience as an advisor in the field of auditing (64 per cent versus 54 per cent).

By contrast, acquiring expertise through continued education (63 per cent versus 54 per cent) and working as a tax consultant (44 per cent versus 36 per cent) were considered more relevant at unlisted companies regarding proof of expertise than at listed companies.

In your opinion, where did the relevant members on your supervisory board acquire the  necessary expertise?

Supervisory boards' qualification matrices According to the GCGC's latest version, the implementation status of a supervisory board's skills and expertise profile is to be disclosed in corporate governance statements in the form of a qualification matrix.

Merely describing the profile will no longer satisfy these new guidelines.

Instead, the proficiencies and qualifications of the individual members of the supervisory board need to be presented in an overview table juxtaposing those with the know-how stipulated under the skills and expertise profile.

When supervisory board members were posed the question whether they had already had any experience in their companies with creating and publishing a qualification matrix, the majority (56 per cent) replied that they did.

At listed companies, that figure was even much higher at 76 per cent.

This meant, of course, that 44 per cent of respondents still lacked any experience with qualification matrices.

Have you already had any experience at your company with creating and publishing a qualification matrix?

2. Training and professional development for supervisory boards It is the duty of every member of a supervisory board under German stock corporation law to ensure that he or she has the required education and training.

The GCGC recommends that companies provide their supervisory board members with the appropriate support in this regard.

Currently, providing that assistance is relevant particularly when it comes to newer, and important, topics such as finances, sustainability and digitalisation.

When asked about how training and professional development were handled at their companies, 44 per cent of surveyed supervisory board members stated that they organised any such programme at their own responsibility and had to bear the costs themselves.

At unlisted entities, that number even rose to 56 per cent.

Some 29 per cent said that their company took care of the organisation as well as the costs.

At publicly traded companies, that figure jumped to 39 per cent.

A further 27 per cent stated that the costs were covered by their companies, but that they needed to organise any continuing education or training course themselves.

In this respect, the difference turns out not to be major between listed (30 per cent) and unlisted (27 per cent) companies."

Sustainability expertise on supervisory boards Particular expertise is also being increasingly demanded of supervisory boards when it comes to sustainability.

This new importance follows from the amended preamble of the GCGC, in which the Code commission emphasises the impact that corporates have on peo- ple and the environment.

The preamble makes clear that that impact is to be taken into account by management and supervisory boards in their companies' leadership, monitoring and enterprise strategy pursued in the company's best interests.

Accordingly, the Code's new recommendations provide that supervisory boards' skills and expertise profiles also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues relevant to the enterprise.

While just a narrow majority (51 per cent) of those surveyed last year believed that their companies met this criterion, a clear majority (69 per cent) said the same this year.

That number spikes to 82 per cent at publicly traded entities.

According to the guidelines of the German Corporate Governance Code, supervisory boards should have expertise on sustainability.

Does your company already meet this requirement?

When asked by whom or how the qualification matrix was prepared and made, the lar- gest percentage of the surveyed supervisory board members (42 per cent) replied that their matrix was created based on a self-assessment, followed closely (41 per cent) by the entire supervisory board contributing.

In near equal measure, the supervisory board members responded that their qualification matrix was prepared and put together either by the super- visory board chairman or in a committee, 32 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.

Fifteen per cent of respondents stated that their qualification matrix was drawn up elsewhere within the company.

Who on the supervisory board prepares and makes the qualification matrix and how?

no 31% yes 69% 16 17 5.

Meeting the sustainability expertise requirements Our study shows that sustainability expertise requirements are being addressed in entirely different ways.

Like last year, the surveyed supervisory board members view training and seminars as the means of choice to fulfil the requirement for this particular ESG expertise.

Unlike in 2022, when training and seminars were given greater weight, this year just as many respondents look to board members with a professional background in this area (each category receiving positive responses from 83 per cent of those surveyed).

By contrast, 64 per cent of supervisory board members would call on the expertise of consultants, or are already doing so.

Minor importance however is still given to an academic background when it comes to choosing a supervisory board member with expertise on sustainability (47 per cent), the same as setting up an ESG committee or appointing an individual to oversee ESG matters (43 per cent).

How does your supervisory board intend to address fulfilling the sustainability expertise re- quirements in the future, or how does your supervisory board meet the requirements already?

Assessing the importance of an aptitude for sustainability The following results of our survey underscore the increased importance of sustainability for the work supervisory boards do.

A clear majority of those surveyed (71 per cent) agreed that the importance of an aptitude for sustainability topics on supervisory boards had risen in the past year.

That assessment was shared by the supervisory board members of listed and unlisted companies to virtually the same degree at 70 per cent and 71 per cent, respec- tively.

Another 27 per cent considered the importance unchanged, and only 1 per cent of the surveyed supervisory board members believed that sustainability aptitude had become less important for their work in the previous 12 months.

The supervisory board office Expanding obligations and requirements due to stricter regulations and the growing com- plexity of responsibilities are increasingly putting supervisory board members in a tight spot to organise their work in such a way that they can fulfil their responsibilities.

One way to address these challenges is to set up a supervisory board office.

Depending on a supervisory board's responsibilities, its office can assist both it and the management board in providing information to the supervisory board members or function as the liaison between the two corporate bodies.

According to our survey however, this approach is not yet very widespread.

One reason for this may be the lack of awareness of the advantages of such an office.

A clear majority of the supervisory board members we surveyed responded with 'no' (67 per cent) to the question of whether or not there was a distinct supervisory board office at their company.

Fifty-six per cent of those answers came from listed companies.

How is the supervisory board at your company organised?

Is there a distinct supervisory board office?

2.

Services performed by supervisory board offices When asked about the services that their supervisory board office performed, respondents stated that logistical support (92 per cent) and minute taking (82 per cent) counted among the main tasks.

By a fairly considerable margin, those tasks were trailed by 'assisting with the supervisory board's reporting' (60 per cent), 'assisting with certification and professional development' (43 per cent) and 'advising supervisory board members on technical matters' (21 per cent).

A supervisory board budget The activities performed by supervisory boards entail a wide range of costs and expenses, for which there is no explicit rule, certainly not of a statutory nature, governing their classi- fication.

Because of that, the importance of a distinct budget has risen in the last few years as supervisory boards' responsibilities have expanded.

The reason: more obligations and re- quirements have also meant greater expenditure.

Our study shows however that the majority of supervisory boards surveyed (76 per cent) do not have their own budget.

This is equally true for both listed and unlisted companies (76 per cent and 78 per cent, respectively).

Does the supervisory board at your company have its own budget?

3. Responsibility for the organisation of the supervisory board With regard to the responsibility for their supervisory board's organisation, a clear majority of respondents (61 per cent) stated that this rested with the management board.

Of those responses, 63 per cent came from the members of listed companies' supervisory boards and 58 per cent from their counterparts at unlisted companies.

Thirty-eight per cent said that their supervisory board itself was in charge of its own organisation.

Only 2 per cent of the surveyed supervisory board members responded that an external service provider was taking care of the organisation.

Importance of nomination committees The GCGC recommends that listed companies in particular institute nomination committees that are in charge of preselecting candidates for their supervisory boards.

That committee, according to the GCGC, should ensure that the preselection process is efficient, transparent and confidential.

Even though finding competent people to fill supervisory boards has be- come increasingly challenging in light of additional qualification requirements, the import- ance of nomination committees in the work supervisory boards do has not risen in the last few years however.

An obvious majority (71 per cent) of the supervisory board members surveyed did not attach any increased relevance to nomination committees.

Fifty-eight per cent of those respondents came from listed entities.

Has the importance of the nomination committee at your company grown?

6. Nomination committees' remuneration Remuneration for serving on a nomination committee is an aspect handled in very different ways.

Notable differences are apparent between listed and unlisted companies.

Forty-se- ven per cent of the supervisory board members surveyed said that the members of their nomination committee were not remunerated.

At unlisted companies, that figure is even higher at 59 per cent.

On the other hand, 32 per cent responded that the remuneration for serving on this committee was currently comparable to that for being a member of other committees.

The figures here also showed that listed companies tend to be more willing (41 per cent) to remunerate their nomination committee members.

Another 20 per cent stated that remuneration was given exclusively in the form of an attendance fee, and just 2 per cent said that remuneration was paid only if a certain minimum number of meetings took place in a calendar year.

yes 29% 24 25 D. .Supervisory board efficiency Professionalising supervisory boards also encompasses the regular review of their operations and decision-making processes.

The aim behind this is to bring about a lasting improvement in company supervision.

The GCGC also espouses this goal.

1. Frequency of reviewing supervisory board operations and  decision-making processes Compared to last year, the percentage of surveyed supervisory board members dropped notice- ably who stated that their corporate body is reviewed regularly on an institutionalised basis: 46 per cent in 2023 versus 63 per cent in 2022.

Thirty-one per cent of supervisory board members replied that such a review occurred only irregularly or on an ad hoc basis.

No such evaluation of the board occurs with another 12 per cent of respondents.

The reason for this may be that in many cases a self assessment of the supervisory board had just taken place according to the relevant company's chosen cycle.

Conducting self assessments too frequently involves the risk of them taking on a routine character and the quality of their findings not being entirely meaningful, thereby reducing their efficacy..

How regularly does your supervisory board review its operations and decision-making  processes?

Like in 2022 previously, major differences appeared between listed and unlisted companies with regard to efficiency reviews.

For example, according to the responses from the surveyed supervisory board members, assessing the work and decision-making processes of supervisory boards is institutionalised at 64 per cent of listed companies, while at unlisted companies it is only 28 per cent.

Further, noticeably more respondents from unlisted companies (38 per cent) than listed companies (24 per cent) stated that irregular evaluations were conducted at their companies.

Considering that the GCGC encourages regular efficiency evaluations, it is scarcely surprising that the degree of institutionalisation of such reviews was distinctly higher at listed companies again this year.

2. Performing efficiency evaluations on supervisory boards In principle, there are many ways that a supervisory board can evaluate its efficiency.

Sixty- seven per cent of surveyed supervisory board members stated that their reviews were conduc- ted without external assistance (64 per cent at listed and 71 per cent at unlisted companies).

The remainder indicated that their evaluations were in fact performed with external assistance or sometimes with and sometimes without (16 per cent and 17 per cent respectively).

The added value of efficiency reviews on supervisory boards Seventy-two per cent of the supervisory board members surveyed attest to the (high) import- ance of efficiency reviews.

One-fifth (21 per cent) found them neither important nor unimport- ant or attached little importance to them.

Two per cent even view them as having no added value whatsoever.

Supervisory board members conducting a self-evaluation, in many cases with external support, constitutes a relatively simple and good way of gauging opinions on the quality and the efficiency of the work performed by supervisory boards directly.

Every company answers the question differently, however, how to approach such assessments.

How do you rate the added value of your supervisory board's efficiency reviews?

E. .Summary"
Hengeler Mueller,From Honorary Post to Profession,"Every company answers the question differently, however, how to approach such assessments.

How do you rate the added value of your supervisory board's efficiency reviews?

E. .Summary

After three challenging years in which especially the coronavirus pandemic and managing the effects resulting from it were at the top of supervisory boards' agendas, this year's sur- vey shows once again that the work being done by supervisory boards is clearly orientated towards issues relating to the future.

Sustainability/ESG as well as digitalisation are the issues of the hour and  to little surprise  have no. 1 priority on agendas.

Without a doubt, financial expertise continues to dominate on supervisory boards and will certainly remain one of the core skills needed going forward.

But, with a view to positio- ning companies for the future, obligations and expectations are growing considerably in the fields of sustainability and ESG in particular.

And, in a majority of cases, the expertise of supervisory board members is already adapted to meet these demands.

Consequently however, the focus of the work supervisory boards do is shifting, which has inevitably led to new challenges in their operations and decision-making processes.

In addition, the 2022 revision of the GCGC underlines the expanded requirements for the skills and expertise profiles of supervisory boards.

The changes are of great practical rele- vance and have had a direct impact on the makeup of supervisory boards.

Hence coming up with and publishing a commensurate qualification matrix in order to comply with the skills and expertise profile has taken on decisive importance.

By contrast, additional professionalisation aspects such as the regular assessment of supervisory boards' operations and decision-making processes have currently dropped in priority somewhat, even though those supervisory boards that do conduct efficiency evaluations deem them highly important.

The fact that these reviews are only belatedly finding their way onto supervisory boards' agendas may also have to do with the constant increase in the workload and effort required of supervisory boards to monitor their ma- nagement boards.

Performing mandatory responsibilities and obligations and handling obviously important issues thus have utmost priority.

Mastering this balancing act will certainly remain one of the greatest challenges for supervisory boards.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Bit of Hope for Cartel Leniency - 1st Advent,"November 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR A Bit of Hope for Cartel Leniency  1st

Advent Its that time of the year again, folks!

Looking for the perfect tree, dusting off those Christmas carols sheet music and wondering whether your old nutcracker is still in fashion this year (Apartment Therapy says yes).

If you need a break from the holiday preparations, weve got you covered.

In our four-part December issue, we will mark each Advent with a topic-specific article on: Cartels, State Aid, Merger Control and the Digital Markets Act.

To kick-off the season, well be talking about Cartels this Monday, focusing on the most recent developments in the field of leniency.

Cartel leniency has long been the crown jewel of DG COMP  in 16 years, it resulted in over 50 cartel decisions, from more than 550 leniency applications.

However, in recent years, the number of new leniency applications declined sharply.

While people appear to disagree as to why that is, some say that the Commissions dedicated  and successful  efforts to promote private enforcement created a perfect storm that inadvertently undermined the EUs and Member States leniency programmes.

In an attempt to revive leniency and cartel enforcement the Commission has taken several counter-measures, with a modern twist on a few tools in its box.

Most recently, the Commission released a new set of FAQs which offer updated guidance on how it handles practical issues that frequently arise in leniency cases, and the Commission has expanded its eLeniency platform to make the communication with leniency applicants less burdensome.

However, there are not only carrots but also sticks.

Both the Commissions whistle- blower tool and the increased number of dawn raids send a message that the risk of cartels being detected and investigated is real, even without leniency.

Below is the state of play with respect to leniency and cartel enforcement in the EU.

Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

November 2022 2 The Rise and Fall of Cartel Leniency The Commission created the leniency programme in 1996 and it proved to be the silver bullet for detecting cartels.

For example, between 2010 and 2017, 23 out of 25 cartels investigated were the result of leniency applications.

By contrast, only 2 investigations resulted from the Commissions own detection work.

We had a look at the figures concerning the evolution of leniency cases between 2010 and 2019, and compared them, here is the result:  Leniency cases registered  

Investigations initiated 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019  Source: European Commission The reason for the drop in leniency cases remains ambiguous, particular because we observe a similar trend in other jurisdictions around the globe.

It may well be that the slump of leniency cases after 2015 has several reasons, including the wide-spread introduction of robust antitrust compliance programmes and the significant investment that companies have made to foster their compliance organizations.

However, there are those who claim that the rise of private litigation in Europe played a  potentially significant  role.

And indeed, the Damages Directive entered the scene in December 2014, just before the downturn in new leniency cases.

And even before, the legal industry had worked to import private antitrust litigation from the U.S., with considerable success.

Were not saying that the number of cartel leniency applications decreased as a direct effect of the damages directive.

Were just looking at the graph, because we like numbers as much as your next antitrust lawyer.

The question remains: Mere coincidence or is there causation?

In 2016, the Commission decided to work on enhancing and diversifying its means of detecting potential cartel cases with high impact on the internal market."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Bit of Hope for Cartel Leniency - 1st Advent,"In 2016, the Commission decided to work on enhancing and diversifying its means of detecting potential cartel cases with high impact on the internal market.

As part of this initiative, since 2017, the Commission has made available on its website a whistle- blowing tool to anonymously submit information on cartels and other anti-competitive practices.

Information received has fed into the Commissions market monitoring activities.

November 2022 3 However, as pointed out by the graph, the numbers did not improve significantly, an aspect flagged by the European Court of Auditors report of 2020, which identified as the way forward a more appropriate detection of infringements.

This was supported in parallel by the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO), which pointed out not only the worldwide and German decline in leniency applications (from 60 to around 10), but also the potential correlation with the sharp increase in private damage claims.

Similarly to the European Court of Auditors, the FCO suggested as a solution the diversification of the investigation toolkit.

Update of the eLeniency Platform To make practicalities easier, in 2019 and just in time for the first lockdown, the Commission launched its eLeniency platform, an online tool to submit statements and documents in leniency and settlement proceedings in cartel and non-cartel cooperation cases.

In September 2022, the Commission updated the platform, which is now working two-ways.

The Commission can now also display documents online that were before only available at the Commissions premises (corporate statements, etc.).

Companies and their representatives can be notified letters and decisions in the context of a cartel leniency procedure, including requests for information.

However, there is a certain degree of reluctance in the legal community regarding eLeniency, particularly due to the lack of understanding of the safeguards it offers.

For this reason, the Commission felt the need to clarify, in its FAQs on Leniency, that, as with the original version of the case file, eLeniency offers the same guarantees in terms of confidentiality and legal protection as the access or notification of such documents at the physical premises of the Commission.

For the moment, the system is voluntary  companies and their legal representatives can continue to use the oral procedure to make statements or to receive access to information at the Commissions on-site premises, if they wish to do so.

But we think this might (at some point in time) signal the phasing out of endless dictating and transcribing at DG COMP offices.

New FAQs for Old Dilemmas The Commission published in October 2022 its FAQs on Leniency, providing further transparency, predictability and accessibility to potential leniency applicants and encouraging them to use the procedure.

The Commission itself has acknowledged that potential applicants are nowadays faced with a more complex leniency landscape, in the context of which some additional guidance could be helpful.

In a nutshell, the guidance includes clarifications on the application of the Leniency Notice and details on the legal protections and benefits that the leniency programme offers.

It also sets out new practical arrangements, such as clearly identified Leniency Officers that companies or their legal representatives can contact for informal advice on leniency or for guidance on submitting a leniency application.

And last but not least, it signals the Commissions intention to discuss potential leniency applications on a no- names basis, without the need to disclose the sector, the parties involved or any other November 2022 4 details identifying the potential cartel.

This will allow potential applicants to ascertain whether the conduct at stake is likely to be considered as a secret cartel and whether reporting it to the Commission would entitle them to benefit from the programme."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Bit of Hope for Cartel Leniency - 1st Advent,"This possibility will be particularly useful if the conduct is novel or if it is unclear whether it falls within the scope of the Leniency Notice.

Also, as an additional practical tool, it is now possible to contact the Leniency Officer to ask whether immunity is available for the cartel that the potential applicants are involved in.

No Place to Hide  Stepping up Dawn Raids

The Commission saw the silver lining in the pandemic and decided that it needed to shake things up if it was to still be taken seriously when it came to cartels.

So it doubled down on dawn raids, sharpening one of the pencils in its toolbox.

And were not talking about your run-of-the-mill dawn raids.

We are talking about raiding private homes of firms executives, a practice rarely used in the past.

The Commission argued that due to the pandemic, work from home has become a main- stream practice.

Which meant that sensitive documents would inevitably end up on peoples kitchen tables.

The first recent dawn raid of this type took place in April 2022, followed by a Commission press conference detailing the raid and promising more dawn raids at private premises to follow, in parallel to raids carried out at the business itself.

Although dawn raids at the companys premises and at home are governed by different sets of procedural safeguards, the April raid signalled a more determined take on cartel detection from the Commissions side.1 We understand that, going forward, for privacy reasons, the Commission will no longer make public the dawn raids carried out at private homes.

The Intelligence Unit Another tool in the Commissions toolbox is its open-source intelligence unit, a rather under-the-radar team which uses IT forensics and data processing methods to detect cartel behaviour clues in the public sphere, starting with the Internet.

It has already helped track down cartels in more than 30 cases.

The unit is part of the ex officio means of cartel detection and for understandable reasons Commission officials are reluctant to provide more details on its functioning, but it does seem to have already made a difference since its establishment in 2017.

Dont Shoot the Messenger Since 2017, DG COMP has had a platform to make it easier for individuals (i.e., employ- ees, customers, etc.) to alert the Commission about secret cartels and other antitrust violations while maintaining their anonymity.

The tool protects whistle-blowers ano- nymity through a specifically-designed encrypted messaging system that allows two-way 1 If you want to read more about it, check our April 2022 issue: https://www.hengeler.com/en/service/newsletter/brussels-a-jour-2022-04.

November 2022 5 communications, so that the Commission can ask for additional information or clarifica- tions, in order to increase the likelihood that it can take action based on the information.

The service is run by a specialised external service provider that acts as an intermediary, and which relays only the content of received messages without forwarding any metadata that could be used to identify the individual providing the information.

But apparently that did not yield the desired results from the start  according to the European Court of Auditors report of 2020, the information received was indeed fed into the Commissions market monitoring activities, but by 2020, it had resulted only in one on-site inspection and this did not lead to the opening of formal proceedings.

By the end of 2021, the Commission was receiving approximately 100 relevant messages yearly.

Cartel whistle-blowers have been a sticky topic in the European antitrust world for a while.

Germany has been insisting on enhanced protection for whistle-blowers, but their appeal was not heard in Brussels."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Bit of Hope for Cartel Leniency - 1st Advent,"Germany has been insisting on enhanced protection for whistle-blowers, but their appeal was not heard in Brussels.

Even the European Court of Auditors chimed in in its 2020 report, criticizing the Commissions lack of initiatives regarding other incentives to encourage the reporting of infringements, such as financially rewarding whistle-blowers.

For example, by 2020, reward schemes for whistle-blowers existed in Hungary, Lithu- ania, Slovakia and the (now departed) UK.

Somewhat foreshadowing the late October 2022 publishing of the FAQs on Leniency, the Commissions Olivier Guersent addressed the elephant in the room in early October, admitting that cartel whistle-blowers may need greater protection from civil damages claims in order to boost the number of EU leniency applications.

And with the publishing of FAQs on Leniency, the Commission took the opportunity to clarify the legal protections and benefits that whistle-blowers receive under the Leniency Notice, but also outside of it.

For example, whistle-blowers who report breaches of EU competition rules are guaranteed a high level of protection against various forms of re- taliation (such as dismissal, demotion, etc.)

by their employers under the Whistle-blower Directive.

Furthermore, under the same directive, employers may not prevent an em- ployee from contacting the relevant public authorities.

The Commission also clarified the dynamic between leniency and whistle-blowing: un- dertakings that choose not to report cartel conduct that they have uncovered forego the opportunity to seek immunity and may subsequently face significant fines if the conduct is reported by a whistle-blower, who faces (under EU competition law)

no sanctions, en- joys significant protection and may contact the Commission anonymously.

The Elephant in the Room  Additional Protection for Immunity Applicants

The FAQs on Leniency shed additional light on another sticky point  further protection for leniency applicants outside the leniency programme itself - in an effort to encourage applications.

Here, the Commission elaborates on the fact that the Damages Directive provides protection to leniency applicants against exposure to civil damages, in particular the prohibition to disclose leniency statements submitted to the Commission or an NCA in follow-on cases before national courts of Member States.

Going one step further, the Com- mission itself assists in the protection of such statements in non-EU jurisdictions.

November 2022 6 Also based on the Damages Directive, immunity recipients are only jointly and severally liable to their direct and indirect customers and to other cartel victims only if full com- pensation cannot be obtained from the other cartelists.

In fact, this is a derogation from the rule that co-infringers can be held jointly and severally liable for the entire harm caused by the infringement.

Each of them can be requested to compensate the harm in full and any injured party has the right to require full compensation from any of them until it has been fully compensated.

This derogation granted to immunity recipients is safeguarded by a corresponding protection against claims by other co-cartelists.

We hope you enjoyed our short dip into the world of cartel leniency.

Hengeler Mueller,The Russia-Ukraine war – withdrawing from Russia?,"The reasons for (partially) withdrawing from Russia are manifold.

Such a measure may be necessary, for example, to avoid reputational damage or an expropriation by the Russian government.

The fact that new sanctions must be expected at any time may also prompt companies to give up their business operations in Russia.

What should companies consider when withdrawing from Russia?

Before the withdrawal, companies should ensure that their Russian and non-Russian operations can run autonomously.

To that end, legally separating the Russian activities into individual legal entities through intra-group spin-offs and restructurings may be required.

Intra-group supply and service arrangements may need to be replaced with equivalent business relationships with third-party providers or performed by each individual entity.

This relates not only to the supply of intermediate products for example, but also to administrative tasks, cash-pool financing arrangements and IP and IT issues.

Any know-how and data that is located or stored only in Russia must be ""secured"".

There are a variety of options for structuring how a withdrawal from Russia could take place.

For instance, Russian operations could be transferred to a third party temporarily.

Reliable, long-term business partners in particular should be considered as potential transferees in these scenarios.

The transferee would need to be based in a state Russia deems ""friendly"", like China, India and the United Arab Emirates.

In this case, the state that is selected ideally should have previously concluded a bilateral investment treaty with Russia.

Companies frequently have several options as regards the legal structure.

If a company opts for a foundation or a foundation-like legal form such as a trust, a beneficiary must be named.

However, the beneficiary cannot be the company that is seeking to withdraw from Russia.

By contrast, the options involving intra-group solutions (such as replacing the parent company of Russian subsidiaries with a group subsidiary that is based in a state Russia deems ""friendly"") are limited.

Opting for such a solution entails the risk of it being misinterpreted as an evasion of sanctions or a publicity stunt.

How can companies prepare for possibly reversing their withdrawal?

Companies may, for example, consider leaving open the possibility of buying back their Russian operations using call options once the political situation has improved.

Alternatively, a retransfer covenant could be agreed already at the time of withdrawal.

In addition, companies may also consider granting financial incentives.

For instance, payment of the purchase price could be deferred and the company's shares may be pledged as security for payment of the purchase price.

Caution is advised, however, where sanctions have been imposed on certain business activities.

Keeping the option of a buyback open might be interpreted as a circumvention of sanctions.

Considering these scenarios, how can companies  prevent their businesses from being managed in the interim in a way that is detrimental?

They may consider incorporating binding requirements into the articles of association or into the transfer agreement, but they will need to factor in the risk that these requirements might not be enforceable.

Appointing trustworthy board members and granting financial incentives may therefore be more expedient than taking corporate-law measures.

If payment of the purchase price is deferred, the transferring entity, in its role as the lender, might be granted rights to wield influence.

Financial incentives, too, may be used to incentivise the acquirer to manage the business going forward as successfully as possible, for instance by making the call option price dependent on the value of the Russian business operations at the time the option is exercised.

As the situation is evolving rapidly, our assessment of this issue might change."

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Hard Pill to Swallow,"April 2024 BRUSSELS  JOUR A Hard Pill to Swallow In line with the spirit of the time, it seems that the European Commission has set its sights on the pills industry.

The legit one, that is.

Moving away from its usual take on Article 102 TFEU cases, the Commission is not only targeting the pharma industry with cartel investigations, but also ramping up its antitrust scrutiny.

It seems that the Covid honeymoon is over.

So, can we expect an enforcement overdose in the coming months and years?

Lets discuss. .

An offer one cannot refuse The run-of-the-mill pharma cases so far were the pay-for-delay sagas - where originator and generic companies colluded to keep generics off the market and share the originators profits from doing so.

The poster case Servier (case COMP/39.612) was an artfully crafted case blending an Article 102 TFEU infringement (shutting out a competing technology and buying out competitors that had developed cheaper medicines, to avoid competing on their own merits) with several Article 101 TFEU infringements (each of the settlements between Servier and its generic competitors).

But even so, there is still space to explore.

The latest twist in the Teva case, for instance, occurred in January 2024, with Teva appealing to the Court of Justice (case C-2/24 P) the General Court judgement concerning the Commission fine it had received for striking side- deals with Cephalon to provide Teva with a net gain for dropping a generic challenge to Cephalons blockbuster sleeping-disorder treatment.

More precisely, Teva is challenging the application of the legal test whereby the Commission should have assessed whether there was a plausible alternative explanation for the contractual arrangement.

The Commission has won before the General Court, it remains to be seen what the Court of Justice will think about the case.

Markus Rhrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

April 2024 2 Cartels all the way Cartels in the pharma industry were not exactly the Commissions biggest fish to fry in the last years.

Actually, the relationship between the enforcer and the industry hit an all-time high in April 2020, when the Commission issued its comfort letter regarding cooperation aiming at responding effectively to shortages of medicines in the EU as a result of the Covid outbreak.

However, the tide seems to have turned in the aftermath of the pandemic, including for the pharma industry.

For instance, October 2023 saw the first time that a cartel in the pharma industry was sanctioned by the Commission, and in relation to an active pharma ingredient (case AT.40636).

More precisely, the Commission fined six companies for having coordinated and agreed to fix the minimum sales price to customers of an input material used in the abdominal antispasmodic drug Buscopan and its generic versions.

Also, in October 2023 and respectively March 2024, clinical laboratory Synlab was investi- gated in Portugal and was raided by French antitrust enforcers regarding anticompetitive behavior.

The Portuguese investigation is focusing on illegal exchanges of sensitive infor- mation when negotiating with public health authorities for prices of Covid test kits, as well as no-poaching agreements regarding their workers.

Lie to me The Commissions new focus on cartels in the pharma industry is not the only new blip on the radar.

The enforcer took things one step further and started looking into potentially abusive disparagement  a phenomenon apparently on the rise.

The issue has been tentatively tackled by a French court in 2023, which criticized a 2020 landmark decision from the French competition authority against Roche and Novartis regarding their criticizing their rivals.

Interestingly, the French judgment analyzes the correct enforcement of the concept of abuse of dominance through the lens of the limits of the freedom of expression."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Hard Pill to Swallow,"Interestingly, the French judgment analyzes the correct enforcement of the concept of abuse of dominance through the lens of the limits of the freedom of expression.

On the EU level, since sectoral enforcement concerning abusive disparagement has not exactly worked, the Commission is now considering using the antitrust toolbox via Article 102 TFEU but aiming at more than pay-for-delay.

So far, it has already charged Teva with, amongst other things, communicating doubts regarding the safety of competitors drugs.

In 2022, it also opened an investigation into Vifor Pharma for disparaging a rivals iron treatment, and in which communication commitments are currently being discussed (case AT.40577).

An ongoing informal inquiry into Edwards Lifesciences might also involve allegations of disparagement.

Since abusive disparagement is new territory, the Commission is trying to calm the markets by promising guidance from an antitrust perspective in the near future.

April 2024 3

No pain, no game Also breaking new ground and picking up on its theory of harm developed during the Dow / DuPont merger (case M.7932), the Commission opened an investigation in the field of veterinary-use painkillers regarding an abuse of dominant position through discontinuing R&D of a pipeline drug.

More precisely, in 2017 Zoetis purchased Nexvet Biopharma, which included the acquisition of a pipeline product called ranevetmab, for treating pain in dogs with osteoarthritis.

Zoetis said at the time that, if approved, this would become the industrys first injection-based pain treatment for the disease.

However, after acquiring Nexvet, Zoetis developed rane- vetmab for two years but then terminated it, focusing its attention instead on a separate drug that ended up as Librela, now its market-leading treatment for canine osteoarthritis pain.

The discontinued drug was due to be commercialized exclusively in the EU by a third company.

The Commission is concerned that Zoetis may have engaged in exclusionary behavior by terminating the development of this alternative pipeline product and refusing to transfer this pipeline medicine to the third party which had exclusive commercialization rights in the EU (case AT.40734).

It is the first time the Commission looks into suspicions around blocking a pipeline product set to be commercialized by another company.

No news on the western front?

Looking back, it seems that the recent investigations can hardly be considered an unex- pected development.

For example, in January 2024, the Commission published its second four-year report con- cerning the enforcement of EU antitrust and merger rules by the Commission and the national competition authorities in the pharma sector for 2018-2022.

The latest report confirms that (especially during the pandemic) it was the active enforce- ment of antitrust and merger rules that kept the prices down and the medicines innovative.

Overall, since 2018, the Commission and the national competition authorities adopted 26 decisions in the field of anti-competitive agreements and cases of abuse of dominant position, imposing fines of over EUR 780 million.

The anti-competitive practices concerned harmed innovation and prices and included: the misuse of the patent system and abusive litigation to prolong patent exclusivity, the disparagement of a competitors products to protect the dominant companys sales, pay-for-delay agreements, and excessive prices charged for off-patent medicines.

In terms of mergers, the Commission reviewed more than 30 mergers in the pharma sector and found concerns in five cases, where mergers could have led to price increases, patients and national health systems being deprived of some medicines, or a reduction in innova- tive efforts to develop new medicines.

The Commission cleared four of these mergers only after the companies offered remedies to address the Commissions concerns and preserve the existing degree of competition."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: A Hard Pill to Swallow,"The Commission cleared four of these mergers only after the companies offered remedies to address the Commissions concerns and preserve the existing degree of competition.

One case was abandoned after the Commission raised initial competition concerns.

April 2024 4 Health is wealth While the number of live cases is certainly going to keep us entertained for the coming months, it is the newly launched concepts that will be the talk of the town.

The Commis- sions loose handling of the abusive disparagement concept and its alleged propensity to extend it to other medical fields, for instance, will likely see it on a collision course with the European Court of Human Rights, sooner or later, concerning the limits of the freedom of expression.

And the Commissions take on the Zoetis case will see the industry fighting back for control over its R&D decision-making process.

Hengeler Mueller,Germany‘s draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions,"February 2023 1 LEGAL UPDATE | DISPUTE RESOLUTION Germanys draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions On February 16 2023, the Federal Ministry of Justice has published its draft1 to implement the EU Representative Actions Directive2 (""Directive"").

Until the very end, the Draft law was subject of intense discussions between the coalition parties.

In the meantime, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Germany for failing to transpose the Directive into national law on time.3

The Draft law will now go through the further legislative process.

The new regulations are to be applied starting June 25, 2023.

The Draft law will result in a reorganisation of the German collective redress system, which has to date only been rudimentary.

The core of the draft is the ""Act on the Enforcement of Consumer Rights"" (VDuG-E), which implements the Directive regarding a representative action for performance.

Since the model declaratory action, which was only introduced in 2018, has not proven to be particularly prolific, the new representative action is intended to eliminate significant deficits of the current legal protection system.

Unlike the model declaratory action, which only allows the courts to make legal determina- tions applicable to a large number of plaintiffs, the VDuG-E introduces the option of filing a representative action for performance (such as the payment of damages).

The performance sought with a representative action should benefit consumers directly, without them having to initiate additional individual proceedings.

Consumer protection associations first and foremost will be entitled to file representative actions.

The entity bringing the action can choose whether to seek a redress measure, an injunctive measure, or merely declaratory relief under the rules applicable to the model declaratory action.

The Capital Markets Model Case Act (Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz, ""KapMuG""), limited until the end of 2023, will (at least initially) remain in place alongside the VDuG-E. 1 Draft law of the Federal Ministry of Justice, Draft law on the Implementation of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 on Representative Actions for the Protection of the Collective Interests of Consumers and Repealing Directive 2009/22/EC (""Draft law"").

I. Prerequisites for the new representative action 1.

Broad scope of applicability The Directive limits the mandatory scope of application of the representative action to in- fringements of certain provisions of European consumer protection law (in particular in the areas of data protection, financial services, energy, environment, telecommunication, health, digital services and product liability)."
Hengeler Mueller,Germany‘s draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions,"The German ministerial draft goes well beyond these provisions and extends the scope of application of representative actions to include all civil law disputes between traders and consumers (cf. Sec. 1 (1) VDuG-E).

Thus, claims in tort would also be covered under the new law.

This reflects what has been the legal situation to date with regard to the model declaratory action, while expanding the scope of application for actions for injunctions under the German Act on Injunctive Relief (Unterlassungsklagegesetz).

In addition, actions brought by capital market investors could also fall within the scope of the new legislation.

To date, these were governed solely by the KapMuG. The Draft law does not address the issue of a potential competition between the VDuG-E and the KapMuG. In any event, it seems conceivable that issuers may see themselves confronted with not just capital investor model case proceedings, but also with redress actions for damages.

Furthermore, as the agreement between the current German Governments coalition partners already provides, the representative action will also be available to small busi- nesses.

According to the definition in the Draft law, small businesses are businesses with less than 50 employees and with an annual turnover or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR ten million (cf. Sec.

1

(2) VDuG-E).

An intrinsic right of trade associations to file representative actions is not provided for in the current version of the Draft law.

2. ""Similarity of the claims Pursuant to the Draft law, one of the central requirements for a representative action to be admissible is that claims filed under the representative action must be similar (gleichartig) (Sec. 15 (1) VDuG-E).

Claims are deemed to be similar if they are based on the same or comparable facts, and the same factual issues and questions of law are relevant for the decision regarding such claims (Sec. 15 (1) nos.

1, 2 VDuG-E).

Accord- ing to the Draft laws explanatory memorandum, a degree of similarity is required that allows for a ""template-like""(schablonenhaft) examination of the claims.

To illustrate the required similarity, the Draft law lists as examples (1) compensation claims asserted under the European Air Passenger Rights Regulation for one and the same flight and Content I. Prerequisites for the new representative action  2 II.

The explanatory memorandum does not consider claims to be similar, however, if they become time-barred at different points in time or if they are based to a decisive extent on the knowledge of the relevant consumer.

Similarity of claims is also deemed to be lacking if not all products of a series are defective, and if it has to be clarified in each individual case whether the relevant product purchased is actually defective or not (cf.

Draft law, p. 78).

It will be interesting to see how the German courts will interpret the similarity require- ment.

The explanatory memorandum suggests a narrow understanding of the term.

The fact that the memorandum refers specifically to air passenger compensation claims, where individual case-related considerations are hard to imagine, shows the difficul- ties involved in this similarity determination.

In principle, German courts will have to examine each consumers claim separately in order to assess similarity.

The question which standard of similarity will be applied, will foreseeably become an issue to be dealt with by the European Court of Justice in view of its importance for the efficient conduct of proceedings.

Hengeler Mueller,Germany‘s draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions,"4

If the claims are not similar, plaintiffs could opt in favour of filing a model declaratory action or enforcing their claims by way of de facto class actions, as for instance has already been the practice through assignment models.

In addition, the filing of several representative actions  each with narrowly defined consumer groups  is also possible in order to ensure similarity.

Pursuant to Sec. 13 (1) VDuG-E and Sec.

260 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, ""ZPO""), several representative actions may be pursued jointly by way of aggregating the claims.

3.

Entities entitled to bring an action Only registered qualified consumer associations are entitled to bring representative actions (Sec. 2 (1) no. 1 VDuG-E).

Associations must have as members at least 350 consumers or ten associations from the same field of activity.

Likewise, the association must have been registered as a qualified entity for four years.

The statutory purpose of the association must be to safeguard consumers interests.

Associations must not aim at making a profit and may not receive more than 5% of their financial resources through business donations.

Qualified entities from other Member States may have legal standing for the purpose of cross-border representative actions if they are entered in the European Commissions register of representative actions (cf. Sec.

2 (1) no. 2 VDuG-E).

4. Registration with the register of representative actions (opt-in)

In line with the legal position to date, the Draft law provides for an ""opt-in"" mechanism.

The affected consumers will not automatically become part of a representative action, but must actively sign up with the Representative Actions Register in order to join a representative action (Sec. 46 VDuG-E).

This does not come as a surprise.

While the Directive does allow for the possibility of introducing an opt-out model along the lines 4

The Directive emphasises that the national rules on the similarity of claims should not hamper the effective functioning of the procedural mechanism for representative actions required by the Directive (recital 12, fourth sentence).

This is due to the German civil-law principle that the parties to the proceedings have freedom of disposition over the proceedings and the subject matter of the dispute (the Dispositionsmaxime).

If the representative action is dismissed by the court, consumers are bound by their opt-in decision and can no longer bring individual actions in the same matter (cf. Sec.

11 (3) VDuG-E).

According to the Draft law, any opt-in by consumers must have taken place by the end of the last day before the first oral hearing.

The Draft law opted in favour of a busi- ness-friendly provision in this respect.

Significantly later registrations were discussed initially, for example even after a settlement is reached or a judgment is issued.

Being able to register at a later stage would allow consumers to wait for the proceedings to progress and to join the representative action only if proceedings are developing posi- tively.

According to the Draft law, such an opportunistic registration is to be excluded.

5. Filing representative actions in different jurisdictions With the implementation of the Representative Actions Directive in all EU Member States, consumer associations will have the opportunity to sue companies in different countries."
Hengeler Mueller,Germany‘s draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions,"Entities with legal standing will be able to file representative actions outside their own Member State of domicile or together with entities with legal standing in other Member States (as joined parties).

Additionally, companies in other jurisdictions may also be confronted with claims asserted by associations based in those jurisdictions.

Representative actions with a foreign element come into consideration specifically in relation to tort claims.

For such claims, not only the court at the companys registered office is competent, but also the court at the place where the harm arose (Erfolgsort).

Thus, a claim can be filed wherever damage has occurred.

The requirements and mechanisms of representative actions vary significantly between EU Member States.

In cases involving cross-border liability claims, German companies should therefore be aware that they may be confronted with a representative action in another Member State that is based on a far more plaintiff-friendly regime than that applicable in Germany (for example, in the Netherlands).

The Draft law provides that no further representative action may be brought against the defendant trader relating to the same matter in dispute once judicial proceedings in the representative action have commenced.

This helps prevent parallel proceedings in Germany that relate to the same subject matter from being initiated.

The Draft law does not rule out the possibility of parallel representative actions being conducted in other Member States.

The admissibility of such actions is governed by the procedural law of the other Member State(s).

The Directive merely provides that consumers who have decided to join a representative action cannot ""be represented in other representative actions with the same cause of action and against the same trader"" (Article 9(4) of the Directive).

Envisaged timeline for an action for redress measures 1.

The three phases of the action for redress The Draft law divides the representative action for redress measures into three phases (vgl.  

16 ff. VDuG-E): a) Phase 1: Preliminary judgment on redress In the first phase, the court examines whether the plaintiffs claims show the required degree of similarity (cf. Sec.

15 VDuG-E).

If the claims are similar, liability is then assessed on the merits of the claims.

If the court deems there to be liability, it issues a preliminary judgment on redress (Abhilfegrundurteil).

In the preliminary judgment on redress, the court sets out the specific criteria ac-

cording to which the eligibility of individual consumers is determined.

The court also determines what evidence the individual consumer must provide to prove the eligibil- ity requirements designated by the court.

If the action for redress measures seeks a collective total amount, the preliminary judgment will also determine the amount due to each eligible consumer.

If the amounts due to the eligible consumers are different, the judgement determines the method to be used to calculate the individual amounts due to the eligible consumer.

b) Phase 2: Settlement After that, the Draft law provides for a phase in which the litigating parties are given the opportunity to agree on a settlement (Sec. 17 VDuG-E).

The parties shall submit a written settlement proposal to the court on the basis of the preliminary judgment on redress.

The subject of the settlement shall be a mutually agreed upon verification and distribution system for the implementation of the preliminary judgment on re- dress."
Hengeler Mueller,Germany‘s draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions,"The subject of the settlement shall be a mutually agreed upon verification and distribution system for the implementation of the preliminary judgment on re- dress.

The explanatory memorandum points out as an advantage that companies will thereby be able to influence not only the implementation of the preliminary judgment on redress, but also the costs arising from the settlement (cf.

Draft law, p. 81).

If the parties do not reach an agreement, the court will issue a final judgment on re- dress (Abhilfeendurteil  cf.

Sec.

18 VDuG-E).

In that judgment, the court may order the defendant company to pay a specific collective total amount or it may order im- plementation proceedings (Umsetzungsverfahren) aimed at satisfying the plaintiffs.

If the Draft law is enacted, the plaintiffs will have the burden of demonstrating in concrete terms the amount of their total loss (cf.

Draft law, p. 84).

According to the explanatory memorandum, an extract from the Register of representative actions can show how many consumers are registered.

Additionally, the amount of the claim must be substantiated in concrete terms.

Following commonly accepted legal principles, the court is authorised pursuant to Sec.

287 ZPO to estimate the loss.

In determining the specific collective total amount, the court may also assume that all claims asserted by the plaintiffs are fully justified.

The respective individual claims will only be examined at the stage of the implementation proceedings.

If individual claims turn out to be unjustified, any excess amount is to be reimbursed to the defendant afterwards.

This tends to be a business-friendly provision.

In other jurisdictions, such ""unclaimed funds"" often fall to charitable organisations.

2. Allocation mechanism The courts judgment on redress is to be carried out by a trustee (Sachwalter) appointed for that task by the court (Secs.

22 et seqq.

VDuG-E).

The trustee sets up an ""implemen- tation fund"" (Umsetzungsfonds), in which the defendant is required to deposit the total amount of damages plus procedural costs (Sec. 25 VDuG-E).

The trustee then verifies whether the registered consumers meet the criteria set out in the preliminary judgment on redress (cf. Sec.

27 (1) nos.

3, 4 VDuG-E).

Where a consumer provides the required evidence, they receive a payment out of the implementation fund.

In the case of other consumer claims, the trustee shall request the defendant to fulfil the specific individual claim, such as making repairs or supplying defect-free products, and sets a reasonable deadline to do so (cf. Sec.

27 (1) no. 5 VDuG-E).

If the trustee rejects the objection, or if a claim is not or only partially fulfilled, the consumer shall be able to pursue that claim, insofar as it still exists, in an individual action after the implementation proceedings have ended (Sec. 39 VDuG-E).

If the consumer was unfairly awarded damages in the implementation proceedings, companies must initiate individual recovery proceedings (Sec. 40 (1) VDuG-E).

In those situations, the German law on unjust enrichment applies.

This could lead to an additional burden on companies with consumer solvency risks that are difficult to calculate.

III.

Funding representative actions The amendment to the law leaves it unclear how consumer associations are to finance a proper conduct of proceedings.

For lawyers, representing an association on the basis of statutory fees will probably not be attractive.

The principles underlying the fee calculation are derived, pursuant to Sec.

18 (1) no. 5 VDuG-E, Sec.

91 ZPO, from the principles set forth in the ZPO and/or the German Court Fees Act (Gerichtskostengesetz) and the German Act on the Remuneration of Law- yers (Rechtsanwaltsvergtungsgesetz).

The amount in dispute in a representative action is capped at EUR 500,000.

For fees calculated on the basis of this amount in dispute, it is hardly possible for a lawyer (let alone a team of lawyers) to manage complex and lengthy collective proceedings properly.

Additional remuneration, such as an agreement on hourly rates, is legally possible for the consumer protection associations.

However, the question arises as to where the funds for such remuneration are to come from, especially since that remuneration cannot be recov- ered from the defendant even if the action is successful.

The possibility of third parties funding representative actions likewise appears impractical according to the current version of the draft.

Third-party funding is allowed under Sec. 4 (2) VDuG-E provided that (i) the litigation funder is not a competitor of or controlled by the defendant company, and (ii) that the litigation funder will not influence how the entity entitled to bring action manages the lawsuit, to the detriment of consumers.

However, consumer associations will generally be unable to offer litigation funders market-conform remuneration in the form of a share in the award amount.

The entire amount claimed is to be disbursed to the consumers if the action is successful (cf. Sec. 18 (1) VDuG-E).

Something different applies to the distribution of profits within the framework of the Ger- man Unfair Competition Act (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb, ""UWG"".

In this context, the new provision of Sec. 10 (6) UWG provides that consumer associations may, under certain conditions, be reimbursed by the Federal Office of Justice (""Bundesamt der Justiz"") for the costs of engaging a litigation financier.

Until the legislator provides other ways of at least covering the costs of litigation (through additional public funds, for instance), the path for most consumer associations to bring numerous and/or major representative actions will probably be blocked for the time being.

Suspension of limitation periods Actions for redress measures and model declaratory actions trigger a suspension of limita- tion periods for consumers who have effectively registered in the Register of actions (Sec. 204a (1) nos.

3, 4 of the new version of the German Civil Code (Brgerliches Gesetzbuch, ""BGB"")).

This is consistent with the law to date in relation to model declaratory actions.

The limitation period is also suspended by representative actions in other Member States if consumers participate in them (Sec. 204a (2) BGB).

Representative actions for injunctive measures have a far-reaching suspensive effect on limitation periods (Sec. 204a (1) no. 2 BGB).

To date, the requirement has been either that claims for injunctive relief must be pursued individually or that at least the preparations for pursuing such claims must be done individually.

The Draft law now removes this require- ment: any impact on the consumer by a contested infringement is sufficient to suspend the limitation period (cf.

Draft law, p. 112).

Unlike in actions for redress measures, in a representative action for injunctive measures consumers are not required to declare their intent to participate in the action, for example by registering with the Register of representative actions.

According to Sec. 5 (2) VDuG-E, the required impact on consumers would be established solely on the basis of a ""brief description"" of the underlying situation of fact.

It is debatable whether and to what extent this mechanism will prove to be practical and help provide legal certainty.

The limitation period for claims will be suspended for a potentially indeterminate group of consumers.

For companies against which such claims are asserted, the legal certainty associated with the statute of limitations is thus drastically reduced.

V. Disclosure of evidence It is the plaintiffs responsibility to present the facts favourable to the action and to obtain relevant evidence.

In the past, this burden has proven to be a considerable hurdle for con- sumer plaintiffs.

The Directive therefore suggests more far-reaching rules on the disclosure of evidence.

The Federal Governments Draft law, however, provides for only modest changes to the current law.

An expansion of disclosure duties is not provided for.

It therefore remains the case, as applicable law has allowed to date, that a court can only order a party to produce certain, precisely specified evidence.

Sec. 6

(1) and (2) VDuG-E do however newly provide that the failure to comply with a dis- closure order can be sanctioned with a fine of up to EUR 250,000, which can be imposed more than once.

Whether or not the possibility of a fine will in fact make a difference remains to be seen.

VI.

Perspective and assessment It seems doubtful that the new law will actually lead to a noticeable reduction in the work- load of the German justice system.

Legal standing is limited to not-for-profit associations, which do not have the option of involving commercially-minded lawyers and litigation Content I. Prerequisites for the new representative action  2 II.

Therefore, both law firms representing plaintiffs as well as for-profit litigation funders will likely continue to have incentives to pursue claims (additionally) through assignment models or by bundling a large number of plaintiffs as co-joined litigants.

A considerable hurdle for representative actions will likely be the narrow interpretation of the requirement in the Draft law that asserted claims be similar."
Hengeler Mueller,Germany‘s draft law on the introduction of representative consumer actions,"A considerable hurdle for representative actions will likely be the narrow interpretation of the requirement in the Draft law that asserted claims be similar.

If claims are not similar, the plaintiffs, as has been the case to date, would have to file a model declaratory action and have their claims subsequently enforced by way of individual actions for damages.

Liability risks for companies are nevertheless exacerbated by the new legal protection regime.

For similar claims (such as claims arising under the GDPR because of data leaks), companies may be facing significant amounts of damages due to potentially very high numbers of affected consumers.

The judicial estimation of damages and the open ques- tions surrounding limitation periods will lead to noticeable liquidity burdens and legal uncertainties for companies, in particular with regard to provisions.

From the defendant companys perspective, the amount of damages will be unclear until all of the claims have been satisfied.

The judicial estimation of damages is only preliminary and can be increased if the amount is insufficient.

The publication of the Draft law was preceded by a significant debate between the coalition parties, in particular regarding the timing of the registration, the requirements for entities entitled to bring an action and the statute of limitations.

These and further issues have not yet been resolved within the coalition.

There remains considerable potential for political conflict.

Therefore, (short-term) changes cannot be ruled out.

It remains to be seen how the legislative process will develop.

Hengeler Mueller,Start-ups and Employee Equity Grants: All Good Thanks to the Future Financing Act?,"For the first time, start-ups will be able to provide employees, who are subject to German taxation, with free or discounted true-equity grants under favorable tax conditions.

This is the bottom line of an amendment to the German Income Tax Act (GITA) that took effect on 1 January 2024.

Start-ups can be at a disadvantage because they are not able to offer international salaries for talented individuals on a par with international corporations.

To compensate for this, they frequently make employee equity grants that come with a deferred opportunity – albeit dependent on the company's success – to participate in the proceeds of a subsequent trade sale or IPO.

There is a problem, however: according to a study by venture capital firm Index Ventures, the regulatory framework for employee equity grants in Germany is amongst the worst in the world.

Although making employee equity grants may not be the easiest exercise under complex German corporate law, the real hurdle is unattractive tax treatment.

The taxation of so-called ""dry income"" plays a key role: if employee equity grants are made free of charge, or at a reduced price, the employee receives a non-cash benefit amounting to the difference between the fair market value of the equity grant and the payment made for it (if any), which is subject to income tax at the time the grant is issued.

The employee must therefore pay tax on this non-cash benefit without simultaneously receiving any money that could be used to pay the tax liability.

To avoid these disadvantages, the German start-up ecosystem has often resorted to granting virtual shareholdings (VSOPs).

However, VSOP payments qualify as part of an individual’s salary and are therefore taxed at the (typically higher) rate of personal income tax.

VSOPs are also an unusual, makeshift construct in an international context.

For these reasons, among others, virtual shareholdings are unattractive, especially for much sought-after international talent.

The previous government attempted to resolve this unsatisfactory situation by introducing a special regulation to incentivize employee participation in start-ups.

Under this regulation, introduced on 1 July 2021, taxation is initially ""deferred"" if a start-up makes discounted or free employee equity grants and the non-cash benefit is only taxed when certain events occur.

However, German start-ups have made virtually no use of the incentive since its introduction due to serious shortcomings.

Primarily, this is seen as an overly narrow scope, which excludes the majority of fast-growing start-ups, as well as compulsory retrospective taxation upon termination of the employment contract, or after 12 years since the grant, which leads to dry income taxation.

The Future Financing Act amends the special tax regime with effect from 1 January 2024.

The scope of its application will be significantly expanded, meaning that fast-growing start-ups and scale-ups (with fewer than 1,000 employees and an annual turnover of no more than EUR 100 million, or an annual balance sheet total of no more than EUR 86 million at the time the grant is made, or in one of the six preceding years and not founded more than twenty years before the grant) will also be able to benefit from the incentive.

In addition, retrospective taxation leading to dry income can be avoided if the start-up assumes liability for income tax.

Retrospective taxation will only take place when the employee disposes of the grant, i.e., typically upon exit.

At this point in time, the employee also receives proceeds from the sale giving them the necessary liquidity to pay the taxes.

By carefully structuring the employee equity programs, the start-up can ensure that the tax liability is actually repaid and so avoid disadvantages for itself.

As a result, dry income is no longer taxed."
Hengeler Mueller,Start-ups and Employee Equity Grants: All Good Thanks to the Future Financing Act?,"As a result, dry income is no longer taxed.

From a tax perspective, employee equity grant programs are now much more attractive for employees as the increase in value after the grant that is realized upon an exit is subject to a capital gains tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable).  

Proceeds from a VSOP, on the other hand, are subject to significantly higher taxation at the personal income tax rate.

The extended scope will also enable a significantly larger number of start-ups to make use of this option.

However, the issue of valuing the equity grants remains unresolved, albeit an under-valuation of employee grants will no longer result in taxation of dry income, but will only have a tax impact at the time of exit.

In future, there will be various ways of structuring equity grants.

In order to grant ""real"" company shares that are well-known and attractive in an international context, it makes sense to utilize proven structures such as pooling vehicles – for example, in the form of a German limited liability partnership ( GmbH & Co. KG ).

Using the tax advantages of Section 19a GITA, shares could be granted and transferred in a comparatively flexible manner without overburdening the corporate governance of a start-up with many immediate shareholders.

Start-ups that already have virtual participation programs in place should nevertheless consider the revised version of Section 19a GITA and its consequences.

Under certain circumstances, an existing virtual participation program can be converted into equity grants making use of Section 19a GITA.

Virtual participation programs could also potentially be left untouched in principle or ""capped"" for further increases in value, and beneficiaries could be granted ""real"" employee shares within the scope of Section 19a GITA to participate in future increases in value."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Night Train to…Nowhere,"August 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Night Train toNowhere The appeal filed against the General Courts judgment in the Lithuanian Railways case gave Advocate General Rantos the opportunity to analyse the so-called Bronner criteria for the classification of a refusal to supply by a dominant undertaking as an abusive practice.

While the Court of Justices judgment is still pending, stay with us, this one is a real page-turner.

When it removed a 19km stretch of railway tracks to the border with Latvia, little did LG (the Lithuanian national railway company) know that it would leave its mark on EU competition law.

What came to be known as the Lithuanian Railways case is now testing the boundaries of the essential facilities doctrine, established in Bronner,1 against a set of facts which can occur more frequently than one would think.

We are taking a look at the history of the case through the lens of Advocate General Rantos.2

Facts and Figures

The facts of the case gravitate around the trendy world of trains.

More precisely, LG concluded an agreement in 1999 with Orlen, a company specializing in refining crude oil and distributing refined oil products.

The object of the agreement was the transport of the vast majority of the oil products resulting from Orlens refinery in Lithuania to the Lithuanian sea ports, while the remainder was transported also by rail to and through Latvia for internal consumption on the Baltics market.

For the latter category, LG concluded a contract with LDZ (the Latvian national railway company), which also included the Lithuanian sector, under a subcontracting agreement with LG.

Following a dispute regarding rates between LG and Orlen, the latter considered contracting directly with LDZ for rail transport services of the internal consumption 1 Case C7/97, Oscar Bronner, 26 November 1998, ECLI:EU:C:1998:569.

Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

Orlen made its intentions known to LG, which resulted in arbitration proceedings against Orlen, as well as LGs unilateral termination of the 1999 agreement.

In parallel, Orlen requested a quotation from LDZ along the lines of its new transport plans.

A few weeks later, LG, after identifying a defect in the rail track to Latvia caused, according to technical reports, by physical deterioration of rail elements, undertook the complete removal of the track.

Orlen continued negotiations with LDZ, during which it concluded a new agreement with LG.

However, discussions with LDZ were discontinued when it became apparent that LG had no intention to repair the track.

Orlen filed a formal complaint with the Commission, which concluded in its subsequent decision that LG had abused its dominant position as railway infrastructure manager in Lithuania by removing the track.

The Commission noted that in so doing, LG had excluded the competing operator from Latvia.

LG challenged the Commission decision before the General Court, arguing  in essence that the Commission should have treated LGs conduct as a refusal of access to an essential facility (the railway system) and, accordingly, should have applied the essential facilities doctrine as established in Bronner.

The reason behind LGs insistence on having Bronner (and the essential facilities doctrine) applied is the high evidentiary standard which it imposes, as compared to other forms of abuses.

If LG could frame the case in those terms, it would have an easier legal defense than if the case was judged as a straightforward competition abuse."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Night Train to…Nowhere,"If LG could frame the case in those terms, it would have an easier legal defense than if the case was judged as a straightforward competition abuse.

In particular, LG argued that the facts did not meet the indispensability prong of the Bronner test because there was an alternative route to Latvia (though longer than the dismantled track).

The General Court dismissed all pleas, but lowered the amount of the fine.

Subsequently, LG filed an appeal before the Court of Justice, which is still pending.

However, the (non-binding) opinion of Advocate General Rantos was published on 7 July, shedding light on the core issues of the case.

Bronners Cube One of the main takeaways of Rantoss opinion is the fact that the Bronner test is here to stay, if there was ever any doubt about it after cases like Google Shopping.3 In short, the test says that a dominant undertaking is obliged to grant access to its own essential infrastructure only if the following cumulative conditions are met: (i) its refusal is likely to eliminate all competition on the relevant market, (ii) its refusal cannot be objectively justified and (iii) the access is in itself indispensable for carrying on the persons business.

Rantos spells it in capital letters that the test is still relevant nowadays.

Rantos specifically recalls and reaffirms the rationale for applying a particularly strict test and high evidentiary burden where the (allegedly) abusive conduct concerns that refusal of access to an essential facility.

In particular, Rantoss opinion reminds us that, as a 3 Case T-612/17, Google and Alphabet v Commission, 10 November 2021, ECLI:EU:T:2021:763.

August 2022 3 starting point, undertakings  whether dominant or not  have a right to contract and dispose of their property as they deem fit and that the Bronner test serves to protect that very (constitutional) right.

Second, Bronner seeks to promote competition in the long term, in the interest of consumers, by allowing a company to reserve for its own use the facilities that it has developed and thus preserving that companys incentives to invest in the construction of these facilities in the first place.

The Bronner Junction  First Stop: Refusal of Access Rantos goes to great lengths in his explanation of the Bronner criteria, in order to shed more light on the nuances of the test, in particular in terms of types of conduct that it applies to (refusal of access) and the limitations that follow from the rationale underlying the Bronner test (objectives of the Bronner criteria).

First, for Bronner to apply, the conduct in question has to amount to a refusal to grant access to essential facilities.

That refusal can be explicit or implied (constructive or de facto).

The issue that Rantos considers in this context is in which circumstances conduct that does not amount to an explicit refusal of access but may raise issues common to such a refusal (i.e. which may have a similar effect) qualifies as a (implicit or constructive) refusal of access for purposes of the Bronner test, as opposed to an (other) independent form of abuse distinct from a refusal of access that should not benefit from the higher evidentiary burden established by Bronner.

Rantos concludes that the removal of the 19km of rail tracks fell into the latter category.

Rantos sums up the main differences between a genuine refusal to grant access and other types of Article 102 TFEU which may have the same exclusionary effect, namely:  

In cases of a genuine refusal to supply, the dominant undertaking reserves its exclusive right of access and does not suffer loss of infrastructure, while in the current case by destroying the infrastructure it intended to harm its competitors.

As such, according to Rantos, LGs conduct was only motivated by the willingness to harm competition;  LGs conduct followed a pure logic of predation."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Night Train to…Nowhere,"As such, according to Rantos, LGs conduct was only motivated by the willingness to harm competition;  LGs conduct followed a pure logic of predation.

According to Rantos, the only rational explanation for LGs conduct was the monopoly reward that it would be able to reap by excluding LDZ from the market (similar to predatory pricing cases).

That logic is different from a genuine refusal to grant access under Bronner;  The very logic of Bronner is based on maintaining infrastructure, by means of preserving the owners incentives to invest in that infrastructure.

LGs destruction of the rail tracks is inconsistent with that logic;  The consequence of finding a Bronner type of abuse has the consequence of requiring the dominant undertaking to conclude a contract (to grant access), while in the Lithuanian Railways case, the Commission merely ordered LG to bring the infringement to an end, without ordering the conclusion of a contract.

August 2022 4 The Bronner Junction  Second Stop: Objectives of the Bronner Criteria Second, even if the conduct amounts to a genuine refusal to grant access (explicit or implicit), Bronner will only apply if the rationale justifying the preferential treatment under the Bronner test are present.

LG had argued that Bronner did not establish such an implied requirement.

However, according to Rantos the Bronner test should generally apply only:  

In cases where the infrastructure to which access is sought is owned by the dominant undertaking and has been financed with its own investment.

In the case at hand, the railway tracks were not LGs property and LG had not undertaken any investments in the construction and development of the Lithuanian railway structure (which was financed by public funding);  

In the absence of a regulatory obligation imposed on the undertaking in order to grant access to its infrastructure, which was not the case here, since LG was obligated, inter alia, to grant access to the public railway infrastructure in its capacity of infrastructure manager.

Next Station is We will certainly keep an eye on the Court of Justices upcoming judgment.

Together with Google Shopping, it paves the way for new categories of discrimination under Article 102 TFEU, especially in the essential facilities space.

Hengeler Mueller,A Beacon of Hope in Stormy Seas,"A core objective of the energy transformation is the switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Offshore wind energy plays a key role in this.

New offshore wind farms are enormous in size: projects planned today will reach several gigawatts of capacity, while onshore wind and solar farms rarely generate more than 100 MW.

Their marginal costs of power generation are lower and the yield of turbines at sea fluctuates due to wind strength less than on land.

The feed-in from offshore wind farms therefore leads to less load volatility in the electricity grid than that from photovoltaics or onshore wind.

This is particularly important as we are phasing out the classic base load-capable generators powered by coal and nuclear energy.

Electricity generated by offshore wind farms is in high demand: the largest electricity consumers such as technology companies, the metal, plastics and chemical sectors, as well as transport and logistics groups, sign long-term, large-volume supply contracts for green electricity, known as Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

This allows wind farm operators to plan their income over many years without state subsidies.

Policy makers have recognised the potential and set ambitious targets for accelerated expansion with the Offshore Wind Act 2023:

The aim is to have 30 GW of generation capacity in the German North Sea and Baltic Sea by 2030, and 70 GW by 2045.

By comparison, just 8 GW has been installed in the past 20 years.

There is intense competition for new offshore wind farm sites: eight sites were awarded in auctions last year.

The four largest projects with a combined capacity of 7 GW were secured by two oil companies for a record total of 12.6 billion euros.

In addition to energy companies, interest from financial investors such as infrastructure funds and pension funds, continues unabated.

This broad range of investors is complemented by industrial companies with particularly high energy consumption.

Some of them are not only signing PPAs, but also acquiring equity stakes in projects.

Even in the current interest rate environment, banks are still providing large-scale loans at sufficiently attractive conditions.

With technological arguments on its side, the offshore wind industry receives political support and attracts a broad spectrum of investors.

These should be the optimum conditions for successful projects and growth in the sector.

But those who have been following the news recently may have gathered a different impression.

In the UK and the US, companies have terminated the development of individual projects; a UK government tender for new sites failed to attract a single bid at the auction; leading turbine manufacturers first reported losses and ultimately received government support.

This raises questions: Why did this happen and what needs to be done?

There is not one answer to the first question, but several.

After the coronavirus pandemic, global demand for materials such as steel increased rapidly.

But warehouses were empty and freight capacities limited.

The war in Ukraine exacerbated inflation.

Rising raw material prices increased the cost of manufacturing turbines, foundations and cables.

This hit European manufacturers at a time of great uncertainty about the long-term project pipeline, and they were therefore reluctant to build up production capacities.

And it is not only raw materials that are in short supply, but also highly specialised installation vessels that have been fully booked for years.

There is also a lack of skilled labour to accelerate expansion.

Such distortions in the supply chain are particularly critical for the offshore wind industry because projects are planned years in advance, based on revenue modelling over a project term of up to 35 years."
Hengeler Mueller,A Beacon of Hope in Stormy Seas,"As the German tendering model de facto means that projects no longer receive state subsidies, conclusion of PPAs at an early project phase is a prerequisite for planning security on the revenue side.

The models must also make assumptions about construction and operating costs as well as future interest rates.

They determine the entry price for investors and the bid price that bidders are prepared to pay in the auctions for new project sites.

These prices are fixed at an early stage of the project, while several decisive costs can still diverge significantly from the assumptions.

The planning horizon for offshore wind farms is long-term, in part also because permitting takes a long time – on average, two years for the complex plan approval procedures to be finalised.

Both European and German legislators have recognised the need for action.

As part of its European Wind Power Action Plan , the EU Commission announced in October 2023 that it would improve the speed and predictability of permitting procedures across Europe.

An EU emergency regulation already makes it possible to dispense with the environmental impact assessment.

And the Renewable Energy Sources Act stipulates that wind farms are in the overriding public interest, which gives them priority over other interests.

The auction rules for new sites not only decide who is allowed to secure a project, they also influence costs and viability.

Different criteria apply throughout Europe.

There are two separate procedures in Germany:

The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency examines some sites for their suitability before the auction.

A combination of bid price and qualitative criteria is then used in the auction.

The qualitative criteria measure the contribution to decarbonisation, the amount of electricity already marketed via PPAs, the avoidance of adverse environmental impacts, and the contribution to securing skilled labour.

Sites that have not yet been analysed for their suitability are awarded to the highest bidder.

Both procedures have attracted criticism.

The expediency of some criteria is debatable.

As the rapid expansion and efficient system integration of offshore wind have priority, it would make sense for the award criteria to reflect this.

For example, they could take into account the bidders' track record of projects completed according to plan, or the use of the most suitable turbine technology.

But where the highest bid is the only deciding factor, the winner will always be a bidder which determines its upper bid limit either according to a different logic or based on revenue and cost assumptions that no competitor agree to.

The legislator will nonetheless not rectify the known weaknesses of the auction design before the next auction rounds in 2024.

But after that, it will have to take action – and will be driven to do so by Brussels.

In the European Wind Power Action Plan, the EU Commission has also set itself the task of harmonising the European auction regimes.

It wants to introduce objective, transparent and non-discriminatory qualitative criteria.

So what needs to be done to get the key industry for the energy transition back on track for success?

The strengths of offshore wind energy remain unchanged.

And its potential has not been exhausted: floating wind turbines that are not anchored to the ground by foundations, the bundling of offshore wind farms via Energy Islands and their cross-border integration into the electricity grids, as well as the production of green hydrogen by electrolysis at sea – all these innovations serve as examples for further development to come.

The industry must be restored to a position that plays to its strengths.

To do this, it needs auction procedures that do not encourage risky bets, but instead reward forward-looking planning and realisation security.

Permitting procedures must be efficient and take into account the importance of expanding offshore wind energy."
Hengeler Mueller,A Beacon of Hope in Stormy Seas,"Permitting procedures must be efficient and take into account the importance of expanding offshore wind energy.

Planning security is needed, not only for wind farm operators, but also for their suppliers.

In December 2023, the European Commission, 26 EU Member States and more than 300 companies jointly committed to implementing the measures of the European Wind Power Action Plan in the European Wind Charter .

The initiatives at both an EU and a national level touch on important levers.

They must now be consistently pursued and enhanced and then prove to be effective in practice."
Hengeler Mueller,Sustainability in Practice – Hengeler Mueller's Commitment to a Greener Future,"Sustainability remains an important subject, both in the provision of legal services to our clients and in how we manage our internal business operations.

German companies have a two-tier board system, divided into a management board and a supervisory board.

In cooperation with the German Supervisory Board Working Group ( Arbeitskreis deutscher Aufsichtsrat e.V. ), we conducted a supervisory board survey ( insert link ), in which these supervisory boards identified sustainability awareness as a key issue for their companies.

Environmental awareness and sustainability are also among our firm's top priorities.

Through diverse individual initiatives at specific locations, as well as across all our offices, we work continuously and proactively to reduce our ecological footprint and energy consumption.

This means that our initiatives cover various areas, such as our business travel, resource conservation in our offices and our purchasing decisions.

Our sustainability committee, for example, comprising staff members from all our German office locations, has regularly assessed the sources of our carbon emissions for years, compiling data and developing strategies and measures to offset them.

In addition, the sustainability committee is responsible for making proposals to further improve and promote our planned sustainability efforts.

Furthermore, one way in which we demonstrate our commitment to ecological sustainability is through programmes that we implement together with staff across all our offices: Our German offices are supplied with 'green power'.

With German airline Lufthansa, we have an offset of CO2 emissions based on our bookings integrated into our air travel, and we strive to use carbon-friendly modes of transportation whenever we travel.

We provide bicycles to our staff for greater urban mobility while on business.

We are integrating sustainable solutions into the renovation of our offices.

As part of our efforts towards achieving greater sustainability, we also collaborate with external partners.

One of these partners is a service provider through which we provide an annual amount for carbon offsetting purposes.

HessenForst's reforestation campaign, dubbed ' Unser Wald ' (Our Forest), is another project close to our hearts.

A public enterprise, HessenForst maintains and manages forests throughout the entire state of Hesse.

We support their efforts through an annual financial donation that is our small contribution to preserving the forest ecosystem and to adapting the tree population to withstand climate change.

Thanks to our offsetting service provider and the reforestation campaign, we offset some of the carbon emissions from our operations that cannot reasonably be avoided."

Hengeler Mueller,The Germany-wide digital Competition Register is up and running,"Digitalisation is advancing in public procurement.

In the new digital Competition Register, data on offences that can result in exclusion from tender procedures is now being collected from across Germany.

Entries in the Competition Register can be retrieved by public authorities with just a few clicks, making compliance systems and cooperation with investigative authorities even more important.

In the long run, the importance of the Competition Register will probably not be confined to public procurement.

As is often the case with digitalisation, it can be expected that this digital transformation will also have an impact on other areas.

More than four years have passed since the German legislator decided to introduce a Germany-wide Competition Register to protect competition in public contracts and concessions.

It is designed to facilitate public authorities' review of whether companies must, or can, be excluded from tender procedures due to offences attributed to them.

Since 1 December 2021, German authorities have been obliged to notify certain offences to the Federal Cartel Office ( Bundeskartellamt ), which collects and registers this information.

Simultaneously, public contracting authorities have also been able to access the Competition Register for the first time.

From 1 June 2022, they will be obliged to retrieve the information stored in the Competition Register before awarding a contract above a certain value.

The offences recorded in the Competition Register include: money laundering, corruption, fraud affecting public budgets, the non-payment of social security contributions, tax evasion, violations of both the Act to Combat Clandestine Employment ( Schwarzarbeitsbekämpfungsgesetz ) and the Minimum Wage Act ( Mindestlohngesetz ), as well as cartel infringements and public procurement fraud.

This list will probably be expanded further.

For example, violations of the Supply Chain Act ( Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz ), which comes into force on 1 January 2023, will be registered.

It is also being evaluated whether the EU Commission's antitrust decisions can be included in addition to antitrust decisions taken by the Federal Cartel Office.

Legal infringements of companies and company representatives are registered if there is a conviction by final judgment, a penalty order, or an unappealable decision to impose fines.

Cartel infringements are an exception to the rule.

Due to the typically lengthy appeal proceedings, they are registered at the same time that a fine is imposed.

No automatical exclusion from public procurement procedures An entry in the Competition Register does not automatically result in a company being excluded from public procurement procedures.

This decision will continue to be made based on the nature of the violation recorded in the Competition Register and a prediction about the respective company's legally compliant, proper and diligent performance of the contract.

Corruption and money laundering offences, for instance, result in mandatory exclusion from tender procedures.

In contrast, an exclusion in the event of cartel infringements is at the discretion of the public contracting authorities.

The importance of the Competition Register could extend far beyond public procurement.

Companies may request access to information on the entries in the Competition Register concerning them.

That information notice could become a 'certificate of good standing' for companies.

It must be expected that, in preparing their audit opinions, auditors will request that an information notice be submitted and explanations be given where there are entries.

Furthermore, it is conceivable that contracting partners and investors might do the same in contractual negotiations.

Information on violations of the law is digitally stored in the Competition Register for three or five years, depending on the category of offence."
Hengeler Mueller,The Germany-wide digital Competition Register is up and running,"Information on violations of the law is digitally stored in the Competition Register for three or five years, depending on the category of offence.

Companies that depend on public contracts or concessions, or which need a clean 'certificate of good standing' and therefore want to delete entries from the register earlier than provided for by law, may 'self-clean'.

To delete an entry, they must provide proof that they have actively cooperated with the investigating authorities and the public contracting authorities: by comprehensively clarifying the facts and circumstances associated with the registered offence, that they have undertaken to compensate any damage, taken effective compliance measures, and remedied any default of payments of taxes, charges or social security contributions.

Compliance systems' review Due to the cooperation requirement, companies will have to plan a course for successful 'self-cleaning' at an early stage and prepare themselves to actively cooperate in case an investigation is launched.

Moreover, companies will have to review their compliance systems and adapt them to the standards required by the authorities.

The Federal Cartel Office has provided some guidance.

On 25 November 2021, it published guidelines on the early deletion of an entry from the Competition Register that, among other things, includes indications of compliance standards."
Hengeler Mueller,European Legislation on Protection of Human Rights and the Environment in Chains of Activities adopted by European Parliament,"1 May 2024 European Legislation on Protection of Human Rights and the Environment in Chains of Acti vities adopted by European Parliament On 24 April 2024, the European Parliament approved the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

The Council is scheduled to adopt the Directive at the end of May 2024.

The CSDDD introduces human rights and environmental due diligence obligations on the EU level.

Companies based in Europe or conducting  significant business there may need to considerably adjust their policies and proce dures to comply with the CSDDD going forward.

Which Companies Are Subject to the CSDDD and When: The CSDDD provides for a phase-in period.

Three years after its entry into force (c. 2027), the CSDDD will apply to EU companies with over 5,000 employees and an annual turnover greater than EUR 1.5 billion and to non-EU companies with the same annual turnover in the EU.

It will then apply to EU companies with more than 3,000 employees and an annual turnover greater than EUR 900 million and to non-EU companies exceeding this turnover in the EU, four years after the effective date (c. 2028).

To all EU companies with over 1,000 employees and a worldwide net turnover exceeding EUR 450 million and to non-EU com- panies with this turnover in the EU (irrespective of the number of employees), it will apply five years after the effective date (c. 2029).

From this point onwards, EU franchise com- panies with a worldwide net turnover of more than EUR 80 million of the ultimate parent company will also be subject to the Directive if they generate more than EUR 22.5 million in royalty income.

The same applies to non-EU franchise companies if they exceed these thresholds in the EU.

2 May 2024

In case of regulated financial undertakings, the upstream but not the downstream activi- ties will be subject to the CSDDD stipulations.

Which Obligations Apply under the CSDDD: The due diligence obligation to protect human rights and the environment extends to the entire so-called chain of activities of a company.

The definition of a chain of activities is broad and encompasses (i) activities of a companys upstream business partners related to the production of goods or the provision of services by the company, including the de sign, extraction, sourcing, manufacture, transport, storage and supply of raw materials, products or parts of the products and development of the product or the service, as well as certain (ii) activities of a companys downstream business partners related to the dis tribution, transport and storage of the product, where the business partners carry out those activities for the company or on behalf of the company.

The CSDDD sets out the obligations of companies and their upstream and downstream partners to prevent, mitigate and remedy negative impacts of their activities on human rights and the environment, including issues such as slavery and labor exploitation, child labor, biodiversity loss, environmental pollution, destruction of natural heritage and cli- mate change.

Specifically, the CSDDD introduces an obligation for companies to adopt a transition plan to mitigate climate change.

This is intended to ensure that the business  model and strategy of companies are compatible with the transition to a sustainable eco- nomy along with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C. The specific due diligence obligations of a company include:  Integrating due diligence into policies and risk management systems,  Identifying and assessing actual or potential adverse impacts,  Preventing and mitigating potential adverse impacts, bringing actual adverse impacts to an end, and minimizing their extent,  Providing remediation for adverse impacts,  Carrying out meaningful engagement with stakeholders,  Establishing and maintaining a notification mechanism and a complaints procedure,  Monitoring the effectiveness of their due diligence,  Publicly communicating on its due diligence."
Hengeler Mueller,European Legislation on Protection of Human Rights and the Environment in Chains of Activities adopted by European Parliament,"Civil Liability and Standing: The CSDDD stipulates that the implementation of remedi- al measures does not exempt the company from penalties or civil liability in the event of damages.

In such instances, natural or legal persons adversely affected by the breach may pursue claims for full compensation within a limitation period of at least five years.

Trade unions and NGOs may also file claims on behalf of the persons affected in accordance with national legislation.

The CSDDD clarifies that a company cannot be held liable for damage caused solely by its business partners in its chain of activities.

Most relevant differences to the German Supply Chain Act (LkSG) Subjective Scope

As of 1 January 2024, the LkSG ap plies to companies with 1,000 or more employees located in Germany or posted abroad.

Un- der the CSDDD, the location of the employees is irrelevant, but an annual net income of more than EUR 450 million must be met in addition to the employee threshold.

Scope of Obligations The LkSG limits the required due diligence measures to the com- panys own business area and its direct suppliers in the supply chain unless there is specific know ledge of risks further up the chain.

The CSDDD applies to the entire chain of activities, governing a companys own business area, its subsidiaries, upstream activities irrespective of the supplier level as well as specific downstream activities.

Civil Liability Unlike the CSDDD, which explic- itly introduces a civil liability, the LkSG explicitly excludes any civil liability for breaches of specific LKSG obligations.

Climate Protection

In contrast to the CSDDD, which places a strong focus on climate protection, the LkSG does not include any climate protection measures, but only very specific environmental risks.

Increased Sanctions Sanctions outlined in the  CSDDD extend beyond those set out in the LkSG.

For example, fines in the LkSG are limited to EUR 8 million or a maximum of 2% of the annual turnover compared to 5% of the annual turnover set forth in the CSDDD.

3 May 2024 Enforcement and Fines:

The CSDDD obliges Member States to designate one or more supervisory authorities to carry out inspections and to observe compliance with the obli- gations laid down in national provisions.

Depending on various decisive factors such as the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the CSDDD requires Member States to stipulate a maximum pecuniary penalty of not less than 5% of the net worldwide turnover in the financial year preceding the fining decision.

Outlook

Following the publication of the law, the EU Member States have two years to transpose the law into national law.

Those Member States having already implemented laws on the protec- tion of human rights in the supply chain, such as Germany and France, will need to amend their existing laws accordingly.

Companies subject to the CSDDD should plan for the necessary adjustments of their policies and procedures rather sooner than later.

As early experiences with the Supply Chain Act in Germany indicate, companies not within the scope of the CSDDD may nevertheless experi- ence indirect effects of the legislation due to increased information requests and contractual obligations from companies covered by the CSDDD.

The CSDDD provides for ongoing review and reporting of the Commission.

The Commission may issue guidelines on how the due diligence obligations should be fulfilled.

These guide- lines may also set out non-binding model contractual clauses that companies can use in their chain of activities.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2023 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break,"September 2023 BRUSSELS  JOUR La Rentre 2023  Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break Some of our readers might have been lucky enough to escape rainy Brussels in August and early September, but unfortunately reality slaps hard and most of us are now faced with the inevitable return to the desk.

So, besides the usual day-to-day, the question is: What to expect in EU competition law until years end and will the newly appointed  interim  Competition Commissioner Didier Reynders change the course?

To smoothen your Rentre a little, we have summarized some of the key developments in terms of antitrust, merger control, and the highly anticipated Foreign Subsidies Regulation of importance in 2023:

Antitrust I: Its getting serious for Gatekeepers Following the entry into force on 1 November 2022 and application as of 2 May 2023 of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the Commission received notifications for the designa- tion of gatekeepers from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (an internet technology company that operates creative content platforms and the developer of TikTok), Meta, Microsoft, and Samsung by the deadline of 3 July 2023.

Not voluntarily, of course  the DMA required them to!

And rather unsurprisingly, the Commission designated almost all of them on 6 September 2023, with only Samsung being able to escape the designa- tion.

What all the designated companies apparently have in common is that they meet the quantitative gatekeeper thresholds in terms of turnover, market capitalization, and number of end and business customers.

At least in the eyes of the Commission, that is  it remains to be seen whether the Union Courts will have the last word!

For now, the gatekeepers have six months to fully comply with the requirements in the DMA, meaning at the latest by 6 March 2024.

The remainder of 2023 will thus be busy for them.

The requirements cover a broad array of areas, depending on the business areas of the gatekeeper, including data interoperability, advertising transparency, and self-preference and tying prohibitions.

Markus Rhrig, Philipp Neideck, Christian Dankerl, Joachim Burger, Katarina Bauer and Christoph Sielmann report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

September 2023 2

In order to verify compliance with the DMA, the Commission recently published its Pro- cedural Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/814.

It deals with the procedural aspects of the DMA, including notifications and submissions of information, the protection of confidential information, access to file and time limits.

It intends to promote effective proceedings and give the involved companies, including those appointed as gatekeepers, legal certainty regarding procedural rights and obligations.

WHAT TO EXPECT?

The remainder of 2023 will not just be busy for the newly des- ignated gatekeepers.

Some national regulators are already some steps ahead in their attempts to regulate the digital economy and they will now need to think about how the DMA is fitting into this.

Antitrust II: FIFA and UEFA vs. The European Super League

One football highlight chases the other.

Now that the FIFA Womens World Cup is over, the UEFA Champions League is just around the corner.

Football fans get their moneys worth.

Apropos Champions League  wasnt there also the European Super League?

The prospects for a revival of the Super League were knocked back after Advocate General Rantos legal opinion has been published by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in December 2022.

In 2021, twelve top clubs caused a stir with the publication of their Super League plans.

The project would have been in direct competition with UEFAs Champions League.

However, after strong protests from leagues, associations and fans, the plan was rejected within 48 hours."

But not from all: Three of the clubs filed a lawsuit against FIFA and UEFA in a court in Madrid, asserting that FIFAs and UEFAs actions opposing the estab- lishment of the European Super League constitute anticompetitive behavior that runs contrary to EU competition law.

In context of a preliminary ruling procedure the ECJ was asked whether UEFA and FIFA are allowed to prohibit the creation of the Super League and impose penalties on partic- ipants.

The main findings in Rantos opinion were succinct: The FIFA and UEFA rules under which any new competition is subject to prior approval are compatible with EU competition law.

He also argued that EU competition rules do not prohibit FIFA, UEFA, their member federations, or their national leagues from imposing sanctions on clubs who join any breakaway.

Now, the Super League makers must put their trust in the ECJ  but will they score?

WHEN?

The decision of the ECJ was expected in March 2023.

As there has been no decision so far, one can eagerly await whether the ECJ will seize the opportunity to revolutionize European football.

A blast from the past: Update of the Market Definition Notice

The current market definition notice dates back to 1997.

It is now being revised for the first time.

While fundamental principles of demand- and supply substitution are still crucial concepts, there have been many significant economic developments over the last 26 years, especially due to digitalization.

For context: When the current market notice was drafted, neither Google nor Facebook were born yet  and Amazon was only three years old!

September 2023 3

In April 2020, the Commission launched an evaluation of its current notice, with the results set out in a staff working document in July 2021.

Following a call for evidence in January 2022, it published its draft revised market definition notice on 22 November 2022.

It also launched a public consultation on this draft that ran until 13 January 2023.

The draft notice incorporates 25 years of the Commissions decisional practice and the case law of the EU courts.

The proposed changes provide new or additional guidance in several key areas, such as explanations on the general principles of market defini- tion, greater emphasis on non-price elements for determining the need for a service or product, the application to the digital world, and innovation-intensive markets.

It also elaborates on possible sources of evidence, meaning that the Commission may use any reliable source without applying a rigid hierarchy of different sources of information or types of evidence.

Irrespective of what one thinks about the individual suggestions: It is desirable if in the future the notice would be regularly (not just every 26 years) revised and adjusted, tak- ing into account the developments of the real world.

1997 sure was a different time than 2023!

WHEN?

The Commissions draft notice is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of 2023.

Merger control

I: Article 22, second act The fall may bring new developments  and hopefully more clarity  in the Article 22 journey: The Illumina/GRAIL battle is expected to go into the next round.

As you will re- member, in the summer of 2022, the General Court upheld the Commissions decision to review the merger based on its new Article 22 approach.

In the meantime, the Commis- sion prohibited the merger.

Illumina has appealed the first instance decision, bringing the case to the ECJ.

Will the court confirm the Commissions controversial approach?

WHEN?

While no date has been set yet for the oral hearing before the ECJ, it is likely to take place in the second half of 2023 or in early 2024."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2023 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break,"WHEN?

While no date has been set yet for the oral hearing before the ECJ, it is likely to take place in the second half of 2023 or in early 2024.

Over the summer, two new Article 22 cases have appeared on the horizon: On 18 August, the Commission made public its decision to accept the requests of 15 Member States to review the proposed acquisition of Autotalks by Qualcomm, semiconductor companies based in Israel and the US, respectively.

Three days later, the Commission announced that it would assess yet another case under an Article 22 referral (this time submitted by three Member States as well as Norway), namely the proposed acquisition of Nasdaqs European power trading and clearing business by European Energy Exchange (EEX), a subsidiary of Deutsche Brse AG and a major European energy exchange.

As in the Illu- mina/GRAIL case (and unlike in other Article 22 cases such as Meta/Kustomer, Viasat/ Immarsat, and Cochlear/Oticon Medical), neither transaction was notifiable under the EUMR or any Member States notification thresholds.

The new cases suggest that the Commission is keen to further embark on the Article 22 path that it has taken, and that the General Court has greenlighted.

September 2023 4 Merger control II: Gun jumping back on the plate Another important issue to follow when the days get shorter and the leaves turn brown will be gun jumping:

First, the ECJ is expected to hand down its judgement on Altices appeal against the General Courts upholding of the Commissions record-setting fee for Altices pre-clearance acquisition of PT Portugal (the General Court only slightly reduced the fee).

The Commission had qualified certain pre-closing covenants that granted Altice veto rights over the targets ordinary business decisions as well as the exchange of cer- tain competitively sensitive information as gun-jumping.

In April, the Advocate General delivered his opinion, confirming the Commissions and the General Courts stance.

Will the ECJ follow?

In any case, it is to be hoped that the ECJ offers some more guidance for the transaction practice.

WHEN?

The ruling is expected in the second half of the year.

Secondly, there is a (potential) new case of gun jumping before the Commission: The acquisition of Lagardre by Vivendi, two large French media companies.

The proposed transaction as such was notified to and, in June 2023, subject to certain commitments, approved by the Commission.

However, on 25 July 2023, the Commission opened a for- mal gun-jumping investigation against Vivendi in relation to the deal.

On the same day, Commissioner Vestager confirmed to a French media outlet that the Commission began looking into Vivendis behavior, as it could have culminated in a breach of the standstill obligation.

While the Commission did not disclose the specific allegations and conduct that are now under scrutiny, market observers noted that back in 2021 executives of Vivendi and Lagardre began coordinating staff decisions, resulting in a series of layoffs at Lagardres media outlets Journal du Dimanche and Paris Match, and their editorial policies, which Vivendis CEO allegedly influenced.

It is now the Commissions task to determine whether Vivendi indeed jumped the gun.

If the Commission comes to this conclusion, Vivendi could face a fine of up to 10% of its global turnover.

WHEN?

According to Commissioner Vestager, the investigation into the allegations could take months.

It remains to be seen whether the Commission will conclude its investigation still in 2023.

Merger Control III:

A welcome simplification When returning to your desk after the summer break, a significant change in the merger control space has already taken effect: on 1 September 2023, the Commissions 2023 Merger Simplification Package, adopted in April 2023, entered into force.

It broadens the scope of transactions that could potentially benefit from a simplified review."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2023 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break,"It broadens the scope of transactions that could potentially benefit from a simplified review.

The 2023 Merger Simplification Package consists of a revised Implementing Regulation, a Notice on Simplified Procedure and a Communication on the transmission of docu- ments.

A Q&A document covers practical questions.

The Notice on Simplified Procedure sets out the categories of cases which may be eligible for a simplified review (and which do not lead to an affected market).

In particular, the category of simplified cases is broadened to include, e.g., cases in which the previous September 2023 5 combined market share thresholds are exceeded up to a certain limit, but in which the market concentration index (HHI) delta is below 150.

It further introduces a category of super-simplified cases, which may be notified without having to undergo pre-notifi- cation discussions with the Commission.

Joint Ventures that not active in the EEA and transactions where the parties activities neither overlap horizontally, nor are vertically linked fall within this category.

Finally, a flexibility clause allows the Commission to treat transactions as simplified cases, even though the thresholds for a simplified treat- ment are slightly exceeded.

The Commission expects that approx.

10% of the cases previously reviewed under the normal procedure would qualify for a simplified treatment under the discretionary sim- plified treatment.

The notification forms have been amended, including the introduction of a new tick- the-box format Short Form CO for simplified cases.

However, it needs to be noted that while the format may be simplified, the level of information required has increased and now requires notifying parties to provide information on non-controlling shareholdings above 10% and cross-directorships.

For non-simplified cases, the Form CO now requires parties to submit all data that is col- lected and stored in the ordinary course of business and that could be useful for a quan- titative economic analysis (Sec. 5.5 of the Form CO).

Parties will also need to describe how they use such data in the normal course of business and provide analyses derived from such data (Sec. 5.6 of the Form CO).

On a more practical note, all documents  notifications and annexes  can be submitted electronically.

Documents that need to be signed will have to be signed using a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) recognised by the Commission.

Despite this progress, filings still have to be submitted by 5pm (and 4pm on Fridays).

WHEN?

Good news  simplification as of now: the 2023 Merger Simplification Pack- age entered into force on 1 September 2023 (and it is mandatory to use the revised notification forms!)

Foreign Subsidies Regulation: It is about to get real As most of our readers are probably well aware, the hotly anticipated  and one may add: infamous  Regulation (EU) 2022/2560 on Foreign Subsidies (FSR) entered into force on 12July 2023.

Many large M&A deals are now subject to a new screening process: any deal that falls under the FSR thresholds and is (i) signed after 12 July 2023 and (ii) due to close after 12 October 2023 must be notified to, and approved by, the Commission prior to closing.

The mandatory notification tool will formally catch a wide array of deals, irrespective of whether the contributions received by a non-EU country have a connection to the trans- action or otherwise potential distortive effects.

A formal FSR filing is always required  where at least one of the merging parties, the target company, or the JV has a turnover exceeding EUR 500m in the EU in the last financial year; and September 2023 6  where the acquirer and/or the target company, including all their group companies, received financial contributions by non-EU countries of more than EUR 50m, on an aggregated basis, in the last three years prior to the signing of an agreement, an- nouncement of a public bid or acquisition of a controlling interest."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2023 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break,"While information on such financial contributions needs to be collected to determine a filing requirement, the Commission has  following harsh criticism  significantly alle-

viated the burden on the reporting obligations within a filing.

In the final Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1441, certain categories of contributions have been exempted from reporting and only such of risky and particularly harmful nature (e.g. unlimited state guarantees) need to be described in detail.

And after long discussions, the Commission also made a concession for PE deals, al- lowing PE firms to report  under certain conditions  only on contributions granted to companies managed by the specific acquiring fund as opposed to all funds managed.

Note however: For determining the filing thresholds, still all contributions to PE funds are relevant (as are turnover figures, mirroring the approach under EU merger control rules)

So now that we have the final documents before us and the FSR becomes a deal reality  what do companies and M&A dealmakers have to bear in mind?

Key points to be con- sidered are:  Information collection:

Companies should  if not done already  systemically collect and track all financial contributions received by non-EU countries (public au- thorities and undertakings with links to the State alike) over the last three years.

That could for instance take the form of subsidy scorecard listing all relevant contracts, tax reliefs, capital injections for subsidiaries etc.  

Considering request for information waivers: The Commission can dispense information requirements in a FSR filing if information is not reasonably available to the parties (e.g., because authorities in third countries refuse to cooperate).

In rele- vant cases, companies should prepare arguments to that end to substantiate a poten- tial waiver request to the EC within pre-notification discussions.  

Consider impact on deal timetable: The FSR not only imposes a standstill obli- gation similar to the EUMR but also mirrors its timetable.

The FSR review process also foresees a Phase 1 review of 25 working days after formal notification, following a potential in-depth Phase 2 investigation of 90 working days in case of substantive concerns (potential extension by 15 working days in case commitments are offered).

As in EU merger control, the Commission encourages parties to engage in pre-notifi- cation discussions on the basis of a draft notification form.

In light of this, dealmakers should consider the impact of a FSR review on the deal timeline (e.g., Long-Stop- Date), having recourse to their EUMR experience.

September 2023 7  Dealmakers should also think about how to reflect a potential FSR filing in deal documents:  Conditions Precedent as known for EU merger control and/or FDI proceedings.  

Cooperation obligations to ensure smooth filing preparations and engagement of all parties before the Commission, which might be particularly important given the extensive (and potentially difficult) disclosure on financial contributions by non-EU countries and corresponding information requests to be expected during an FSR review.  

Efforts covenants, e.g., on negotiating and accepting possible remedies, as the FSR has a different focus and goes beyond the types of divestiture or behavioral commitments typically accepted under the EUMR.  

Risk allocation: Negotiation of hell-or-high water clauses or break-up fees to address uncertainty about deal clearance, in particular in cases of high visibility (e.g., investments from China, transactions in strategic sectors such as semicon- ductors, healthcare etc.).  

Possible springing conditions: Under the FSR, the Commission will also have powers to call in below-threshold deals (as under Article 22 EUMR) for review, a risk that can and should be addressed for non-notifiable deals proactively.

That is again particularly true for highly visible cases."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2023 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break,"That is again particularly true for highly visible cases.  

Prepare for potential parallel Commission reviews: A number of M&A trans- actions may require a filing under both FSR and the EUMR.

As things stand, such filings would be dealt with by different case teams and companies have to prepare for potential divergence in terms of timing (different length of pre-notification, remedy discussions), different focus of such reviews and having to consider additional reme- dies.

Companies should seek close contact with the Commission early on to align on such risks.  

Consider interplay with national procedures: A number of cases might however only fall under the FSR and potential national merger control and/or FDI procedures.

This poses similar questions as raised above on necessary closing conditions, deal timelines and potentially conflicting remedies.

WHATS NEXT?

Companies and dealmakers now need to face the new realities  there is yet another layer to consider in M&A transactions.

Stay tuned for the 12 Oc- tober, when the Commission will receive the first notifications and hopefully provides further guidance based on its first experiences soon after.

Hengeler Mueller,Government proposal for English-language chambers and commercial courts – will Germany be bolstered as a venue for international commercial disputes?,"Government proposal for English-language chambers and commercial courts – will Germany be bolstered as a venue for international commercial disputes?

The German Federal Ministry of Justice (BMJ) has published a key issues paper on strengthening the competitiveness of the German judiciary in international commercial disputes.

It remains to be seen whether this can be achieved.

Numerous other states such as the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Singapore and Dubai have implemented commercial courts with an international focus to attract cross-border disputes.

Now, the German government seeks to catch up and enhance Germany's attractiveness as a venue for international commercial disputes.

As agreed in the German government's coalition agreement, swift and efficient court proceedings tailored to the needs of the economy shall be introduced.

Thereby, the German Government intends to gain ground over private arbitration proceedings, which are often preferred when dealing with (international) commercial disputes.

The paper, published by the BMJ, addresses the following key issues: Parties shall be able to conduct certain commercial disputes in English before regional courts ( Landgerichte ), provided that the parties agree and there is an objective reason.

The entire proceedings, including written submissions, hearings and the judgement would be in English.

The same would apply with regard to any appeals to higher regional courts ( Oberlandesgerichte ).

The German federal states are to be allowed to jointly establish English-speaking tribunals at regional courts and special senates at higher regional courts (the so-called 'commercial courts') that are competent to judge on appeals.

Where the value in dispute exceeds one million euros, the parties shall be free to skip the regional court level and bring the action directly before a commercial court.

Only specialized judges with very good language skills shall be selected for the commercial courts.

As before arbitral tribunals, verbatim transcriptions of the oral hearings are to be provided.

Parties shall be able to appeal to the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) against commercial court decisions.

It shall also be possible to conduct the proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice in English, provided that the relevant senate gives its consent.

The protections for trade secrets are to be expanded.

Up to now, it is only possible to restrict the public access to the hearings in exceptional cases.

There are no further restrictions on the use of information obtained during civil proceedings.

Files can be inspected by third parties.

Henceforth, business secrets disclosed in the course of court proceedings are subject to specific protection by prohibiting the disclosure of those information outside the proceedings.

The use of videoconferences shall be promoted in proceedings before the commercial courts.

Virtual hearing shall be possible, if the parties agree.

The key issues paper is a first step in the right direction: Having proceedings conducted in English, will make it easier for foreign companies to directly follow the course of their proceedings.

The fact that the court of first instance could be skipped would reduce the long duration of proceedings in commercial disputes before German courts, an issue that is also perceived abroad.

If the reform proves to be successful, it would push Germany's position in the competition for attractive judicial venues (which has long since flared up).

However, a complete equivalence of German civil procedure with commercial arbitration cannot be achieved by the proposal.

Proceedings before commercial courts would still be public in principal, their confidentiality is not guaranteed to the same degree as before arbitral tribunals.

Moreover, a key advantage of arbitration is the considerable flexibility of the proceedings."
Hengeler Mueller,Government proposal for English-language chambers and commercial courts – will Germany be bolstered as a venue for international commercial disputes?,"Moreover, a key advantage of arbitration is the considerable flexibility of the proceedings.

By means of the case management , the parties and the tribunal can not only make arrangements on how the proceedings are organised but also with regard to rules of evidence.

Such flexibility cannot be provided by a commercial court, which is bound to the rather inflexible Code of Civil Procedure.

Moreover, one import important question remains unanswered by the key issues paper: Is there a sufficient number of judges willing and able to conduct complex commercial proceedings in English?

This will require more than just generally good foreign language skills.

Without extensive training programmes, it will hardly be possible to staff the envisaged English-speaking chambers and senates in the necessary quantity.  

Hopefully, the BMJ will also develop solutions for this practical problem."
Hengeler Mueller,The Russia-Ukraine war and the EU's financial sanctions response,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, numerous German and international banks have been trying either to reduce their exposure to Russia significantly or to withdraw from the country altogether.

These de-risking activities have been triggered in part by actual or expected (counter-)sanctions and in part by purely reputational concerns.

However, compliance and reputational risks not only loom in banks' Russia-related back books, but also arise in connection with new business.

Banks must therefore carefully and continuously monitor the quickly evolving (EU) sanctions landscape to avoid breaching sanctions.

The financial sanctions are largely based on EU Regulations that are directly applicable in each EU Member State.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 and Regulation (EU) 833/2014 are the most relevant statutes concerning the sanctions against Russia.

Regulation (EU) 269/2014 imposes such measures as an asset freeze and a prohibition on providing funds or goods to numerous sanctioned persons (both natural persons and legal entities), as well as to entities controlled by sanctioned persons.

By contrast, Regulation (EU) 833/2014 sets out numerous sector-specific sanctions, some of which are of particular relevance to the financial services sector, including: the exclusion of major Russian banks (e.g. VTB, Gazprombank, most recently Sberbank) from the SWIFT network used for financial messaging among banks.

Decoupling these banks from SWIFT effectively cuts them off from international interbank transactions.

a prohibition on dealing in or assisting with the issuance of certain issuers' securities, not just in the financial sector, but in other industries as well (defense, oil).

a prohibition on credit institutions accepting deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 from Russian citizens and entities, as well as from natural persons resident in Russia (save for narrow exceptions), with existing deposits exceeding this threshold being grandfathered.

So, what do companies need to keep in mind?

The consequences of violating EU (financial) sanctions are harsh.

In most cases, transactions in breach of EU sanctions will be void under civil law.

In Germany, breaches may also qualify as a criminal offence or an Ordnungswidrigkeit (administrative offence) under the German Foreign Investment Act.

Banks may also face supervisory measures for failure to establish a proper business organisation that prevents such breaches.

These measures can range from a mere request to remediate the organisational shortcomings to repercussions for the management of financial institutions.

As the situation is evolving rapidly, our assessment of this issue might change.

Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: A Topsy Turvy World - Children, Watch after your Parents!","November 2021 BRUSSELS  JOUR A Topsy Turvy World: Children, Watch after your Parents!

The Sumal Judgment, Top-Down Liability and its Implications The Court of Justices Sumal case1 was ranking high on the watch list of private antitrust litigators.

And the Courts judgment certainly lived up to the expecta- tions.

You may agree or disagree with the Court, but the notion that subsidiaries can be liable for antitrust violations committed by their parent entity, or possibly other companies of the same corporate group (top-down liability) marks a major milestone for private antitrust litigation across the EU.

However, Sumal may very well have significant implications also for the Commissions cartel en- forcement and for M&A dealmakers.

In this edition of Brussels  Jour, we explain why the all members of the antitrust community, not just private litigators, should consider what Sumal means for their business and the advice they provide to their (external and internal) clients.

Parental liability turned upside down: Sumal and top-down liablity The notion of parental liability has long been a well-established part of the EUs antitrust laws.

A parent company can be held liable for infringements committed by one of its subsidiaries, provided the subsidiary does not determine independently its own conduct on the market, but essentially carries out the instructions given to it by the par- ent company and, therefore, parent and subsidiary belong to the same economic unit.

Under the Court of Justices Akzo ruling, a presumption to that effect applies where a parent company holds (almost) all of a subsidiarys equity.2 In many ways, piercing the 1 Court of Justice, judgment of 6 October 2021, Case C882/19, Sumal SL v Mercedes Benz Trucks Espaa SL. 2 Court of Justice, judgment of 27 April 2017, Case C-516/15 P, Akzo Nobel v European Commission.

Markus Rhrig reports on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

November 2021 corporate veil has long been not the exception, but the rule under the EU antitrust rules.

However, except in very specific circumstances,3 it has been a one way street.

Parent companies could be held liable for anticompetitive behavior of their subsidiaries, but not vice versa, as the General Court explicitly held in

Parker ITR.4

The Court of Justices judgment in Aristrain was similarly clear with respect to sister companies, or so it seemed.5

In that sense, Sumal is a game changer.

The Sumal case originated in the Spanish courts.

In the late 1990s, Sumal bought two trucks from Mercedes Benz Trucks Espaa, a subsidiary of Daimler.

In 2016, the Com- mission adopted a decision holding that Daimler had been involved in collusive behavior in relation to certain trucks in violation of Article 101 TFEU.

Subsequently, Sumal sued Mercedes Benz Trucks Espaa, not an addressee of the Commissions decision, for dam- ages, claiming that it had overpaid for the two trucks.

The Spanish courts referred the case to Luxembourg.

According to the Court of Justice holding in Sumal, any member of an economic unit can be held liable for the anticompetitive conduct of any other part of that same econom- ic unit, thus confirming that subsidiaries may also have to answer for the conduct of their parent company.

However, the Court recognized that there should be boundaries to the notion of top down liability.

Therefore, the Court held that, where a plaintiff claims antitrust damages from a subsidiary based on anticompetitive conduct that its parent company was engaged in (but not the subsidiary), it is for the plaintiff to demonstrate (i) that both are in fact part of the same economic unit, considering their economic, organ- izational and legal links, and (ii) that there is a specific link between the subsidiarys business activities and the subject matter that the parents infringement pertained to."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: A Topsy Turvy World - Children, Watch after your Parents!","In other words, the anticompetitive conduct must concern the same products as those marketed by the subsidiary.

The Court of Justice also held that, allowing plaintiffs to go after the subsidiary, did not disregard its procedural rights to an effective remedy and a fair trial, even though the Commission had addressed neither its statement of objections (SO) not the final decision to the subsidiary.

If an addressee, the subsidiary would have been able to dispute both the infringement as such and the existence of an economic unit, if need be in court.

That option is not available to the subsidiary if the SO and the decision are addressed to the parent company only.

Nonetheless, when ruling on a follow-on damage claim, the Commissions decision is binding on the national courts pursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation No 1/2003.

Still, the Court of Justice found that the subsidiarys procedural rights were fully respected because it had been able to contest the Commissions decision through its parent company.

It seems like Sumal effectively extends the notion of eco- nomic unit to the sphere of procedural rights.

A broad reading of the judgment suggests that, if the parent company had sufficient opportunity to avail itself of its procedural rights, that will effectively count against other corporate entities which belong the same economic unit.

3

For example, in Biogaran, the General Court ruled that the concept of joint liability could also apply if the anticompetitive infringe- ment resulted not only from the subsidiarys conduct but from a combined behavior of both the parent company and the subsidiary.

See General Court, judgment of 12 December 2018, Case T677/14, Biogaran v European Commission.

4 General Court, judgment of 17 May 2013, Case T-146/09, Parker ITR v European Commission.

5 Court of Justice, judgment of 2 October 2013, Case C-196/99 P, Aristrain.

November 2021 Knock-on effects on the Commissions cartel enforcement Sumal originates from the private antitrust litigation space and, given the strategizing around venue and choice of law issues that is peculiar to that space, this is likely where the Court of Justices judgment is likely to have to greatest impact.

However, there is little doubt that the judgment will have spillover effects on the Commissions public cartel enforcement.

The Court explicitly finds that term undertaking cannot have one meaning for purposes of private damage claims and an entirely different meaning when it comes to imposing fines for anticompetitive behavior.

Applying Sumal to cartel enforcement would enable the Commission to prosecute subsidiaries for their parent (or even sister) companys anticompetitive conduct if they form an economic unit and operate in the same industry that the anticompetitive conduct pertain to, without having to prove that the subsidiary was involved.

Although the Commission will in most cases be inclined to address its decision to the entity that was immediately involved and its ultimate parent (which may have deeper pockets), there may be exceptions.

Therefore, the issue is unlikely whether the Commission could hold a subsidiary liable for anticom- petitive conduct that its parent companyor a sister companywas involved in, but in which scenarios the Commission might find it useful to avail itself of its new powers.

A few scenarios come to mind (there may be others, too).

International cartels.

Where cartels span the entire globe, it is not uncommon that all or at least some of the cartel members are companies located outside of the EU.

Obviously, the Commission has power to address decisions to and impose fines on non-EU compa- nies, and it has made frequent use of that power in recent years.

However, enforcement of these decisions outside of the EU will be difficult if (in exceptional cases) a non-EU company refused to pay the fine."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: A Topsy Turvy World - Children, Watch after your Parents!","However, enforcement of these decisions outside of the EU will be difficult if (in exceptional cases) a non-EU company refused to pay the fine.

In international cartels, the Commission might there- fore be inclined to add the non-EU parents subsidiaries in the EU to the list of address- ees, or simply enforce the decision addressed to the non-EU parent against a subsidiary in the EU.

The Commission might also be increasingly inclined to address request for information to EU-based subsidiaries in an effort to collect information that is controlled by its non-EU parent.

Sister companies.

In the past, the Commission has at times struggled to establish liabil- ity between sister companies, or where several corporate entities are de facto under joint management without there being a common parent entity.

In these cases, Sumal could make the Commissions life much easier.

Repeat offenders.

Under its Fining Guidelines, the Commission may increase the fine imposed for anticompetitive behavior if the same perpetrator has previously committed a similar infringement.

While it is well-established that the notion of same perpetrator refers to the economic unit rather than the specific corporate legal entity, Sumal might still make it easier for the Commission to mark up fines for a repeated offenses, par-

ticularly in light of the Court of Justices proposition that procedural rights also apply to economic units rather than individual legal entities.

November 2021 Challenges for M&A dealmakers on the horizon Antitrust risks are significant and, if known to the parties (notably the acquirer) can easily become deal breakers.

Unfortunately, hardcore cartels typically involve covert conduct that is unknown to the acquirer and that is unlikely to be discovered in a stand- ard due diligence processand a full-fledged antitrust compliance audit, which may or may not uncover cartel behavior, in most cases is not a feasible option pre-merger.

Therefore, the parties need to deal with antirust risks in their transaction documents.

While the devil might have been in the details, the existing rules provided fair guidance as to where the risk is and who is responsible, subject of course to any diverging rules that the parties might agree between themselves.

Obviously the target has to answer for any anticompetitive conduct that it is directly involved in.

The seller is jointly and sever- ally liable with the target for that targets anticompetitive conduct up until closing, not the acquirer (except in very specific circumstances where the seller ceases to exist).

If the target continues the infringement post-closing, the acquirer is liable alongside the target for the conduct as from the closing date.

What that means is that acquirer can focus on investigating any antitrust risks associated with the target companys business and seek- ing warranties and indemnities to cover these risks.

Sumal changes these dynamics.

Under Sumal, the target company could be held liableby the Commission, or a court of law in private litigationfor anticompetitive conduct that it was not involved in, but (only) the seller or another legal entity that belongs to the sellers group.

In theory, the acquirer would have to extend its due diligence to the sellers group, at least to the extent that the seller or entities which belong to its group will retain activities that pertain to the same or similar markets that the target is doing business in (the specific link under the Sumal test).

The acquirer would also need to seek corresponding warranties and/or indemnities for the sellers conduct.

In practice, that seems utterly unrealistic, even more so in a buyers market!

There is some hope that the Commission might not prosecute target companies for the anticompetitive conduct of their former parents.

Private plaintiffs may show less restraints."

Hengeler Mueller,German Federal Government clears the way for CETA ISDS,"When the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada was concluded in October 2016, no one would have guessed that ratification of the Agreement would still not be completed in 2022.

On 1 July 2022, however, an important hurdle from a German perspective was overcome: On that day, the Federal Cabinet passed a bill for the ratification of the Trade Agreement.

The ratification bill is to be introduced into the Bundestag by the coalition parties' MPs before summer recess starts.

The parliamentary process is to be completed as early as this autumn.

The CETA already entered into force provisionally in September 2017.

This means that those parts of the Agreement for which the EU undoubtedly has exclusive competence already apply.

These include, in particular, the provisions on customs facilitation, intellectual property protection and the link to the incorporation provisions under international corporate law.

In contrast, other important parts of the Agreement are not yet applicable, including the chapter on investment protection.

For CETA to enter into full force and effect, it must be ratified by the parliaments of all EU member states, the EU and Canada.

To date, 15 member states have ratified it, but Germany, among other states, has not mustered the determination to do so yet.

One particular reason for this hesitancy is the disputed investment protection provisions.

Important milestone on the way to a multilateral investment tribunal?

The CETA aims to modernise the investor-state arbitration mechanism introduced in the 1980s to align it with 21st century requirements.

The investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) provided for in the Agreement is a novel hybrid solution that combines elements from traditional investment arbitration with classic state court structures: Under the CETA, independent, impartial and permanent investment arbitration tribunals are to be established.

These are to be staffed with 15 permanent arbitrators, five each from the EU, Canada and third countries, and decide in chambers with three arbitrators.

The composition of the chambers is to be random.

Further innovations include an appellate body and greater transparency through public oral hearings and the publication of pleadings.

Moreover, the establishment of the ISDS mechanism is only the first step: Going forward, the CETA envisages the establishment of a multilateral investment tribunal, which is to have competence also to rule on further trade agreements and which is to be open to accession by any country without restrictions.

Proposals for a correspondingly reformed dispute settlement mechanism already include investment protection agreements of the EU and EU member states with Singapore and Vietnam as well as the free trade agreements with Mexico and Chile.

In addition, the EU recently successfully concluded negotiations, which had been ongoing since 2018, on a free trade agreement between the EU and New Zealand, which also provides for such a reformed dispute settlement mechanism.

The legal conformity of the structure contemplated by the CETA was and is by no means beyond doubt.

In the past, the ECJ had shown restraint in cases where there was a possibility that another court could interpret European law and had always attached great importance to the autonomy of Union law and its primacy of interpretation.

One need only think of the ECJ's negative decision on the EU's possible accession to the European Convention on Human Rights in 2014 and the ECJ's Achmea decision in 2018, which held that investment tribunals between EU member states were contrary to EU law.

However, in a 2019 opinion, the ECJ – as a surprise to some – endorsed the approach to investment disputes provided for by the CETA , thus paving the way for implementation of the Agreement."
Hengeler Mueller,German Federal Government clears the way for CETA ISDS,"However, in a 2019 opinion, the ECJ – as a surprise to some – endorsed the approach to investment disputes provided for by the CETA , thus paving the way for implementation of the Agreement.

One last legal hurdle that the CETA investment protection mechanism will still need to overcome in Germany could be the following: Although, in a March 2022 decision, the German Constitutional Court ruled that the provisional application of the CETA does not violate Germany's Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ), the.court did not specify whether this holds also true for the CETA court system.

Can the cabinet decision act as an impulse to other EU member states?

The German government has already announced that it does not want to demand any renegotiation of the Agreement.

It stated that it intends to work towards an interpretative declaration on investor protection, however, through talks at the EU level and with the Canadian government.

This is intended to ensure that certain CETA investment protection provisions are further specified and that an abusive application of the substantive protection provisions is prevented.

In addition, the German government will advocate for improvements in parliamentary participation.

It does not expect that this will interrupt the ratification process, however.

Ultimately, not only Germany, but also eleven other EU member states are yet to give their consent, so that the decision of the Federal cabinet will not lead to any changes for the time being.

Nevertheless, the decision of the German government is a groundbreaking step towards a new EU investment protection system and the further legal protection of foreign direct investments – not only in relation to Canada.

Especially companies operating across borders, and across the Atlantic, are likely to be monitoring developments with great attention."
Hengeler Mueller,Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany,"1 February 2024 Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany On 1 February 2024, the German Federal Ministry of Justice (Bundesministerium der Justiz, BMJ) presented a ministerial draft bill on legislation for the moderni- sation of arbitration law (Gesetz zur Modernisierung des Schiedsverfahrensrechts, the Draft Bill).1 Following last years publication of the key issues paper (link to our article2), an important step has been taken towards the implementation of the proposed reform.

The Draft Bill should be viewed in conjunction with the 2023 draft of the Legal Venue Strengthening Act (Justizstandort-Strkungsgesetz).3 Similarly to this, the Draft Bill aims to make Germany a more attractive location for international and large-scale com- mercial disputes.

The BMJ recognises the im-portance of implementing a reliable legal framework for efficient dispute resolution tailored to the practical needs of the business community as a key location factor.

In this context, proceedings in state courts and arbitration  correctly  are not primarily seen as two competing dispute resolution mechanisms, but as complementary ones, the strengthening of which will be of overall benefit to Germany as a business location.

In the following, we would like to present and evaluate, from a practical perspective, the most important changes to German arbitration law that the Draft Bill provides.

Informal Arbitration Agreement

According to the Draft Bill, it will be possible to conclude arbitration agreements in- formally, provided that the arbitration agreement is a commercial transaction for all parties (Section 1031 (4) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO-E)).

1 www.bmj.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzgebung/RefE/RefE_Modernisierung_Schiedsverfahrensrecht_2024.pdf 2 https://hengeler-news.com/de/articles/bmj-legt-eckpunktepapier-zur-modernisierung-des-deutschen-schiedsverfahrensrechts-vor 3 www.bmj.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzgebung/RefE/RefE_Justizstandort_Staerkung.pdf CONTENT INFORMAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT VIDEO HEARINGS AND ELECTRONIC ARBITRAL AWARDS ENGLISH AS THE PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE DISSENTING OPINIONS AND PUBLICATION OF ARBITRAL AWARDS APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS IN MULTI- PARTY ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS PROVISIONAL OR PROTECTIVE MEASURES CLOSING REMARKS CONTACT 2 February 2024

The planned legislative changes will allow for arbitration agreements to be concluded im- plicitly or verbally.

The Draft Bill sees a practical need for this in connection with global supply chain and framework agreements.

Whether the proposed changes are expedient in such circumstances is debatable.

In any event, the omission of any written form has the potential to cause disputes and consequently delays and legal uncertainty.

An arbitration agreement typically contains not only the agreement that an arbitral tri- bunal shall have jurisdiction, but also various other provisions on the conduct of the ar- bitration proceedings (in particular the choice of an arbitration institution, the number of arbitrators and the place of the arbitration).

For evidentiary purposes alone, the parties should therefore draw up their agreement in writing.

Alternatively, if the parties wish to ensure that any disputes are to be adjudicated by state courts, it is advisable to document this decision as well.

Otherwise, proceedings before the state court could be delayed in fu- ture by claiming that an oral arbitration agreement has been concluded and that the state court therefore has no jurisdiction.

The Draft Bill further increases the potential for abuse that results from eliminating any formal requirement by expanding the possibilities for reviewing the (non-)existence of an arbitration agreement.

Under the Draft Bill, an arbitral award can also be set aside by state courts if the arbitral tribunal has wrongly denied its jurisdiction (Section 1040 (2) ZPO-E)."
Hengeler Mueller,Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany,"Under the Draft Bill, an arbitral award can also be set aside by state courts if the arbitral tribunal has wrongly denied its jurisdiction (Section 1040 (2) ZPO-E).

Finally, the elimination of any formal requirement is likely to impair the free circulation of arbitral awards issued in Germany and consequently runs against the objective of increa- sing the attractiveness of Germany as a place of arbitration.

Article II (1) of the New York Convention states that contracting states are only required to recognise written arbitration agreements.

Admittedly, the most-favoured-treatment principle of Article VII (1) alterna- tive 2 of the New York Convention allows an arbitration party to invoke more lenient for-

mal requirements of the domestic law of the state in which it wishes to enforce an arbitral award.

However, this only helps the parties to an arbitral award issued in Germany if such regulations exist in the state of enforcement.

It seems rather unlikely that the parties will take this into consideration when concluding an arbitration agreement verbally or by im- plication.

Video Hearings and Electronic Arbitral Awards

The Draft Bill provides that the arbitral tribunal may conduct the oral hearing by video and audio transmission (video hearing) after hearing the parties, unless the parties ha- ve agreed otherwise (Section 1047 (2) ZPO-E).

Under the current law, a video hearing is already possible due to the principle of procedural freedom.

The fact that the Draft Bill expressly provides for the admissibility of video hearings is nevertheless a welcome de- velopment.

The BMJ supports arbitral tribunals in cases in which a party objects to a video hearing without reasonable grounds, thereby potentially jeopardising the effective conduct of proceedings.

The planned legislation clarifies that a video hearing satisfies a persons right to be heard and that conducting a video hearing, despite (unreasonable) objections by a party, in and of itself does not constitute a violation of this right.

This ensures that, if a party has reasonable grounds to object to a video hearing, it can present these in advance to the extent necessary.

The Draft Bill also considers digitalisation by introducing an electronic arbitral award.

With the consent of the parties, the arbitral tribunal may issue the award electronically, provided that the names of the arbitrators and their qualified electronic signatures are in- cluded in the electronic document (Section 1054 (2) ZPO-E).

English as the Procedural Language

The Draft Bill allows proceedings in arbitration matters before the German courts to be conducted in English.

For example, the appointment or challenge of arbitrators, the admis- sibility or inadmissibility of arbitration proceedings, the annulment or declaration of en- forceability of arbitral awards and the enforcement, annulment or amendment of interim or protective measures can in future be heard and decided in English (Sections 1062 (5), 1063a ZPO-E).

Responsibility for these proceedings is intended to lie with the Commercial Courts, which are to be introduced by the Legal Venue Strengthening Act.

The Draft Bill authorises the state (Lnder) governments to establish by statutory order the necessary conditions for proceedings to be conducted entirely in English (Section 1062 (5) sentence 2 ZPO-E and section 1063a (1) sentence 1 no. 1

ZPO-E in conjunction with Secti- on 184a (1) sentence 1 no.1 of the German Courts Constitution Act (Gerichtsverfassungs- gesetz, GVG-E))."
Hengeler Mueller,Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany,"ZPO-E in conjunction with Secti- on 184a (1) sentence 1 no.1 of the German Courts Constitution Act (Gerichtsverfassungs- gesetz, GVG-E)).

The parties must have expressly or implicitly agreed to the proceedings being conducted in English or, if they are represented by legal counsel, they must have entered an appearance in English without objection (Section 1063a (1) sentence 1 no. 2 ZPO-E).

However, the parties cannot rely on being able to pursue all stages of legal recourse in Eng- lish.

In appeal proceedings, the German Federal Court of Justices (Bundesgerichtshof) agreement is required for the proceedings to be conducted in English (Section 1065 (3) sentence 1 no. 3 ZPO-E) and it can order at any time, without giving reasons, that the pro- ceedings be continued in German or that parts of the case file be translated into German (Section 1065 (3) sentence 4 in conjunction with Section 184b

(2) GVG-E).

In addition to conducting proceedings in English before the Commercial Courts, the Draft Bill includes the option of submitting in proceedings conducted in German English-langu- age documents that have been prepared or submitted in arbitration proceedings (Section 1063b (1) ZPO-E).

The court may only request a translation in individual cases where there is a special need (Section 1063b ZPO-E), for example if the judges are generally not suffi- ciently proficient in English or if a matter is in dispute that requires knowledge of speciali- sed English terminology that the court does not have.

Even though the Draft Bill does not guarantee that proceedings will be conducted in English across all instances, it should be welcomed that the Commercial Courts will be responsible for matters relating to arbitration proceedings.

It remains to be seen whether the reform plans will ensure the desired internationalisation of Germany as a judicial venue.

If in the CONTENT INFORMAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT VIDEO HEARINGS AND ELECTRONIC ARBITRAL AWARDS ENGLISH AS THE PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE DISSENTING OPINIONS AND PUBLICATION OF ARBITRAL AWARDS APPOINTMENT OF ARBITRATORS IN MULTI- PARTY ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS PROVISIONAL OR PROTECTIVE MEASURES CLOSING REMARKS CONTACT 4 February 2024 future arbitration proceedings are conducted in English, legal counsel will no longer need to translate pleadings and court decisions for English-speaking clients.

The fact that the Draft Bill introduces the submission of English-language documents before all courts is a positive development, even though many courts already accept documents in the English language anyway.

The planned legal reform would relieve the parties of time-consuming and cost-intensive translations.

Dissenting Opinions and Publication of Arbitral Awards The Draft Bills clarification of the admissibility of separate opinions (Section 1054a

ZPO-E) is also to be welcomed.

Already identified in 1996 as a possible subject of regulation in the preparatory work for the revision of German arbitration law, there is currently no mention of separate opinions in the arbitration law of the German Code of Civil Procedure.

The BMJ now proposes introducing a provision according to which an arbitrator may set out his or her dissenting view on the arbitral award or its grounds in a separate opinion, unless the parties agree otherwise (Section 1054a (1) ZPO-E).

Up until now, an arbitral separate opinion has harboured the risk that a domestic arbitral award will be set aside or that a foreign arbitral award will not be recognised in Germany.

It is argued that the submission of a separate opinion violates the secrecy of the proceedings and that this gives the arbitral award such a serious flaw that its recognition and enforce- ment in Germany would be contrary to German public policy (ordre public)."
Hengeler Mueller,Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany,"This view has been supported most notably by an obiter dictum of the Higher Regional Court of Frank- furt am Main, which ultimately did not have to decide the question, but did express serious reservations about separate opinions (decision of 16 January 2020, case no.

26

Sch 14/18).

This is why the BMJs proposal is a positive step.

The proposed regulation would further legal certainty, namely for an instrument that can show the litigant that the arbitral tri- bunal has considered such arguments that were ultimately not able to support the majority decision.

It also makes sense that the Draft Bill, as a rule, permits the publication of arbitral awards with the consent of the parties (Section 1054b (1) ZPO-E).

With this proposal, the Draft Bill addresses the frequentlyvoiced criticism of the lack of transparency in arbitration pro- ceedings.

From a practical point of view, the exception that the parties can agree otherwise is im- portant (Section 1054b (2) ZPO-E).

A deviating party agreement may also consist of the choice of institutional arbitration rules, such as those provided by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or the German Arbitration Institute (Deutsche Institution fr Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit e. V., DIS).

In contrast to the draft legislation, institutional ar- bitration rules or the guidelines for their application sometimes provide for an objection solution (i.e., an opt-out) rather than the possibility to opt-in.

This means that they require a party to expressly object in order to prevent the publication of (anonymised) arbitral awards, summaries or extracts.

Choosing institutional arbitration rules alone, thus, does not reliably protect parties from the publication of the arbitral award.

Appointment of Arbitrators in Multi-Party Arbitration Proceedings

The Draft Bill also provides for a provision on the appointment of arbitrators in multi- party arbitration proceedings (Section 1035 (4) ZPO-E).

This would close a regulatory gap of practical relevance for ad hoc proceedings.

The current statutory provisions on the appointment of arbitrators were drafted under the guiding principle of arbitration proceedings with only one claimant and one respondent, whereas multi-party arbitration proceedings are characterised by having more than one participant on at least one side (claimants or respondents).

The Draft Bill refers to them as joined parties (Streitgenossen) in line with proceedings before state courts.

The use of this terminology, however, is not intended to imply that the provisions on the joinder of parties in proceedings before state courts (Sections 59 et seq.

ZPO) should apply accor- dingly in arbitration proceedings.

For the appointment of arbitrators in a three-member arbitral tribunal, there are two pro cedural issues in particular that need to be regulated in multi-party arbitration procee- dings:  

Firstly, it must be decided whether the joined parties are obliged to agree on an arbitra- tor.

This question has been largely answered in the affirmative in practice and literature to date.

It is not a surprise that the Draft Bill also provides for the joint appointment of arbitrators by the joined parties, which is a good choice.  

Secondly, the question arises on how a replacement arbitrator is to be appointed if the joined parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator."
Hengeler Mueller,Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany,"Secondly, the question arises on how a replacement arbitrator is to be appointed if the joined parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator.

The Draft Bill provides that it should be at the discretion of the court responsible for the appointment of a replacement arbit- rator whether it only takes over the appointment of the arbitrator to be appointed by the joined parties in disagreement or also appoints the arbitrator of the opposing party.

A comparable solution was already provided for in certain institutional arbitration rules (such as the DIS Arbitration Rules) and the arbitration law of other countries.

Recently, however, there has been a trend in case law in favour of the concept of a socalled com- prehensive solution.

According to the comprehensive solution, both party-appointed arbitrators would have to be appointed by the competent court.

The BMJs decision to allow the court to exercise its discretion when appointing a replace- ment is a positive development.

A party confronted, whether voluntarily or not, with seve- ral opposing parties, therefore, does not have to worry about losing its right to choose an arbitrator just because the joined parties cannot agree on who to appoint.

This is particu- larly useful in cases in which the joined parties block the joint appointment of an arbitrator for tactical reasons in order to deprive the opposing party of the opportunity to appoint its own arbitrator.

Moreover, the Draft Bill provides that provisional or protective measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal with a foreign place of arbitration can be authorised by the court for enforcement in Germany (Section 1025 (2) ZPO-E in conjunction with Section 1041 (2) ZPO-E).

This is intended to resolve the previously controversial issue of the possibility of such an authorisation.

In addition, the judicial discretion that exists under current law with regard to the courts authorisation to enforce interim measures is to be repealed.

Instead, the courts will only be allowed to reject applications for an enforcement order if there are certain reasons, which are exhaustively listed in Section 1041 (2) sentence 3 ZPO-E. These include, but are not limited to, grounds that can lead to the annulment of an arbitral award, failure to pro- vide a security for costs ordered by the arbitral tribunal, or that a corresponding interim measure has already been applied for before a domestic state court.

On the other hand, the annulment or suspension of the interim measure by a state court at the foreign place of ar- bitration does not constitute grounds for refusal according to the Draft Bill.

This should be viewed critically.

The reference in the Draft Bill to the parallel problem of arbitral awards and the corresponding discussions in case law is not convincing.

Considering the existing uncertainties in case law, it would be particularly desirable to have a statutory regulation for both arbitral awards and interim measures.

Overall, the proposals for reform regarding provisional or protective measures can be approved.

However, it would also have been desirable to examine the possibility of provi- ding for an emergency arbitrator in the ZPO, which was considered in the key issues paper but not taken up in the Draft Bill.

Considering the numerous advantages that proceedings before an emergency arbitrator can offer (such as particularly quick decisions, specialised expertise and a high degree of confidentiality), it was hoped that a corresponding provision would be included in the Draft Bill.

Closing Remarks"
Hengeler Mueller,Important Steps towards the Modernisation of Arbitration Law in Germany,"Closing Remarks

The BMJs initiative to strengthen Germany as a judicial venue is to be welcomed.

The Draft Bill contains many useful and positive clarifications and innovations, but also inclu- des a number of provisions and regulatory gaps that can be criticised.

The consultations, which have just commenced, and the legislative process provide an opportunity to correct the weaknesses of the Draft Bill.

If this opportunity is utilised, the proposed reform offers a real opportunity to make Germany more competitive internationally as a dispute resolu- tion location.

Hengeler Mueller,Our new co-managing partners at Hengeler Mueller,"On 1 July 2022 Thomas Müller and Bernd Wirbel took up their roles as new Hengeler Mueller co-managing partners  succeeding Georg Frowein and Rainer Krause, whose scheduled term ends after four years.

Thomas Müller, who is based in Frankfurt, has been a partner since 1996.

He primarily advises large international private equity investors on German and European transactions in real estate law and has developed Hengeler Mueller's real estate practice to become one of the market leaders in Germany.

Düsseldorf-based Bernd Wirbel has been a partner since 2004, serving as resident partner in the firm's London office for four years.

He primarily advises on domestic and cross-border M&A transactions, corporate restructuring measures and public takeovers."
Hengeler Mueller,Our Pro Bono Work,"Outside the office, Hengeler Mueller personnel dedicate their time to social causes in various ways.

As one of Germany’s premier large commercial law firms, Hengeler Mueller is also aware of its social responsibility at a firm-wide level.

For this reason, the firm takes on pro bono clients in suitable cases, providing legal advice free of charge and thereby either supporting a good cause or giving clients, who would otherwise not be able to afford it, access to qualified legal advice.

In particular, Hengeler Mueller provides pro bono legal advice to charitable institutions active in fields such as education and science, health care, the environment, arts and culture, human rights and the rule of law, as well as in the fight against hunger and poverty.

One example of our pro bono casework in recent years is advising the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), a non-profit organisation headquartered in England, which advocates worldwide for protection of the environment, in particular the world's oceans, and for the defence of human rights.

To achieve its goals, the EFJ conducts studies and campaigns to raise public awareness through global networks comprised of environmentalists, human rights activists and local communities.

Hengeler Mueller has advised the EJF on its activities in Germany.

Other examples include our services for the African Parks Network, an environmental and animal welfare organisation; the non-profit Afro-German lawyers association Afro‑Deutsche Jurist:innen e.V.; and the charitable association Philip Julius e.V., which supports the families of children with multiple severe disabilities.

Some of our pro bono engagements have a more local connection, such as our advice to Start Right e.V., an association in which law students provide legal assistance for social projects, such as the Munich Teddybärkrankenhaus , where medical students of the Munich universities LMU and TUM volunteer their time to help children overcome their fear of visiting the doctor by acquainting them with a hospital setting through fun and playful 'teddy bear clinics'.

Some of our pro bono work also relates to major international challenges, such as advising the U.S. non-profit organisation International Refugee Assistance Project, Inc. (IRAP), which is committed to the development and enforcement of a system of legal claims and human rights for refugees and displaced persons around the world.

As a rule, we provide advice in those areas of law in which Hengeler Mueller has particular expertise.

Many of the firm's pro bono engagements have come about through personal contacts and the civic engagement of our lawyers and business services staff.

In addition to the actual work performed for various engagements, Hengeler Mueller is also involved in professional organisations that promote pro bono legal advice in special ways, such as Pro Bono e.V., an association in which many of the larger German law firms have joined forces.

The firm's pro bono work is coordinated by Annika Clauss and Georg Seyfarth, who are the first points of contact for any client enquiries."

Digital Markets Act The DMA will enter into force on 1 November 2022.

It will regulate a small number of large gatekeeper undertakings.

The DMAs obligations include, among other things, providing information to advertisers and publishers, giving end users effective portability of their data free of charge, and providing fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to business users of software application stores, search engines and social networks.

It also imposes prohibitions on combining and cross-using users personal data between their services and between third party services and their own.

Search engine discriminatory rankings and the use of certain price parity clauses are also prohibited for gatekeepers.

Unless a company submits substantiated arguments to demonstrate the contrary, a company is presumed to have gatekeeper status and fall under the scope of the DMA if it: i. provides a core platform service serving as an important gateway for business users to reach end users; ii. has an annual turnover of at least EUR 7.5 billion within the EU in each of the past three financial years or an average market valuation of at least EUR 75 billion in the past financial year, and it provides the same core platform service in at least three Member States; and iii. has on average a minimum of 45 million monthly end users established or located in the EU and at least 10,000 yearly business users established in the EU in each of the previous three financial years.

The DMA will become applicable on 2 May 2023.

From that date, companies must self-assess their gatekeeper status and inform the Commission of this fact, and make any submissions as to why gatekeeper status is not merited (a rebuttal submission).

The Commission must then decide on the companys gatekeeper status within 45 working days and specify which of the gatekeepers core platform services are designated services (e.g., advertising, social networking, app stores, search engines).

The gatekeepers must comply with the applicable DMA obligations within six months of this decision.

The Commission may fine a gatekeeper up to 10% of its worldwide turnover (up to 20% in cases of recidivism and in case of systematic non-compliance; the Commission may also impose a ban on M&A activity).

If a gatekeeper systematically fails to comply with the DMA, the Commission can open a market investigation and, if necessary, impose behavioural or structural remedies.

These are platforms servicing 45 million or more monthly active recipients in the EU on average which the Commission designates based on figures that online platforms must now report once every six months.

Although the bulk of the DSAs obligations will not take effect until 2024, certain reporting obligations for online platforms will apply when the DSA enters into force.

In addition, VLOPs must comply with their DSA obligations within four months of the Commissions designation, even if this is before 1 January 2024.

Member States will need to enact legislation implementing the DSA and lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the DSA.

For VLOPs, the Commission will have direct supervision and enforcement powers and can, in the most serious cases, impose fines of up to 6% of the global turnover.

COMPETITION LAW IN THE DIGITAL AGE COMPETITION LAW IN THE DIGITAL AGE PAGE 3 QUICK LINKS NOVEMBER 2022 EU DIGITAL REGULATION GERMANYS LAW REFORM APPLE FINE REDUCTION AMAZON & APPLES WIN CLOUD SERVICES TURNING THE TIDE  GERMANYS COMPETITION LAW REFORM Only 20 months after the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) was equipped with new tools to impose preventive measures against large digital platforms, Germanys next competition law reform is just around the corner.

The sweeping new changes on the horizon include:  giving the FCO remedial powers following sector inquiries;  setting out the enforcement of the DMA in Germany; and  new measures to facilitate skimming off the benefits stemming from a competition law infringement.

The proposal  not clearly tied to the energy crisis, but which certainly helped to gain political momentum  seeks to give competition law the claws and teeth it supposedly lacks.

In line with recent trends, it deviates from a more evidence-based approach requiring an actual infringement (e.g. abuse of dominance, cartel) and gives more importance to preserving market structures in case of perceived (or feared) distortions of competition.

The proposal is now in intra-government consultation and is expected to be passed before the years end.

Sector Inquiries  a New Competition Tool for the FCO?

Leaning on the experiences of the UK Competition and Markets Authority and the European discussion around a New Competition Tool (later abandoned in favour of the DMA), the draft bill introduces a new and non-sector specific intervention mechanism.

Thereunder, the FCO can impose various remedies up to 18 months after a sector inquiry has been concluded:  Order a merger control notification for below-threshold concentrations (in case of an objectively verifiable indication that it could significantly impede effective competition in one of markets identified in the sector inquiry report).  

In case of a significant, continuous or repeated disturbance of competition, the FCO can inter alia request companies to grant access to interfaces/data, a common standard setting or to supply competitors (e.g. IP rights).  

Under strict conditions and as ultima ratio, the FCO may also breakup undertakings.

DMA enforcement The draft bill will equip the FCO with the power to investigate possible non-compliance of designated gatekeepers with the DMA rules.

However, as the European Commission is the sole authority empowered to enforce the DMA, the investigation results will be only passed on and the FCO cannot impose any sanctions of its own."
Hengeler Mueller,Competition Law in the Digital Age,"However, as the European Commission is the sole authority empowered to enforce the DMA, the investigation results will be only passed on and the FCO cannot impose any sanctions of its own.

Nevertheless, it can be reasonably expected that the FCO will use any, even if small, room to continue to closely monitor the digital space and (Big Tech) companies already on its radar.

The draft bill also foresees relevant provisions to ensure an effective private enforcement of the DMA before German courts.

COMPETITION LAW IN THE DIGITAL AGE PAGE 4 QUICK LINKS NOVEMBER 2022 Skimming off benefits The draft bill also aims at a more effective disgorgement of economic benefits stemming from a competition law infringement.

To do so, the FCO (i) will no longer have to prove intention or negligence of the infringement and (ii) can rely on a (rebuttable) presumption that it caused a benefit of at least 1% of all domestic sales of the products/services connected to the infringement.

The total amount subject to disgorgement will however be capped at 10% of the total annual global turnover in the preceding year.

PARIS COURT OF APPEAL SLASHES RECORD FRENCH ANTITRUST FINE AGAINST APPLE On 6 October 2022, the Paris Court of Appeal handed down its judgment on Apples appeal from the 16 March 2020 decision by the French Competition Authority (FCA), which had fined it a record EUR 1.1 billion in respect of several anti-competitive practices related to its distribution system in France1.

These included (i) product and customer allocation; (ii) resale price maintenance (RPM); and (iii) abuse of economic dependence of its resellers  a rarely used specificity of French commercial law.

The judgment upholds the appeal in part, overturning in particular the FCAs infringement finding on the hotly-debated topic of RPM and slashing the overall fine by two-thirds, while at the same time upholding its findings in respect of the two other alleged infringements, though for a much shorter period.

Price transparency and RPM: guilty until proven innocent?

The case raises the issue of parallel behaviour in a highly transparent market and of proof of collusion in this context.

It was undisputed that there was no contractual provision relating to the imposition of a fixed minimum price by Apple.

However, in a context where Apple itself was very transparent with its own retail prices (through its website and through the communication of an Apple Price List to resellers) and where many resellers applied the same prices, the chicken and egg question for the Court became: did this transparency amount to an invitation to collude, and did the fact that most of Apples resellers did not go below Apples prices show their acceptance, or was this alignment merely the result of market forces and, therefore, competition at work?

The Court concluded the latter.

At a minimum (no pun intended), resellers interpreted Apples prices as a maximum, above which they could not realistically go.

No harm there - and reasonably understandable where customers are well informed and shop around before purchasing.

As to whether they could have charged a lower price?

In theory yes: there was nothing in the contracts limiting their pricing freedom, no policing of prices by Apple, and resellers were free to manage their promotional activities.

The fact that they rarely did go below Apples prices in practice was, rather, due to their already low margins and the result of effective competition.

This serves as a reminder that, even where facts point to a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour, the principle remains that one must be innocent until proven guilty."
Hengeler Mueller,Competition Law in the Digital Age,"This serves as a reminder that, even where facts point to a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour, the principle remains that one must be innocent until proven guilty.

In the context of parallel behaviour, where alternative explanations to collusion exist, the competition authority must establish this most basic yet fundamental element of an anti-competitive agreement, i.e. the concurrence of wills.

1

The FCA also fined Apples two wholesale distributors in France, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, EUR 76.1 million and EUR 62.9 million respectively, who also both appealed the decision and were largely successful.

These appeals are not discussed in detail in this article.

COMPETITION LAW IN THE DIGITAL AGE PAGE 6 QUICK LINKS NOVEMBER 2022 Big Apple Apples other major win on appeal relates to the way the FCA calculated the fine and, in particular, the uplift of 90% it applied for deterrence, on account of Apples size and financial strength.

Such a move was wholly unprecedented and, in its appeal, Apple noted that at EU level, even Google had only had a 30% uplift in the Google Shopping case.

The Court agreed.

The principle of proportionality applies even to the biggest of behemoths and, while maintaining the principle of an uplift to give effect to the penalty, the Court considered that on the facts, an uplift of 50% was sufficient to meet the objective of deterrence.2 An apple a day is not enough: managing supply shortages in Apples distribution system Notwithstanding these wins for Apple, the Court upheld the FCAs findings in respect of two of the three alleged infringements: both relate to Apples allocation of volumes to its various distribution channels, in the context of frequent product shortages and competition from Apples own direct distribution channel, online and through the Apple Retail Store.

With respect to its wholesalers, Apple was found to have engaged in both customer allocation between its wholesalers and product allocation among resellers at the downstream level, which the FCA found was both a hard-core restriction under the Vertical Guidelines and, on the facts, a by-object restriction of competition.

While Apple argued that it had only recommended an order of priority for deliveries, in order to ensure that its products were distributed evenly during regular periods of shortages, the FCA and the Court found that Apples interventions in its wholesalers client relationships went beyond mere recommendations.

Further, they found that there could be nothing fair nor pro-competitive about this system which continued even in the absence of shortages which were, in any event, largely of Apples own making.

With respect to its Premium Resellers, the supply shortages which they repeatedly faced, while products were readily available through Apples direct distribution network, was held to be discriminatory and  exceptionally - an abuse of resellers economic dependence.

For these resellers, Apple was found to be an unavoidable trading partner by virtue of its brand, the overall proportion of Apple products in their turnover (close to 80% on average), and the unavailability of viable alternatives (given in particular, the investments made by these resellers into selling Apple products, and their customers loyalty to the brand).

Importantly, this seldom-used specificity of French commercial law does not require the company to be dominant.

Two down, two to go Having won on two fronts and lost on two, Apple has announced it will appeal the judgment to the French Supreme Court.

At stake for the company in particular is the novelty of its distribution system.

Damningly, the Court noted that Apples distribution system presented many of the characteristics of a selective distribution system or of franchising (i.e. with strict criteria that resellers must adhere to and important related point-of-sale investments), without offering any of the related protections and benefits."
Hengeler Mueller,Competition Law in the Digital Age,"For others watching, the case will be of relevance far beyond the sphere of tech companies and the ongoing debate around the DMA, as it shows that vertical agreements continue to be a hot topic of competition law.

The Court similarly reduced the uplifts applied to the fines on Ingram Micro and Tech Data, to 10% and 8% respectively (down from an original 60% and 50%).

COMPETITION LAW IN THE DIGITAL AGE PAGE 7 QUICK LINKS NOVEMBER 2022 LAZIO COURT OVERTURNS COMPETITION FINES IMPOSED ON AMAZON AND APPLE On 3 October 2022, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court overturned the approx.

EUR 200 million fine imposed by the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) on Amazon and Apple.

The ICA had imposed the fine on the companies for allegedly restricting unauthorised resellers of Apple and Beats products from accessing Amazon.it.

More precisely, the overturned fine concerned a clause in a 2018 agreement between Apple and Amazon whereby the sale of Apple and Beats products via Amazon Marketplace was reserved to Apple Premium Resellers  i.e., the category of resellers that meet the highest quality and investment standards within Apples distribution system  in order to limit counterfeiting.

The Lazio Regional Administrative Courts decision is particularly interesting because it places the two companies right of defence at the heart of its reasoning.

Indeed, after having ordered the joinder of the appeals, the court did not examine any of the substantive arguments put forward by the parties (e.g., the vertical nature of the agreement, benefits for consumers, and the definition of the relevant market) but rather concentrated its analysis on two procedural complaints.

Breach of the limitation period for initiating proceedings Although the court considered the 90-day limitation period not to be directly applicable, it ruled that the ICA is required to initiate preliminary investigation phases within a reasonable time, in relation to the complexity of the case concerned, under penalty of violating the principles of legality and good performance that must always distinguish its work.

The degree of reasonableness of the time taken to initiate proceedings is determined in large part by the time needed to acquire and analyse the elements necessary to have a full and legitimate picture of the dispute.

In this case, on 22 February 2019, Digitech notified the ICA that Amazon had removed from the Italian marketplace all resellers that  despite lawfully selling Apple products  did not belong to the official programme of authorised resellers.

However, the ICA did not open its investigation until 21 July 2020.

Consequently, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court held that the parties complaint alleging breach of the limitation period for initiating proceedings was well founded and stated that the ICA could have acquired all the information necessary to outline the basic elements of the unlawful act  and thus decide whether to initiate the subsequent investigation phase  in a much shorter time than the time that actually elapsed, during which no activities were carried out.

Infringement of the parties right of defence due to the excessively tight time limit for concluding observations The ICAs preliminary findings were disclosed on 30 July 2021, and the parties were given the statutory 30-day time limit to respond.

The parties immediately requested an extension and were granted an additional 15 days.

However, the parties were not given access to the economic data in the notice of investigation findings until 24 August 2021, when the ICA set-up a special data room.

The parties were therefore unable to obtain a complete picture of the situation until after a significant part of the time limit had elapsed."
Hengeler Mueller,Competition Law in the Digital Age,"The parties were therefore unable to obtain a complete picture of the situation until after a significant part of the time limit had elapsed.

The Lazio Regional Administrative Court ruled that this constituted a clear restriction of the parties right of defence  especially in view of the complexity of the ICAs assessment, the amount of the fine imposed, and the very long duration of the preliminary investigation and investigation phases.

EU DIGITAL REGULATION GERMANYS LAW REFORM APPLE FINE REDUCTION AMAZON & APPLES WIN CLOUD SERVICES COMPETITION LAW IN THE DIGITAL AGE PAGE 8 QUICK LINKS NOVEMBER 2022 DUTCH COMPETITION AUTHORITY PUBLISHES MARKET STUDY ON CLOUD SERVICES Cloud services are essentially IT services that are offered over the internet.

These services are related to hiring flexible capacity in data centres for computational power, storage and software purposes.

The pay-as-you-use model associated with cloud services enables users to scale up or down easily.

Different cloud services are offered on different layers (e.g., Infrastructure-as-a-Service IaaS, Software- as-a-Service SaaS, Platform-as-a-Service PaaS).

Considering the important role played by cloud services in the Dutch economy, the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) launched the first phase of its cloud services market study in May 2021, focusing on gathering technical knowledge about the market.

Now after this preliminary evaluation, the ACM has completed its market study and highlighted some potential competition concerns which require further review.

The ACMs identifies vendor lock-in, as a potential concern.

Lock-in effects can be exacerbated by limitations on data portability (i.e. the ability of users to transfer data) and interoperability (i.e. the ability of different cloud services to work together).

This may have an effect on the ability of users to switch cloud service providers or to multi-cloud by combining services of different providers.

Such a lock-in effect is related to technical switching barriers (interconnectedness of services, lack of data portability) and financial switching barriers (complex tariff structure and cost of taking data out of the cloud, referred to as egress fees).

According to the ACM, a lock-in effect is at times related to limited interoperability and users may have less freedom to combine services of different cloud service providers.

On the flipside, the ACM notes that selecting one specific cloud provider with an integrated offering can result in quality and price benefits for users.

The ACM mentions quality benefits resulting from a single providers services working together optimally.

Price benefits such as volume discount are equally possible.

For example, certain services are provided free of charge or at a discount if multiple services are purchased.

According to the ACM, the current growth in the cloud services sector coupled with the importance of securing new users greatly reduces risks to key competition parameters such as price, quality or innovation.

The ACM expects cloud service providers to continue providing high-quality services at competitive prices noting that providers are presently committed to the further improvement of their product and service offering.

Another potential issue identified by the ACM relates to possible leveraging by larger, vertically integrated cloud providers who may bundle services on different layers.

ACM points out that the biggest integrated cloud providers can acquire a strong position across different cloud layers, possibly by leveraging their positions in certain layers onto other layers.

However, where there is effective competition at the initial tendering stage for cloud services, the integration of services may be of a lesser concern.

The ACM points out that at the first moment of choice, there is usually strong competition."
Hengeler Mueller,Competition Law in the Digital Age,"The ACM points out that at the first moment of choice, there is usually strong competition.

For example, cloud providers offer credits and free trials allowing users to familiarize with different cloud services before making a choice.

The ACM is not alone in its quest to identify perceived imperfections in the market for cloud services.

This rapidly growing sector is on the radar of other regulators, as well.

For instance, the French Autorit de la concurrence commenced its market study into cloud services in January 2022 and later launched a public consultation seeking input on specific practices that it intends to investigate.

Across the Channel, the United Kingdoms Office of Communications has very recently initiated a market study examining the position of Amazon, Microsoft and Google in the UKs 15bn cloud services market.

The market power of the larger market participants was also the focus of one of the first market studies of cloud services, commissioned by Japans competition authority.

Elsewhere, the Korean competition authority is assessing competition issues as part of its own market inquiry into the cloud sector.

There are also examples of specific investigations into cloud services: for example, the European Commission is examining complaints by NextCloud and OVHcloud concerning Microsofts cloud services offerings.

Consequently, Microsoft has proposed remedies to alleviate concerns raised by its competitors.

In the realm of merger control, the UKs CMA has stressed that Microsofts proposed acquisition of Activision may potentially harm competition in cloud gaming.

Previously, in September 2020, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) announced investigations against three of the leading cloud computing service providers, namely, Google (for Google Drive service), Apple (for iCloud service) and Dropbox.

Traditional competition enforcement in the market for cloud services will soon be complemented by the DMA and the proposed EU Data Act.

Cloud computing services are categorized as a core platform service under the DMA and designated gatekeepers cannot impair effective end-user data portability or restrict the ability of end users to switch.

Other than the DMA, the draft EU Data Act also provides for data portability obligations.

Nonetheless, the ACM has proposed amendments to the Data Act explicitly requiring cloud providers to also make interoperability possible.

The Digital Economy is clearly on the ACMs agenda and business users should further take note of the ACMs draft guidelines regarding rules for online platforms and search engines in connection with the EU Platform to Business regulation.

Hengeler Mueller,Securing the gas supply in light of the Russia-Ukraine crisis,"The Ukraine conflict has led to a substantial curtailment of the gas deliveries from Russia, resulting in high prices on the gas market.

Since the risk of the situation deteriorating further cannot be ruled out, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) unveiled an additional package of energy-securing measures on 21 July 2022 that basically has three components: raising gas storage facilities' filling level targets, cutting natural gas consumption in electricity generation, and expanding the measures to boost energy efficiency and saving.

The measures are to be implemented step-by-step in the coming weeks and after the summer recess.

Already on 23 June 2022, the BMWK declared the second of the three crisis levels under Germany's Emergency Plan for Gas.

Now, at this ""alert"" stage, which followed the announcement of the ""early warning"" level on 30 March 2022, there is a disruption of the gas supply or an exceptionally high demand for gas which has resulted in a significant deterioration of the gas supply situation.

In this scenario, however, the market is still able to manage the situation without the need to apply non-market-based measures.

Only at the ""emergency"" level can the government intervene directly because the gas supply would no longer be sufficient to meet the remaining demand for gas in spite of all relevant market-based measures having been implemented.

In an emergency, the Federal Network Agency (FNA) assumes the role of national supply coordinator and may take sovereign measures to increase gas production or imports on the supply side or reduce gas consumption on the demand side.

One possible measure would be ordering the reduction of gas consumption.

According to the FNA, there are no abstract criteria that can be used to determine which companies may be affected by a gas consumption reduction.

Instead, the FNA would decide after balancing relevant interests in such a way as to avoid or compensate for any under-supply in the gas supply network.

However, in its 17 May 2022 notification on the supply distribution of gas, the FNA identified concrete measures that could be taken to increase gas production and imports as well as to decrease the demand for gas, including the possibility of ordering gas consumption reductions on non-protected end consumers, including industry consumers.

In the notification, the FNA outlines certain criteria to be considered if an order to reduce gas consumption is being contemplated, in particular whether or not the relevant consumers are essential to ensuring that vital needs are met.

The key legal framework to Germany's Emergency Plan for Gas is provided by Regulation (EU) No 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation EU No 994/2010 (the SoS Regulation – the three crisis levels mentioned above are defined in Article 11 (1)).

On a national level, the SoS Regulation is implemented by the Energy Industry Act (EnWG), the Energy Security Act 1975 (EnSiG) and the Regulation on Securing Gas Supplies in the Event of a Supply Crisis (GasSV).

With an amendment of the EnSiG in May 2022, Sec. 24 of the law has created a price adjustment mechanism in order to prevent companies along the energy supply chain from collapsing in the event gas prices become extremely high.

For this mechanism to be used, the FNA must have determined that overall gas import quantities to Germany have dropped significantly, and that finding must be published in Germany's Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ).

This has not yet happened.

As an alternative to the price adjustment rights under Sec. 24 EnSiG, in early July 2022, Sec. 26 EnSiG gave the Federal Government the authority to issue an ordinance instituting a surcharge mechanism for a ""balanced price adjustment"" ("" saldierte Preisanpassung "").

That authority can be used as soon as a significant reduction in the quantities of gas imported to Germany is imminent."
Hengeler Mueller,Securing the gas supply in light of the Russia-Ukraine crisis,"That authority can be used as soon as a significant reduction in the quantities of gas imported to Germany is imminent.

The ""balanced price adjustment"" pursuant to Sec. 

26 EnSiG is designed to enable energy companies to allocate their additional costs for procuring gas equally to all gas customers.

On 22 July 2022, the Federal Government announced that it intends to utilise this authority and, from no later than 1 October 2022 onwards, to allow gas importers to pass on 90% of the increased procurement costs to gas consumers by means of a surcharge procedure.

The ordinance is currently being drafted.

Companies are advised to collect and substantiate as early as possible the necessary information that may be relevant for the FNA's decisions whether or not to order a reduction of gas consumption.

In particular, it is sensible for companies to assess the impact that a gas supply reduction would have on the goods they produce that serve vital needs of the public.

Either in case of a gas shortage or as an entirely preventive measure, companies should provide the relevant information to the FNA so that the authority can consider it in potential future decisions on gas consumption reductions.

At present, the FNA considers the gas supply in Germany to be stable, but the overall situation to be tense and very volatile.

After the maintenance work on Nord Stream 1 was completed, the gas flows from the pipeline were at around 40% of maximum capacity.

A reduction of delivery quantities to 20% was announced on 27 July 2022.

As the current factual and legal situation is evolving so rapidly, our assessment might change.

At the European level, there are also designs to reduce the risks that might arise from a complete stoppage of Russian gas deliveries through an emergency gas plan that sets out an array of measures.

Although the EU Commission's 20 July 2022 proposal for an emergency gas plan was agreed upon by the EU energy ministers on 26 July 2022, it includes considerably more exemptions and higher hurdles for the introduction of binding gas savings targets.

The planned EU regulation provides for the national consumption of gas to be reduced voluntarily by 15% from August 2022 to March 2023.

In the event of a major supply crunch, an EU-wide alarm is to be sounded and binding savings targets set by the EU Council.

If you have any specific questions on the legal regulatory framework for the gas supply, please reach out to one of our experts."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: New Year, Same Problems? – Altice and the Fine Line of Pre-Closing Covenants","January 2024 BRUSSELS  JOUR New Year, Same Problems?  

Altice and the Fine Line of Pre-Closing Covenants Happy New Year, and welcome to our first Brussels  Jour issue in 2024!

We hope you had a wonderful holiday season and a great start to the new year, which we are certain will be an exciting one for EU competition law.

After our traditional Christmas edition brought you a review of the most important developments in 2023 and an outlook for 2024, in this issue, we delve deeper into a major recent decision of the European Court of Justice: Its judgement on Altices appeal of the General Courts decision, mostly confirming the Commissions fine decision.

So lets talk gun-jumping.

(Spoiler alert: While the ruling does bring some important consequences for the transaction practice, you probably dont have to rewrite your pre-closing covenants as a result of it.)

The Case Before the Court of Justice The roots of the case reach back to 2014, when Altice, a Dutch cable and telecommuni- cations company, signed an SPA with Oi SA, according to which Altice would acquire PT Portugal, a Portuguese telecommunications operator.

The SPA provided that the implemen- tation of the deal was subject to, inter alia, the Commissions merger control clearance and, as usual, contained several (not necessarily usual) pre-closing covenants.

In the spring of 2015, the Commission cleared the transaction (after Altice had made di- vestment commitments), and Altice announced its closing.

Yet, a few months later, the Commission launched a formal gun-jumping investigation into the matter and, in April 2018, determined that Altice had indeed violated Articles 4(1) EUMR, which obliges parties to notify relevant transactions before their implementation, and 7(1) EUMR, which forbids parties from implementing transactions before notification or clearance.

The Commission found fault in the veto rights that the SPA had granted Altice over PT Portugal and in the exchange of sensitive information between the two companies.

Based on this, the Com- mission set a (then) record fine of EUR 124.5 million, EUR 62.25 million for each violation (this record was shattered in the summer of 2023, when the Commission fined Illumina EUR 432 million for gun-jumping).

Markus Rhrig, Christian Dankerl and Christoph Sielmann report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

January 2024 2 Altice brought the case before the General Court, which only slightly reduced the fine by 10% and only for the Article 4(1)

EUMR violation (i.e., about EUR 6 million), arguing that Altice had proactively informed the Commission of the planned transaction weeks before the SPA was signed.

Altice appealed the General Courts decision.

After the Advo- cate General had supported the General Courts view, the Court of Justice mostly affirmed the ruling, too, only reducing the fine for the violation of Article 4(1)

EUMR by another (approximately) EUR 3 million.

Same Same But Different  The Parallelism of Articles 4(1) and 7(1) EUMR As a central line of its argument, Altice challenged the Commissions ability to impose separate fines for violations of Articles 4(1) and 7(1) EUMR, arguing that they both pursued the same objective as part of an ex-ante merger control system, and that the Commissions approach violated the principle of prohibition of double punishment, or ne bis in idem.

The Court of Justice rejected this argument:  

Firstly, the Court held that while a breach of the obligation to notify a transaction (Article 4(1) EUMR) automatically entailed a breach of the standstill obligation (Article 7(1) EUMR), and the two provisions were linked, it remained possible to infringe Article 7(1) EUMR without breaching Article 4(1)

EUMR:

The parties may well notify a trans- action, but then implement it before receiving clearance.

The Court, thus, confirmed its judgement in Marine Harvest."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: New Year, Same Problems? – Altice and the Fine Line of Pre-Closing Covenants","EUMR:

The parties may well notify a trans- action, but then implement it before receiving clearance.

The Court, thus, confirmed its judgement in Marine Harvest.

Based on these differences, the Court argued that the two provisions pursued autonomous purposes.  

The Court argued, secondly, that the imposition of two fines for the same material con- duct by a single fine decision did not violate the ne bis in idem principle.

The court again confirmed its judgement in Marine Harvest in which it had reiterated that the principle only prevented the repetition of fine proceedings concerning the same material conduct that had previously been subject to a final fine decision.  

The Court, thirdly, emphasized that Article 4(1) EUMR contained an obligation to act, while Article 7(1) contained an obligation not to act, and that a breach of the former was instantaneous in nature, while a breach of the latter was of a continuous kind (lasting from the first implementation measure until clearance is obtained).

Ultimately, the Court concluded, even if the two provisions might have some overlap, the Commission was entitled to determine two separate infringements and impose two separate fines with a single fine decision.

Accordingly, the Commission had not infringed the ne bis in idem principle either.

However, in this context, the Court also gave Altice the one small bright spot of the ruling: Given the different durations of the two violations, the Court argued, the Commission had not sufficiently explained, and the General Court had not sufficiently ascertained, why the two fines were identical in amount.

The Court of Justice, however, also made it clear that in general, the infringements of the two provisions might be charged with identical fines.

January 2024 3 Veto Rights and Information Exchange  The Substance of the Gun- Jumping Allegations In line with the Commission and the General Court, the Court of Justice found, firstly, that the SPAs pre-closing covenants effectively enabled Altice to exercise decisive influence over PT Portugals business, and that Altice actually exercised this influence.

The relevant covenants provided that PT Portugal had to ask Altice for their consent before adopting numerous decisions regarding its business operations, commercial policy, and manage- ment structure.

The Court also highlighted that Altice could claim compensation for any violation of these covenants.

The General Court had found that these clauses had gone beyond what was necessary to protect PT Portugals value until closing of the acquisition.

The Court of Justice did not dispute this finding.

In this context, the Court also made clear that a partial implementation of the concen- tration could already violate Articles 4(1) and 7(1) EUMR, and that it was the change of control that must be lasting, but that even conduct that is only temporary may contribute to such lasting change.

Secondly, the Court of Justice affirmed the General Court in finding that the exchange of sensitive information further contributed as evidence to the finding that Altice had deci- sive influence over PT Portugal.

The Court argued that information exchange was not solely governed by Article 101 TFEU and Regulation 1/2003, but also fell within the scope of the EUMR.

Since the Commission had looked at the incidents of information exchange only as contributory evidence, the Court did not have to decide whether or not, and under what circumstances, information exchange in itself may qualify as a standalone gun-jumping violation, leaving this question to be answered in future decisions.

Finding That Fine Line  Avoiding Gun-Jumping While Safeguarding  Legitimate Pre-Closing Interests The Court of Justices Altice judgement brings clarity in that it confirms the Commis- sions tough stance on gun-jumping (most recently underlined by the Commissions Illu- mina/Grail decision)."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: New Year, Same Problems? – Altice and the Fine Line of Pre-Closing Covenants","In particular, the Courts affirmation of the Commissions view that gun-jumping can separately infringe Article 4(1) and Article 7(1) EUMR potentially doubles the amounts of fines.

Yet, the ruling, unfortunately, does not bring (or, to be fair, could not bring, given the case before the Court) much clarity as to what precisely qualifies as gun-jumping, neither with respect to pre-closing covenants nor to exchange of information: The abstract legal require- ments have long been established, and the Altice judgement does not change them  the covenants at issue in the Altice case were indeed quite extensive, and their categorization as gun-jumping doesnt really come as a surprise.

So if your pre-closing covenants were lawful pre-Altice, they remain so post-Altice.

This is the good news for the transaction practice.

The bad news is that there remains a gray area where it is not entirely clear where gun-jumping begins and where legitimate safeguarding ends.

January 2024 4 All of this reinforces the importance for parties to be cautious when drafting pre-closing covenants and sharing information between signing and closing.

After all, whether or not a sellers pre-closing covenants could potentially violate the obligation to notify and/or the obligation not to implement the transaction before having obtained merger control clearance will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind that the legitimate aim of the sellers pre-closing covenants is to protect the target businesss value until closing against measures taken outside the ordinary course of business, but at the same time, it must ensure that the target can operate its ordinary course business until closing independently from the acquirer.

Hengeler Mueller,New Whistleblower Protection Act in Germany,"On 12 May 2023, the Whistleblower Protection Act ( Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz ) has passed the German legislative process and will now be forwarded to the Federal President for promulgation as part of the ""Bill for improving the protection of whistleblowers and implementing the EU Directive on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law"".

The law will enter into force one month after its promulgation, presumably in June 2023.

The first attempts to adopt the Whistleblower Protection Act failed earlier this year, when Germany's second legislative chamber (the Bundesrat ) rejected its approval.

After months of political controversy the governing coalition and the main opposition party as well as the legislative chambers now reached common ground to improve whistleblower protection.

To this end, the Whistleblower Protection Act provides for far-reaching organisational and procedural obligations for German-based companies: The Whistleblower Protection Act has a broad scope.

It applies if individuals become aware of information concerning violations in an occupational context.

Violations include: criminal offences, administrative offences (provided that the violated provisions protect life, limb, health, or the rights of workers or their representative bodies) and violations of EU and national laws in certain areas such as environmental protection or consumer protection, as well as abusive tax structuring.

The violations have to be committed in carrying out official duties, economic activities or occupational activities.

Being aware of information relating to a violation does not require having actual knowledge of a committed violation.

Instead, a reasonable suspicion of a violation that is very likely to be committed in the future, or even efforts to conceal a violation, are deemed sufficient for the new law to apply.

For employers, this creates a material risk of employees lawfully leaking highly sensitive business information based on reasonable, but unfounded suspicions, i.e. without any violation whatsoever actually occurring.

In principle, all German-based employers with at least 50 employees have to set up and operate internal reporting channels.

Private employers with 50 to 249 employees have until 17 December 2023 to set up the required structures.

Certain industries, e.g. investment service providers and capital management companies, have to set up reporting channels immediately irrespective of their size, once the new law enters into force.

Internal reporting channels can be operated either by the employer's sufficiently qualified staff, or by a third party.

Employers with 50 to 249 employees can also set up joint reporting channels together with other employers, while larger employers have to operate their own reporting channel.

According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the law, group companies can implement a group-wide central reporting channel if further conditions are met.

Internal reporting channels should also process anonymous reports, although there is no obligation to design the reporting channels in a way that they allow the submission of anonymous reports.

Certain federal and state authorities have to implement external reporting channels.

Whistleblowers may choose whether to report internally or externally but are encouraged to use internal channels where a violation can be effectively remediated internally and no retaliation has to be apprehended.

Employers, as well as public authorities receiving a report, have to provide feedback to the whistleblower within quite strict timelines and take appropriate follow-up measures, which may include the opening of an internal investigation or referral of the proceedings to a competent authority.

In external reporting, the public authority may compel the company concerned to provide information.

All reports must be documented in a permanently retrievable manner."
Hengeler Mueller,New Whistleblower Protection Act in Germany,"In external reporting, the public authority may compel the company concerned to provide information.

All reports must be documented in a permanently retrievable manner.

In principle, the information has to be deleted three years after completion of the process but may be kept for longer if required to comply with legal obligations in a proportionate way.

The identity of the whistleblower must be kept confidential throughout the entire process of follow-up measures, unless one of the narrow exceptions under the new law applies.

If the whistleblower does not receive appropriate feedback from the public authority on the report in good time, he/she may lawfully disclose the relevant information to the general public.

The same disclosure right applies in other circumstances defined by the law, e.g. in cases where the whistleblower may face retaliation in the context of external reporting.

The law provides several protections for whistleblowers.

For these to apply, it is sufficient that the whistleblower has reason to believe that the information to be reported or disclosed is true, irrespective of whether it actually is or not.

The protections afforded to whistleblowers under the new law include an exclusion of liability and a prohibition of retaliation.

Employers who retaliate have to compensate the whistleblower concerned for the damage suffered including compensation for non-pecuniary losses.

If an employer takes measures that adversely affect a whistleblower and the whistleblower asserts that this is due to his reporting, the law provides for an assumption that the employer has illegally retaliated against the whistleblower, shifting the burden of proof onto the employer to demonstrate that the measures were legally justified or unrelated to the whistleblowing.

The law also provides for a comprehensive list of fines.

A fine of up to €50,000 may be imposed for hindering or attempting to hinder reporting.

The same applies to any retaliation, as well as to unjustified disclosures of the whistleblower’s identity.

In the latter circumstance, even a reckless or negligent violation can be punished.

A fine of €20,000 can be imposed in the event that the employer fails to set up internal reporting channels, or does so inadequately – however, this provision will only enter into force six months after the remainder of the law has entered into force.

In certain circumstances, fines may be increased tenfold for companies."
Hengeler Mueller,Is there no Corporate Criminal Liability in Germany? Not exactly.,"Before the German federal election in 2021, there was much public debate about the former government's draft Corporate Sanctions Act, which aimed to introduce a new framework for prosecuting and sanctioning companies.

The bill did not pass the Bundestag and while the current government has also announced that it wants to reform this area of law, it plans to make only targeted adjustments to the existing legal framework.

Contrary to what this development might suggest, it is important to understand that the current legal situation in Germany already allows for the imposition of corporate fines for criminal or administrative offences – and in recent years, prosecutors and courts have been using this tool more and more frequently.

Requirements for corporate fines Under German law, companies cannot be defendants in criminal proceedings, because only individuals can commit offences.

That is the basis for the often-used maxim that there is no corporate criminal liability in Germany.

However, there is a statute that allows the imposition of an administrative fine against companies (Sec. 30 of the German Act on Administrative Offences (OWiG)).

Such a corporate fine can be levied if a person with a ""managerial position"" has committed a criminal or administrative offence, as a result of which duties of the company have been violated, or where the company has been enriched or was intended to be enriched.

A managerial position includes persons with supervisory and control powers relating to a specific area of the company, such as executives, directors, and certain heads of divisions and departments.

Criteria for a managerial position are personnel, budget or departmental responsibility, and the power to represent the company.

Corporate fines can also be levied on foreign companies.

Although this may pose practical problems, such as international enforcement, it is done on a regular basis.

Offences by employees not holding a managerial position do not trigger a corporate fine.

However, in such cases, prosecutors often invoke a breach of supervisory duty by someone with a managerial position.

Breach of the latter is an administrative offence that is committed if someone omits to take the supervisory measures required to prevent business-related criminal or administrative offences within the company, when the underlying offence would have been prevented, or made much more difficult, if there had been proper supervision.

Where a regular employee has committed an offence, prosecutors therefore usually claim that there was a lack of supervision by management, allowing them to impose a fine on the company.

Amount of corporate fines For an underlying criminal offence, the current maximum corporate fine is 10 million euros for intentional violations and 5 million euros for negligent violations.

This is also the case for violations of supervisory duty where the underlying offence is a crime.

This rather low amount has been one of the main criticisms of the current framework and the draft Corporate Sanctions Act suggested raising the maximum fine to 10 per cent of the company's annual turnover.

However, the maximum fines for administrative offences in certain areas of regulation, for example antitrust, capital markets, data protection and anti-money laundering, already amount to a certain percentage of the company's annual turnover.

Notably for larger companies, this leads to the paradoxical consequence that administrative offences can result in higher corporate fines than related criminal offences.

Proceeds from an underlying offence can also be confiscated beyond any statutory maximum fine.

The confiscated amount will be included in the total fine.

This has resulted in corporate fines reaching hundreds of millions of euros, despite the statutory maximum for these offences being 5 million euros."
Hengeler Mueller,Is there no Corporate Criminal Liability in Germany? Not exactly.,"This has resulted in corporate fines reaching hundreds of millions of euros, despite the statutory maximum for these offences being 5 million euros.

The extent to which the maximum permissible amount of a fine is limited in an individual case depends on the gravity of the offence and the economic circumstances of the company.

Consideration will also be given to whether the company has taken appropriate compliance measures and to what extent it has cooperated with the authorities.

Competent authority and proceeding There is no central federal agency competent to prosecute companies.

With regard to underlying criminal offences, more than 100 local public prosecutors’ offices at state level are also competent to prosecute companies.

However, only a criminal court can impose a corporate fine in such cases.

For underlying administrative offences, the competent regulatory authority can prosecute companies and impose a corporate fine.

In tax law, for example, this would be the local tax office.

However, the prosecutor's office can always take over the case.

If a corporate fine is based on a breach of supervisory duty which is linked to an underlying criminal offence, the local public prosecutor's office prosecutes and levies the corporate fine.

Accordingly, proceedings against companies where fines are levied can be concluded prior to a potential criminal trial against the responsible individuals.

On the other hand, fines for breaches of supervisory duty linked to an administrative offence can be imposed by the competent regulatory authority, if the prosecutor's office does not take over the matter.

As a general rule, in contrast to criminal proceedings against individuals, it is at the discretion of the competent authority or court whether or not to prosecute and sanction companies.

The draft Corporate Sanctions Act also aimed to introduce mandatory proceedings against companies.

But in practice, prosecutor's offices, especially those in bigger cities, have been prosecuting companies under the existing rules for quite some time.

Summary While the government has not specified what changes it wants to make, in practice, German and foreign companies can already be subject to heavy fines as prosecutors claim that there is a lack of supervision in order to impose them.

To protect themselves, in particular against accusations of having violated their supervisory duties, companies must have adequate compliance programs in place, and in the case of investigations against employees, they should develop a corporate defence strategy at an early stage."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"July 2023 1 LEGAL UPDATE | DISPUTE RESOLUTION New representative action regime passed into law On 7 July 2023, Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, passed the Act to implement the EU Representative Actions Directive1.

Until the very end, the Act had been the subject of intense discussions between the coalition parties.

The European Commission had meanwhile initiated an infringement procedure against Germany for failing to transpose the Directive into national law on time2.

The new statutory provisions are to enter into force after the German upper house, the Bundesrat, deliberates on them in autumn 2023.

The new law3 will result in a reorganisation of the German collective redress system, which has to date only been rudimentary.

The linchpin of the Act is the 'Consumer Rights En- forcement Act' ('VDuG'), which is to implement the Directive's provisions on the institution of a representative action for redress measures mechanism.

Since the model declaratory action, which was only introduced in 2018, has not proven to be particularly prolific, the new representative action is intended to eliminate significant deficits of the current legal protection system.

Unlike the model declaratory action, which to date has allowed the courts only to make legal determinations applicable to a large number of plaintiffs, the VDuG introduces a representative action for redress (such as the payment of damages).

The redress sought with a representative action is intended to benefit consumers directly, without them having to initiate additional individual proceedings.

Consumer protection associations first and foremost will be entitled to file representative actions.

The entity bringing the action can choose whether to seek a redress measure, an injunctive measure or merely a determina- 1 Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2020 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing Directive 2009/22/EC (the ""Directive"").

VDuG.

A revised version of the KapMuG has been announced for the period thereafter.

Companies must prepare themselves for comprehensive changes: in addition to the action for redress measures, which can also be brought as a cross-border representative action, the new law provides for innovations in inter alia the third-party funding of the entities entitled to bring these actions, the suspension of the limitation period for the claims asserted and the disclosure of evidence.

I. Conditions for the new representative action 1.

Broad scope of applicability The Directive limits the mandatory scope of application of the representative action to infringements of certain provisions of European consumer protection law (in particular in the areas of data protection, financial services, energy, environment, telecommunication, health, digital services and product liability).

The VDuG goes beyond these provisions and extends the scope of application of representative actions to include all civil law disputes between traders and consumers (cf. Sec. 1 (1) VDuG).

Thus, claims in tort will also be cov- ered under the new law.

This reflects what has been the legal situation to date with regard to the model declaratory action, while expanding the scope of application for actions for injunctions under the German Act on Injunctive Relief (Unterlassungsklagegesetz).

For a representative action to be permissible, the association bringing the action must verifiably demonstrate that at least 50 consumers may be affected by the representative action.

What legal standard is associated with 'verifiably demonstrate' is an unanswered question.

In contrast to the draft version of the Act, which provided for a demonstration to the satisfaction of the court (Glaubhaftmachung) pursuant to Sec.

294 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), the final version of the provision will likely mean a simplified standard of proof from consumer protection associations' perspective.

In addition, actions brought by capital market investors could also fall within the scope of the Act.

To date, these were governed solely by the KapMuG. The VDuG does not address the issue of a potential competition between it and the KapMuG. In any event, it seems Content I. Conditions for the new representative action  2 II.

Furthermore, as the agreement between the current German Government's coalition part- ners already provides, the representative action will also be open to small businesses.

Small businesses are defined in the Act as businesses with less than 10 employees and with an annual turnover or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR two million (cf. Sec. 1 (2) VDuG).

An intrinsic right of trade associations to file representative actions is not provided for in the VDuG. 2."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"An intrinsic right of trade associations to file representative actions is not provided for in the VDuG. 2.

'Similarity' of the claims One of the central requirements for a representative action to be permissible is that the claims that at least 50 consumers are enforcing by means of the representative action must be similar (gleichartig) (Sec. 15 (1) VDuG).

This is deemed the case if the claims are based essentially on the same or comparable facts, and the same factual issues and questions of law are essentially relevant for the decision regarding such claims (Sec. 15 (1) nos.

1, 2 VDuG).

According to the Act's explanatory memorandum, a degree of similarity is required that allows for a 'template-like' (schablonenhaft) examination of the claims.

To illustrate the required similarity, the explanatory memorandum lists as examples (1) compensa- tion claims asserted under the European Air Passenger Rights Regulation for one and the same flight and (2) the fulfilment of claims for back payments of interest that arise due to (a bank's) invalid general terms and conditions.

The explanatory memorandum does not consider claims to be similar, however, if they become time-barred at different points in time or if they are based to a decisive extent on the knowledge of the actual consumer.

The similarity of claims is also deemed to be lacking if not all products of a series are defective, and if it has to be clarified in each individual case whether the relevant product purchased is actually defective or not.

It will be interesting to see how the German courts interpret the similarity requirement.

The explanatory memorandum originally suggested a narrow understanding of the term.

The fact that the explanatory memorandum of the Act's draft refers specifically to air passenger compensation claims, where individual case-related considerations are hard to imagine, shows the difficulties involved in examining the similarity of the claims.

For that reason, during the legislative process, the Bundestag took up a suggestion from the Bundesrat and has now set down that claims must be 'essentially' similar.

The intent is that this will enable an appropriate examination on a case-by-case basis.

In principle, German courts will have to examine each consumer's claim separately in order to assess similarity.

The question of which standard of 'similarity' is to be applied will foreseeably become an issue to be dealt with by the European Court of Justice in view of the importance for the efficient conduct of proceedings4.

If the claims are not similar, plaintiffs could opt in favour of filing a model declaratory action or enforcing their claims by way of de facto class actions, as has already been done for instance through assignment models.

In addition, the filing of several representative actions  each with narrowly defined consumer groups  is also conceivable in order to 4 The Directive emphasises that the national rules on the similarity of claims should not hamper the effective functioning of the procedural mechanism for representative actions required by the Directive (recital 12, fourth sentence).

Pursuant to Sec. 13 (1) VDuG and Sec.

260 ZPO, several representative actions may be pursued jointly by way of aggregating the claims.

Sec. 7

(1) sentence 2 VDuG makes that explicitly clear.

3.

Entities entitled to bring an action Only registered qualified consumer associations are entitled to bring representative actions (Sec. 2 (1) no. 1 VDuG): in terms of members, associations must have at least 350 consum- ers or 10 associations from the same field of activity."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"Likewise, the association must have been registered as a qualified entity for four years.

The statutory purpose of the association must be to safeguard consumers' interests.

Associations must not aim at making a profit and may not receive more than 5 per cent of their financial resources through donations from companies.

Qualified entities from other Member States may have legal standing for the purpose of cross-border representative actions if they are entered in the European Commission's qualified entities list (cf. Sec.

2 (1) no. 2 VDuG).

4. Registration with the register of representative actions (Opt-In) In line with the legal situation to date, the VDuG provides that consumers must 'opt in': the affected consumers will not automatically become parties to a representative action.

Rather, they must actively register with the register of representative actions (Verbandsk- lageregister) in order to join the representative action (Sec. 46 VDuG).

This does not come as a surprise.

While the Directive does allow for the possibility of introducing an opt-out model along the lines of the US's class action mechanism, the introduction of such a model in Germany has been rejected by the majority of lawmakers.

This is due to the German civil-law principle known as the Dispositionsmaxime, according to which the parties to proceedings must have the freedom to control all relevant aspects of the proceedings, such as initiating it, selecting its subject matter and terminating it.

If the representative action is dismissed by the court, consumers are bound by their opt-in decision and can no longer bring individual actions in the same matter (cf. Sec.

11 (3) VDuG).

Up to three weeks after the conclusion of the oral proceedings, consumers have the right to join the representative action (Sec. 46 (1) VDuG).

A ruling cannot be issued until an additional three weeks have passed (Sec. 13 (4) VDuG).

The draft of the Act originally pro- vided that any opt-in by consumers must have taken place by the end of the day preceding the start of the oral proceedings.

In the course of the legislative process, lawmakers opted in favour of a consumer-friendly provision in this respect.

The ability to register at such a late stage gives consumers the opportunity to wait for the proceedings to progress and see if there is any indication in the oral proceedings whether the representative action will be successful.

Thus, consumers can wait to see if joining the action is likely to be promising.

5. Filing representative actions in different jurisdictions With the implementation of the Representative Actions Directive in all EU Member States, consumer associations will have the opportunity to sue companies in different countries.

Entities with legal standing will be able to file representative actions outside their own Member State of domicile or together with entities with legal standing in other Member States (as joined parties).

Additionally, companies in other jurisdictions may also be con- Content I. Conditions for the new representative action  2 II.

Representative actions with a foreign element are conceivable primarily in the case of tort claims.

For such claims, not only the court at the company's registered office is competent, but also the court at the place where the harm arose.

Thus, a claim can be filed wherever damage has occurred.

The requirements and mechanisms of representative actions vary significantly between EU Member States."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"Thus, a claim can be filed wherever damage has occurred.

The requirements and mechanisms of representative actions vary significantly between EU Member States.

In cases involving cross-border liability claims, German companies therefore have to expect that they will be confronted in another Member State with a rep- resentative action that is based on a far more plaintiff-friendly regime than that applicable in Germany (for example in the Netherlands).

As soon as a representative action against a defendant trader is pending, another repre- sentative action may not be brought if its subject matter relates to the same situation of fact and the same claims or to the same declaratory objectives.

This helps prevent parallel proceedings from being initiated in Germany that relate to the same subject matter.

The Act does not rule out the possibility of parallel representative actions being conducted in other Member States.

The permissibility of such actions is governed by the procedural law of the relevant Member State.

The Directive merely provides that consumers who have decided to join a representative action cannot 'be represented in other representative actions with the same cause of action and against the same trader' (Article 9(4) of the Directive).

Envisaged timeline for an action for redress measures 1.

The three phases of the action for redress The Act divides the representative action for redress measures into three phases (cf.

Secs.

16 et seqq.

VDuG): a) Phase 1: Preliminary judgment on redress In the first phase, the court examines whether the plaintiffs' claims show the required degree of similarity (cf. Sec.

15 VDuG).

If the claims are essentially similar, liability is then assessed on the merits of the claims.

If the court deems there to be liability, it issues a preliminary judgment on redress (Abhilfegrundurteil).

The court also specifies what evidence the individual consumer must provide in order to prove they meet the eligibility requirements that the court has also defined.

If the action for redress measu- res seeks a collective total amount, the preliminary judgment will also determine the amount due to each eligible consumer.

If the amounts due to the eligible consumers are different, the judgement is to state the method to be used to calculate the individual amounts due to the eligible consumers.

If the entity entitled to bring the action is already seeking enforcement of certain claims for the benefit of named consumers, the court may issue a final judgment on redress directly.

For that to happen, Sec. 16 (4) VDuG requires that the parties submit a petition to this effect and that the efforts to reach a settlement must have failed.

b) Phase 2: Settlement After that, the Act provides for a phase in which the litigating parties are given the op- portunity to agree on a settlement (Sec. 17 VDuG)."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"b) Phase 2: Settlement After that, the Act provides for a phase in which the litigating parties are given the op- portunity to agree on a settlement (Sec. 17 VDuG).

The parties are to submit a written settlement proposal to the court on the basis of the preliminary judgment on redress.

The purpose of any settlement agreement is for the parties to mutually agree on a verification and distribution system for implementing the preliminary judgment on redress.

The explanatory memorandum points out as an advantage that companies will thereby be able to influence not only the implementation of the preliminary judgment on redress, but also the costs arising from the settlement.

c) Phase 3: Final judgment on redress If the parties do not reach an agreement, the court will issue a final judgment on redress (Abhilfeendurteil  cf.

Sec.

18 VDuG).

In that judgment, the court may order the defen- dant company to pay a specific collective total amount or it may order implementation proceedings (Umsetzungsverfahren) aimed at satisfying the plaintiffs.

In this context, the plaintiffs will have the burden of demonstrating in concrete terms the amount of their total loss.

According to the explanatory memorandum, an extract from the register of representative actions can show how many consumers are registered.

Addition- ally, the amount of the claim must be substantiated in concrete terms.

Following commonly accepted legal principles, the court is authorised pursuant to Sec.

287 ZPO to estimate the loss.

In determining the specific collective total amount, the court may also assume that all claims asserted by the plaintiffs are fully justified.

The respective individual claims will only be examined at the stage of the implementation proceedings.

If individual claims turn out to be unjustified, any excess amount is to be reim- bursed to the defendant afterwards.

This leans more towards being a business-friendly pro- vision.

In other jurisdictions, such unclaimed funds often fall to charitable organisations.

The allocation mechanism The court's judgment on redress is to be carried out by a trustee (Sachwalter) appointed for that task by the court (Secs.

22 et seqq. VDuG).

The trustee sets up an 'implementation fund' (Umsetzungsfonds), in which the defendant is required to deposit the total amount of damages plus procedural costs (Sec. 25 VDuG).

The trustee then verifies whether the registered consumers meet the criteria set out in the preliminary judgment on redress (cf. Sec.

27 (1) nos.

3, 4 VDuG).

Where a consumer provides the required evidence, they receive a payment out of the implementation fund.

In the case of other consumer claims, the trustee requests the defendant to fulfil the specific individual claim, for example make repairs or supply defect-free products, and sets a reasonable deadline for doing so (cf. Sec.

27 (1) no. 5 VDuG).

Consumers and companies may file an objection to the trustee's decision pursuant to Sec.

28 (2)

VDuG.

If the trustee rejects the objection, a court decision may be petitioned (Sec. 29 (4) VDuG).

This possibility of the court to have the oversight over the proceedings was added during the legislative process only after extensive criticism had been voiced.

If a consumer's claim is not or only partially fulfilled, the consumer will, as a rule, be able to pursue that claim, insofar as it still exists, in an individual action after the implementation proceedings have ended.

Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"This applies, however, only if the consumer was unable to enforce the claim previously in the appeal proceedings (Sec. 39 VDuG).

If a consumer's claims were wrongfully satisfied in the implementation proceedings, companies must initiate individ- ual recovery proceedings (Sec. 40 (1) VDuG).

In those situations, German law on unjust enrichment applies.

This could lead to an additional burden on companies with consumer solvency risks that are difficult to calculate.

Funding representative actions The new law leaves it unclear how consumer associations are to finance the proceedings for them to be conducted properly.

For lawyers, representing an association on the basis of the statutory fees is not likely to be attractive.

The amount in dispute in a representative action is capped at EUR 300,000.

For fees calculated on the basis of this amount in dispute, it is hardly possible for a lawyer (let alone a team of lawyers) to manage complex and lengthy collective proceedings properly.

Additional remuneration, such as an agreement on hourly rates, is legally possible for the consumer protection associations.

However, the question arises as to where the funds for such remuneration are to come from, especially since that remuneration cannot be recov- ered from opposing parties even if the action is successful.

Third-party funding of representative actions is allowed under Sec. 4 (2) VDuG provided that the litigation funder (i) is not a competitor of the defendant, (ii) it is not controlled by the defendant and (iii) it will not influence the entity entitled to bring the action to manage the lawsuit to the detriment of consumers.

However, consumer associations will generally be unable to offer litigation funders market-conform remuneration in the form of a share in the award amount.

If an action is successful, a maximum of ten per cent of the total amount sued for may go to a litigation funder (cf. Sec. 4 (2) no. 3 VDuG).

Furthermore, if an action is funded by a third party, all the agreements between the consumer association and the litigation funder must be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 4 (3)

VDuG.

It remains to be seen whether litigation funders are willing to invest under these restric- tive conditions.

Until the legislature provides other ways of at least covering the costs of litigation (through additional public funds for instance), the path for most consumer associations to bring numerous and/or major representative actions will likely be blocked for the time being.

IV.

Suspension of limitation periods Actions for redress measures and model declaratory actions trigger a suspension of limi- tation periods for consumers who have effectively registered in the register of actions (Sec. 204a (1) nos.

3, 4 of the new version of the German Civil Code (BGB).

This is consistent with the law to date in relation to model declaratory actions.

The limitation period is also suspended by representative actions in other Member States if consumers become a party to them (Sec. 204a (2) BGB)."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"The limitation period is also suspended by representative actions in other Member States if consumers become a party to them (Sec. 204a (2) BGB).

Representative actions for injunctive measures have a far-reaching suspensive effect on limitation periods (Sec. 204a (1) no. 2 BGB).

To date, the requirement has been either that claims for injunctive relief must be pursued individually or that at least the preparations for pursuing such claims must be done individually.

The Act has now removed this require- ment: any impact on the consumer by a contested infringement is sufficient to suspend the limitation period.

Unlike in actions for redress measures, in a representative action for injunctive measures consumers are not required to declare their intent to participate in the action, for example by registering with the register of representative actions.

According to Sec. 5 (2) VDuG, the required impact on consumers would be established solely on the basis of a 'brief de- scription' of the underlying situation of fact.

Outlook and assessment 9 Contact 10 July 2023 9 this mechanism will prove to be practical and help provide legal certainty.

The limitation period for claims will be suspended for a potentially indeterminate group of consumers.

For companies against which such claims are asserted, the legal certainty associated with the statute of limitations is thus drastically reduced.

V. Disclosure of evidence It is the plaintiff's responsibility to present the facts favourable to the action and to obtain relevant evidence.

In the past, this burden has proven to be a considerable hurdle for con- sumer plaintiffs.

The Directive therefore suggests more far-reaching rules on the disclosure of evidence.

The new German Act, however, provides for only modest changes to the current law.

An ex- pansion of disclosure duties is not provided for.

It therefore remains the case, as applicable law has allowed to date, that a court can only order a party to produce certain, precisely specified evidence.

Sec. 6

(1) and (2) VDuG do, however, newly provide that the failure to comply with a disclo- sure order can be sanctioned with a fine of up to EUR 250,000, which can be imposed more than once.

Whether or not the possibility of a fine will in fact make a difference remains to be seen.

VI.

Outlook and assessment It seems doubtful that the new law will actually lead to a noticeable reduction in the work- load of the German justice system.

Legal standing is limited to not-for-profit associations, which do not have the option of involving commercially-minded lawyers and litigation funders.

Therefore, both law firms representing plaintiffs as well as for-profit litigation funders will likely continue to have incentives to pursue claims (additionally) through assignment models or by bundling a large number of plaintiffs as co-joined litigants.

A considerable hurdle for representative actions will likely be the narrowly defined condi- tions set out in the Act for lawsuits to permissibly be funded by third parties.

Using their own funds, associations will likely only be able to finance complex and costly proceedings to a limited extent.

This is true all the more since the statutory fees lawyers can demand are unattractive with the amount in dispute being capped at EUR 300,000.

Liability risks for companies are nevertheless exacerbated by the new legal protection regime.

For essentially similar claims (such as claims arising under the GDPR because of data leaks), companies may be facing significant amounts of damages due to potentially very high numbers of affected consumers."
Hengeler Mueller,Advanced Technologies for Efficient Mass Litigation,"The judicial estimation of damages and the open questions surrounding limitation periods will lead to noticeable liquidity burdens and legal uncertainties for companies, in particular with regard to provisions.

From the defendant company's perspective, the amount of damages will be unclear until all of the claims have been satisfied.

The judicial estimation of damages is only preliminary and can be increased if the amount is insufficient.

In summary, the representative action is an expansion of consumer protection associa- tions' repertoire to challenge companies.

It remains to be seen how greatly the tool will be utilised.

Hengeler Mueller,Legal Update: Corporate Disputes - An additional option for pre-trial discovery requests in Germany,"July 2022 1 LEGAL UPDATE Cross-border disputes: An additional option for pre-trial discovery requests in Germany On 1 July 2022, an amendment to Germanys Implementing Act (Implementing Act) to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Com mercial Matters (Hague Evidence Convention) entered into force.

The amend ment enables German courts for the first time to provide legal assistance on foreign discovery orders.

In practice, the amendment might provide relief for German liti gants who want to obey foreign discovery orders (irrespective of their enforceability in Germany), but find themselves in conflict with German law when doing so.

The Hague Evidence Convention and its application to pre-trial discovery The Hague Evidence Convention is a multilateral treaty which came into force in 1972.

It governs the taking of evidence in cross-border situations, where evidence is required for use in judicial proceedings in one signatory state, but located in another signatory state.

Under the convention each contracting state designates a central authority to receive and review incoming letters of request for taking evidence in that state.

Many civil law countries view the common law style of discovery as too broad and intru- sive.

Broad US style discovery is at the focus of the discussion.

However, UK disclosure  while much narrower than the discovery which is allowed in the US and where the courts are generally opposed to fishing expeditions  is a similarly unfamiliar concept under a civil law regime.

Consequently, Article 23 of the Hague Evidence Convention al- lows a signatory country to refuse to comply with a request for pre-trial discovery.

Of the 64 signatories to the Hague Evidence Convention, 351 countries issued a declaration in accordance with Article 23 of the convention that they will not execute a letter of request for the purpose of obtaining pre-trial discovery of documents as known in Common Law countries.

Prior to 1 July 2022, Germany was one of those countries.

1

The Hague Convention website currently shows 35 states have issued a declaration in accordance with Article 23, although the Fed- eral Government of Germany mentions 28 states in its legislative reasons for the new amendment (Federal Government of Germany, Legislative reasons for the draft of 21 March 2022, Federal Parliament of Germany printed matter 20/1110, p. 38) July 2022 2 Germanys Article 23 declaration had the result that foreign courts could not obtain legal assistance in Germany for pre-trial discovery.

However, this did not prevent US and UK courts from issuing discovery or disclosure orders against foreign parties under their own civil procedure rules.

The US Supreme Court decided in 1987 in Arospatiale2 that Hague Evidence Conven- tion procedures are not mandatory in the US but rather optional.

Since Arospatiale, US courts have considered various factors, including a comity analysis, in determining whether it is appropriate in a particular case to allow discovery to proceed under the Hague Evidence Convention rather than the US civil procedure rules.

More often than not, US courts have found that the US interest in allowing discovery outweighs the con- cerns of any countervailing foreign country.

UK courts, backed by the European Court of Justice,3 similarly took the position that the EU Evidence Regulation4 did not limit the options of the UK courts to obtain disclosure from parties to UK litigation.5 According to US and UK judges, even the possibility of criminal prosecutions imposed by other jurisdictions for producing information for use in US or UK litigation does not necessarily override the courts ability to order disclosure.6 The unfortunate result of that practice is that German parties to a proceeding brought in a common law court can often find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place."
Hengeler Mueller,Legal Update: Corporate Disputes - An additional option for pre-trial discovery requests in Germany,"On the one hand, the common law court that issues a request for pre-trial discovery may order sanctions (up to a disbarment from the proceedings) or other penalties to be imposed on a party that refuses to comply with the pre-trial discovery request.

On the other hand, a German company has to assess whether complying with a pre-trial discovery request is in line with its obligations under German law.

German law does not generally prevent a company from complying with a foreign pre-trial discovery request.

However, a German party needs to make sure that it does not breach its confidentiality obligations under German law or the provisions of the EUs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Many of the German law concerns related to discovery orders by common law courts could be alleviated by a German court order mandating disclosure of documents.

However, such an order by a German court was not obtainable through legal assistance in the past.

In two cases from the Netherlands and Belgium, the European Court of Justice ruled that courts who want to take evidence in another Member State still have the option to take evidence in accordance with the law of their Member State and do not have to rely on the EU Evidence Regulation, see ECJ, Judgment of 6 September 2012  Case C-170/11 (Lippens and Others) and Judgment of 21 February 2013  Case C-332/11 (ProRail).

July 2022 3 Germany will accept certain letters of request concerning pre-trial discovery as of 1 July 2022 As of 1 July 2022, Germany now allows foreign courts of countries who are signatories to the Hague Evidence Convention to ask German courts for legal assistance in pre-trial discovery proceedings, provided that their letter of request satisfies certain require- ments.

Under the new wording of Section 14 of the Implementing Act German courts shall exe- cute requests for pre-trial discovery of documents under the Hague Evidence Convention if the following prerequisites are met: 1. the documents to be produced are specified in detail; 2.

the documents to be produced are of direct and clearly identifiable importance for the proceedings in question and their outcome; 3.

the documents to be produced are in the possession of a party to the proceedings; 4."
Hengeler Mueller,Legal Update: Corporate Disputes - An additional option for pre-trial discovery requests in Germany,"the documents to be produced are in the possession of a party to the proceedings; 4.

the request does not violate fundamental principles of German law; and 5.

if the documents contain personal data, the requirements of the GDPR must be met.

These requirements seek to safeguard the rights of German litigants, by ensuring that they are not subject to an overly broad request for the production of an entire collection of documents.

If the Hague Evidence Convention is used in the way it is intended by the German legislature, it will create more legal certainty for German parties.

It remains to be seen whether foreign courts will make use of the new option to obtain evidence Whether things will change in practice now that there is a new mechanism for obtaining pre-trial discovery in Germany remains to be seen.

It depends to a large extent on how German courts will interpret Section 14 of the Implementing Act and whether or not com- mon law courts will refine their pre-trial discovery requests in order to comply with the specific requirements of the German restrictions under the Hague Evidence Convention.

On the German side, the practical usefulness of the amended Section 14 of the Imple- menting Act in assisting US or UK style discovery or disclosure mainly hinges on the interpretation of prerequisites no. 1 and 2:  It will be decisive whether the requirement of specifying the documents to be pro- duced in detail will be interpreted narrowly to mean that each document needs to be individually identified, or whether it is sufficient to identify a specific group of docu- ments.

The German wording of the legislation suggests that documents might need to be identified individually to fulfil this requirement.

Such an interpretation would be at odds with discovery practice, which does not impose a particularly high burden on an applicant with regard to the specification of documents to be disclosed.

However, the legislative intent is also relevant here, and the purpose behind the amendment of the Implementing Act is to open up a possibility for common law courts to use the Hague Evidence Convention for pre-trial discovery, and to encourage them to do so.

In order to give effect to that legislative intent, the German courts might be inclined to consid- er a broader discovery classification.

July 2022 4  Whether the requested documents are of direct and identifiable importance to the proceedings is also a question of discretion for the court.

A US or UK definition of what is relevant or important is likely to be broader than that of a more restrictive German court definition, and it may be harder to convince a German court that a document is relevant or important than it would be to convince a common law court.

Again, given that the German legislature intended to encourage the use of legal assis- tance in German courts, it may be that the courts will give a broader interpretation of relevance than they would otherwise have done.

On the common law side, courts take into account comity considerations when making discovery orders.

Therefore, they can be expected to be more amenable to use of the Hague Evidence Convention now that there is a mechanism in place to allow for legal assistance for discovery requests in the first place.

It remains to be seen whether or not common law courts will refine their pre-trial discovery requests in order to comply with the specific requirements of the German restrictions under the Hague Evidence Conven- tion.

It may well be that foreign courts, at least in the near future, will continue to apply their own procedural law, instead of using the Hague Evidence Convention.

However, if letters of request under the Hague Evidence Convention are executed quickly and efficiently, this could become the more common option of choice when dealing with pre-trial dis- covery requests in Germany."
Hengeler Mueller,Legal Update: Corporate Disputes - An additional option for pre-trial discovery requests in Germany,"For German parties to a proceeding in a common law court, it would be advantageous to ensure the court is aware of this new possibility for legal assistance.

It could prove a valuable tool in evading the catch-22 that they may encounter when faced with a US or UK discovery order.

Hengeler Mueller,Foreign Subsidies Regulation – A New Tool for Merger Control,"In mid-2023, the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) entered into force: a new tool used by the European Commission (the Commission) to address distortions in the EU internal market caused by subsidies from non-EU Member States.

One cornerstone of this new regulatory framework is the notification requirement, effective since 12 October 2023, for certain M&A transactions involving companies that have received financial support from third countries.

Given the broad definition of financial contributions and the potential for significant penalties - up to 10% of the aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year, or the annulment of deals for non-compliance - companies engaged in M&A transactions within the EU need to be aware of the new layer of regulatory scrutiny and its complex information requirements.

A new Regulatory Hurdle for M&A Transactions While EU Member States were already subject to rigorous regulatory examination of state-granted subsidies prior to the new regulation, third countries that employ financial contributions as part of their industry policy, were not targeted by EU state-aid rules.

Accordingly, they faced less scrutiny from European regulators.

To close this perceived regulatory gap and create a level playing field for all companies operating in the EU internal market, the FSR has introduced mandatory screening for transactions involving investors or target companies that have received financial contributions from non-EU Member States.

Mergers, acquisitions, and the formation of joint ventures bringing about a lasting change of control must be notified to the Commission if: (1) the target (in case of an acquisition), one of the companies involved in the concentration (in case of a merger), or the newly formed JV (a) is established in the EU and (b) has generated an EU-wide turnover of at least EUR 500 million; and (2) all companies involved have received combined financial contributions from third countries of more than EUR 50 million during the last three years.

Notably, the Commission is also authorized to require notification for transactions falling below these thresholds if it suspects that financial contributions constituting foreign subsidies were granted in the three years prior to the merger.

What to Notify under the FSR The concept of financial contributions, as defined in Art. 3(2) FSR, is exceptionally broad.

It encompasses loans, guarantees, capital injections, certain tax benefits, fiscal incentives, debt forgiveness, and the supply or purchase of goods or services.

Identifying the relevant financial contributions and determining whether the EUR 50 million threshold has been met – and therefore whether a filing is required – is a challenge for dealmakers.

After criticism from various stakeholders, the Commission issued an Implementing Regulation under which the obligations on notifying parties to disclose financial contributions have been clarified and eased.

Notably, financial contributions not constituting foreign subsidies must only be disclosed if, in the last three years, the individual amount of the financial contribution exceeded EUR 1 million and, cumulatively, all financial contributions exceeded EUR 45 million per third country.

Information on such financial contributions only has to be provided in an overview aggregated in a table format.

The Commission may, however, request more detailed information.

Only for a limited subset of financial contributions, ""most likely distortive"" foreign subsidies pursuant to Art. 5(1) FSR, more detailed information must be provided.

A financial contribution qualifies as a foreign subsidy if it confers a ""benefit"" that could not be obtained on market conditions."
Hengeler Mueller,Foreign Subsidies Regulation – A New Tool for Merger Control,"A financial contribution qualifies as a foreign subsidy if it confers a ""benefit"" that could not be obtained on market conditions.

Certain foreign subsidies granted to ailing undertakings, unlimited guarantees, export financing measures, foreign subsidies directly facilitating a concentration or foreign subsidies enabling an undertaking to submit an unduly advantageous tender are considered ""most likely distortive"".

For these foreign subsidies the exact amount, purpose, potential conditions attached to the financial contribution and the main elements and characteristics, as well as supporting documents, must be provided.

For private equity investors, the FSR Implementing Regulation brought some simplifications with regard to the information to be provided on financial contributions: as long as a financial contribution does not qualify as a ""most likely distortive"" foreign subsidy, information (in the aggregated manner described above) only has to be provided for the acquiring fund.

This simplification does, however, not apply to the assessment whether the notification threshold is met – this is still assessed across all funds managed by the private equity investor.

Impact on the Transaction Timeline and Agreements Like EU merger control, the FSR regime has a suspensive effect – notifiable transactions must not be closed until clearance has been obtained (Art. 24(1) FSR).

The FSR review broadly follows the EU merger control process: After having gone through a pre-notification phase, the formal review period in Phase I of up to 25 working days commences upon formal notification (Art. 25(2) FSR).

If the Commission finds that a foreign subsidy exists and likely has distortive effects on the EU internal market, it can enter an in-depth investigation lasting 90 working days from formal notification, or 105 working days if remedies are offered (and which may be further extended up to 125 working days).

The Commission may also suspend the time limit if the parties fail to submit complete responses to a request for information.

Whether the Commission initiates an in-depth investigation largely depends on whether there are ""sufficient indications"" that a foreign subsidy exists distorting the internal market (Art. 10(3) FSR).

The Commission conducts a ""balancing test"" (Art. 6 FSR) where it weighs negative effects of a foreign subsidy against positive effects in the development of the relevant subsidised economic activity on the internal market.

If the negative effects outweigh the positive ones, the Commission may, under Art. 7 FSR, impose redressive measures or accept commitments offered by the undertaking under investigation to remedy distortions in the EU internal market.

For M&A contract negotiations, it is important to bear in mind that a notification requirement under the FSR will need to be reflected as a pre-closing condition.

Further, a long-stop date has to reflect the length of the review process.

The allocation of risk in having to make commitments or the imposition of redressive measures by the Commission should be reflected in the transaction documents.

Navigating the Challenges: Setting up a FSR-Compliance Framework Currently, there are doubts about whether the FSR strikes the right balance between creating a level playing field and imposing an added bureaucratic burden that will make M&A transactions within the EU more costly and time consuming.

Gathering the required data for filing can be complicated and time-consuming and most companies do not (yet) routinely collect the specific data needed for an FSR notification.

Companies should therefore prepare themselves for this new complex regulatory layer of scrutiny – for example, by implementing effective information-gathering protocols and requiring target companies to disclose their foreign financial contributions as part of their standard due diligence."
Hengeler Mueller,(Partially) withdrawing from Russia – how to structurally approach making this complex decision,"Every company with operations in Russia is confronted with the dilemma of whether or not to continue those operations in the face of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.

From a legal standpoint, the question is easy to answer if specific operations being conducted by a company are prohibited under applicable sanctions law.

If the company's operations fall outside the scope of the mandatory sanctions regime, taking a decision on what to do with those operations going forward is more difficult.

While management boards do have discretion, they must adhere to the principles of the business judgment rule.

Before they can take any definite decision, they need to answer three questions: What are the available options?

What are the main objectives when taking the decision?

What factors need to be considered when determining whether the objectives have been achieved?

Usually, companies do not have just the two alternatives of continuing their Russian operations as they are versus withdrawing from the country entirely.

In fact, companies may also opt to gradually scale back or suspend their operations in Russia, for example by refraining from making investments, engaging in marketing activities or acquiring new business while continuing to honour existing contracts; suspending their B2B relationships while continuing their B2C business or at least the sale of essential goods; just stopping the sale of products which can potentially be used for military purposes or in support thereof.

Companies opting to end their active presence in the market should weigh whether to leave their operations merely ""dormant"" without laying off staff or giving up their operating facilities, or to make a full withdrawal from Russia.

If they decide to do the latter, they have to consider whether to implement the withdrawal by selling their operations to a third party or by simply discontinuing their business activities.

What should the main objectives and intentions be when taking the decision?

Management boards are obliged to base their decisions on what is in their company's best interests, which includes, in any case, preserving and optimising the company's net assets, financial position and results of operations.

Especially in cases where companies are considering a withdrawal from Russia, they are faced with the question of whether also ethical or political aspects can be taken into account, even if taking a specific measure would be detrimental in business terms.

The trend among companies is moving in the direction, and quite rightly so, of allowing this in a much greater scope than was accepeted in the past.

Applicable law provides sufficient grounds to assume that lawmakers did not have a focus on pure shareholder value in mind and the mission statement of all companies is that of a good corporate citizen.

It goes without saying that there are limits to ethical, environmental or other politically motivated decisions that are not ""worth it"".

In particular, a company's existence must not be put at risk as a result of such decisions.

But even if a management board observes these limits, its discretion is still fairly broad.

If and to the extent that a management board voluntarily takes into account ethical or political considerations as well, it is key for the board to precisely define the objectives that it intends to achieve: when debating an exit from Russia, the question to be answered is whether the withdrawal (merely) serves to prevent the company's products from being misused for military purposes or to make a political statement, and, if so, whether the aim is to generally dissociate the company from Russian aggression or to put pressure on the Russian people to work towards political change.

Only after the objectives have been clearly defined can a management board assess the suitability of the measures to be taken."
Hengeler Mueller,(Partially) withdrawing from Russia – how to structurally approach making this complex decision,"Only after the objectives have been clearly defined can a management board assess the suitability of the measures to be taken.

With that in mind, there comes the question of what factors need to be taken into account when determining whether objectives have been achieved.

There is a multitude of factors to consider, all of which have to be analysed regardless of whether a management board intends to act purely based on business interests or also out of ethical/political considerations.

These factors include in particular: an analysis of the legal framework, including current sanctions and (assessing) expected additional sanctions of Western countries, as well as Russian countermeasures; an assessment of the impact of the various options on the company's business operations in Russia and other countries, including any possible supply-chain disruptions; the impact on existing contracts and agreements, including delivery obligations and risks of incurring damages; an analysis of the impact on the company's net assets, financial position and results of operations, specifically the impact of scaling down the business activities on sales and revenues and on the need for write-downs on account of any decommissioning or expropriation of facilities and/or assets, along with any subsequent financial burdens, such as risks of incurring obligations to compensate damages and compensation payments to be made to employees; the impact on the company's financial KPI and ratings; the impact on the company's IT and data security; the impact on contracts and agreements of the German holding company, such as loan agreements; the impact on personnel in Russia; the impact on the company's reputation; the risk of any expropriation by the Russian government and the associated involuntary assistance of the Russian government.

Without a thorough analysis of these example factors in particular for each of the different available avenues, a carefully considered decision is hardly possible.

As the situation is evolving rapidly, our assessment of this issue might change.

Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Buy one, get one free. But not a Commission dawn raid.","March 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Buy one, get one free.

But not a Commission dawn raid While we were all looking forward to the first hints of spring, the European Court of Justice held a hearing in Intermarch Casino v. Commission1 on 24 February.

The case has French supermarket Intermarch (and others) challenging the lawfulness of an inspection decision that the Commission had adopted in 2017 when it raided the companies premises pursuing allegations around anti-competitive purchas- ing arrangements.

Similar to other recent cases such as Prysmian2 and Nexans3, Intermarch Casino raises the issue of just how much and what type of information (indicia) must be in Commissions possession to justify the adoption of an inspection decision.

Put more bluntly: When does the Commission cross the line of conducting an unlawful fishing expedition?

The case affords the European Court of Justice another opportunity to weigh in on the evidentiary standard that the Commissions inspection decisions should be held to.

Building on the so-called sealed envelope procedure that it had established in Akzo4, the Court might also establish procedural safeguards that companies can draw on when they sense that the Commission might really be just fishing for information.

Gone fishing in muddy waters?

In Prysmian and Nexans, the Court reminded the Commission that it needed to be (more) precise in defining the scope of a dawn raid in the inspection decision.

While the Commis- sion is not necessarily required to delimit the relevant market, it must state the essential characteristics of the suspected infringement, indicating inter alia the market thought to be affected.

The ink had hardly dried on these judgments that the regulator found itself in hot water once again.

Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

March 2022 2 In the Intermarch Casino case, the French supermarket Intermarch (together with Casino and Intermarch Casino Achat) was the subject of a dawn raid in 2017 by the Commission based on allegations of an unlawful coordination between their and other competitors pur-

chasing behaviour.

Anti-competitive conduct, according to the Commission, had occurred in separate instances and forms: first, an exchange of information on discounts that the com- panies granted to their respective suppliers (since 2015) and, second, coordination between the companies on their respective future commercial strategies (since 2016).

Information obtained during the 2017 dawn raids was used to conduct fresh inspections in 2019.

The supermarkets appealed the 2017 dawn raid decision before the General Court arguing that the Commission had breached their right to the inviolability of the home, invoking Article7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 8 of the European Charter of Human Rights.

Separately, the supermarkets challenged the Commissions 2019 inspection decision, arguing that it was adopted solely on the basis of documents seized during an inspection carried out beforehand on the basis of a decision that was itself illegal.

The latter appeal is currently pending before the General Court.5

The applicants went all out and challenged the Commissions views on evidentiary elements.

Both before the General Court6, as well as before the European Court of Justice, the super markets alleged that the Commissions handling of indicia was shoddy, which could potentially set a dangerous precedent."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Buy one, get one free. But not a Commission dawn raid.","The General Court largely defended the Commission, in stating  among other points  that due to the secrecy shrouding cartels, the indicia are only rarely direct and individual; most of the times it is a body of indicia which must be read in block.

However, out of the two alleged infringements, the Court could only justify the Commissions take on one  the 2015 incident.

As far as the second infringement was concerned (i.e. the 2016 incident), the Court (even if reluctantly) concluded that the Commission did not have in its possession sufficient indicia to indicate the potential existence of an infringement and declared null the relevant provision in the inspection decision.

An (antitrust) hen v. egg dispute In accordance with the Nexans case-law, in order to confirm that the inspection decision was not arbitrary, i.e. not adopted in the absence of any circumstance of fact and of law capable of justifying an inspection, the General Court in Intermarch Casino considered whether the Commission had sufficiently serious indicia to suspect an infringement of the competition rules by the undertaking concerned.

To that end, the General Court deter- mined, first, what indicia were in the Commissions possession at the time it adopted the inspection decision.

On that basis, second, it assessed whether these indicia were sufficient to justify that decision.

Why the supermarkets were suspicious.

The companies discovered that, prior to adopting the inspection decision, the Commission had held interviews with 13 suppliers.

However, the interviews had taken place even as late as on the day before the said decision was adopted.

Furthermore, the interview minutes were only drafted after the inspection decision had been adopted, and had not been formally acknowledged for accuracy by the 5 See case T-538/19 - Casino, Guichard-Perrachon v Commission.

The supermarkets also challenged the legality of a 2020 information request which the Commission had issued as part of its ongoing EU antitrust probe.

That appeal is also pending before the General Court.

See case T-614/20 - Casino, Guichard-Perrachon v Commission.

6 Case T-254/17 - Intermarch Casino Achats v Commission, case T-249/17 - Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and Achats Marchandises Casino v Commission.

March 2022 3 interviewees.

For the supermarkets, all this chain of events pointed to one conclusion  the Commission had already decided to inspect them, even before collecting all the necessary indicia (in this case  the interviews).

The Commissions interviews.

Even though the interviews were only transcribed as minutes after the date on which they had been conducted and also after the date on which the Commission had adopted the inspection decision, the Commission considered them relevant indicia on which it based its inspection decision.

This raises the question: What ever information the Commission learned in these interviews, was that information already in the Commissions possession at the time it adopted the inspection decision?

Here, the General Court chose to take a fairly lenient approach, holding that the moment when the Commission obtained the relevant piece of information was the date of the interviews, not their recording in proper interview minutes.

Slippery slope, the supermarkets said.

Bottom line: The case surely offers sufficient reason for the Court of Justice to set out when and under which circumstances the Commission may rely on information from interviews to justify an inspection decision.

Assessing the weight of the Commissions indicia.

The General Court assessed in detail the weight of the indicia in the Commissions possession when adopting the inspec- tion decision.

At the outset, the Court clearly stated that, at the preliminary investigation stage, the Commission cannot be required (before adopting an inspection decision) to be in possession of evidence."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Buy one, get one free. But not a Commission dawn raid.","At the outset, the Court clearly stated that, at the preliminary investigation stage, the Commission cannot be required (before adopting an inspection decision) to be in possession of evidence.

Such evidence, which refers to a stricter and more formalistic level of proof than indicia, was required only at the phase of the statement of objections.

Then, the Court looked into the form of the indicia, its authors, and its contents.

The Court examined the indicia for the two alleged infringements separately, in light of these criteria taken together.

In one instance, it considered the indicia sufficient, in the other it did not.

While the General Courts intensely fact-based assessment offers some guidance, there is still room for the Court of Justice to chime in and set out, in clear and unequivocal terms, what evidentiary standard the Commissions indicia need to meet to justify an inspection.

What would Akzo do?

Interestingly, the Court seized the opportunity of the oral hearing to table the sealed envelope procedure that is had developed in Akzo as a procedural tool to safeguard the professional legal privilege during inspections.

More precisely, the Court wondered whether it could be extended to include documents containing sensitive personal data, or to protect materials that fall outside the scope of the decision to launch inspections (i.e. different products or countries other than the ones listed in the inspection decision).

As a reminder, the sealed envelope procedure allows companies to challenge Commissions efforts to seize documents protected by attorney-client privilege, documents which are put in a sealed envelope pending verdict.

As expected, the supermarkets deemed the proposed extended scope too limited, as it would not provide an efficient remedy to potential dawn raid abuses from the Commissions side.

In the opposite corner, the Commission pleaded for an enforcement of an extended Akzo rule only as last resort and after its inspectors had already sifted through the documents, briefly contemplated them and discussed them with the company lawyers.

March 2022 4 Maybe its time for a facelift Last, but not least, the parties discussed whether our beloved Regulation 1/2003 is still en vogue, or whether it is overdue for maintenance.

According to the supermarkets, Article 20 of the Regulation seems to lag behind in terms of human rights developments, because it breaches their right to an effective remedy.

More precisely, the companies consider that in so far as the judicial review of the conduct during inspections (as opposed to the inspection decision as such) can be carried out only in the context of the action for annulment of the final decision adopted by the Commission in application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the possibility of challenging the specific inves- tigatory measures that the Commission takes during these inspections is not certain and is not available within a reasonable time.

In light of this, the supermarkets argued that they were not given the opportunity to place themselves, in a timely manner, under the protection of an impartial and independent tribunal and were thus required to respond favourably to all requests made by the inspectors.

This, while EU Member States such as France, Germany, Sweden, Czechia, Belgium, Spain and Poland allow legal challenges to the conduct of inspections (following Strasbourg rul- ings).

Surprisingly, the allegation was met with resistance from the Commissions side, which stated that the intensity of the EU review takes precedence over its timeliness.

Although the 24 February hearing was hardly the time or the place for academic reflections on the future of judicial remedies in EU competition law, the issue does taste like food for thought.

Would an ECN++ initiative focused on safeguarding companies rights of defence, as opposed to strengthening regulators enforcement powers, be the silver bullet, as opposed to a facelift of Regulation 1/2003?"
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Buy one, get one free. But not a Commission dawn raid.","Will the Strasbourg judges finally be heard up north, in the Schuman roundabout?

Lets wait and see what the Court of Justice thinks about the case.

It will take a while before the Court hands down its judgment.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Exploring the First 100 Days of the Notification Obligation under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"March 2024 BRUSSELS  JOUR Exploring the First 100 Days of the Notification Obligation under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation More Notifications, Limited Exceptions!

The first 100 days have passed since EUs newest regulatory regime to target foreign subsidies granted by non-EU countries in the context of transactions took effect on 12 October 2023.

This seemed to be just the right moment for the Commissions Directorate-General for Competition (DG COMP) to share its experience and provide us with statistics of the first cases assessed under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) in a Policy Brief issued on 1 February 2024.

Some stats Firstly, the Policy Brief contains some statistics on the cases that the Commission dealt with under the new notification obligation:  Pre-Notification Procedures: Until 20 January 2024, a total of 53 cases kicked off with pre-notification talks, leading to 14 formal notifications and 9 clearances following initial so-called Phase I investigations.

So far, no concentration has been reviewed in-depth (so called Phase II) or prohibited.

A significant portion (42 out of 53) of these cases underwent simultaneous assessments under the EU Merger Regulation, with only five concentrations undergoing national merger control reviews.

Roughly half of the FSR cases have also been subject to a foreign direct investment screening in one or several EU Member States.

While these statistics are insightful, the Commission  unlike in EU merger control cases not falling under scope of a simplified procedure  does not publish a reasoned Phase I decision or even the fact that a transaction has been notified.

So it remains unclear what specific criteria guided the Commissions past clearances under the FSR.

Markus Rhrig, Christoph Wilken and Christian Dankerl report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

2 March 2024  Surpassing Expectations: The first numbers show that much more notified cases will occur than the 30 cases per year initially predicted by the Commission.

To handle the caseload, the newly formed Directorate K within DG COMP, consisting of three units, has stepped into action, commencing its review of concentrations under the FSR since 1 March 2024.

Beyond the numbers  clarity!

Secondly, the Commissions Policy Brief provides much needed clarifications on recurring issues concerning FSR notifications.

The key explanations are as follows:  Clarification of Notification and Reporting Requirement:

For both the noti fi cation and the reporting requirement, two concepts must be distinguished: Foreign Subsidies and Foreign Financial Contributions (FFCs).

Ac cording to Art. 20 (3) FSR, concentrations require notification if: (1) The undertaking to be acquired, at least one of the merging undertakings, or the joint venture, is established in the EU and has aggregate EU turnover of 500 million or more; and (2) The aggregate amount of FFCs is more than 50 million over the past three years.

While the FSR is only targeting foreign subsidies, both the notification and the reporting requirement are not triggered by foreign subsidies but FFCs.

The latter is a much wider concept which covers any transfer of financial resources from a foreign public authority.

It also includes FFCs received on market terms which do not confer any benefit.

All FFCs received must be taken into account to determine whether the notification threshold is met.

This also includes FFCs that are excluded from the reporting obligation for other reasons (see below).  

Clear Distinction between Notification and Reporting Threshold:

Once notification is required, only those FFCs must be reported which (i) meet the threshold of EUR 45million per third country (according to Annex I, Section 9, point 3 of the Implement- ing Regulation) and are not excluded under points 6 or 7 of the Instructions set out in Annex I, Section 9 of the Implementing Regulation, or (ii) may qualify as a subsidy under Art."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Exploring the First 100 Days of the Notification Obligation under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"5(1)(a) to (d) FSR or are granted directly to the notifying parties.

This has led to situations in which a notification was required, yet none of the FFCs actually had to be reported to the Commission.

In such instances, as clarified in the Commissions Policy Brief, parties are expected to provide an explanation as to why no reporting is necessary, and practice has shown that the case team may request further information on certain non-reportable FFCs.  

Categorization of Foreign Financial Contributions: Parties involved in the concentra- tion are obliged to include in Section 5 Form FS-CO (the notification form for concen- trations) detailed information about all FFCs that are most likely to distort the internal market, according to Art.

5(1)(a) to (d) FSR, should they qualify as a subsidy.

It is not necessary to determine whether these FFCs are indeed foreign subsidies at this stage.

March 2024 3 However, parties can explain within the notification form why such FFCs do not meet the criteria for being considered foreign subsidies.

During the pre-notification period, parties are encouraged to consult with the case team if there are uncertainties regarding the proper classification.

The Commission explicitly encourages parties to err on the side of over-reporting FFCs, as this does not preclude the determination of whether they constitute a distortive foreign subsidy.

The Policy Brief also offers additional guidance on the types of FFCs that are most likely to distort the internal market.

The Commission stresses that in cases of a bail-out without an adequate restructuring plan, the assessment of whether an entity is ailing under Article 5(1)(a)

FSR must be conducted on a legal entity basis, rather than (only) for the entire undertaking.

This necessitates an undertaking to disclose if any of its legal entities meet the conditions to be considered ailing or has met the conditions within the previous three years, even if the overall group remains financially stable.

For larger groups, this poses another very burdensome administrative exercise.

Regarding FFCs directly facilitating a concentration under Article 5(1)(d) FSR, parties must disclose all FFCs used to finance the acquisition or from which the transaction objectively benefits.

It is irrelevant whether the granting third country subjectively in- tended to facilitate a specific transaction.

Therefore, FFCs granted as limited partner investments in an acquiring investment fund should generally be reported, as their purpose typically involves providing resources for a specific acquisition.

The notifying party is then required to furnish adequate information on whether these contributions were made at market conditions or not.  

Narrowing Exceptions to the Reporting Requirement: Point 6 and 7 of the Commis- sions Instructions to provide information on FFCs that do not qualify as most likely distortive (Table 1 to Form FS-CO) enlist exceptions from the reporting obligations.

The Commission makes clear that these are exceptions to the general reporting rule and therefore must be interpreted narrowly.

For example, the list of tax measures exempted under point 6 is exhaustive, and any other tax measure must be reported.

Given that approximately one-third of all cases involve investment funds as notifying parties, the Commission found it crucial to clarify exceptions in point 7 that are specif- ically relevant to acquisitions by investment funds.

While FFCs received by other funds within the investment company can be excluded under certain circumstances, parties will face a significant burden of proof to demonstrate that there is no likely cross-sub- sidization from other funds to the acquiring fund, or that mechanisms are in place to minimize this risk."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Exploring the First 100 Days of the Notification Obligation under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation,"This includes providing substantial evidence that (1) investors in the non-acquiring fund differ in terms of profit entitlement from those in the acquiring fund, (2) the acquiring funds adhere to Directive 2011/61/EU or equivalent third-country legislation to prevent cross-subsidization, and (3) economic and commercial transactions between acquiring and non-acquiring funds are either nonexistent or limited.

March 2024 4 The Commission continues to cast a wide net Despite the unexpectedly high caseload, which might have indicated a need for stricter notification requirements, the Commission remains resolute in its determination to thor- oughly examine all types of FFCs.

Given the expansive nature of notification and reporting requirements, coupled with the limited exceptions, companies likely falling within the scope of the FSR are advised to conduct thorough and comprehensive reviews.

Installing robust monitoring systems can help to ensure that companies are able to provide all nec- essary information accurately and completely within the extensive requirements under the Form FS-CO, or as directly requested by the Commission.

Hengeler Mueller,The EU Data Act - Free flow of machine data?,"Until today, different views exist on how data can be characterized.

A few years ago, the proposition was popular that data is the oil of the 21st century - a raw material whose owner can refine it through analytical tools and then exploit it.

Today, many voices reject the ensuing implication that data is limited.

Instead, advocates of a free flow of data are now multiplying.

They see data as a public, non-exclusive good whose benefits are maximized through sharing.

Users' rights to access machine data The EU's Data Act aims for such a free flow of data.

The law covers data from connected devices and machines, as well as data generated by, for example, voice command of smart devices or other product-related services.

According to the commission's plans, manufacturers should design their products in such a way that users can easily access their machine-generated data.

Users should be able to share the data with companies other than manufacturers and authorize those companies to access the data directly.

Violations of these obligations would lead to heavy fines.

The draft law refers here to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, which provide for fines in maximum amounts of EUR 20 million or 4 percent of global turnover.

The obligations to share data are flanked by obligations on cloud providers to make it easier for their customers to switch providers and by powers for the EU Commission to standardize technical aspects of data sharing.

With the Data Act, the Commission wants to promote the development of data-driven business models and establish new service providers on the market.

Users of connected devices and machines are to be offered a broader range of aftermarket and additional services, such as predictive maintenance services or intelligent spare parts management.

For example, specialized service providers could access data from multiple machines from different customers and manufacturers, thereby improving their forecasting or other offerings based on a larger data set.

The free flow of machine data can indeed spur the development of innovative business models.

But under the draft Data Act, the flow of data is to be stopped at precisely two key points.

Only weak access rights for manufacturers First, the draft does not provide for an explicit legal right of manufacturers to access the data.

This weakens the position of manufacturers vis-à-vis machine users, to whom the draft law grants such a right.

The Commission asserts that the Data Act is not intended to limit the ability of manufacturers to use the machine data.

On closer inspection, however, doubts arise as to whether the draft actually provides sufficient protection for manufacturers.

For example, the recitals of the Data Act and later Article 4 state that manufacturers should only be able to access machine data if they have contractually agreed to do so with users.

Contractual data access may prove to be a blunt sword for manufacturers.

After all, not all users might be willing to grant manufacturers usage options, as the current discussion about the allocation of vehicle data shows.

In addition, the Data Act subjects contractual restrictions on legal access rights to narrow limits.

The rules can even be understood to mean that manufacturers may no longer prohibit users from having their machines serviced by third parties.

It is debatable whether the preferential treatment of users with regard to machine data is justified.

In particular, the interests involved in machine data are not comparable to those involved in personal data.

While personal data must be assigned to the respective person for reasons of fundamental rights, machine data are neither exclusively assigned to the user nor exclusively assigned to the manufacturer of a product.

Rather, this data is generated by the interaction of the manufacturer and the user.

Therefore, the manufacturer should have at least as strong access rights as the user."
Hengeler Mueller,The EU Data Act - Free flow of machine data?,"Rather, this data is generated by the interaction of the manufacturer and the user.

Therefore, the manufacturer should have at least as strong access rights as the user.

Far-reaching exclusion of platforms Second

, the Data Act significantly restricts the possibility of data access by certain platforms.

Machine users will not be allowed to authorize large platforms to retrieve machine data.

It is true that the ban is to apply only to data to which users have access precisely because of the Data Act.

The Commission also states in the recitals that platforms may continue to receive data on a different basis and that they should continue to be able to provide certain services.

However, according to the Commission's logic, users' access to machine data is currently very limited.

This is precisely why the Commission proposed the Data Act.

The restriction of the access ban is therefore likely to leave platforms little room for alternative ways to access data.

The European Commission believes it is protecting the single market and reducing inefficiencies in this way.

However, it must face the question of why it does not let machine users decide for themselves which company they want to make the data available to.

No promotion of the European data economy through bans German and European industrial companies, as well as new players in the market, have built up their own digital platforms for business customers in recent years.

As a result, the industry is moving away from being a manufacturer of conventional products to a provider of digitally supported solutions.

However, the success of these business models does not only depend on machine data flowing freely.

It also requires that users are free to decide with whom they share data and that manufacturers are given strong access rights."
Hengeler Mueller,German general meetings' 'say-on-climate',"Increasing regulatory requirements and external stakeholder expectations are raising the pressure on companies to examine their ESG strategies comprehensively at every level, to refine them, and even to formulate one from scratch.

In light of this, it is not surprising that demands have been voiced internationally for some time that the general meetings of listed companies should also be involved in the relevant deliberations.

But what factors and underlying conditions have to be considered under applicable German law regarding general meeting resolutions, currently referred to using the catchphrase 'say-on-climate'?

To date, no say-on-climate resolutions are known to have been passed in Germany by the general meetings of German listed companies.

On the contrary, sustainability issues have traditionally been of minor importance at general meetings.

One possible reason for this historic reluctance might be the strict rules imposed by the German Stock Corporation Act: it assigns primary responsibility for deciding on a company's strategic direction – within the limits set down by its articles of association – to the executive board, which is advised and monitored by the supervisory board in taking those decisions.

Special scenarios in which the general meeting should handle questions of corporate management are few and very specific, such as the conclusion of certain enterprise agreements or the approval of transformation measures.

Exceptions to this general rule are possible if the executive board decides that it wants to submit certain questions of corporate management to the general meeting for approval.

If the executive board makes the request, it is possible, in principle, to have the general meeting adopt a resolution on the company's climate strategy – or even on its sustainability strategy as a whole.

Details are still unclear, however, as to the legal and factual consequences of such a resolution by the general meeting.

In the particular circumstance where the executive board is pursuing an ambitious sustainability strategy at the expense of the company's profitability, having the general meeting pass a resolution can reduce the risk of personal liability to the executive board members and, indirectly, to the supervisory board members.

Conversely, a low-key climate action plan can, of course, be 'ratified' in this way by the general meeting, and any ambitions to go beyond it could thereby be curbed long term.

Logically, presenting a resolution to the general meeting only as an 'act of consultation' should not result in the executive board later being bound by every detail of that approved strategy.

Rather, the executive board must retain the flexibility to adapt the company's goals and strategies to changing situations throughout the year without needing to have an additional resolution passed (if necessary, in coordination with the supervisory board), and to even disregard the originally approved strategy.

The question as to whether such flexibility is in fact possible once a resolution has been passed has not yet been clarified in every aspect.

Where the executive board chooses not to put say-on-climate items on the agenda, there is currently no refined system under German stock corporation law that would permit shareholders to have such items put on the agenda.

The prevailing view of legal literature is that the general meeting cannot be forced to pass a resolution - for example, by way of a formal request for additions to the agenda.

Alternative approaches – possibly in the form of additional requests aimed at amending the company's articles of association (in order to add certain sustainability targets to the company object, for example) or the directors' and officers' remuneration system (with sustainability targets) – are comparatively 'invasive' by nature and will in most cases fail to achieve the intended aim of a jointly approved strategy."
Hengeler Mueller,German general meetings' 'say-on-climate',"Likewise, refusing to approve the board members' acts because the company's climate strategy is not submitted to the general meeting will most likely fail to have the desired effect.

According to current opinion, the only option that shareholders essentially have at present to make ESG issues part of the general debate is by submitting questions for discussion at the general meeting, without being able to force the meeting to resolve on a particular matter.

ESG and all of its aspects will continue to have a decisive influence on German stock corporation law and the corporate governance of German listed companies, leading to perceptible changes sooner or later.

It already seems foreseeable, and should in principle be welcomed, that in Germany, resolutions on the ESG strategy – or more specifically the climate strategy – of companies will also appear on the agendas of their general meetings.

If it is possible to achieve broad approval for a specific ESG strategy through corresponding resolutions, this can provide relief for the executive board (and indirectly also for the supervisory board) and at the same time send a clear signal to third parties that certain goals are part of the stated corporate strategy."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Banks Strike Back,"October 2023 BRUSSELS  JOUR The Banks Strike Back

In case you have ever wondered in which circumstances a standalone exchange of information may amount to a restriction of competition by object or whether the exchange of recent production volumes can be a problem, you may want to look at AG Rantoss opinion in Banco BPN v BIC Portugus (Case C-298/22)1.

Its also a good read to refresh your knowledge of the basics of by object infringements and information exchange more generally.

Summary of the Case Banco BPN v BIC Portugus concerns a request for preliminary ruling from Portugal.

The Autoridade da Concorrncia, Portugals national competition agency (NCA), had fined several banks for an infringement of national competition law and of Article 101(1) TFEU.

According to the NCA, the countrys six largest banks (comprising approx.

80% of the national market) had been engaged in the exchange of commercially sensitive information on home loans, consumer credit and corporate lending over the course of 11 years.

Broadly speaking, the exchange covered two categories of information, i.e., (i) current and future commercial conditions such as, e.g., charts of credit spreads, bor- rowing capacities and risk variables, and (ii) monthly production figures for each bank, namely disaggregated data on loans granted in euros in the preceding month.

None of that information was available in the public domain or any other source, particularly not in disaggregated form.

The NCA concluded that the exchange of information in question constituted a restric- tion of competition by object, which relieved it of the obligation to investigate its possible effects on the market.

The NCA did not allege that the banks had participated in any oth-

er form of restrictive conduct such as, e.g., price fixing or market-sharing agreements.

The NCAs decision was appealed before the Portuguese Competition Court.

The Court referred the matter to Luxembourg on the grounds that the ECJs case-law on restric- 1 Advocate General Rantos, Opinion of 5 October 2023, Case C-298/22, Banco BPN v BIC Portugus and Others.

Markus Rhrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

October 2023 2 tions of competition by object and effect did not appear to offer any precedent in relation to the assessment of standalone exchange of information within the framework of Arti- cle 101(1) TFEU.

A Jog Down Memory Lane In AG Rantoss own words, the case at hand is an opportunity for the ECJ to develop its case-law on the exchange of information between competitors under Article 101(1) TFEU.

His opening is a quick refresher of the concept of restriction of competition by object.

He evokes the ECJs consistent practice that, to determine whether an agreement between undertakings displays a sufficient degree of harm to be considered a restriction of competition by object, the analysis should focus on the content of its provisions, its objectives and the economic and legal context which it forms part of.

He then reminds us of a few key concepts on by object infringements.  

The notion of by object infringements should be interpreted restrictively.

If an agreement or concerted practice does not satisfy the (restrictive) criteria of a by object infringement, the analysis should switch to effects.  

While the ECJ has emphasized the need for there to be reliable and robust experi- ence for a practice to be classified as a restriction of competition by object, the exist- ence of precedent is not indispensable.

The fact that the Commission did not take the view that a certain kind of agreement was, by virtue of its very object, restrictive of competition in the past does not, as such, prevent it from doing so in the future following an individual, detailed examination of the conduct at issue.

In other words, companies dont get one for free."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Banks Strike Back,"In other words, companies dont get one for free.  

The requirement to assess the legal and economic context of a given type of conduct in order to qualify it as a restriction by object is designed as a basic reality check (or a failsafe test).

Its goal is to check whether specific legal and economic circumstanc- es might cast doubt on the presumed harmful nature of the agreement.

It is meant to weed out any false positives stemming from an excessively formalistic analysis of the exchanges content and objectives.

In AG Rantoss view, in essence, the difference between by object infringements and by effects infringements lies in the intensity with which they are examined.

A by object infringement is easy to perceive and it must be possible to establish that it is capable of restricting competition without having to examine its effects.

The significance of the dis- tinction between restrictions by object and by effect is primarily evidential.

Exchange of Information as a by Object Infringement AG Rantos points out that the ECJ has consistently held that an exchange of information which reduces or removes the degree of uncertainty as to the operation of the market in question, with the result that competition between undertakings is restricted, is con- trary to Article 101(1) TFEU.

The problem, says AG Rantos, was that the Court has not been clear on whether this criterion indicated a restriction of competition in general, by effect or by object.

According to AG Rantos, it is the former (restriction of competition in general), which should not be surprising because the distinction between object and effect restrictions was primarily evidential (as pointed out above).

October 2023 3

Therefore, it follows that, even where competitors exchange strategic information which is capable of reducing uncertainty in the market, their conduct does not automatically qualify as a restriction by object.

Instead, the exchange of information between com- petitors amounts to a by object infringement only if, based on an analysis of its content, objectives and legal and economic context, it can be established that there is a sufficient degree of harm to competition.

On the other hand, the fact that the exchange of infor- mation is not associated with broader cartel conduct does not, as such, call into question the finding of a restriction by object.

The standalone exchange of information can qualify as by object, provided it displays a sufficient degree of harm.

If It Looks Like a Duck AG Rantos concludes his opinion with an assessment of the two categories of informa- tion which the Portuguese banks had exchanged.  

Commercial conditions of loans (credit spreads)  

Those, according to AG Rantos, were clearly of a strategic and commercially sensitive nature.

Credit spreads were an essential element of pricing and there was sufficiently reliable and robust experi- ence to support the view that such exchanges concerning future pricing (or certain parameters of pricing) were inherently anticompetitive, particularly in view of the especially high risk of collusion which they entailed.

Given the nature of the infor- mation, the purpose of the exchange could be no other than to restrict competition.

In terms of the legal and economic context, AG Rantos points out that the exchange took place in a highly concentrated market and in a closed loop, which created an information asymmetry to the disadvantage of non-participating banks.

The fact that credit spread information was exchanged only sporadically was irrelevant.

Therefore, according to AG Rantos, the exchange of information on credit spreads amounted to a restriction by object.  

Production volumes  

The banks had exchanged individualized, disaggregated figures showing the amount of loans granted by each of them in the preceding month."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Banks Strike Back,"Production volumes  

The banks had exchanged individualized, disaggregated figures showing the amount of loans granted by each of them in the preceding month.

According to AG Rantos, production volumes can, in principle, constitute strategic and sensitive information the exchange of which may restrict competition within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU.

However, he takes a cautious view on whether and how likely the exchange of production data might have an anticompetitive object.

The exchange of production volumes, even from the preceding month, did not relate to future conduct and, in principle, the exchange of past (or historic) data was unlikely to lead to a collusive outcome and was less harmful from the point of view of competition law, as it was unlikely to be indicative of competitors future conduct or to provide a common understanding on the market.

Therefore, says AG Rantos, although it could not be ruled out that exchanges relating to past events could also constitute restric- tions by object, that would seem improbable.

To establish an anticompetitive object, one needed to show that the exchange of recent individualized information on stra- tegic variables [i.e., past production volumes], the awareness of which would be ca- pable of reducing or eliminating the parties uncertainty as to their future intentions on the market, in which case such an exchange could be equivalent to the exchange of information on future data [revealed trends], arguably a relatively restrictive test.

October 2023 4 Unfortunately, AG Rantos misses to opportunity to weigh in on some of the more con- troversial and unclear issues that often arise in that context, namely when data becomes historic (i.e., how old does the data need to be and what the minimum time lag is between the reference period the data pertains to and its release) and in which circum- stances data is genuinely aggregated (i.e., across how many companies data needs to be aggregated, whether there is a magic number that offers a safe harbor, three, five or even higher).

However, he does conclude that the facts before him (set out in the reference request) are insufficient to establish a restriction by object.

Interestingly, these facts include: (i)

The monthly exchange of individualized production volumes, i.e., disaggregated data on loans granted in euros in the preceding month; (ii) Between Portugals six largest banks; (iii) With approx.

80% market coverage; (iv) In a highly concentrated market with the top 4 banks accounting for a combined share of 69%, the top 5 banks even of 75%.

Obviously, the above is not to say that the exchange of production volumes may never amount to a restriction by object and, in any case, it might still have restrictive effects (which is beyond AG Rantoss opinion and the issues referred to the ECJ in this case).

Until Next Time It remains to be seen what ECJs take on the reference request will be, particularly whether it may seize the opportunity to offer guidance on some of the key issues that practitioners come across when they assess information exchange systems under Article 101(1) TFEU (age of data, minimum aggregation, time lag for release, etc.).

While we are not expecting an overhaul of the Commissions newly minted Horizontal Guidelines, we are eagerly awaiting what the ECJ has to say.

Hengeler Mueller,Greenwashing: A Liability Trap for Management,"The German Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) is set to tighten the reins in its battle against greenwashing.

In July 2023, BaFin published its sustainable finance strategy, which makes the battle against greenwashing a priority.

According to BaFin, the term ‘greenwashing’ describes the practice of presenting sustainability-related information that does not clearly and fairly reflect the sustainability profile of a company or product.

Without doubt, greenwashing is not just an issue for the financial services sector.

The European Commission recently presented a draft ""Green Claims Directive"" which is intended to provide consumers with the certainty of knowing that something sold as being environmentally-friendly (or ""green"") is indeed what it claims to be.

The draft directive was preceded by the publication of an EU study, which found that over 50% of EU-based environmental claims examined by the study were judged to be vague, misleading or unfounded.

Legal Compliance Duty

If the draft directive is implemented, the sustainability-related disclosure requirements will be tightened further.

In the current legal environment, companies and/or their managers can become liable under various aspects if they make any sustainability-related claims which prove to be inaccurate.

These developments are significant for company managers because management is obliged by general principles under corporate law to ensure compliance within the company (so-called duty of legality).

This encompasses two aspects.

First, managers themselves must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Second, management must organise the company in a way which prevents other board members or employees from violating legal regulations.

If there is any suspicion of misconduct, this must be investigated and immediately stopped.

Otherwise, management may face civil and possibly criminal liability.

Organisational compliance must therefore be directed at preventing greenwashing.

Although not new in principle, this will pose various management challenges, particularly given the regulatory zeal of European legislators.

In the financial sector in particular, a veritable tsunami of ESG regulation has emerged in recent years.

This trend is also prevalent outside the financial sector.

In addition to the draft Green Claims Directive, examples include the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which came into force in January 2023, and supply chain legislation.

For market participants, the task of keeping an eye on relevant developments should not be underestimated.

The legal provisions also contain numerous undefined terms that have yet to be clarified by further regulations and case law.

Greenwashing Prevention as Part of ESG Governance From a management perspective, another challenge is that the requirements for sustainability-related disclosure affect various functions within the company (such as investor relations, financial reporting, legal, compliance, sales, etc.)

and therefore trigger a need for coordination at a company-wide level.

Against this backdrop, managers are well advised to review existing compliance structures to determine whether they adequately cover any risks of greenwashing.

Conceptually, greenwashing prevention measures form part of the processes for implementing ESG (environmental, social and governance) requirements within the company (ESG governance).

Available Guidance

The following questions arise in connection with green claims: Procedurally, how can the data used for sustainability-related claims be guaranteed as accurate and methodologically sound?

How is information systematically collected, validated and consolidated within the company?

And which function within the company is responsible for these tasks in each case?

Depending on the business activity and risk situation, various organisational models are feasible."
Hengeler Mueller,Greenwashing: A Liability Trap for Management,"And which function within the company is responsible for these tasks in each case?

Depending on the business activity and risk situation, various organisational models are feasible.

Guidance can be provided by input from standard setters and associations, such as the position paper on ESG published by the German Institute for Compliance (DICO) in June 2023.

Regardless of which organisational model is chosen, managers are collectively responsible for the implementation of the ESG requirements, and therefore for greenwashing prevention.

Of course, managers cannot fulfil all the requisite tasks by themselves.

Instead, management must ensure that the tasks are delegated appropriately to suitable bodies and that their responsibilities are clearly documented.

Documentation Compliant with Regulatory Standards In this context, documentation that complies with the standards set by the competent regulatory authorities is of particular importance.

It should relate both to the data on the basis of which ESG-related claims are made and to the measures taken to validate this data.

It is imperative that the information can be restored, even years later should the relevant employee(s) have left the company.

Other measures to reduce risk include traditional compliance instruments, such as conducting employee training, spot checks and establishing whistleblower systems.

Dealing with Greenwashing Allegations Even the most sophisticated compliance system cannot always prevent violations of sustainability-related disclosure requirements, and greenwashing allegations can be made through various channels.

It is conceivable, for example, that the relevant facts are reported internally by whistleblowers, or that they are identified as part of audits by internal control functions (compliance, internal audit).

More recently, companies have also been confronted with greenwashing allegations by external stakeholders, such as environmental authorities or consumer protection organisations.

How should management deal with such allegations?

It follows from their duty to legality mentioned above that allegations must be investigated.

Experience shows that the facts are often complex: it follows that investigating them can require considerable time and effort.

In such cases, it is important that management initiates appropriate data preservation measures at an early stage.

These measures must ensure that data, potentially relevant to the investigation, is not deleted or modified.

Governance Plays a Major Role Governance is also of great importance in investigations.

The organisation should generally be structured in such a way that it can withstand an ""investigation of the investigation"" by internal bodies or auditors (e.g. the supervisory board or a special auditor appointed by the general meeting), or external third parties (e.g. public authorities or audit firms).

Typically, precautions should be taken to ensure that the key players are sufficiently independent.

Respective responsibilities should be specified and documented as precisely as possible.

If the organisation is structured accordingly, this reduces the risk of claims being brought against managers for any violations.

In addition, the precautions described above can help to identify and remedy any internal deficiencies in sustainability-related communication."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Roundup Before Christmas,"December 2023 BRUSSELS  JOUR The Roundup Before Christmas

We dont want to repeat ourselves, but its (again) the most wonderful time of the year (Andy Williams is not known to have been a lawyer, according to Wikipedia).

As we finish decking our respective halls and celebrating the return of Commissioner Vestager to the Berlaymont, we are also looking back at 2023 and its takeaways for 2024.

Like every year, we dedicate our Christmas issue to the main segments of EU Competition Law  this year, we will be looking at antitrust, merger control and the Foreign Subsidies Regulation.

So, put down the tinsel and take a breather with us.

Antitrust We are told that the coziness of festive gatherings does not apply to companies, and the European Commission tends to agree.

Here are a few of the most important antitrust developments of 2023.  

The European Commission and the national competition authorities seem to have their eyes set on industry associations facilitating cartels.

Following in the foot- steps of the ICAP case, the European Commission is currently investigating the in- volvement of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association in the carmakers collusion regarding end-of-life vehicles.

Not to mention its ongoing inquiry into Euro- bats assistance in the creation and functioning of price-setting indices used by starter battery firms to negotiate with carmakers.

This is not to say that industry associations were ever shielded from the enforcement of cartel provisions (or that there is not broad scope for legitimate cooperation through industry associations), but with the adoption of the new Horizontal Guidelines, it seems that the European Commission is keen on road testing them as soon as possible.  

True to its (green) word, the European Commission has adopted antitrust Guide- lines for sustainable agreements in agriculture, offering clarifications on how the agri-food sector can design sustainability agreements in agriculture without infring- ing EU Competition Law.

The idea is not new  Art. 210a of Regulation 1308/2013 Markus Rhrig, Christian Dankerl, Laura Stoicescu and Christoph Sielmann report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

CONTENTS ANTITRUST MERGER CONTROL FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION December 2023 2 establishing a common organization of the markets in agricultural products excludes certain restrictive agreements in the agricultural sector from the Art.

101(1) TFEU prohibition when those agreements are indispensable to achieve sustainability stand- ards going beyond the mandatory EU or national rules.

Art.

210a itself was actually introduced in 2021, when the European Parliament and the Council adopted this new exclusion from competition rules for agricultural products, in the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy reform for 2023-2027.

By publishing the Guidelines, the European Commission offered more guidance as to how exactly that can be done.

And as a side note, the European Commission continues its open-door policy to dis- cussing cooperative sustainability agreements generally, and would also be willing to adopt an Article 10 decision to provide additional guidance.

However, there appears to be somewhat of a chicken and egg problem  while companies would appreciate guidance, no individual company may be willing to enter an extended process with the European Commission if the outcome of the investigation is not clear.  

The trend regarding the sanctioning of buyers cartels is gaining momentum in the shape of the sanctioning of no-poach agreements.

Although still eons away from the U.S., Europe is now building its case-law with the European Commissions latest dawn raid earlier this autumn targeting no-poach agreements.

In the meantime, various national competition authorities (France, Belgium) are already investigating no-poach agreements as hardcore by-object infringements, potentially having negative effects on innovation."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Roundup Before Christmas,"Although for the moment the focus is on sectors which rely on highly qualified or skilled works such as engineering, technology consulting, or IT, enforcers do not exclude pursuing such setups also in low-skills sectors in the future.

It appears that this latest wave of cases is just the start of a new category of antitrust cases, since more are expected in the near future.  

What spread like wildfire in The Bubble came to be confirmed  the Market Defini- tion Notice will not be published as scheduled.

Although due for the first week of De- cember, there is some more uncertainty around the timetable for the Notices adoption than was the case until now.

In any event, we are keeping our ears to the ground and will report back as soon as we hear something.  

To end the section on a (New Years) high, well have a quick look at upcoming policy projects.

To begin with, with the 12 October DG COMP Interactive Workshop on the Evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the European Commission has finished its tour of public consultations.

In parallel, the evaluation support study tender was awarded a year ago, so the overall picture of the necessary reforms should be clear, once the Eu- ropean Commission draws the line.

And considering the overdrive of the legal rumor mill in Brussels regarding the scope of the reform, we are eagerly waiting for the first draft to be published.

Also on our radar are the Guidelines on exclusionary abuses of dominance, al- though only scheduled for adoption in 2025.

In March, the European Commission has launched a Call for Evidence seeking feedback on the adoption of the Guidelines, the draft of which is due for publication before summer 2024.

The new text will most likely focus on exclusionary conduct only (as opposed to exploitative abuses).

While CONTENTS ANTITRUST MERGER CONTROL FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION December 2023 3 the Commission is expected to continue to apply an economic approach to Article 102 cases (which is now firmly based on the EU Courts case-law), the role that quan- titative price-cost tests will play is likely to differ depending on the specific type of exclusionary conduct.

Also in March of this year, the European Commission published a Communication amending its 2008 Guidance on enforcement priorities concerning exclusionary abuses.

Merger control 2023 was an exciting year for the field of merger control, filled with groundbreaking devel- opments, historic firsts, and  so you dont panic  some thrilling cliffhangers for 2024.  

One of the major merger-related developments in 2023 was the continuing Illumina/ Grail saga ... with the grand finale (with respect to the jurisdictional issues) expect- ed for 2024.

As you will recall, the European Commission  based on its novel Art.

22 EUMR approach  prohibited the merger, but which the parties had already completed without waiting for clearance.

The General Court, back in the summer of 2022, upheld the European Commissions decision to assess the case (see our July 2022 issue).

Illumina appealed this decision, and the case is now pending before the Court of Justice.

The oral hearing took place on 12 December; the Advocate Generals opinion will follow in March, and the judgement is expected in the Summer, hopefully bringing much-needed clarity on the European Commissions jurisdiction to review transactions.  

In a storyline parallel to the Art.

22 EUMR question, the European Commission, in July 2023, imposed a record-setting gun-jumping fine of EUR 432 million upon Il- lumina (next to a symbolic, yet likewise unprecedented, EUR 1,000 fine upon Grail); Illumina has challenged this decision, too."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Roundup Before Christmas,"And as if these werent already enough landmark events, in October 2023, the European Commission  in another first-of-its- kind decision  obligated Illumina to divest Grail and to restore the ante-merger sit- uation (on 17 December 2023, after a U.S. Circuit Court mostly sided with the Federal Trade Commission that had also required a divestiture of Grail, Illumina announced that it would sell off Grail).

With the two cases pending before the EU courts, you may wonder how many more historic firsts this case will bring in 2024  Speaking of gun-jumping, another important event in the last months was the ECJs judgement on Altices appeal of the General Courts decision to largely uphold the European Commissions decision to fine Altice (the General Court had slightly reduced the European Commissions EUR 124.5 million fine  which was a record amount in the pre-Illumina/Grail era  by about EUR 6 million).

In spring 2023, the Advocate General supported the European Commissions and the General Courts decisions.

In its judgement issued in November 2023, the ECJ largely dismissed Altices appeal, only reducing the fine by another EUR 3 million.

The court confirmed the General Court in that the European Commission was entitled to fine both the infringement of Art.

4(1) EUMR (the obligation to notify a transaction before implementation) and of Art. 7(1) EUMR (the obligation not to implement a transaction before notification or clearance).

The court argued that the two provisions pursued autonomous objectives CONTENTS ANTITRUST MERGER CONTROL FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION December 2023 4 and underlined their differences: While a breach of Art.

4(1) EUMR automatically resulted in a breach of Art.

7(1)

, the same was not true in the opposite direction; and while an infringement of Art.

4(1) EUMR was instantaneous in nature, an infringe- ment of Art.

7(1) EUMR was a continuous violation.

Overall, the ECJ confirmed the European Commissions firm stance towards gun-jumping.

However, the ruling does not seem to have any immediate effects on the transaction practice (in particular pre-closing covenants), leaving many questions to be answered in future decisions.  

And if you  too  cant get enough of these gun-jumping cases: There is a sequel in the making, starring French media companies Lagardre and Vivendi, which, in November 2023, have appealed before the General Court a European Commission request for information in their gun-jumping investigation of the Lagardre/Vivendi deal.

To be continued  Christmas wouldnt be Christmas without some family drama.

Or, in the case of the European Commission and the UKs CMA, without some divergence between com- petition regulators.

The most recent major example was the planned acquisition of eTraveli by Booking, two online travel agencies (OTA):

While the CMA had already cleared the transaction in Phase I in September 2022, the European Commission, in September 2023, blocked the merger after a Phase II investigation, citing concerns that the deal would strengthen Bookings dominance and result in higher costs, which were, in the European Commissions view, not sufficiently addressed by the remedies proposed by Booking (the situation, therefore, was the other way around as in the oth- er major case of divergence in 2023:

Microsofts acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which had been cleared by the European Commission, while the CMA initially blocked the merger).

The Booking/eTraveli case also made headlines because the decision was based on an untested but  if confirmed by the courts  consequential conglomerate theory of harm, referring to cases where there may not be horizontal or vertical overlaps, but the parties are active on neighboring markets: In the EEA, Booking is mostly active in the hotel OTA business; eTraveli mainly acts as a flight OTA."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Roundup Before Christmas,"The European Com- mission argued that the transaction would have allowed Booking to become the main player in the flight OTA business, thereby generating significant additional traffic to its core hotel platform and strengthening its ecosystem.

Booking has appealed the Euro- pean Commission decision before the General Court (case no. T-1139/23).

Foreign Subsidies Regulation It is not only the most wonderful time of the year, but also the time that is often used to reflect on key events of the year that is drawing to a close.  

In the field of foreign subsidies law, one of the key events in 2023 certainly was the Foreign Subsidies Regulations (FSR) entry into force on 12 July with notification requirements for certain transactions since 12 October, and the adoption of the FSR Implementing Regulation.

While dealmakers were hoping for the FSR Implementing Regulation to be a (very) early Christmas present that would ease the burden of having CONTENTS ANTITRUST MERGER CONTROL FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION December 2023 5 to identify relevant financial contributions, gathering the data and reporting these financial contributions, this has not exactly turned out to be the case.

Although the European Commission responded to heavy criticism from various companies and industry associations by raising the threshold for individual financial contributions that need to be reported to EUR 1 million (from EUR 200.000) and only having them report aggregated financial contributions per third country if they exceed EUR 45 million (previously EUR 4 million), identifying the relevant financial contributions and collecting the relevant data is still a very burdensome exercise for which most companies currently do not have a monitoring system in place.

Moreover, first practi- cal experiences show that DG COMP in pre-notification may request aggregated finan- cial contributions to be broken-down and to be provided with detailed information for certain financial contributions.

Not surprisingly, this focusses on financial contribu- tions allocatable to specific countries.  

The first two months of application of the notification requirement have not brought much clarity on how the European Commission is applying its newest tool.

DG COMPs Task Force on Foreign Subsidies still appears to be understaffed compared to the resources that had been promised to it.

According to Eddy de Smijter, Head of the International Relations Unit which is home of the Task Force on Foreign Subsidies, some cases were brought to DG COMPs attention as a result of them having to re- mind some companies of the existence of the FSR.

Since the notification obligation entered into force, DG COMP handled a medium double-digit number of cases under the FSR (all of which also notifiable under the EUMR).

This number already surpasses the anticipated annual number of cases expected to trigger a notification requirement  and we are only just over two months into the application of the notification obliga- tion!  

In addition to the cases notified to the European Commission and the cases currently in pre-notification discussions, the European Commission has received several in- formal complaints about allegedly distortive foreign subsidies.

The publics attention was especially caught by informal complaints in the football sector, namely the Spanish La Ligas complaint about financial aid from Qatar to French outlet Paris Saint-Germain and the Belgian football club Royal Excelsior Virtons complaint about competing club Lommel SK, part of the City Football Group, having received financial doping in the form of artificially inflated sponsorship agreements but also  more directly  through capital injections from UAE.

The European Commission, however, confirmed that it has so far not opened any proceedings on its own initiative, neither in the football sector nor in any other industry sector, but prioritizes the noti- fications of transactions it has received under the FSR."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: The Roundup Before Christmas,"The FSR does not lead to transparency in the processing of cases.

While the term Foreign Subsidies has its own policy area category in DG COMPs case search, a search in this category currently does not return any findings.

Most cases handled by DG COMP under the FSR will fly under the publics radar: Unlike transactions notified under the EUMR, under the FSR transactions do not need to be published, unless the European Commission decides to carry out an in-depth Phase II investigation into a transaction involving foreign subsidies potentially distorting the EU internal market CONTENTS ANTITRUST MERGER CONTROL FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATION December 2023 6 (in which case a summary notice of the decision to initiate an in-depth review will be published).

While this discretion may be welcomed by the companies involved, it restricts other stakeholders from voicing their concerns in Phase I proceedings.

It also has downsides for the companies involved: as the European Commission does not issue clearance decisions in Phase 1 but clears notified transactions by lapse of the review period, obtaining early clearance (as is possible under the EUMR) seems diffi- cult.

Hopefully by our next Christmas edition of Brussels  Jour we will not only have more clarity on the practical hurdles when applying the FSR.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Be My Fee-lentine,"February 2024 BRUSSELS  JOUR Be My Fee-lentine Its February and love is in the air, they say.

However, not a lot of love was shown by the Court of Justice towards notaries in Lithuania and lawyers in Bulgaria when it ruled that their efforts to establish minimum fees was in breach of competition law.

In the two judgments (C438/22 and C-128/21)

the Court consolidates its practice regarding minimum fees established by various professional organizations.

And we think its not pure coincidence that both judgments were handed down within a week from each other.

The cherry on the top potentially far-reaching on NCAs powers to directly rely on Article 23(2) of Regulation 1/2003 where they lack sufficient enforcement powers under their national laws.

Existential Questions In the case of the Lithuanian notaries, it was the Lithuanian Competition Council noting that the Chamber of Notaries had adopted a set of rules to clarify the methods for calcu- lating fees payable for certain services provided by notaries.

According to the Competition Council, these rules in fact established a mechanism which fixed, in all cases, the amount of those fees to the highest amount of the range authorized by government regulation.

The Competition Council characterized the clarifications as a by object infringement and fined the Chamber of Notaries, which appealed the decision.

The court asked the ECJ to adopt a preliminary ruling on, among other things, whether the Chamber of Notaries clarifying rules amounted to a restriction of competition by object or by effect.

In the case of the Bulgarian lawyers, the case started as a benign run-of-the-mill insurance claim where lawyers fees were submitted to the court for reimbursement.

The court con- cluded that the claimed legal fees were excessive and reduced them to reflect the complexity of the case, as it was entitled to do under Bulgarias Code of Civil Procedure.

However, the Code of Civil Procedure did not allow the court to set the amount of legal fees lower than the minimum provided for in a regulation adopted by Supreme Council of the Legal Profession.

The decision on costs was further appealed by the applicant in the main pro- ceedings, and the referring court forwarded a number of questions to the Court of Justice, asking, amongst others, whether a scheme fixing minimum amounts for lawyers fees is in Markus Rhrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

February 2024 2 compliance with Article 101(1) TFEU.

As a side note The difference between the amount claimed and the courts amendment was less than EUR 100, but thats how judicial legends are born at the ECJ.

Background noise The debate regarding minimum fees is not exactly new at national level.

For at least a dec- ade, bar associations and NCAs are engaged in a (more or less) tacit tug-of-war regarding whether such fees are in breach of competition law.

In 2018, the Cyprus bar association avoided being fined by the European Commission for a minimum fee scale for out-of-court legal work such as drawing up wills, contracts, the administration of estates and the registration of companies, by amending the national law.

The amendment entailed abolishing the minimum fee scale.

In 2017, the Romanian national union of public notaries agreed to a number of commit- ments with the NCA to remove the competitive constraints regarding establishing, among others, minimum fees.

Also in Romania, in 2004, the NCA had the Parliament abolish from the lawyers regulation a scheme setting minimum fees for lawyers.

An attempt to re-introduce the scheme in the same law in 2016 was swiftly nipped in the bud by the same NCA.

In 2017, the national bar association council adopted the same scheme making its en- forcement mandatory, but had to recall it only three months later, after being told off by the NCA.

Local attempts to reinstate the scheme since then were swiftly addressed by the NCA."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Be My Fee-lentine,"Local attempts to reinstate the scheme since then were swiftly addressed by the NCA.

Labels, labels, labels, ...

In the two judgments the Court consolidates its own case-law regarding if and in which circumstances notaries, lawyers and their professional organizations qualify as undertak- ings or associations of undertakings.

In CHEZ Elektro Bulgaria (Case C-427/16), the Court had already held that the (Bulgarian) lawyers professional organizations governing body qualified as an association of undertak- ings within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU when it adopted regulations determining the minimum amount of professional fees.

At the time, the judgment marked a departure from Wouters (Case C-309/99), where the Court had stated that the Dutch bar association could not qualify as an undertaking or group of undertakings because it did not carry out any economic activity, and its members were not sufficiently linked to each other.

In CHEZ Elektro Bulgaria, the Court had come out the other way, referring to the absence of any provision indicating that the governing body acted on behalf of the State when issuing the regulations on fees.

This rationale was carried over and upheld by the Court in Case C-438/22 in January 2024.

However, the Court had not had yet the opportunity to undertake a similar assessment regarding notaries.

Partially building on Wouters (*gasp*), the Court in Case C-128/21 starts from the premise that the notion of undertaking in competition law comprises any entity engaged in an economic activity.

According to the Court, notaries established in Lithuania carried out their activities in the context of a liberal profession and not a public officials.

While it was acknowledged that activities which were connected to the February 2024 3 exercise of prerogatives of public authority did not have an economic character justifying the application of the EU competition laws, the notaries activities specifically listed in the request for a preliminary ruling (approval of mortgages, drafting notarial deeds, validation of certain exchange contracts) did not fall in that category.

In relation to these specific activities notaries should therefore be considered undertakings.

Round up the usual suspects In CHEZ Elektro Bulgaria (2017), the Court had already established that the fixing of minimum amounts for lawyers fees, made mandatory by national legislation, amounted to horizontal fixing of minimum tariffs and prohibited by Article 101(1) TFEU as a by object restriction.

The Court reached a similar decision in the Bulgarian case at hand, stating that national legislation which did not allow a lawyer to set its fees below the minimum amount laid down in a regulation issued by a professional organization of lawyers, and did not authorize the courts to order reimbursement of fees in an amount less than that min- imum amount, amounted to a restriction on competition by object within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU.

For notaries, however, the Court had not yet ruled on whether the fixing of minimum fees for certain economic activities might amount to a by object infringement.

In the Lith- uanian case, the Court, having established notaries sometimes qualify as undertakings, built a somewhat classical assessment of the behavior and, quite unsurprisingly, reached the same conclusion as in the case of the lawyers.

To start with, the Court, building again on Wouters (*gasp, again*), classified the notaries professional organization as an association of undertakings, since its governing body is composed exclusively of members of the profes- sion elected by their peers, without the intervention of national authorities.

Therefore, the clarifications it had issued regarding minimum fees constitute decisions of an association of undertakings."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Be My Fee-lentine,"Therefore, the clarifications it had issued regarding minimum fees constitute decisions of an association of undertakings.

And its content  a mechanism for calculating notaries fees resulting in them using the highest price in the price range proposed by the Ministry of Justice  was found to amount to horizontal fixing of the prices for the services in questions and thus a by object infringement.

When life doesnt give you lemons ... then, according to the Court, you pass by the lemonade stand and grab yourself a glassful.

Tucked away in the last paragraphs of the judgment in Case C-128/21 you will find rather sweeping language affording NCAs the power to directly rely on Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003 when imposing fines for infringements of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.

According to settled case law, and as established in Article 23(3) of Regulation 1/2003, where its internal rules allows an association to bind its members, the fine imposed on the association for an infringement of Article 101 TFEU may andin fact, mustbe calculated by reference to the turnover achieved by its members.

However, the national law applicable at the time the conduct before the Court had occurred did not allow the Lithuanian NCA to take into account the turnover of an associations members for purposes of calculating an antitrust fine to be imposed on the association (or so its seems).

Not a problem, says the February 2024 4 Court of Justice.

The lack of a national provision allowing the NCA to take into account the members turnover did not prevent the NCA from doing it just that apparently relying on some sort of direct application of Article 23 of Regulation in favor of NCAs.

The Court builds (quite loosely) on the Schenker case (Case C-681/11).

However, there, the Court merely established that NCAs may exceptionally not impose fines on undertakings which had infringed competition law but had taken part in a leniency program.

The key notion of not imposing a fine being the exception was tied, in essence to effective enforce- ment of Article 101 TFEU and the powers conferred to NCAs under Article 5 of Regula- tion 1/2003.

This is quite different from what the Court could be read to suggest in Case C-128/21, namely that Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003 conferred some subsidiary power for NCAs to impose and calculate fines in direct application of that provision where their respective national law does not allow afford them the impose fines which have a sufficient deterrent effect.

Or even more broadly, that NCAs may resort to the enforcement powers that Regulation 1/2003 grants to the Commission where national law does not provide for such powers Where a Member State fails to fully implement the ECN+ Directive, would that Member States NCA be ableor even requiredto directly resort to the powers grant- ed to the Commission in Regulation 1/2003 where the normal sanction for a failure to implement a directive would be the Commission going after the Member State?

Such a broad reading of the Courts holding in Case C-128/21 (which is really just an obiter dictum) would be worrying from a rule of law perspective.

Well always have Luxemburg

It appears that the Court is putting all its ducks in a row regarding horizontal price fixing by liberal professions organizations.

That will not only bring some peace and quiet on the national level, but it also sends a strong message to similar structures that times are changing and that the niches somewhat forgotten until now are front and center today.

Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Raiding private homes of firms' executives – DG COMP’s response to the new ""working from home"" world","April 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR Youve Got MailOr

Do You?

Raiding private homes of firms executives  DG COMPs response to the new working from home world.

Ah, the perks of working from home!

Especially the afternoon, when the postman rings the doorbell to deliver the smart pet bed you bought online for Suzy.

Suzy can finally enjoy a temperature-controlled sleep at night!

But when you open the door, the postman is not the postman, there is no parcel in sight, and some people in suits are suddenly ask-

ing questions about a cartel.

In your kitchen.

You are not dreaming  you have just been raided by the European Commission (Commission).

As working from home has become commonplace in many companies, DG COMP expects to more frequently assert its powers to raid private homes to collect evidence of antitrust infringement.

On April 5, the Commission announced it had smoothly raided (in DG COMPs Maria Jaspers words) a private home where sensitive evidence related to a sus- pected cartel was allegedly held.

Please refrain from speed-dialling your general counsel for a moment, while we tell you more about the background of such inspections, and pro- vide you with some coping strategies, au cas ou.

In Search of Lost Time The Commissions latest move comes as quite a surprise, since it renders mainstream a practice rarely used in the past, although the French competition authority got a head start, having conducted such inspections in November 2021 in relation with possible anticom- petitive practices in the food retail sector.

While the power to raid private homes has long been on the books, the Commission made use of that power only in a very limited number of cases such as, for example, when investigating a cartel between producers of North Sea shrimps, and previously, a cartel in the gas-insulated switchgear market.

However, the fact that this tool was scarcely used is a meagre consolation now.

On the occasion of this latest raid, the Commission declared its intention of using it more frequent- ly, in parallel to raids carried out at the business itself.

Why?

Maria Jaspers invoked the Markus Roehrig and Laura Stoicescu report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

April 2022 2 Covid-backed shift to working from home, which resulted in sensitive documents ending up in private homes, inevitably.

And while we are not big fans of Proust, it seems to us that by using this latest tool more often, the Commission is trying to make up for lost inspection opportunities during the height of the pandemic.

At least you may not have to worry about the Commission leaking details about Suzys die- tary requirements to the press.

Jaspers noted that the Commission wont publicly announce such private premises dawn raids in order to protect the individuals privacy.

While this detail might sound like a footnote, it actually is another hint that things are changing in the Commissions dawn raid rulebook  the Commission is increasingly concerned with the protection of private data, when it comes to inspections.

If you are a frequent reader of our newsletter, you are already familiar with the other amendments, which we discussed in detail in our June 2021 and March 2022 issues.

By the Book To refresh everyones memory  Article 21 of Regulation 1/2003 affords the Commission the power to conduct on-site inspections (i.e. dawn raid) of premises other than a com- panys office or production site.

That includes the private homes of a companys directors, managers and other staff.

While the Commissions powers are somewhat more limited when it raids private homes, they are still formidable."
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Raiding private homes of firms' executives – DG COMP’s response to the new ""working from home"" world","That includes the private homes of a companys directors, managers and other staff.

While the Commissions powers are somewhat more limited when it raids private homes, they are still formidable.

In particular, the Commission has the power to enter any premises, land and means of transport of companies (i.e. private homes, apartments, cars etc.), to examine the books and other records related to the business, irrespective of the medium on which they are stored, and to take or obtain in any form copies of or extracts from such books or records.

Some additional procedural safeguards apply.

The Commission may adopt a decision to search private homes only if there is reasonable suspicion that books or other records related to the business and to the subject-matter of the inspection are being kept there.

Moreover, the Commission cannot conduct the raid without prior authorization from the national judicial authority of the Member State in which the private home is located (i.e. essentially a judicial search warrant).

Before issuing a search warrant, the national judicial authority (often a court) may confirm that the Commission decision is authentic and that the proposed inspection is neither arbitrary nor excessive in light of the alleged infringe- ment, the importance of the evidence sought, the involvement of the company concerned and the reasonable likelihood that business books and records relating to the subject matter of the inspection are kept at the private home to be searched.

However, the national judicial authority may not call into question the necessity for the inspection nor ask to be provided with information in the Commissions file.

Having said that, bear in mind that national competition authorities accompanying the Commission or acting on their own authority will often have broader powers than the Commission when it comes to raiding private premises.

April 2022 3 Alices Treasure Map

The nuts and bolts of conducting dawn raids are laid out in the Commissions Explanatory note on inspections pursuant to Article 20(4) of Council Regulation No 1/2003, which makes for a fine read, in our opinion.

So, before you start stuffing documents under Suzys old bed, lets go through some points of wisdom we took out of the Commissions explan- atory note, in case the men in suits do show up in your kitchen.  

How to I know that the officers have a right to raid my home?

Ask for the inspec- tion decision (or search warrant) and their badge or service card evidencing that they are Commission officials.

As an additional step, make sure you carefully examine the inspection decision (or search warrant) to determine its scope and in particular the premises, documents and objects that are the subject of the warrant.  

Can they search my car, my garden house, etc.?

Yes.

The Commissions inspection decision only needs to include the address of the premises to be searched and affords the officials to power to access all of the addressees property, cars etc.

that are located on these premises, leaving the Commission with some margin of appreciation on the ground.  

Do I have to let them in?

Do I need to cooperate?

If you dont, the Commission may (and likely will) ask the national regulator or police to force its way into your home.

You will want to discuss with your company if and to what extent you should cooperate beyond opening your doors.  

Can I call my company, my boss, our legal department?

How about a lawyer?

Yes, you may and are generally well-advised to do so as soon as possible.

Your com- pany may have dawn raid guidelines that will tell you who your first point of contact should be.

You may also ask the inspectors to delay (for a reasonable amount of time) the start of the inspection, until a member of the legal department (or external coun- sel) arrives.  

What if I know that there are potentially incriminating documents or data in my house?

Dont destroy documents!"
Hengeler Mueller,"Brussels à Jour: Raiding private homes of firms' executives – DG COMP’s response to the new ""working from home"" world","What if I know that there are potentially incriminating documents or data in my house?

Dont destroy documents!

Dont block access to or disconnect your email!

Dont delete any electronic data!  

Can they search my companys/ my private PC?

How about my company/ my private mobile?

Yes.

The Commissions explanatory note explicitly states that its IT experts may search private devices and media that are used for professional reasons (Bring Your Own Device - BYOD) when they are found on the premises (of the raided company  in this case, your home office).  

Can they seize my computer/ communication devices?

That will be a no.

The Commission generally does not have the power to seize evidence, only to make copies.  

Do I have to answer questions that the Commission asks during the raid?

There is no legal obligation to answer questions that the Commission asks when raiding a private home.

However, you are well-advised to consult your company as to if and to what extent you should cooperate.  

Can they seal rooms or my desk?

No, the Commissions power to seal rooms is limit- ed to dawn raids conducted at the companys premises.

April 2022 4 These are only some of the  often tricky  questions that an individual might encounter if the Commission raids its private home.

Companies are well-advised to educate their ex- ecutives and other staff about how to respond if their private homes are raided.

A separate handout covering (at least) these points as a Christmas gift may come handy.

We are sure they will not return this one to the store.

And before we go  Suzy has nothing to do with the dawn raid, scouts word.

Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"July 2023 1 LEGAL UPDATE | DISPUTE RESOLUTION New representative action regime passed into law On 7 July 2023, Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, passed the Act to implement the EU Representative Actions Directive1.

Until the very end, the Act had been the subject of intense discussions between the coalition parties.

The European Commission had meanwhile initiated an infringement procedure against Germany for failing to transpose the Directive into national law on time2.

The new statutory provisions are to enter into force after the German upper house, the Bundesrat, deliberates on them in autumn 2023.

The new law3 will result in a reorganisation of the German collective redress system, which has to date only been rudimentary.

The linchpin of the Act is the 'Consumer Rights En- forcement Act' ('VDuG'), which is to implement the Directive's provisions on the institution of a representative action for redress measures mechanism.

Since the model declaratory action, which was only introduced in 2018, has not proven to be particularly prolific, the new representative action is intended to eliminate significant deficits of the current legal protection system.

Unlike the model declaratory action, which to date has allowed the courts only to make legal determinations applicable to a large number of plaintiffs, the VDuG introduces a representative action for redress (such as the payment of damages).

The redress sought with a representative action is intended to benefit consumers directly, without them having to initiate additional individual proceedings.

Consumer protection associations first and foremost will be entitled to file representative actions.

The entity bringing the action can choose whether to seek a redress measure, an injunctive measure or merely a determina- 1 Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2020 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing Directive 2009/22/EC (the ""Directive"").

VDuG.

A revised version of the KapMuG has been announced for the period thereafter.

Companies must prepare themselves for comprehensive changes: in addition to the action for redress measures, which can also be brought as a cross-border representative action, the new law provides for innovations in inter alia the third-party funding of the entities entitled to bring these actions, the suspension of the limitation period for the claims asserted and the disclosure of evidence.

I. Conditions for the new representative action 1.

Broad scope of applicability The Directive limits the mandatory scope of application of the representative action to infringements of certain provisions of European consumer protection law (in particular in the areas of data protection, financial services, energy, environment, telecommunication, health, digital services and product liability).

The VDuG goes beyond these provisions and extends the scope of application of representative actions to include all civil law disputes between traders and consumers (cf. Sec. 1 (1) VDuG).

Thus, claims in tort will also be cov- ered under the new law.

This reflects what has been the legal situation to date with regard to the model declaratory action, while expanding the scope of application for actions for injunctions under the German Act on Injunctive Relief (Unterlassungsklagegesetz).

For a representative action to be permissible, the association bringing the action must verifiably demonstrate that at least 50 consumers may be affected by the representative action.

What legal standard is associated with 'verifiably demonstrate' is an unanswered question.

In contrast to the draft version of the Act, which provided for a demonstration to the satisfaction of the court (Glaubhaftmachung) pursuant to Sec.

294 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), the final version of the provision will likely mean a simplified standard of proof from consumer protection associations' perspective.

In addition, actions brought by capital market investors could also fall within the scope of the Act.

To date, these were governed solely by the KapMuG. The VDuG does not address the issue of a potential competition between it and the KapMuG. In any event, it seems Content I. Conditions for the new representative action  2 II.

Furthermore, as the agreement between the current German Government's coalition part- ners already provides, the representative action will also be open to small businesses.

Small businesses are defined in the Act as businesses with less than 10 employees and with an annual turnover or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR two million (cf. Sec. 1 (2) VDuG).

An intrinsic right of trade associations to file representative actions is not provided for in the VDuG. 2."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"An intrinsic right of trade associations to file representative actions is not provided for in the VDuG. 2.

'Similarity' of the claims One of the central requirements for a representative action to be permissible is that the claims that at least 50 consumers are enforcing by means of the representative action must be similar (gleichartig) (Sec. 15 (1) VDuG).

This is deemed the case if the claims are based essentially on the same or comparable facts, and the same factual issues and questions of law are essentially relevant for the decision regarding such claims (Sec. 15 (1) nos.

1, 2 VDuG).

According to the Act's explanatory memorandum, a degree of similarity is required that allows for a 'template-like' (schablonenhaft) examination of the claims.

To illustrate the required similarity, the explanatory memorandum lists as examples (1) compensa- tion claims asserted under the European Air Passenger Rights Regulation for one and the same flight and (2) the fulfilment of claims for back payments of interest that arise due to (a bank's) invalid general terms and conditions.

The explanatory memorandum does not consider claims to be similar, however, if they become time-barred at different points in time or if they are based to a decisive extent on the knowledge of the actual consumer.

The similarity of claims is also deemed to be lacking if not all products of a series are defective, and if it has to be clarified in each individual case whether the relevant product purchased is actually defective or not.

It will be interesting to see how the German courts interpret the similarity requirement.

The explanatory memorandum originally suggested a narrow understanding of the term.

The fact that the explanatory memorandum of the Act's draft refers specifically to air passenger compensation claims, where individual case-related considerations are hard to imagine, shows the difficulties involved in examining the similarity of the claims.

For that reason, during the legislative process, the Bundestag took up a suggestion from the Bundesrat and has now set down that claims must be 'essentially' similar.

The intent is that this will enable an appropriate examination on a case-by-case basis.

In principle, German courts will have to examine each consumer's claim separately in order to assess similarity.

The question of which standard of 'similarity' is to be applied will foreseeably become an issue to be dealt with by the European Court of Justice in view of the importance for the efficient conduct of proceedings4.

If the claims are not similar, plaintiffs could opt in favour of filing a model declaratory action or enforcing their claims by way of de facto class actions, as has already been done for instance through assignment models.

In addition, the filing of several representative actions  each with narrowly defined consumer groups  is also conceivable in order to 4 The Directive emphasises that the national rules on the similarity of claims should not hamper the effective functioning of the procedural mechanism for representative actions required by the Directive (recital 12, fourth sentence).

Pursuant to Sec. 13 (1) VDuG and Sec.

260 ZPO, several representative actions may be pursued jointly by way of aggregating the claims.

Sec. 7

(1) sentence 2 VDuG makes that explicitly clear.

3.

Entities entitled to bring an action Only registered qualified consumer associations are entitled to bring representative actions (Sec. 2 (1) no. 1 VDuG): in terms of members, associations must have at least 350 consum- ers or 10 associations from the same field of activity."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"Likewise, the association must have been registered as a qualified entity for four years.

The statutory purpose of the association must be to safeguard consumers' interests.

Associations must not aim at making a profit and may not receive more than 5 per cent of their financial resources through donations from companies.

Qualified entities from other Member States may have legal standing for the purpose of cross-border representative actions if they are entered in the European Commission's qualified entities list (cf. Sec.

2 (1) no. 2 VDuG).

4. Registration with the register of representative actions (Opt-In) In line with the legal situation to date, the VDuG provides that consumers must 'opt in': the affected consumers will not automatically become parties to a representative action.

Rather, they must actively register with the register of representative actions (Verbandsk- lageregister) in order to join the representative action (Sec. 46 VDuG).

This does not come as a surprise.

While the Directive does allow for the possibility of introducing an opt-out model along the lines of the US's class action mechanism, the introduction of such a model in Germany has been rejected by the majority of lawmakers.

This is due to the German civil-law principle known as the Dispositionsmaxime, according to which the parties to proceedings must have the freedom to control all relevant aspects of the proceedings, such as initiating it, selecting its subject matter and terminating it.

If the representative action is dismissed by the court, consumers are bound by their opt-in decision and can no longer bring individual actions in the same matter (cf. Sec.

11 (3) VDuG).

Up to three weeks after the conclusion of the oral proceedings, consumers have the right to join the representative action (Sec. 46 (1) VDuG).

A ruling cannot be issued until an additional three weeks have passed (Sec. 13 (4) VDuG).

The draft of the Act originally pro- vided that any opt-in by consumers must have taken place by the end of the day preceding the start of the oral proceedings.

In the course of the legislative process, lawmakers opted in favour of a consumer-friendly provision in this respect.

The ability to register at such a late stage gives consumers the opportunity to wait for the proceedings to progress and see if there is any indication in the oral proceedings whether the representative action will be successful.

Thus, consumers can wait to see if joining the action is likely to be promising.

5. Filing representative actions in different jurisdictions With the implementation of the Representative Actions Directive in all EU Member States, consumer associations will have the opportunity to sue companies in different countries.

Entities with legal standing will be able to file representative actions outside their own Member State of domicile or together with entities with legal standing in other Member States (as joined parties).

Additionally, companies in other jurisdictions may also be con- Content I. Conditions for the new representative action  2 II.

Representative actions with a foreign element are conceivable primarily in the case of tort claims.

For such claims, not only the court at the company's registered office is competent, but also the court at the place where the harm arose.

Thus, a claim can be filed wherever damage has occurred.

The requirements and mechanisms of representative actions vary significantly between EU Member States."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"Thus, a claim can be filed wherever damage has occurred.

The requirements and mechanisms of representative actions vary significantly between EU Member States.

In cases involving cross-border liability claims, German companies therefore have to expect that they will be confronted in another Member State with a rep- resentative action that is based on a far more plaintiff-friendly regime than that applicable in Germany (for example in the Netherlands).

As soon as a representative action against a defendant trader is pending, another repre- sentative action may not be brought if its subject matter relates to the same situation of fact and the same claims or to the same declaratory objectives.

This helps prevent parallel proceedings from being initiated in Germany that relate to the same subject matter.

The Act does not rule out the possibility of parallel representative actions being conducted in other Member States.

The permissibility of such actions is governed by the procedural law of the relevant Member State.

The Directive merely provides that consumers who have decided to join a representative action cannot 'be represented in other representative actions with the same cause of action and against the same trader' (Article 9(4) of the Directive).

Envisaged timeline for an action for redress measures 1.

The three phases of the action for redress The Act divides the representative action for redress measures into three phases (cf.

Secs.

16 et seqq.

VDuG): a) Phase 1: Preliminary judgment on redress In the first phase, the court examines whether the plaintiffs' claims show the required degree of similarity (cf. Sec.

15 VDuG).

If the claims are essentially similar, liability is then assessed on the merits of the claims.

If the court deems there to be liability, it issues a preliminary judgment on redress (Abhilfegrundurteil).

The court also specifies what evidence the individual consumer must provide in order to prove they meet the eligibility requirements that the court has also defined.

If the action for redress measu- res seeks a collective total amount, the preliminary judgment will also determine the amount due to each eligible consumer.

If the amounts due to the eligible consumers are different, the judgement is to state the method to be used to calculate the individual amounts due to the eligible consumers.

If the entity entitled to bring the action is already seeking enforcement of certain claims for the benefit of named consumers, the court may issue a final judgment on redress directly.

For that to happen, Sec. 16 (4) VDuG requires that the parties submit a petition to this effect and that the efforts to reach a settlement must have failed.

b) Phase 2: Settlement After that, the Act provides for a phase in which the litigating parties are given the op- portunity to agree on a settlement (Sec. 17 VDuG)."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"b) Phase 2: Settlement After that, the Act provides for a phase in which the litigating parties are given the op- portunity to agree on a settlement (Sec. 17 VDuG).

The parties are to submit a written settlement proposal to the court on the basis of the preliminary judgment on redress.

The purpose of any settlement agreement is for the parties to mutually agree on a verification and distribution system for implementing the preliminary judgment on redress.

The explanatory memorandum points out as an advantage that companies will thereby be able to influence not only the implementation of the preliminary judgment on redress, but also the costs arising from the settlement.

c) Phase 3: Final judgment on redress If the parties do not reach an agreement, the court will issue a final judgment on redress (Abhilfeendurteil  cf.

Sec.

18 VDuG).

In that judgment, the court may order the defen- dant company to pay a specific collective total amount or it may order implementation proceedings (Umsetzungsverfahren) aimed at satisfying the plaintiffs.

In this context, the plaintiffs will have the burden of demonstrating in concrete terms the amount of their total loss.

According to the explanatory memorandum, an extract from the register of representative actions can show how many consumers are registered.

Addition- ally, the amount of the claim must be substantiated in concrete terms.

Following commonly accepted legal principles, the court is authorised pursuant to Sec.

287 ZPO to estimate the loss.

In determining the specific collective total amount, the court may also assume that all claims asserted by the plaintiffs are fully justified.

The respective individual claims will only be examined at the stage of the implementation proceedings.

If individual claims turn out to be unjustified, any excess amount is to be reim- bursed to the defendant afterwards.

This leans more towards being a business-friendly pro- vision.

In other jurisdictions, such unclaimed funds often fall to charitable organisations.

The allocation mechanism The court's judgment on redress is to be carried out by a trustee (Sachwalter) appointed for that task by the court (Secs.

22 et seqq. VDuG).

The trustee sets up an 'implementation fund' (Umsetzungsfonds), in which the defendant is required to deposit the total amount of damages plus procedural costs (Sec. 25 VDuG).

The trustee then verifies whether the registered consumers meet the criteria set out in the preliminary judgment on redress (cf. Sec.

27 (1) nos.

3, 4 VDuG).

Where a consumer provides the required evidence, they receive a payment out of the implementation fund.

In the case of other consumer claims, the trustee requests the defendant to fulfil the specific individual claim, for example make repairs or supply defect-free products, and sets a reasonable deadline for doing so (cf. Sec.

27 (1) no. 5 VDuG).

Consumers and companies may file an objection to the trustee's decision pursuant to Sec.

28 (2)

VDuG.

If the trustee rejects the objection, a court decision may be petitioned (Sec. 29 (4) VDuG).

This possibility of the court to have the oversight over the proceedings was added during the legislative process only after extensive criticism had been voiced.

If a consumer's claim is not or only partially fulfilled, the consumer will, as a rule, be able to pursue that claim, insofar as it still exists, in an individual action after the implementation proceedings have ended.

This applies, however, only if the consumer was unable to enforce the claim previously in the appeal proceedings (Sec. 39 VDuG)."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"This applies, however, only if the consumer was unable to enforce the claim previously in the appeal proceedings (Sec. 39 VDuG).

If a consumer's claims were wrongfully satisfied in the implementation proceedings, companies must initiate individ- ual recovery proceedings (Sec. 40 (1) VDuG).

In those situations, German law on unjust enrichment applies.

This could lead to an additional burden on companies with consumer solvency risks that are difficult to calculate.

III.

Funding representative actions The new law leaves it unclear how consumer associations are to finance the proceedings for them to be conducted properly.

For lawyers, representing an association on the basis of the statutory fees is not likely to be attractive.

The principles underlying the fee calculation are derived, pursuant to Sec.

The amount in dispute in a representative action is capped at EUR 300,000.

For fees calculated on the basis of this amount in dispute, it is hardly possible for a lawyer (let alone a team of lawyers) to manage complex and lengthy collective proceedings properly.

Additional remuneration, such as an agreement on hourly rates, is legally possible for the consumer protection associations.

However, the question arises as to where the funds for such remuneration are to come from, especially since that remuneration cannot be recov- ered from opposing parties even if the action is successful.

Third-party funding of representative actions is allowed under Sec. 4 (2) VDuG provided that the litigation funder (i) is not a competitor of the defendant, (ii) it is not controlled by the defendant and (iii) it will not influence the entity entitled to bring the action to manage the lawsuit to the detriment of consumers.

However, consumer associations will generally be unable to offer litigation funders market-conform remuneration in the form of a share in the award amount.

If an action is successful, a maximum of ten per cent of the total amount sued for may go to a litigation funder (cf. Sec. 4 (2) no. 3 VDuG).

Furthermore, if an action is funded by a third party, all the agreements between the consumer association and the litigation funder must be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 4 (3)

VDuG.

It remains to be seen whether litigation funders are willing to invest under these restric- tive conditions.

Until the legislature provides other ways of at least covering the costs of litigation (through additional public funds for instance), the path for most consumer associations to bring numerous and/or major representative actions will likely be blocked for the time being.

IV.

Suspension of limitation periods Actions for redress measures and model declaratory actions trigger a suspension of limi- tation periods for consumers who have effectively registered in the register of actions (Sec. 204a (1) nos.

3, 4 of the new version of the German Civil Code (BGB).

This is consistent with the law to date in relation to model declaratory actions.

The limitation period is also suspended by representative actions in other Member States if consumers become a party to them (Sec. 204a (2) BGB)."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"The limitation period is also suspended by representative actions in other Member States if consumers become a party to them (Sec. 204a (2) BGB).

Representative actions for injunctive measures have a far-reaching suspensive effect on limitation periods (Sec. 204a (1) no. 2 BGB).

To date, the requirement has been either that claims for injunctive relief must be pursued individually or that at least the preparations for pursuing such claims must be done individually.

The Act has now removed this require- ment: any impact on the consumer by a contested infringement is sufficient to suspend the limitation period.

Unlike in actions for redress measures, in a representative action for injunctive measures consumers are not required to declare their intent to participate in the action, for example by registering with the register of representative actions.

According to Sec. 5 (2) VDuG, the required impact on consumers would be established solely on the basis of a 'brief de- scription' of the underlying situation of fact.

Outlook and assessment 9 Contact 10 July 2023 9 this mechanism will prove to be practical and help provide legal certainty.

The limitation period for claims will be suspended for a potentially indeterminate group of consumers.

For companies against which such claims are asserted, the legal certainty associated with the statute of limitations is thus drastically reduced.

V. Disclosure of evidence It is the plaintiff's responsibility to present the facts favourable to the action and to obtain relevant evidence.

In the past, this burden has proven to be a considerable hurdle for con- sumer plaintiffs.

The Directive therefore suggests more far-reaching rules on the disclosure of evidence.

The new German Act, however, provides for only modest changes to the current law.

An ex- pansion of disclosure duties is not provided for.

It therefore remains the case, as applicable law has allowed to date, that a court can only order a party to produce certain, precisely specified evidence.

Sec. 6

(1) and (2) VDuG do, however, newly provide that the failure to comply with a disclo- sure order can be sanctioned with a fine of up to EUR 250,000, which can be imposed more than once.

Whether or not the possibility of a fine will in fact make a difference remains to be seen.

VI.

Outlook and assessment It seems doubtful that the new law will actually lead to a noticeable reduction in the work- load of the German justice system.

Legal standing is limited to not-for-profit associations, which do not have the option of involving commercially-minded lawyers and litigation funders.

Therefore, both law firms representing plaintiffs as well as for-profit litigation funders will likely continue to have incentives to pursue claims (additionally) through assignment models or by bundling a large number of plaintiffs as co-joined litigants.

A considerable hurdle for representative actions will likely be the narrowly defined condi- tions set out in the Act for lawsuits to permissibly be funded by third parties.

Using their own funds, associations will likely only be able to finance complex and costly proceedings to a limited extent.

This is true all the more since the statutory fees lawyers can demand are unattractive with the amount in dispute being capped at EUR 300,000.

Liability risks for companies are nevertheless exacerbated by the new legal protection regime.

For essentially similar claims (such as claims arising under the GDPR because of data leaks), companies may be facing significant amounts of damages due to potentially very high numbers of affected consumers."
Hengeler Mueller,New representative action regime passed into law,"The judicial estimation of damages and the open questions surrounding limitation periods will lead to noticeable liquidity burdens and legal uncertainties for companies, in particular with regard to provisions.

From the defendant company's perspective, the amount of damages will be unclear until all of the claims have been satisfied.

The judicial estimation of damages is only preliminary and can be increased if the amount is insufficient.

In summary, the representative action is an expansion of consumer protection associa- tions' repertoire to challenge companies.

It remains to be seen how greatly the tool will be utilised.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: An Illuminating Judgment,"July 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR An Illuminating Judgment

The General Courts judgment of 13 July 2022 in Case T-227/21  Illumina/GRAIL, confirming the Commissions new approach to referrals pursuant to Article 22 EUMR.

Until March 2021, companies could confidently close a transaction which qualified for merger control neither under the EU Merger Regulations (EUMR) rules nor in any EU Member State.

But that closed door was kicked open when the Commission released its new guidance on Article 22 EUMR.

In Illumina/GRAIL, the Court refused to shut that door, endorsing the Commissions view that it has jurisdiction to review a concentration referred to it by a Member State under Article 22 EUMR even if that concentration does not meet the national merger control thresholds of the referring Member State.

What follows is a new era of uncertainty for dealmakers.

Not only does the Court uphold the new referral policy as such, it also confirms the Commissions view that the deadline of 15 working days for a referral request runs only once the companies involved have actively informed the Member States of a deal potentially falling under Article 22 EUMR.

So briefing papers or mini notifications to each and every Member State to obtain legal certainty?

Companies and their advisors will need to adopt to the new world of merger control quickly.

More cases may just be around the corner, as Commissioner Vestager has already announced that we have a few acquisitions within our sights prone to Article 22 EUMR.

So time to sort the facts and identify the pitfalls to look out for.

Background

The judgment revolves around the Commissions revised approach to referrals under Article 22 EUMR, see our April 2021 edition.

Article 22 EUMR allows Member States to request the Commission to examine a concentration that does not exceed EUMR Markus Roehrig and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

July 2022 2 turnover thresholds, but may affect trade between Member States and threatens to significantly affect competition within the territory of the referring Member States.

Until 26 March 2021, if a merger did not meet national merger control thresholds, the Commission explicitly discouraged Member States from making a referral request.

The Commissions new Article 22 guidance1 has been nothing less than a complete reversal of that policy with the sole purpose of closing a perceived enforcement gap.

Since the question of whether to notify a deal is dictated by the turnover achieved in preceding years, an increasing number of deals escaped regulatory scrutiny.

Particularly so-called killer acquisitions of start-ups or nascent firms with low to zero turnover, as often seen in the digital economy or pharmaceutical sector, were a thorn in the Commissions side.

To close that gap, the Commission decided to actively encourage Member States to refer cases which in their view fulfil the conditions of Article 22 EUMR.

And to add to that, the Commission announced that it would proactively send out invitation letters asking for a referral according to Article 22(5) EUMR if it believes a transaction falls within the ambit of Article 22 EUMR.

The first to fall victim was US-based sequencing gene company Illuminas proposed acquisition of GRAIL, a US-based company developing blood tests for early cancer detection.

The transaction signed in September 2020 was not notifiable in any jurisdiction: GRAIL did not achieve any turnover.

But the Commission, following a competitor complaint, took the view that the products developed by GRAIL had a competitive significance (potential game-changer in the healthcare sector) that was not appropriately reflected by its  zero  turnover.

Therefore, the Commission decided to send out invitation letters encouraging Member States to request a referral.

And quite a number, the first being France, followed."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: An Illuminating Judgment,"Therefore, the Commission decided to send out invitation letters encouraging Member States to request a referral.

And quite a number, the first being France, followed.

Illumina challenged the Commissions subsequent referral decision on three grounds:  Jurisdiction.

The Commission has no power to accept referral requests made by a Member State if the concentration does not meet that Member States national merger control thresholds, and thus no jurisdiction to review such concentrations under the EUMR.  

Timing.

Frances referral request was too late, as the deadline of 15 working days begins once the concentration is made known to a Member State, which according to Illumina is once a deal is publicly communicated.

Illumina also argued that the 47 days the Commission took to send out the invitation letter after having received the competitor complaint violated the principles of legal certainty and good administration.  

Legitimate Expectations.

The Commission acted contrary to the principle of legal certainty and violated Illuminas legitimate expectations by inviting Member States to refer the deal even before it announced its revised stance on Article 22 EUMR, even though it had publicly communicated that it would not implement its new policy before it had issued proper guidance.

1 Commission Guidance on the application of the referral mechanism set out in Article 22 of the Merger Regulation to certain catego- ries of cases, C (2021) 1959 final.

July 2022 3 The Commissions New Referral Policy on Firm Legal Grounds?

The Court rejected Illuminas first plea in law and ruled that the Commissions interpretation of referrals under Article 22 EUMR is valid: The Commission has jurisdiction to review mergers even when they do not meet the national merger control thresholds in the Member State making a referral request under Article 22 EUMR, or in any Member State at all for that matter.

To analyze the legality of the new approach, the Court engaged in a literal, historical, contextual and teleological interpretation:  Literal Interpretation.

The Court holds that Article 22(1) EUMR expressly uses the wording any concentration and contrary to the applicants arguments, there is no indication in this wording that a referred concentration must also be notifiable under the applicable national merger control rules.

Therefore, the mere fact that a company has zero turnover is in itself not relevant.

As long as all conditions of Article 22(1) EUMR are met and there are potentially significant cross-border effects, the Commission is within its right to accept a referral request.  

Legislative History.

The Court acknowledges that Article 22 EUMR was historically introduced for Member States that did not (yet) operate their own merger control system (back then Netherlands and Luxembourg).

However, the Court points out that, even though Article 22 EUMR was intended mainly for such Member States, nothing in the legislative history of the EUMR indicates that it was by design limited to such Member States.  

Contextual Interpretation.

According to the Court, the scope of Article 22 EUMR must be construed independent of, and cannot depend on, the Member States respective national merger control rules.

Then, there are three ways in which the Commission can obtain jurisdiction to review a concentration under the EUMR.

In the first place, the Commission has jurisdiction if a concentration exceeds the turnover thresholds pursuant to Article 1(2),(3) EUMR.

However, Article 1(1) EUMR explicitly states that this is without prejudice to Article 4(5)

EUMR and Article 22 EUMR, both permitting a referral in case EU notification thresholds are not met.

Accordingly, Articles 4(5) and 22 EUMR are alternative, subsidiary ways for the Commission to obtain jurisdiction under the EUMR.  

The Provisions Rationale."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: An Illuminating Judgment,"Accordingly, Articles 4(5) and 22 EUMR are alternative, subsidiary ways for the Commission to obtain jurisdiction under the EUMR.  

The Provisions Rationale.

The Courts holds that Article 22 EUMR is a corrective mechanism and helps to achieve the main objective of the EUMR, i.e. to ensure effective control of all concentrations that might have significant cross-border effects on competition.

But for the admittedly new flexible approach under Article 22 EUMR, transactions falling below EU and all national turnover thresholds would escape review.

In other words: Just because the turnover is low, a concentration can still cause harm to consumers and the EUMR must enable the Commission to review such concentrations.

That is a rather textbook-like approach to interpreting the scope of Article 22 EUMR, or so it seems.

While the provisions plain language surely supports the Courts reading of Article 22 EUMR, antitrust practitioners might feel a certain unease when it comes to some of the Courts sweeping statements.

For example, the Court refers to Article 22 EUMR affording the Commission a subsidiary power to review concentrations.

July 2022 4 However, if Member States decide not to submit a referral request, leaving aside political pressure, the Commission has no legal tools to enforce a referral and establish jurisdiction, even if a review by the Commission was in the EUs interest.

Just how can Article 22 EUMR be said to afford a subsidiary power if the decision to refer remains solely at the Member States level?

Other findings are similarly unclear such as, for example, the Courts claim that a broad reading of Article 22 EUMR works to safeguard the one stop shop principle and increases legal uncertainty, as parties are relieved from applying, within the context of Article 22 EUMR, the different criteria and concepts determining the scope of the merger control regimes existing in the member States

[] which, because of their unpredictable nature, were rejected by the Commission when introducing the EUMR.

However, split reviews are a risk inherent to the referral mechanism established in Article 22 EUMR and companies and their advisors have many years of experience applying the various thresholds that Member States have chosen to determine jurisdiction under their respective merger control regimes.

And then there is the broad line statement that control of concentrations that affect trade between Member States can be better achieved at EU level  a statement that NCAs will not necessarily agree with.

There may be valid policy reasons for a review of killer-acquisitions and their potentially anti-competitive effects on an EU level.

However, one wonders whether it would not be for the EU legislator to close any perceived enforcement gap, rather than the Commission adopting a new referral policy even if wholeheartedly backed by the Court (but overlooking the immense practical implications and the lack of a due process).

Knowledge Is Power And Trust Must Be Earned The Court also rejected Illuminas additional arguments in its second and third plea, with far-reaching effects on deal timelines.  

Deal Timeline.

Contrary to the applicants arguments, the fact that a transaction is publicly reported is not sufficient to trigger the formal deadline for a referral request.

Article 22(1) EUMR requires that the Member State making the request does so within 15 working days of the date on which the transaction was made known to the Member State concerned.

But the Court held that the term made known requires more than the NCA simply knowing about the transaction as such: It must enable the Member State to carry out a preliminary assessment as to whether the substantive conditions for a referral request under Article 22 EUMR are satisfied.

And the Court goes even further: Even though it does not require an informal notification, the information to be submitted to Member States must be comparable to that provided in a notification."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: An Illuminating Judgment,"And the Court goes even further: Even though it does not require an informal notification, the information to be submitted to Member States must be comparable to that provided in a notification.

In practice, this means that to obtain legal certainty and to not risk late referral request impacting the overall timeline (as in the case at hand), a conservative approach might be best suited.

Depending on the deal structure and entities involved, that could well lead to a chain of informal briefing papers or mini notifications to all 27 Member States  more on that later.  

Post-Closing Scrutiny.

Even though the Court found that the period of 47 working days between receiving the competitor complaint and sending the invitation letter July 2022 5 to France was an unreasonable period of time, this did not suffice to annul the Commissions referral decision.

According to the Court, Illuminas ability to defend itself against a potential referral and its right to be heard was not impeded.

This means, in practical terms, that even once the Commission obtains knowledge of a transaction, it can  even deliberately  delay the process considerably (the Article 22 EUMR guidance even states that referrals could be possible up to six months post- closing) as long as the parties have the possibility to defend themselves.  

No Legimitate Expectations.

The Commissions previous practice to discourage Member States from referrals does not preclude an  even sudden  policy shift.

A legitimate expectation only arises following precise, unconditional and consistent assurances from the Commission, which Illumina did not receive.

That is a notable statement and an extremely high bar to overcome: But since the policy is already in place since March 2021 and has to be factored into deal planning, it should  while frustrating for Illumina  be of lesser relevance going forward.

Implications for Dealmakers So the new referral policy is here to stay (pending an appeal the Court of Justice) and the main challenge for dealmakers will be to to rule out risks of a referral as far as possible.

But how?

A few questions come to mind, which might also be for the Commission to answer:  Substantive Requirements for a Referral Request.

The Court has not provided further guidance on when a referral under Article 22 EUMR is mandated, beyond a mere reference to the vague requirements set out in the provision itself.

So the Commission might want to think about an extended guidance  for companies and Member States alike  at what point an acquisition becomes a killer acquisition prone to Article 22 EUMR.

A number of such deals, in particular in the digital economy and pharmaceutical sector, will cater to wider than national markets, increasing the risks of a referral.

And if it is not a clear-cut case, the risk of a referral could hit you up to six months post-closing.  

Mini Notification.

One solution to mitigate risks might be to send out informal briefing papers or mini notifications to all 27 or at least those Member States in which anti-competitive effects might arise.

But the practical terms are unclear: In what language are such briefing papers accepted?

And if a NCA is of the opinion that the information included is not sufficient, does the 15 working days deadline apply only once potentially extensive follow-up questions are answered?

The fact that there is no guidance or due process for this makes it incredibly hard for businesses to assess the risk of a referral.  Commission as a Conduit.

Another solution might be that the Commission introduces a new form, in which the parties can describe a transaction potentially falling under Article 22 EUMR (e.g., on the nature of the business, market definition and market shares, competitive structure of the markets involved).

This form could be send to the Commission, which in turn might provide this to the NCAs (e.g. via the ECN network)."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: An Illuminating Judgment,"This form could be send to the Commission, which in turn might provide this to the NCAs (e.g. via the ECN network).

But again, and leaving aside the additional delays that the completion of forms tend to create: Would the Commission be willing to do so and would it in Follow us Dont miss any edition of our Brussels  Jour News letter.

July 2022 6 their view already trigger the 15 working days deadline, providing comfort to the parties involved?

In the absence of specific guidance and the commitment to follow a specific process, we think it is best to seek close contact with the Commission in early stages of deal planning.

And once it is indicated that a deal might fall under Article 22 EUMR and which Member States are concerned, the respective authorities should be informed separately to trigger the 15 working days deadline as early as possible.  

Split Reviews.

And what if a Member State without applicable thresholds refers, and another one having national jurisdiction does not?

The risk of split reviews remains.

Admittedly, this is inherent to Article 22 EUMR (which might, again, have called for a change of the EUMR), but will require additional coordination efforts.

This is particularly the case in complex transactions: One might think of remedies and the differing views some NCAs and the Commission have on that part.

Next Steps Illumina has announced that it will appeal the judgment to the European Court of Justice.

It remains to be seen whether the appeal will go so far as sanction the far- reaching interpretation of the Commissions approach.

But the policy is here to stay in the meantime: As long as the appeal is not handed down, it will continue to affect dealmakers and companies.

And Illumina will have to fight another battleground: As most of you will be aware of, Illumina and GRAIL decided to consummate the merger in August 2021 despite the Commission having initiated a Phase II investigation just one month earlier.

That prompted the Commission to open a gun jumping inquiry and it followed up quickly after the 13 July 2022 judgment: Only 6 days later, the Commission send a Statement of Objections alleging that Illumina and GRAIL breached the EUMR by prematurely implementing the acquisition2.

Hengeler Mueller,Crisis management and strategy go hand in hand on supervisory boards,"Sustainability has long been an important topic affecting business activities.

But all three ESG criteria - environment, social and governance - are now becoming more central to companies' strategic planning than ever before.

For some time, this has not just been about straightforward compliance with different legal regimes, such as sustainability reporting requirements or adapting to EU taxonomy.

Positioning an organisation to be sustainable can also provide it with greater resilience to external shocks and developments – from dependence on supply chains to the impact of climate change.

Our current environment shows precisely how important such resilience is, and how much sustainable economic success is ultimately linked to it.

As a result, corporate boards are also focusing on sustainability - not just executive boards, but also supervisory boards.

The findings of our 2022 supervisory board survey, conducted jointly with Arbeitskreis deutscher Aufsichtsrat e.V. (German Supervisory Board Working Group), prove exactly that.

After managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises, the supervisory boards of German companies are once again harnessing more of their energy in strategic areas.

Inevitably, the impact of events in Ukraine is being felt: 81 per cent of respondents believe that Russia’s war of aggression is having a tangible effect on the work of supervisory boards.

But positioning their companies for the future is perceived to be just as relevant.

At 86 per cent, an overwhelming majority of supervisory board members regard adapting their companies to the digital age as a central issue.

But ESG and transforming companies to becoming more sustainable is also increasingly seen as imperative: 80 per cent of supervisory board members surveyed now consider it relevant, up from 64 per cent last year.

Dealing with the effects of the pandemic has become less of a priority, however, although it still continues to reverberate in supply chains.

This combination of permanent crisis management, establishing resilience and working on the future of their companies will consume the attention of supervisory boards for some considerable time.

This is hardly surprising.

After all, dealing with crisis issues has already become part of their day-to-day business – whether it be adjusting to a recessionary economy or handling conventional energy supply shortages.

Our study also shows that the issue of sustainability is now more and more apparent in how supervisory boards are organised.

In that context, calls for particular expertise in sustainability are now being taken into account, as recommended by the German Corporate Governance Code, for example.

A narrow majority (51 per cent) of respondents believe that their companies already meet this requirement.

At listed companies, the figure is notably higher, at 62 per cent.

Supervisory boards are tackling sustainability expertise requirements in entirely different ways.

More than three quarters of board members surveyed (76 per cent) currently view training and seminars as the best means of education.

While 72 per cent look to appoint board members with a professional background in this area, 63 per cent would involve external consultants.

By contrast, dealing with ESG topics by establishing committees or appointing individuals to oversee sustainability matters is not currently the norm.

Only 12 per cent of survey participants said that they had opted for such a solution on their boards.

It is still typical for the full supervisory board to handle ESG matters, according to 58 per cent of respondents.

But a dynamic shift has become evident when it comes to assigning responsibility on supervisory boards for the key business challenge of sustainability."
Hengeler Mueller,Crisis management and strategy go hand in hand on supervisory boards,"But a dynamic shift has become evident when it comes to assigning responsibility on supervisory boards for the key business challenge of sustainability.

Companies such as Allianz, Bayer, Covestro, Deutsche Börse, Deutsche Post, e.ON, Qiagen, MunichRe, Puma, SAP, Zalando, RWE, EON, Hello Fresh and LEG are now setting up ESG committees or functions specifically to address the issue, which shows that it is not just relevant for companies of a certain critical size or for those operating in certain sectors.

Establishing technical expertise on the supervisory board to monitor and advise management effectively is in the company's best interest - and of paramount importance.

We have also seen that institutionalised know-how on sustainability, in whatever form, is another key component in the growing professionalisation of the work done in this area by supervisory boards.

This development is critical for the future viability of Germany as a centre of international business.

Ultimately, in addition to fulfilling its monitoring function, the supervisory board is involved in shaping the company's fundamental decisions when determining the future direction of its business.

The ongoing transformation of supervisory boards is also reflected in their make-up.

As demonstrated by a significant body of research, the boards of big companies listed on the DAX, MDAX and other indices, have never been more international or more balanced in their gender composition than they are today.

That gives cause for hope.

A gathering storm on the economic horizon and an imminent recession will do nothing to alter the strategic significance of sustainability.

Reining in ambitions or putting projects on hold cannot be the answer.

On the contrary, now is precisely the right time to invest more.

ESG is not a luxury issue, but a critical factor for the future viability and resilience of companies, and in turn, our national economy."
Hengeler Mueller,The Russia-Ukraine war – international investment law as protection against asset losses in Russia?,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, numerous German and international companies have been withdrawn from or significantly reduced their activities in Russia.

Those companies that have not taken an explicit decision to withdraw are faced with their subsidiaries' ailing operations.

In response to all this, Russia has enacted and is threatening to enact several counter-measures that either target those companies specifically that are withdrawing or that provide for the takeover of struggling companies.

For example, a draft law is currently under consideration in Russia which would provide for the establishment of external administration for and subsequent liquidation of subsidiaries of German and international parent companies that withdraw from Russia without them receiving any compensation.

So, what are the risks?

The risks to assets held by German and international companies in Russia are manifold.

New laws and governmental decrees are passed on a weekly basis affecting every aspect of commercial enterprise – from corporate ownership to capital transfer to IP.

For instance, Russian authorities are reportedly confiscating the property of local subsidiaries of multinationals.

Often, companies are faced with only three alternatives: dispose of their assets in emergency sales, relinquish them or declare insolvency of their Russian subsidiaries.

It is uncertain whether reliable legal recourse can be taken in Russia's national court system.

Companies should therefore take the existing legal protections under international law into account when deciding on the future of their subsidiaries.

Bilateral investment treaties, or BITs, provide the legal basis on which international investors can derive direct legal protection against a foreign state's unlawful measures.

There are currently 63 BITs in force between Russia and other nations, which include major industrial nations like Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

Russia – together with the European Union – is also a party to the Energy Charta Treaty (""ECT""), an international treaty dealing with the energy sector.

These BITs and the ECT provide investors from contracting party states substantive safeguards against measures taken by Russia that are detrimental to their assets.

In particular, investors may seek prompt, adequate and effective compensation for any expropriation of their investments.

Investor claims may be brought before international arbitration tribunals.

These tribunals are independent from national court systems and are at the heart of the international law regime of investor-state dispute settlement.

Russia is known to be reluctant to participate in international arbitral proceedings or to pay any amount ordered by an arbitration tribunal.

Enforcing claims under an international investment treaty before an arbitral tribunal will therefore be a challenging task.

However, these challenges should not automatically discourage investors from demanding the protections and safeguards afforded to their investments under international law.

Even if an arbitral award may not currently be effectively enforced, it will be a bargaining chip when negotiating a potential return to the Russian market at some point in the future.

In addition, enforcing investor rights is a means of holding Russia accountable for its unlawful invasion of Ukraine.

As the situation is evolving rapidly, our assessment of this issue might change.

If you have any specific asset-related questions please reach out to one of our experts."
Hengeler Mueller,M&A snapshot: increasing complexity ahead,"The Russian attack on Ukraine has had an enormous geopolitical impact and an equally significant effect on the M&A market.

Alongside ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain, rising inflation and increasing interest rates, the conflict is causing huge uncertainty among market players.

Nevertheless, the European and German M&A markets have proven to be quite resilient so far.

The long-term M&A outlook also remains promising.

Last year saw more than 11,600 M&A transactions with European targets valued at more than EUR 1,100bn and approx.

1,300 German target deals with a disclosed value of EUR 114bn.

*

Although this represents a significant decline of almost 44 per cent by value in German target deals compared to the previous record-breaking year, it is surprisingly solid given the current environment.

Some key deal drivers, including digital transformation and ESG considerations, will continue to stimulate deal activity.

Overall, we see a large investor appetite for sustainable business models and those that enable sustainability.

In addition to traditional investment in renewable energy companies, green tech is very popular - whether agricultural technology, recycling or sustainable mobility.

In the wake of the current crisis, numerous companies are looking for energy independence and bringing the necessary expertise in-house for the sustainable transformation of their own business model through acquisitions.

As investors look for traditionally crisis-proof business models with predictable profits, the healthcare and defence sectors should benefit from the current environment, as will the infrastructure, education, construction and food sectors, among others.

We anticipate that an increased focus by many companies on their core business will lead to spin-offs of non-core divisions, creating additional opportunities for M&A transactions.

Distressed M&A is also on the rise.

We have already seen some major restructurings this year and expect such transactions to increase further in the near future.

The crisis makes transactions more complex and more demanding.

Market participants not only have to cope with a challenging financing environment, but they also need to factor in sanctions, stricter investment controls and anti-trust scrutiny, as well as disrupted supply chains and volatile prices.

We also have the impression that buyers’ increased caution leads to higher transaction complexity, as negotiations with a small number of interested parties become more intensive in order to find creative contractual solutions.

This leads to stronger demand for high-end legal advice.

Overall, we may not be able to match the record volumes of the recent past in 2023.

But we expect deal activity in Germany and Europe to remain robust and that transactions with a positive ESG profile will continue to increase.

Sales, Discounts, Rebates  some of you might have been lucky with some bargains during Winter Sales 21/22.

So who would say that rebates are a bad thing?

You guessed it: The Competition Law community, albeit  as always in law  it depends.

From a Competition Law perspective, rebates schemes are ordinarily unproblem- atic or might even be beneficial consumer welfare.

If used by dominant companies, however, certain types of rebates, in particular exclusivity or loyalty rebates, can be abusive under Article 102 TFEU.

The General Courts recent Intel judgment, handed down on 26 January 2022, of-

fers the latest update on the controversy as to when such rebates are unlawful.

The General Court in essence holds that the Commission, in Article 102 TFEU decisions relating to exclusivity or loyalty rebates, cannot simply take a formalistic view and presume competitive harm if the dominant undertaking has presented evidence to rebut that presumption.

Rather, a detailed effects-based assessment has to be carried out, effectively strengthening dominant companies possibilities to defend their case by allowing them to submit evidence on the absence of anti-competitive effects themselves.

Background of the case The General Courts judgment follows a long series of events surrounding a 2009 Com mission decision  the endpoint of a long investigation following complaints by competitor AMD as early as 2000  and imposing a EUR 1.06 billion fine on Intel for having abused its dominant position on the worldwide market for x86 processors.

The Commission found that Intel has granted exclusivity rebates for selected customers and made use of so-called naked restrictions, i.e. payments to computer manufacturers to stop, cancel or postpone the launch of products using competitors (in particular AMD) processors.

Markus Roehrig and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

February 2022 2

The judgment, handed down on 26 January 2022, is the latest part of the Intel saga.

Initially, the General Court dismissed Intels first challenge and upheld the decision in 2014.

However, following Intels appeal, the Court of Justice referred the case back to the General Court in 2017, resulting in the recent judgment.

The Court of Justices 2017 landmark judgment In 2017, the Court of Justice reaffirmed the basic  and rather formalistic  principle (based on the Hoffmann-La Roche case law) that exclusivity rebates granted by a dom- inant undertaking are by their very nature capable of restricting competition.

However, the Court of Justice added an important tweak to the Hoffmann-La Roche case law, allowing the dominant undertaking to demonstrate, on the basis of supporting evi- dence, that rebates were in fact not capable of restricting competition and in fact did not  produce foreclosure effects.

The Court left however open what level of detail such sup- porting evidence must reach and what standards have to be adhered to.

If rebutting evidence is submitted, it is necessary and the Commission is obliged to ana- lyze all the circumstances of the case and to carry out an effects-based analysis in such dominance cases."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Processing the Intel judgment – a more economic approach?,"If rebutting evidence is submitted, it is necessary and the Commission is obliged to ana- lyze all the circumstances of the case and to carry out an effects-based analysis in such dominance cases.

According to the Court, the legal test to be applied by the Commission for the analysis of foreclosure effects has to take into account five factors:  the extent of the companys dominant position on the relevant market;  the share of the market covered by the challenged practice;  the conditions and arrangements for granting the rebates in question;  their duration and their amount;  the possible existence of a strategy aiming to exclude competitors that are at least as efficient as the dominant undertaking from the market; In its 2009 decision, the Commission had resorted to the so-called as-efficient-competitor test (or AEC test) to substantiate the foreclosure effects of Intels exclusivity rebates, even though it had primarily relied also on a prima facie presumption of harm (based on the Hoffmann-La Roche case law).

Since the AEC test played an important role in the Commissions assessment, the Court of Justice concluded that the General Court was re- quired to examine all of Intels arguments concerning that test and how the Commission had applied it.

Since the General Court had failed to do so, the Court of Justice set aside the initial 2014 judgment and referred the case back for a detailed examination of the AEC test.

The General Courts judgment annulling the Commissions decision In its judgment of 26 January 2022, the General Court, based on the criteria set out by the Court of Justice, engages in a very extensive and painstakingly detailed economic analysis of the potential anticompetitive foreclosure effects of the conditional rebates.

In particular, the General Court focused on the Commissions (incorrect) application of the AEC test.

February 2022 3

The AEC test analyzes whether a competitor, which is considered to be as efficient as the dominant firm (pertaining to costs, offerings, product quality etc.) can effectively match that firms offer.

In case of exclusivity or loyalty rebates, the AEC test considers whether a customer would switch to such an as-efficient competitor in absence of the dominant firms rebate scheme (or if the as-efficient competitor was to apply a similar scheme).

An- ticompetitive foreclosure effects arise if the dominant companys customer would have switched volumes of business to a competitor.

According to the General Court, the Com- mission committed several errors when applying the AEC test to Intels rebates:  As a dominant company is in most cases an unavoidable trading partner, it has to be assessed under the AEC test which share of their demand customers can and would switch to alternative suppliers (the so called contestable share).

When calculating the contestable share, the Commission falsely relied on only certain pieces of evidence (one spreadsheet that had been prepared by one of Intels customers), while disre- garding several other pieces of evidence that Intel had submitted and that pointed the other way.  

Furthermore, according to the General Court, the Commission also erred in assessing the value of the conditional rebates and of so-called non-cash advantages that these rebates allegedly had for Intels customers.

In particular, the Commission failed to establish the specific value of such rebates and how that value transposes into an anti-competitive foreclosure of Intels competitors, thereby failing to substantiate the AEC test.  

The Commission also did not meet the proper standards for extrapolating results of the AEC test for one single-quarter period to the entire infringement period.

Rather than using real data for the entire period, it claimed that only data for one specific single-quarter period and restricted to one OEM customer was available."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Processing the Intel judgment – a more economic approach?,"Rather than using real data for the entire period, it claimed that only data for one specific single-quarter period and restricted to one OEM customer was available.

According to the General Court, this data was not only no accurate basis for extrapolating the AEC test results for that customer, but the Commission also erred by simply assuming that these results are representative and can also be extrapolated, without any further evidence, for the AEC analysis of another company.

The General Court concluded that, in light of the foregoing, the AEC analysis carried out by the Commission [] is vitiated by errors (para.

482 of the General Courts 2022 judgment) and that the Commission did not establish that Intels rebates were capable of having or likely to have anticompetitive foreclosure effects.

As the exclusivity rebates subject of this judgment constituted only part of the conduct found to be a violation of Article 102 TFEU in the 2009 decision, the question arose whether the General Court will uphold the fine regarding the naked restrictions while setting aside the exclusivity rebates-related fine.

However, the General Court stated that it does not consider itself to be in a position to identify the amount of the fine relating solely to the naked restrictions, as the Commission has assessed both conducts as a whole.

Thus, on the grounds set out above, the General Court annulled the EUR 1.06 billion fine in its entirety.

February 2022 4 Implications for the future The 2022 Judgment is a major victory for Intel and sets a higher bar for the Commission to bring abuse of dominance cases.

The General Court agreed with Intel that regulators must prove that exclusivity and loyalty rebates have anti-competitive effects before sanctioning them, despite the tendency of regulators generally disliking such rebates used by dominant companies and presuming competitive harm.

If the dominant company submits economic evidence during the administrative procedure suggesting a that its rebate scheme is not anti-competitive, the Commission will be required to carry out effects-based analyzes in- stead of merely relying on the presumption of (by nature)

anti-

competitive effects.

But the questions arises: What does supporting evidence mean in practice and what level of detail is demanded?

Both the Court of Justice and the General Court remain silent in that respect and it is hard to draw general conclusions from such the highly specific facts underlying the Intel case.

However, the Intel saga shows that every aspect of the Commissions AEC test will be highly scrutinized on appeal, starting with the evidentiary basis for the contestable share up to the conditions of extrapolating results to the entire infringement period.

It remains to be seen what this entails for future abuse of dominance cases, but given the importance of submitting qualified and convincing rebuttal evidence, the judgment might not only result in a more economic approach, but also more work for economists.

Their involvement is already crucial, but will  as the complexity of such abuse of dominance cases  certainly increase further.

Beyond the question of how to counter the Commission in abuse of dominance cases, both the recent judgment and the Court of Justices 2017 landmark case provide an important clarification on the general assessment of exclusivity rebates.

While it was advisable  from a compliance point of view even potentially mandatory  for dominant companies to ab- stain from exclusivity and loyalty rebates, Intel may open up the door a little more for in- novative rebate schemes.

Given the severe sanctions that the Commission can impose for infringements of Article 102 TFEU, dominant companies will however have to assess with great care and in line with the criteria set out by the courts whether there is sufficient eco-

nomic evidence to demonstrate that a given rebate scheme does not have foreclosure effects."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à jour: Processing the Intel judgment – a more economic approach?,"nomic evidence to demonstrate that a given rebate scheme does not have foreclosure effects.

Since the AEC test is also at issue in other dominance proceedings, such as in Qualcomm (T-235/18) and Google Android (T-604/18), the Commission can be expected to appeal the 2022 judgment.

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 1),"September 2022 BRUSSELS  JOUR La Rentre 2022  Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 1) Now, that the first post-Covid summer has come and gone, its time to put up your surf board, pack the kids lunch boxes and plan for the months ahead.

Admittedly, we cant rival with the masters of bento boxes, but we can give you a short overview of les must of this fall in terms of antitrust, cartels, merger control, foreign subsidies and State aid.

Stay with us, for our second issue of La Rentre, keeping you company for the next three days.

To kick off, in todays instalment, we will be looking at what lies ahead in terms of Antitrust and Cartels.

Antitrust: Horizontal Block Exemption Regulation With the expiry of the current rules dues for the end of the year, and the public consul- tation process already concluded in April, it looked for a while that it was smooth sailing for the last stretch of the procedure.

Only it is not, as far as the R&D part is concerned.

Just a few days ago, the Commission announced that it was considering extending the Horizontal Block Exemption Regulation (HBER) rules, pending additional reflection on the new framework.

It appears that the market feedback on issues such as mobile network sharing and sustainability rules has been quite critical.

For the moment, it is unclear until when the existing rules will be extended, as well as the impact of this delay on the rest of the legislative package.

Antitrust: Digital Markets Act At the same time the darling of the Commission and the favorite punching bag of the Big Tech, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) passed its final legislative hurdle in July, when it received final approval from ministers of the European bloc.

While the ink was still fresh, the DMAs first effects started to show.

Mid-September, the Commission announced that it was already looking to hire a chief technology officer to advise on competition.

The new hire will have their job modelled on the mandate of Markus Roehrig, Laura Stoicescu and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law..

September 2022 2 the chief economist.

Overall, the new DMA team will comprise 80 officials, with the workload due to increase in 2023, when the Commission will begin the formal gate- keeper designation process.

Another uptake in workload will most likely take place in 2024, when the Commission will start reinforcing and monitoring the DMA obligations.

Considering the current zero-growth policy in terms of staffing, the team will have a fair share on their plate.

The first effects start to show on the Big Tech side as well  according to Vice President Vestager, Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta may have to share planned changes to their business with consumers in dedicated workshops under new EU tech legislation.

Antitrust: Revision of Regulation 01/2003

The revision of Regulation 1/2003 is one of the topics on the Brussels agenda, due to the potential that it would hold (if done right) for the legal community.

In parallel to the public tender launched in April 2022, a public consultation was also opened, allowing the stakeholders to contribute to the shaping of the follow-up to Regulation 1/2003.

A few issues have already been flagged, particularly in the 2020 report of the European Court of Auditors, such as the fact that the Commission now handles lengthier and more complex investigations due to increasing volumes of data to be processed and the emergence of digital markets.

The Commissions own capacities for monitoring of mar- kets and own detection of cases were found to be affected by limited resources, while although cooperation with NCAs was good, certain aspects could benefit from improved coordination.

If we are to make 3 wishes, like the story goes, we would like to see a number of points being addressed in the revision of Regulation 1/2003, namely:"
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 1),"If we are to make 3 wishes, like the story goes, we would like to see a number of points being addressed in the revision of Regulation 1/2003, namely:  

Having a minimum standard of codification at ECN level for legal and professional privilege (LPP).

In practice, the concept is frequently a source of ambiguities, espe- cially since the scope varies from one Member State to another.

This leads to friction between enforcement systems and the erosion of fairness to the undertakings under investigation.  

Amending the mandate of the Hearing Officer by extending it throughout the inves- tigative phase of Commission inquiries.

Here, we are thinking about the fact that undertakings currently have no address in a timely manner regarding irregularities in the conduct of inspectors during dawn raids.

Getting the Hearing Officer involved would remedy the balance of the rights of defense.  

Rendering oral hearing a more efficient role in the investigative phase.

Currently, oral hearings play a mostly formalistic role of having the parties heard.

An idea would be to shift the rationale to having oral hearings similar to peer reviews, where the parties do more than repeat the arguments presented in their response to the statement of objections.

September 2022 3

In addition to the public consultation, the Commission has launched a tender for an eval- uation support study of EU antitrust enforcement framework.

The study is intended to focus on topics such as the state of competition in the EU, particularly with regard to its globally active businesses, and how competition helps the blocs economy.

WHEN?

Staff working paper likely in mid-2024, but the public consultation runs until 6 October 2022.

So if you have wishes to add to our list, you might want to hurry up.

Otherwise, the Commission seems  somewhat  eager to listen to feedback from the antitrust community and you still might be able to get your points across informally.

Antitrust: Informal Guidance Rules

The mechanism of the informal guidance has seen a wave of advocacy around it with this years rentre mainly due to the Commissions seeking feedback on its new draft text.

The Commission is now on a tour to promote it, also in an effort to lighten its workload and following the success of a similar mechanism at national level in Member States such as the Netherlands.

So far, the informal guidance has actually never been used in practice.

Rumor has it that the mechanism was not popular neither with the Commission staff nor with undertak- ings, mainly because of the strict conditions a request needed to satisfy in order to be examined by the Commission.

The text now on the table of the Commission seeks to soften the admissibility conditions and to simplify the handling of a request by limiting its assessment to a short fact-find- ing.

It also adds an additional condition  the relevance of the request at EU level.

The Commission has engaged in an exchange of opinions with stakeholders in order to better adapt the current draft to the practical challenges encountered in the past when attempting to use the mechanism.

WHEN?

The publishing an updated Informal Guidance Notice is scheduled before the end of 2022.

Antitrust and Cartels: Crisis mode and cooperation As you may recall, prior to its introduction and the transition to a self-assessment regime, companies had to notify agreements to the Commission to benefit from the exemption laid down in what is now Article 101(3) TFEU.

Companies often required an informal exemption by way of a comfort letter to be able to defend its behavior in front of national competition authorities and courts.

But with Regulation 1/2003, the era of formal exemptions and comfort letters came to an sudden end."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: La Rentrée 2022 – Things to Have on Your Radar after the Summer Break (Day 1),"But with Regulation 1/2003, the era of formal exemptions and comfort letters came to an sudden end.

But not forever  fast forward 20 years: to tackle the pandemic, the Commission decided to re-introduce and issue two comfort letters, which provided businesses with guidance on what form of coordination is allowed with a view to increasing supply and the production of urgently needed vaccines.

September 2022 4 Unfortunately, we seem to schlep from one crisis to another and to add insult to injury, the pandemic is now topped off by the energy crisis.

So will a similar form of cooperation to manage the energy supply and mitigate the effects of price surges be allowed, and will competition authorities provide guidance to that end?

First answers are already coming in: On 6 September 2022, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO), under close cooperation with the European Competition Network, allowed a one-time, temporary cooperation between sugar producers.

Within the project, the participating producers aim to provide each other with production capacities in case of a gas supply shortage in order to avoid a sudden production halt.

According to the FCO, given the extraordinary circumstances, the positive effects of such cooperation on consumers outweigh its nega- tive effects and is thus in line with competition law.

And the Commission?

Is so far silent on crisis cooperation, but that might change soon: In the context of the EU Energy Platform, which aims to ensure the security and di- versification of gas supply, governments and businesses are currently discussing some sort of joint purchasing mechanisms.

While details are not yet public, the Commission was quick to comment that this must be set up and implemented in a way that fully complies with competition law.

So we hope that the Commission will follow the FCOs example and use that  or another  chance to provide businesses with specific guidance on what form of cooperation is allowed in the current crisis on a European level.

Wheth- er the Commission is however willing to do so beyond individual cases and whether it might issue publicly available comfort letters to that end, as done in the Covid crisis, remains to be seen.

WHEN?

Hard to tell.

The Commission is yet to act  but, if need be, it might be worthwhile to reach out and discuss the projects with the Commissions services.

In the Covid crisis, the Commission was particularly open to discuss such issues with business associations (which was also the case with the FCO in the sugar cooperation).

Instead of our usual sign-off, we invite you to come back tomorrow  same place, same time  for our second instalment of La Rentre, this time looking into Merger Control.

A demain!

Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: All I Want for Christmas - Our Brussels year review,"December 2021 BRUSSELS  JOUR All I Want for Christmas A Brussels Year in Review Another year has come and gone and although most of us are mentally still somewhere in March 2019, quite a few things happened in the meantime.

Before you unwrap your gifts from Santa and kick back with a well-deserved mug of steaming Glhwein (as we like to call it), lets have a look at what 2021 brought in terms of EU competition law  through cartel enforcement, merger control, State aid and foreign subsidies, with a special shout-out to the digital economy developments.

Antitrust Enforcement  The Commission broke cover, conducting its first dawn raid since the start of the pandemic.

The subject of the raid was a German company active in the sector of gar ments manufacturing and distribution.

The dawn raid in question was all the more relevant since on this occasion the Commission departed from its usual approach of only confirming inspections once a company makes them public.

Instead, it confirmed the inspections in a press release, without naming the company involved, before the company put forward any press release.

Throughout the rest of the year, the Commis sion undertook two other unannounced inspections regarding cartel suspicions in the field of wood pulp (October) and defence (November).  

The three cartel-related dawn raids are part of a larger upswing in the Commissions antitrust enforcement activity, which also included inspections related to a potential abuse of a dominant position in the animal health sector.

Commissioner Vestager herself had already warned in October that more antitrust inspections were on the horizon.

She specifically referred to a number of types of conduct the Commission would likely target, including procurement cartels, no-poach agreements, and collusion on sustainability.

Markus Roehrig, Philipp Neideck, Laura Stoicescu, Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital ofcompetition law.

CONTENTS Antitrust Enforcement Merger Control State Aid Foreign Subsidies Digital Economy & Co. December 2021 2  Commissioner Vestager confirmed the constant decrease in leniency applications, once the silver bullet in cartel detection.

On leniency, the Commission suggested that cartel whistleblowers may need greater protection from civil damages claims to boost the number of leniency applications, although that is still a long way to go.

At the same time, Commissioner Vestager indicated that it was time to step up the other detection methods, which have already shown their efficiency, in order to fill the detection gap.

One such instrument is the anonymous whistleblower platform the Commission launched in 2017, and which provides it with around 100 messages every year.

Another tool is the so-called intelligence unit, which, since its creation in 2016, has had an almost mythological existence.

The launch itself was a rather footnote affair, after which its functioning or even efficiency were never brought up again.

In October, Commissioner Vestager revealed that the James Bond-like structure has helped with investigations in more than 30 cartel and antitrust cases.

And the Commission is planning for it to play an increasingly vital role in its work in the years to come.  

Notable developments in Luxembourg included:  Sumal  The Court of Justice confirmed that subsidiaries can be the target of  follow-on damages actions over anticompetitive conduct by their parent companies if they sold cartelized products.

The ruling promises to make it easier for claimants to bring cartel lawsuits.

We covered the details in our November 2021 issue.1  Google Shopping  

The ruling was the first major judicial test for the Commissions approach to tackling Big Tech via antitrust powers.

The judgment sets a framework for analyzing how power is wielded and deciding whether or not competition has been harmed.

Merger Control"
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: All I Want for Christmas - Our Brussels year review,"The judgment sets a framework for analyzing how power is wielded and deciding whether or not competition has been harmed.

Merger Control  

In March, the Commission issued a communication giving practical guidance on theuse of the referral provision of the EUMR (the now famous Article 22), parti cularly when referrals are appropriate even though the merger is not notifiable in the country in question.

The Commission was specifically eyeing problematic deals such as killer acquisitions, where a large company buys up an innovative startup that may not yet have any significant revenue.

We covered the details in our April 2021 issue.2 9months later, the feedback on its enforcement is rather anticlimactic.

Not only did some businesses and lawyers report that the guidance created significant uncertainty over which deals have to be notified, but also the anticipated flurry of guidance re quests never happened, according to officials from the French and EU competition authorities.

For instance, the Autorit de la Concurrence received only one formal request for guidance, on top of a few informal requests from companies that said theymay come back for advice later.

In the Brussels Bubble, rumor has it that every one is following the Illumina saga, before making any moves of their own.

1 www.hengeler.com/en/2021-11-brussels-a-jour 2 www.hengeler.com/de/2021-04-brussels-a-jour December 2021 3  

Which brings us to the US gene-sequencing company Illumina, currently the only company to have had a merger referred to the EU under the new guidance.

Illumina has taken the Commission to the blocs General Court to challenge the move to claim jurisdiction to review its acquisition of cancer-detection specialist Grail.

In the oral hearing of 16 December, Illumina went all out and argued that it was used as a guinea pig (their words, not ours) for a new method of asserting jurisdiction.

The following 3 hours of Q&A with the judges covered everything from the philosophy behind the EUMR and subsidiarity, to whether Commissioner Vestagers speeches are legally binding.

The case is currently being handled by the General Court under expedited procedure and its outcome might shed more light on the future enforcement of the Article 22 guidance.

Although the Commissions review is still on-going (current deadline: February 2022), Illumina closed the Grail acquisition in August, prompting the Commission to adopt interim measures (inter alia a hold-separate obligation) due to the unprecedented early implementation of a concentration, and also triggering an investigation for gun-jumping, i.e. a potential violation of the standstill obligation.  

The revision of the Market Definition Notice is making a strong comeback, under the impatient French and German eyes.

Ever since the EU regulator vetoed the merger of Siemens and Alstoms railway business in 2019, the two governments argued that by taking such a narrow view of competition, the Commission was preventing the emergence of European companies that could compete on a global scale.

In November, Commissioner Vestager pushed back confirming that European champions come in all shapes and sizes, and stressed that the debate was still open.

The clarification follows up on the Commissions assessment notice of June, which largely confirmed the relevance of the Market Definition Notice, while at the same time identifying 20 areas where the Notice might need updating, to take into account changes in the global economy, evolutions in the Commissions decisional practice, and directives from the case law of the EU courts.

Which way the revision will go is anyones guess now, par ticularly since the Commission feels that EU markets are increasingly concentrated, so breeding European champions might turn out to be a parcours du combattant.

The publication of the draft revised Notice is (still) expected at the beginning of 2022."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: All I Want for Christmas - Our Brussels year review,"The publication of the draft revised Notice is (still) expected at the beginning of 2022.  

In another case, the General Court chimed in with the Commissions conviction that, although crime does not pay in benefits, it pays high fines when caught.

In September, Altice lost its appeal of a sanction levied by the Commission for the implementation of its buyout of PT Portugal before getting merger approval.

Even if the Court reduced the fine by EUR 6 million, the ruling affirmed the Commissions view that pre-closing covenants, if not carefully tailored not to interfere with the targets business, can amount to gun-jumping, an important wake-up call for M&A dealmakers.

The Court also confirmed that the obligations to notify a merger and not to close prior to clear ance are two different sets of rules and that, where a company closed without even notifying its deal, the Commission could impose two fines.

On 2 December, Altice challenged the judgment before the Court of Justice.

December 2021 4 State Aid  Even though 2021 and a continuous inflow of COVID-19 cases continued to put its capacities to a stern test, the Commission  rather than throwing in the towel  kept pushing its agenda forward.

What stands out are efforts aimed at preparing current State aid rules for the so-called twin transition of the European economy into a green and digital future.  

Christmas came three days early when the Commission published the cornerstone of its Fit for 55 package on 21 December 2021, the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy 2022 (CEEAG), thereby replacing the previous 2014 guidelines.

Entering into force on 1 January 2022, the CEEAG is an essential part of the Commissions efforts to promote its Green Deal and aims to pave the way for increased public support towards green projects.

The CEEAG comprises various new or revised sections (e.g. for renewables, energy efficiency, clean mobility and infrastructure) and allows for more flexible granting of aid, provided it contributes to the climate goals of the Green Deal.

To ease the rules, the CEEAG foresee, inter alia, competitive bidding processes, the possibility of higher aid intensities (covering up to 100% of the cost difference to non-climate friendly projects) and even introduces new aid instruments such as Carbon Contracts for Difference.  

Besides its focus on its ambitious climate plan, the Commission has been all but silent on the second pillar of the twin transition.

On digitalization, the Commission just re cently  on 19 November  launched a public consultation on the proposed revision of the Guidelines on State aid rules for broadband networks (Broadband Guidelines), aiming to enable public support for deploying broadband networks particularly into remorse and sparsely populated regions across Europe.

In addition, specifically with a view to ease public support for digitalization-related research and innovation projects, the Commission tabled a proposal for a revised Framework for State aid for research and development and innovation (RDI Framework).  

To back up its efforts on the twin transition, the Commission also adopted and tabled several other frameworks corresponding to and complementing the aforementioned rules.

This included the adoption of a Communication on Important Projects of Com mon European Interest (IPCEI Communication, entering into force on 1 January 2022) as well as a public consultation of proposed amendments to the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER).

Changes to the latter will prove to be of particular practical relevance, as it will under certain criteria allow to exempt various types of aid measures (e.g. green projects, green hydrogen, risk finance investment and vari ous RDI projects) from the obligation to formally notify these to the Commission."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: All I Want for Christmas - Our Brussels year review,"Other noteworthy developments in the State aid area include the new private enforce ment notice, encouraging a closer cooperation between the Commission and national courts (e.g. via new contact points) to facilitate competitors efforts in bringing State aid questions before national courts.

Speaking of enforcement via court, also Luxembourg provided further insights beyond a number of COVID-19 cases (e.g. on discrimination through national aid (schemes), first in Case T-238/20).

In Case C-57/19 P  Tempus Energy v. Commission, the Court of Justice handed down a December 2021 5 widely noticed judgment clarifying the Commissions investigative duties regarding notified measures under preliminary examination (Phase 1).

According to the Court of Justice, contrary to the General Courts extensive interpretation in the now over turned judgment, when assessing whether to open a formal investigation (Phase 2), the Commission is not obliged to seek or research additional information on its own, but can limit its review to information in its possession.

To seek annulment, an appli cant must therefore show that the Commission should have had serious doubts as to the compatibility of the aid based on information available to it in Phase 1 or that such information warranted further enquiries.

Foreign Subsidies  On 5 May 2021, the Commission proposed legislation that would revolutionize the rules on foreign subsidies in the EU, essentially imposing a new regulatory notifica tion regime akin to the EU Merger Regulation and State aid rules.

For details, with a particular focus on implications in M&A transactions, please see our May 2021 edi tion.3

The proposal is currently in the midst of the legislative process at the European parliament and the Council.

It remains to be seen whether there will be substantial changes, in particular with respect to some of the question marks around the current draft.  

As far as the interplay with the State aid rules is concerned, one may ask whether the existing State aid rules and case law offer an appropriate blueprint for foreign sub sidies, having in mind that such questions are also partially addressed by other frame works (e.g. WTO rules).

Furthermore, it remains unclear whether developments in one or the other field can  or even must  be translated into the respective counterpart.  

The foreign subsidies review comes on top of potentially applicable EU or national merger control proceedings and national FDI screenings.

While with respect to EU Merger control proceedings, timelines and notification thresholds are largely aligned, it is unclear how a parallel review might pan out in practice.

For instance, there is no guidance on potential remedies and whether merger control remedies might be accepted or in the Commissions view even sufficient to address additional competitive concerns caused by foreign subsidies.

In addition, practical questions as to the gather ing of information (RFIs to undertakings or third countries) or potential inspections of undertakings in  or outside the EU (possible under foreign subsidies regulation, n/a under merger control or State aid rules) and treatment in parallel proceedings remain unanswered.

3 www.hengeler.com/de/2021-05-brussels-a-jour December 2021 6 Digital Economy & Co.  Ursula von der Leyen raised eyebrows and heartrates when she delivered a very bold 2021 State of the EU speech before the European Parliament in September (SOTEU).

In addition to backing up the upcoming Digital Markets Act (DMA), she also brought into the limelight a European solution to the global semi-conductors shortage, known since then as the European Chips Act.

The Commission was remarkably tight- lipped about the new initiative, except for a brief mentioning in the Commissions 2022 work program.

The initiative might see a very French revival with the 2022 French Presidency."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: All I Want for Christmas - Our Brussels year review,"The initiative might see a very French revival with the 2022 French Presidency.

Although semi-conductors are not mentioned in the Presidencys list of priorities published on 9 December, sources in the Brussels Bubble think that Commissioner Thierry Breton  in charge of the project  is likely to be supported in delaying the conclusion of the tech partnership with the US, in order to buy some time for Europes industry.

The next episode of the cloak and dagger drama is scheduled for spring 2022, with the 2nd EU-US meeting regarding the tech alliance.

In the mean time, you can read more about the SOTEU in our September issue.4  As for the DMA, discussions are close to the finish line and the French Presidencys enthusiasm to see it through is palpable  the DMA features front and center in its list of priorities.

In the meantime, on 25 November, the Council agreed on a common position on the draft DMA, shortening the proposed deadlines, further defining the role of national competition authorities and confirming the Commissions role as sole enforcer of the regulation.

The general approach completes the negotiating position agreed by the Council and provides the Presidency with a mandate for further discus sions with the European Parliament, which are scheduled for 2022.

You can read more about the DMA, including the German take on the debate, in our October issue.5  Although the new Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (VBER) will have broad implications for all industries, the Commissions long awaited draft, published in July 2021, sure takes a special interest in the digital economy.

VBER and guidance not only include extra provisions for online intermediation services  platforms in plain language , effectively excluding certain business models from the safe-harbor.

They also allow suppliers to apply dual-pricing (i.e. different sales prices for their retailers, depending on whether the goods will be sold online or offline) and abandon the long-standing principle that suppliers must not set materially different require ments for their retailers online and offline sales channels.

In the last 12 years since the adoption of the current VBER, e-commerce has certainly made a quantum leap (not just in respect to its importance for our daily life, but also technically)  and the Commission now clearly wants to protect and re-vitalize the brick-and-mortar competition.

Unsurprisingly, the drafts were met with mixed feedback, but the time for changes is running out.

The current VBER will expire on 31 May 2022 and the Commission is determined to have a follow-up legislation duly in place.

Hengeler Mueller,"Distressed M&A – Same same, but different","Although the Covid-19 pandemic caused the worst economic downturn since the global financial crisis of 2008/9, a significant wave of insolvencies and restructuring situations has not yet hit the German market.

This might change, however, in the short to medium term since there is still a great need for a fundamental transformation of business models in many sectors – e.g. automotive, industrial and retail.

The transformation process requires a considerable amount of investment and liquidity that not every company is able to secure.

Moreover, leverage ratios have increased especially in connection with Covid-19 rescue financings, which will considerably hamper the refinancing prospects for many businesses in the near term.

The number of distressed M&A transactions is therefore likely to increase.

The question arises: is the market adequately prepared for this, given that distressed transactions differ significantly from ""ordinary"" M&A transactions?

Transactions under time pressure In general, distressed M&A transactions are not initiated proactively, but are instead the result of extraordinary circumstances such as financial distress or insolvency events.

In structuring the process, sellers hardly ever have much time to prepare, leading to many distressed M&A processes being started on the basis of incomplete information.

In this context, the challenge is often to identify the value drivers for potential acquirers quickly so that not only the equity story, but also a sound restructuring concept can be promoted during the marketing phase of the transaction.

Compared to the classic two-step M&A process, another challenge is the lack of time and flexibility in structuring the process.

In the first phase of a classic M&A process, bidders are initially approached using preliminary information, and full-scale due diligence is performed with a smaller group of bidders in the second stage.

By contrast, a distressed M&A process often only consists of one stage, where potential bidders are identified during a brief bidder eligibility check and the due diligence is started early on in the process.

In addition to the sale of the entire company, the sale of individual business units frequently also needs to be pursued in parallel.

Moreover, stakeholder management is complex: while ordinary M&A processes are often ""controlled"" solely by the shareholder, distressed M&A transactions require additional coordination, specifically among lenders, suppliers and customers.

They are also subject to stricter transparency requirements.

Buyer dynamics and value drivers In distressed M&A transactions, approaching a long list of bidders is the starting point for ensuring transaction security and a maximum purchase price in a manner that is objectively verifiable (e.g. to a creditor committee).

In this context, the approach of strategic buyers differs from that of specialised financial investors.

The latter group, specialising in turnaround situations and familiar with structuring options, can use their experience to put a price tag on levels of risk and are used to meeting tight deadlines.

Strategic investors, by contrast, often require more time to assess and execute distressed M&A transactions, and they frequently apply the same acquisition criteria as for ""healthy"" acquisitions.

This particular bidder environment brings opportunities to promote competition.

Acquiring companies in distress offers strategic buyers the opportunity to increase the transaction's synergy potential significantly as the organisational structure of the target can be modified, for example through insolvency proceedings, even before the transaction is closed.

This increases the pricing pressure on financial investors.

On the other hand, the speed at which distressed M&A transactions can be executed by financial investors places added pressure on strategic investors, who might otherwise miss out on making a transformative acquisition."
Hengeler Mueller,"Distressed M&A – Same same, but different","Apart from securing the highest possible purchase price, it is crucial to identify alternative value drivers.

Depending on the structure of the transaction, the ""transaction value"" can be increased significantly for the seller by minimising post-closing risks and implementing potential earn-out mechanisms.

Purchase agreements follow their own rules Purchase agreements in distressed M&A transactions follow their own rules.

Sellers frequently take a clean-cut approach – especially in cases where the seller ""pays"" the buyer a dowry in the form of a negative purchase price.

In such instances, sellers demand that risks associated with the target's past business operations be allocated exclusively to the buyer and that there be as few representations and warranties as possible, which under different circumstances would be considered aggressive.

Usually, agreements for the purchase of distressed targets also include provisions addressing the seller's liability risks that might materialise in an insolvency after closing, especially if the intended restructuring fails.

In this context, liability risks associated with intra-group financing measures (e.g. loans granted during the crisis), intra-group transactions and pre-closing carve-outs are of paramount importance – particularly when considering risks posed by insolvency avoidance actions ( Insolvenzanfechtung ).

The linchpin of the contractual defence mechanism is found in provisions stipulating that the buyer is obliged to indemnify the seller against any and all claims asserted by third parties, such as creditors or an insolvency administrator, in the event of the target's insolvency, also known as ""insolvency indemnity"".

Mirroring that indemnity, purchase agreements frequently provide for positive covenants, specifically so-called ""solvency covenants"", under which the buyer undertakes to provide the target with ongoing financing for a certain period of time.

Closely connected with such covenants are ring-fencing provisions.

These prohibit the buyer from taking certain measures with respect to the target for a specific period of time post-closing, e.g. withdrawing company funds in the form of dividends or management fees.

In the event that the seller is unable to obtain reliable buyer commitments, the seller may seek to protect itself against certain insolvency risks by having the transaction implemented on the basis of a restructuring opinion prepared by an independent expert.

In bidder processes, great care and skill are especially required when it comes to the restructuring opinion: it needs to be based on the business plan of the successful bidder validated by the opinion provider, although the selection of the successful bidder depends to a large extent on the business case presented by the bidder.

Exercising great care and skill when acquiring insolvent companies Buyers also require specific expertise on insolvency if a restructuring has failed and the target has already filed for insolvency.

In that event, the buyer may opt for buying either the insolvent company by way of an asset deal ( übertragende Sanierung ), or shares in the insolvent entity by way of an insolvency or restructuring plan.

While both options generally permit the settlement of existing liabilities, they differ quite considerably in other respects and must be weighed up by taking the facts of the individual case into account.

Finally, buyers of insolvent companies benefit from transaction experience: only buyers who are familiar with the demands of an insolvency administrator, and who manage to steer clear of the no-nos under insolvency law, will succeed in competitive bidding processes.

Due to the many unique characteristics of distressed M&A transactions, such processes are not carried out via a standardised approach."
Hengeler Mueller,"Distressed M&A – Same same, but different","Due to the many unique characteristics of distressed M&A transactions, such processes are not carried out via a standardised approach.

Distressed M&A transactions require not only a holistic approach when preparing and executing the transaction, but also the experience that is necessary to be able to respond with flexibility in extremely dynamic processes and special circumstances.

In view of the expected increase in deal volume in the short and medium term, market participants are well advised to familiarise themselves with the special aspects of transactions involving distressed companies in order to be able to successfully execute accretive acquisitions as well as value-maximising sales that also safeguard jobs.

Distressed transactions are usually perceived as carrying a high inherent risk at the time of execution.

Accordingly, only those sellers and investors who are well-prepared and well-positioned when entering these processes will be able to achieve a high selling price / an attractive and predictable long-term investment return.

A version of this article has been published also in M&A Review."
Hengeler Mueller,Financing Trends in 2023 and Outlook 2024,"After the unexpectedly buoyant mood in 2021 and early 2022, the M&A and financing markets suffered a significant setback following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

In 2023, the total volume of syndicated loans granted in Europe fell significantly compared to previous years, which particularly affected acquisition financings.

Continuing the trend from 2022, refinancing transactions dominated the European credit market.

Among other things, this was due to the political and economic turmoil, soaring energy prices and inflation.

Although liquidity remains abundant in the hands of private equity and private debt providers, lenders are increasingly reluctant to support highly leveraged buyout transactions, fearing that target companies are increasingly vulnerable to economic risks and political instability.

At the same time, the constant increases in base rates by central banks and the associated rise in reference interest rates have led to a considerable increase in the cost of debt capital.

This ongoing financial burden must not only be taken into account when entering into new financing transactions, it also puts pressure on some companies with existing financing arrangements.

These developments have made lenders more aware of default risks in acquisition financings which is now causing them to act more cautiously.

Against this backdrop, it is notable that potential target companies are being scrutinised more critically by potential lenders.

Private equity investors were once again the most active parties on the buyer side in European M&A transactions, albeit at a lower level than in previous years.

Financing part of the purchase price with debt capital is a key element of M&A transactions with a private equity investor as the buyer.

In recent years, debt funds have increasingly established themselves as an alternative to traditional acquisition financings made available by banks.

While debt funds generally demand higher margins than banks, in many cases they are able to provide a significantly larger financing volume than a single bank, which makes it easier for borrowers to negotiate terms with only one or a very small number of debt funds.

In addition, debt funds commonly offer acquisition financings that provide for a bullet repayment at the end of the term, which is advantageous for private equity sponsors pursuing a buy-and-build strategy.

Banks, on the other hand, generally require that a portion of the facilities they provide be repaid in instalments.

This ongoing outflow of funds from the financed group reduces the possibility of using its own generated liquidity for further acquisitions.

On the other hand, for structural reasons, debt funds are rarely or only to a limited extent in a position to provide revolving credit facilities to finance the ongoing business activities of a company or group, because unlike banks, debt funds have to call the required funds from their investors.

The granting of loans for short periods of time does not suit this financing model.

In addition, debt funds are often unable to grant letters of credit or bank guarantees.

If there is a need for a revolving credit facility, it may be an option to form a consortium consisting of debt funds and banks.

For example, a debt fund can provide the term loan facilities to finance acquisitions, while a bank makes the revolving credit facility available.

As the isolated provision of the revolving credit facility may not be economically attractive for a bank in the context of an acquisition financing transaction, it may be a solution to additionally offer the bank a portion of the acquisition facilities.

However, agreeing on the details of such a structure is often the subject of intense negotiations, as the debt fund will generally be keen to secure extensive decision-making powers in the ongoing contractual relationship with the borrower.

It is difficult to predict developments in 2024."
Hengeler Mueller,Financing Trends in 2023 and Outlook 2024,"It is difficult to predict developments in 2024.

Sponsors are under pressure to make investments, and the cooled M&A market of recent months will eventually push some older portfolio companies onto the market, so that at least some gains can be realized by the investors.

This is likely to lead to increased activity in the M&A market in 2024.

With regard to acquisition financings, much will depend on whether the increases in base rates will come to an end and whether the new interest rate environment is taken more into account in sellers' price expectations.

It will also be important that the attention of lenders is not taken up too much by insolvencies and financial difficulties by existing borrowers."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2022,"Supervisory Board Survey 2022 SEPTEMBER 2022 3 Foreword

The after-effects from more than two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, lingering supply chain problems, and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine have all led to massive geopolitical turmoil.

German companies have not been spared from having to confront the far-reaching consequences of these events.

But what impact has the current global situation had on the work and the deci sion-making of supervisory boards?

Besides these developments, which are being felt everywhere, what other subjects are defining the agendas of these corporate bodies?

What else is keeping them busy?

And what role do a company's strategic direction and the further professionalisation of the work performed by its supervi sory board now play after years of continuous crisis management?

Together with AdAR, the Arbeitskreis deutscher Aufsichtsrat e.V. (German Supervisory Board Working Group), we explored these and many more questions in this year's su pervisory board survey.

We hope you find this reading enlightening and inspiring.

26 6 7 Dealing with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, has dropped in priority somewhat, although it still continues to reverberate in supply chains.

After clearly defining supervisory board agendas last year (91 per cent of respondents agreeing), the pandemic currently ranks just sixth in respondents' order of priority with just 75 per cent of respond ents agreeing.

What subjects have been on your agenda in particular in 2022 (versus in 2021)?

A. Subjects and resources 1.

The supervisory board agenda in 2022 The war in Ukraine and its ripple effects are, understandably, also contributing to what does and does not appear on supervisory boards' agendas.

Eighty-one per cent of the supervisory board members surveyed consider the impact of the Russian war of aggression and its conse quences either relevant or very relevant to the work they do.

Given the numerous challenges and upheaval the war and its effects have entailed, this is hardly astonishing."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2022,"Given the numerous challenges and upheaval the war and its effects have entailed, this is hardly astonishing.

Among the subjects that have arisen in connection with the war, there are the implications felt in the sale of goods and services as well as in the supply of finished and semi-finished goods, the question of what to do with company locations and employees in the two countries, and energy market turbulence, to give just but a few examples.

The two major crises, the Ukraine war and COVID-19, have affected how relevant supply chains are (79 per cent of respondents agreeing), and they have obviously brought home to companies all the more (aspects of) the geopolitical instability that there has been since even before these crises began (77 per cent of respondents agreeing).

While supervisory board members of both listed and unlisted companies deem the war in Ukraine and the persistently heightened political uncertainty to be highly relevant to their activities, managing the effects of the pandemic has kept listed companies somewhat busier (86 per cent of respondents agreeing versus 69 per cent).

The difference is even more distinct when it comes to supply chains.

The disruption of global trade has been dominating the agenda of listed companies' supervisory boards to a far greater degree (91 per cent of respondents agreeing) than it has for their counterparts at unlisted companies (73 per cent of respondents agreeing).

Please note: The values used in this study report are rounded figures.

Furthermore, 'prefer not to say' responses have been left out for better comprehensibility.

Therefore, in individual cases, total sums might not come out to 100 (per cent).

Moreover, not all respondents answered all of the questions, meaning that there may be different survey sample sizes for individual questions.

8 9 However, supervisory board members are apparently still attaching the greatest relevance to positioning their companies for the future, despite or perhaps precisely because of the persisting crisis situations.

Eighty-six per cent of respondents consider adapting their com panies for the digital age to be the central topic on their agenda.

ESG topics and the trans formation of their companies towards becoming more sustainable are equally conspicuous on the agenda, with 80 per cent of respondents attributing these subjects relevance."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2022,"ESG topics and the trans formation of their companies towards becoming more sustainable are equally conspicuous on the agenda, with 80 per cent of respondents attributing these subjects relevance.

These were followed by compliance (68 per cent), succession planning (49 per cent), diver sity (45 per cent), management board and supervisory board remuneration (43 per cent) and co-determination (18 per cent), some of which trail the one before it by a considerable margin.

In this regard as well, the order of the priorities is different at listed and unlisted compa nies.

While nearly the same importance is attached to the sustainability transformation, the digital transformation is given somewhat higher priority by supervisory board members of unlisted companies (with 92 per cent of respondents agreeing) than by their counterparts at publicly traded companies (83 per cent).

Compliance also has higher priority at unlisted companies (71 per cent of respondents agreeing) than it does with the supervisory board members of listed companies (58 per cent).

The latter have possibly come to regard compliance as more a part of an institutionalised routine in light of regulatory requirements, and because of that the subject appears with less and less emphasis on supervisory board agendas.

The difference between listed and unlisted companies is even greater with regard to diversity.

With 50 per cent of respondents from listed companies agreeing, diversity is a far more established topic there than on the supervisory boards of unlisted companies (35 per cent).

These figures clearly show the impact of the statutory requirements that are aimed at listed companies to a far greater extent than at unlisted companies.

Clear differences between respondent groups are also apparent in opinions regarding suc cession planning, i.e. whether or not it is viewed as a key topic for the supervisory board.

Sixty-nine per cent of the surveyed officers of listed companies reported having this subject on their agendas, whereas only 38 per cent of respondents from unlisted companies said the same.

The effects of the increasing requirements being placed on the office of supervisory board member, primarily at listed companies, are also evident when it comes to succession planning.

In addition, recent examples have also shown that personnel decisions relating to management boards are criticised (publicly) by institutional investors and other stakeholders of listed companies.

A few respondents to the survey also identified energy and future financing as agenda items  two areas that have recently gained considerable momentum.

Assuming that the current situation continues, these areas may resonate far greater in our next survey.

2.

The resources allocated to supervisory boards To handle both acute and strategic challenges, supervisory boards must of course also have the appropriate tools, personnel and resources available.

Just last year, survey respondents described the adequacy of the resources allocated to the corporate body they serve on as the biggest challenge they face.

This appears  at least to an extent  to have changed for the better.

How do you rate the resources allocated to your supervisory board?

When asked about how satisfied they are with their allocated resources, supervisory board members gave personnel resources their greatest approval (75 per cent), followed by finances (73 per cent) and the time available for board activities (66 per cent).

Last year, only 59 per cent of respondents agreed that they had ample time to fulfil their role as a supervisory board member.

This aspect has therefore improved somewhat."

The makeup of a supervisory board When it comes to the composition of a supervisory board, a broad mix of experience and professional expertise is gaining in importance.

Driving this development, besides regula tion, are the imperatives of business  whether it be the digital transformation, the need for financial expertise or the creation of greater sustainability.

1.

Financial expertise on supervisory boards For instance, under Germany's Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity (FISG), at least two finance experts must be sitting on each supervisory board.

One of them needs to have expertise in accounting, and the other should be familiar with statutory audits.

The German Corporate Governance Code goes even further with its guidelines.

When asked about the cri teria they apply for verifying a candidate's expertise, most of the supervisory board members surveyed said they relied on the candidate's experience as a CFO (79 per cent either agreeing or strongly agreeing).

A lot of weight is also given to expertise acquired through continuing professional development (66 per cent) and to obtaining the public auditor qualification or working as one (66 per cent) or to membership on the audit committee of other companies (61 per cent).

Working as a tax consultant or any other long-term experience as an advisor in the field of auditing was rated rather low as proof of expertise.

The surveyed supervisory board members see the greatest room for improvement in the technical resources allocated to them.

More than one in four supervisory board members surveyed (26 per cent) rated these resources as mediocre.

One in ten (10 per cent) even considered them poor.

In taking a closer look at the two respondent groups, however, almost tangible differences become apparent this year again as well.

For example, the level of satisfaction among su pervisory board members at listed companies with regard to their financial resources and personnel is significantly higher than at unlisted companies.

These assets were rated as good or very good by 81 per cent and 83 per cent of the respondents, respectively, at listed com panies.

By contrast, only 65 per cent of supervisory board members at unlisted companies said the same for both finances and personnel.

Moreover, only 53 per cent of supervisory board members at listed companies view their technical resources as very good or good, while this figure is 63 per cent at unlisted com panies.

The reason for this may also be the different requirements for listed and unlisted companies.

Significantly more supervisory board members of listed companies deem their technical resources to be only mediocre or even poor (33 and 11 per cent, respectively).

Sustainability expertise on supervisory boards Particular expertise is also being increasingly demanded of supervisory boards when it comes to sustainability."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2022,"12 13 2.

Sustainability expertise on supervisory boards Particular expertise is also being increasingly demanded of supervisory boards when it comes to sustainability.

The German Corporate Governance Code, for instance, stipulates that supervisory boards also need to have sustainability expertise.

A narrow majority (51 per cent) of surveyed supervisory board members believe that their companies already meet this criterion.

At listed companies, this figure is even 62 per cent.

According to the guidelines of the German Corporate Governance Code, supervisory boards should have expertise on sustainability.

Does your company already meet this requirement?

Supervisory board members of listed companies attach significantly greater importance to professional experience as a CFO when gauging proof of financial expertise (85 per cent) than their peers at unlisted companies do (72 per cent).

The same goes for a candidate's work or qualification as a public auditor (78 versus 54 per cent).

By contrast, acquiring expertise through continued education is considered more relevant at unlisted companies with regard to proof of financial expertise (69 per cent at unlisted companies versus 58 per cent at listed companies), the same as with membership on an audit committee at another company (68 per cent at unlisted companies versus 53 per cent at listed companies).

From where do the relevant members on your supervisory board have the necessary  expertise on accounting and statutory audits?

The role of a committee dedicated solely to sustainability The finding presented above is consistent with respondents' attitudes towards setting up a committee dealing specifically with sustainability issues.

According to our survey, a clear majority of supervisory board members (58 per cent) are in favour of having the full su pervisory board address sustainability topics.

Another 15 per cent of respondents stated that such topics are dealt with in other supervisory board committees.

Some supervisory boards, for instance, have expanded the purview of their strategy or innovation committee to include sustainability issues.

In some cases, this has even entailed a considerable increase in the number of members of that committee.

Only 12 per cent of survey participants said that there already was a sustainability committee at their respective companies; another 8 per cent said that establishing such a committee was being planned.

What is your supervisory board's stance on establishing a committee devoted specifically to subjects of sustainability?

3. Meeting the sustainability expertise requirements There are entirely different ways in which supervisory boards can meet sustainability ex pertise requirements, as our study has also shown.

Most supervisory board members sur veyed (76 per cent) currently view training and seminars as the means of choice to fulfil the requirement for this particular ESG expertise.

Seventy-two per cent look to board members with a professional background in this area, while 63 per cent would involve consultants."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2022,"Seventy-two per cent look to board members with a professional background in this area, while 63 per cent would involve consultants.

An academic background is given rather minor importance, however, when it comes to choosing a supervisory board member with expertise on sustainability, the same as setting up an ESG committee or appointing an individual to oversee ESG matters.

How does your supervisory board intend to address fulfilling the sustainability expertise re quirements in the future, or how does your supervisory board meet the requirements already?

By comparison, only 2 per cent of supervisory board members from the unlisted camp responded that they had a sustainability committee, but 12 per cent were planning theirs.

In addition, 22 per cent of supervisory board members at listed companies stated that sustainability was covered on other committees of the supervisory board (com pared to 10 per cent at unlisted companies).

At 46 per cent, the supervisory boards of listed companies are going with the full board as the place to address sustainability far less than the supervisory boards of unlisted companies (68 per cent).

There is certainly no panacea for having sustainability matters handled by the supervisory board.

The variety of possible approaches is as large as Germany's corporate landscape itself.

Sustainability should of course be internalised as a cross-cutting issue by all relevant players within a company.

However, someone has to accompany this institutionalisation process, which is why putting a new  or one or more already existing  committee in charge of this topic specifically might be sensible in a first step.

To be sure, the effort required for this ap proach needs to correlate to the size of the supervisory board.

It also bears considering that listed companies must and also want to comply with the requirements of the capital market and the expectations of their institutional investors much more than unlisted companies do.

This concept has also received a boost from recent developments at no less than the largest listed companies in Germany.

Within the DAX 40, there has been a considerable increase in the number of committees dedicated solely to sustainability since 2021.

This trend is likely to continue over the next few months at listed companies at any rate."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2022,"This trend is likely to continue over the next few months at listed companies at any rate.

5. Criteria when selecting new supervisory board members In addition to the competence in finances and sustainability outlined above, further im portant criteria are taken into account when companies look for candidates to nominate to their supervisory boards.

An overwhelming majority of the supervisory board members we surveyed are looking most of all for personality in the individuals who will serve with them (92 per cent of respondents agreeing).

An explanation for this might be found in the type of subjects supervisory boards deal with: many of them are cross-cutting issues that require leaders who others believe are capable of finding the right approach in times of crisis.

But other skills and factors are also sought after: teamwork skills (76 per cent) and intercultural competence (67 per cent), as well as an international background (49 per cent) and gender parity on the supervisory board (46 per cent).

In a way, one might infer that the women's quota works if it no longer plays a major role when positions on supervisory boards are filled.

What are the important criteria, in addition to competence, when selecting the next  supervisory board member?

Succession planning 1.

The significance of management board succession to the supervisory board In light of rising investor expectations for more diversity, the subject of succession planning has become noticeably more important for companies in the last few years.

This trend is also reflected in our survey: 74 per cent of surveyed supervisory board members consider succession planning to be relevant or very relevant.

At listed companies, this figure is even slightly higher at 78 per cent.

Another explanation for this is likely also the increasingly critical response from investors and other stakeholders to a number of prominent succession decisions.

Especially in times when companies are facing transformations and expanding global challenges, personnel decisions relating to the management board are perceived as a fundamental cornerstone of future development.

To lay that foundation, these groups are demanding new perspectives and ideas, in addition to previous experience, from managers more and more.

Simple 'in- house appointments' without considering any alternatives are therefore coming across as far less acceptable.

How relevant is it to you that matters of succession relating to the management board be handled by the supervisory board?

2. Central players in management board succession At most companies, it is primarily the supervisory board chair (61 per cent), the personnel committee or a similar committee (55 per cent) or the entire supervisory board (51 per cent) that are involved in planning the succession of management board members.

But, in the opinion of the supervisory board members surveyed, the management board chair (44 per cent) and executive search firms (43 per cent) are also important.

Who is involved in planning the succession of management board members?

4.

The supervisory board's preparations for management board succession Succession planning is a constant process for most companies.

Thirty-seven per cent of surveyed supervisory board members work continuously on evaluating potential successor candidates to the management board; another third (31 per cent) begin such work in ad vance of scheduled transitions.

Merely a quarter of respondents act according to situational demands.

How much in advance is the succession of management board members evaluated on the supervisory board?

As expected, the degree of institutionalised succession planning correlates to the size of the company.

The ongoing evaluation of management board successors on supervisory boards is clearly more established at listed  and thus in many cases, larger  companies at 46 per cent than it is at unlisted companies (32 per cent).

Our data reflects what is being practised.

What is remarkable, however, is that personnel departments are little involved in succession planning when it is ultimately the human re sources and talent development experts of a company that in many cases will have the argu ably best awareness of the potential that there is within their own organisation.

Supervisory boards should not overlook this know-how when developing young talent for the long term.

3. Challenges in planning the succession of management board members The growing shortage of skilled workers in Germany has now reached the executive level as well.

Seven out of ten supervisory board members surveyed (69 per cent) find there to be a lack of suitable candidates or describe the size of the successor pool (71 per cent) as the central challenge to succession planning.

It is therefore hardly surprising that executive development is considered decisively important when planning who will replace members on a management board, as 82 per cent of respondents attest.

According to 86 per cent of respondents from listed companies, this challenge is even slightly more significant there than at unlisted companies (80 per cent).

Supervisory board efficiency Another factor contributing to furthering the professionalisation of the supervisory board is the regular review of its operations and decision-making processes.

1.

The added value of reviewing the efficiency of the supervisory board Seventy-one per cent of supervisory board members surveyed attest to the (highest) impor tance of efficiency reviews.

Supervisory board members conducting a self-evaluation, in many cases with external support, constitutes a relatively simple and good way of gauging opinions on the quality and the efficiency of the work performed by supervisory boards directly.

Each company answers the question differently, however, how to approach such assessments.

How do you rate the added value of reviewing the efficiency of the supervisory board?

supervisory board members replied that such a review occurred only irregularly or ad hoc.

No such evaluation of the board occurs with 13 per cent of respondents.

How regularly are your supervisory board's operations and decision-making processes reviewed?

Notable differences appear between listed and unlisted companies.

For example, according to the responses from the surveyed supervisory board members, assessing the work and decision-making processes of supervisory boards is institutionalised at 81 per cent of listed companies, while at unlisted companies it is only 48 per cent.

Twenty-four per cent  almost twice the average  of supervisory board members of unlisted companies stated that no pro cess evaluation took place at all on their boards.

The number of irregular evaluations is also somewhat higher at unlisted companies at 28 per cent than it is with the surveyed officers of listed companies (14 per cent).

Because of their significance for the (future) development of the work supervisory boards do, and as an immediate indicator for supervisory board members, the German Corporate Governance Code stipulates regular efficiency reviews.

The distinctly higher degree of insti tutionalisation at listed companies is therefore hardly surprising.

Our study shows that the work of supervisory boards is clearly orientated towards strategy.

The concurrence of permanent crisis management, establishing resilience and working on the future of their companies will engross supervisory boards in the future as well.

After all, future crisis issues, such as adjusting to an increasingly recessionary economic environ ment and handling the supply shortages of conventional energy, have already made it into supervisory boards' day-to-day business.

In that context, professionalising the work done by supervisory boards is also coming to be regarded as more and more important.

Besides the increasing statutory requirements, a higher degree of institutionalised operations and technical expertise in particular is desired to help supervisory boards contribute to an even more effective monitoring and counselling of management in the company's interest.

In light of the challenging and  to a degree  disruptive times that companies are facing, the supervisory board members surveyed believe that personality also plays an equally crucial role on supervisory boards.

Managers equipped with the right resources are apparently trusted to find the right approach precisely in challenging environments.

During the pandemic, the Commission gave additional leeway to companies genuine efforts to cope with the crisis through appropriately tailored cooperation, and special State aid rules were put in place to allow Member States to support affected industries.

Can companies expect the Commission and NCAs to take a similar approach in the current energy crisis and economic downturnso the lights dont go out?

In light of the not-so-cheerful news nowadays concerning energy security, energy prices, and shortages ofpretty much everything, we thought wed try and paint a brighter picture of tomorrow, with the help of EU competition law.

Its not an easy time for companies struggling with market disruptions, especially under the watchful eye of Article 101(1) TFEU.

But if the pandemic taught us something, its that the Commission is sometimes willing to give leeway to its (in)famous cartel prohibition.

And considering the current energy crisis, the war in Ukraine and the upcoming economic crisis, it might be a good moment for the Commission to concede again.

Stay with us, as well look at the specifics of the cartel prohibition and crisis cartels, the legislative action the EU is brewing in order to broaden the scope of cooperation between undertakings as well as the State aid provisions companies can rely on.

The Notion of Crisis Cartels Revived?

Back in 2020, the Commission and its national counterparts explored to quite some extent if and how much leeway they can allow with respect to the enforcement of Article 101(1) TFEU where companies sought to cope with the economic challenges brought about by the pandemic through cooperation.

If you will, a resurrection of the so-called crisis cartels  an economic concept previously employed, where a government (or the Commission, in our case) allows or fosters coordination or agreement between firms during an economic downturn.

At the beginning of the pandemic, disruptions in the retail supply chain motivated the Commission to issue a comfort letter relaxing the conditions of cartel enforcement so that the cooperation between suppliers would Markus Roehrig, Laura Stoicescu and Joachim Burger report on the latest developments from the European capital of competition law.

October 2022 2 alleviate the difficulties of the market, in certain conditions and temporarily.

The same mechanism was employed for the pharma industry in order to combat the pandemic.

Can companies expect the Commission and NCAs to be equally pragmatic in the current energy crisis and the ensuing economic downturn in Europe?

Signalling an initial willingness to pursue a pragmatic approach to the enforcement of Article 101(1) in the current crisis, the ECN and the ICN both put out (fairly high-level) statements leaving room for cooperation between undertakings in order to ensure the purchase, supply and fair distribution of scarce products (on one hand), or to mitigate the economic consequences arising from sanctions imposed on Russia.

However, in order to be acceptable to antitrust enforcers, any form of cooperation will likely need to meet two requirements.

First, all measures will have to be temporary, strictly necessary and to specifically target the market disruptions.

Second, there will need to be convincing evidence that the cooperation will generate clear efficiencies outweighing any restrictions.

Generally speaking, cooperation on the supply-side is likely to receive more preferential treatment than cooperation on aspects which are customer-facing.

Where Cooperation May (or May not) be Permissible While the ECNs and ICNs statements send a clear message that agencies are willing to engage in a constructive discussion, they remain fairly generic and offer little specific guidance as to where to draw the line.

However, some agencies have already ventured out and taken first decisions."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Turn off the Light!,"However, some agencies have already ventured out and taken first decisions.

Along with the experience from the pandemic, these can offer some useful insights where companies may be able to get help from antitrust regulators across the EU.  

In Germany, in order to mitigate the effects of possible gas shortages on sugar production (i.e., the rotting of sugar beets due to factory forced downtime), the Bundeskartellamt allowed four manufacturers to make production capacities available to each other in the event of gas supply cut-offs and ensuing production stoppages at the affected factories.

The cooperation is temporary and limited to the upcoming sugar beet campaign and the subsequent settlement period until June 2023.

The exchange of information between the companies will be limited to what is necessary by means of accompanying measures, and handled by an external party.  

In a similar move, two German gas importers and wholesalers were allowed to collaborate in the setup and operation of floating LNG terminals, in the North Sea ports of Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbttel.

The joint operation of the LNG terminals would tend to restrict competition, but any potential negative effects are currently offset by obvious and substantial benefits for customers, the Bundeskartellamt said, approving the plan.

In terms of efficiencies, the rapid commissioning can create urgently needed and price-reducing import capacities for gas in a relatively short period of time.

The cooperation model is currently limited until the end of March 2024.

October 2022 3  

The management of supply-chain disruptions may well be another area in which companies may be allowed to cooperate, the resulting efficiency being the provision of a more final product on the market.

For instance, a company faced with disruptions in its raw materials supply due the sanctions imposed to Russia could conclude a supply agreement with a competitor sourcing its raw materials from within Europe.  

Cooperation is less likely to be acceptable to address structural overcapacity in the market triggered, for instance, by an economic recession, or specifically as a result of export bans to Russia.

Arguably, the reduction of overcapacity could lead to cost savings.

However, the Commission has so far been reluctant to accept the coordinated reduction of production capacity given the potentially significant impact on competition and prices such agreements may have.

According to the Commission, even in times of long-term structural overcapacity, the criteria for cartel exemptions under Article 101(3) TFEU will rarely be met, and that overcapacity should be rectified by market forces.

The Brazilian competition authority, however, did authorize pioneering measures to reduce demand shocks during the pandemic, allowing large food suppliers to coordinate on special conditions, such as discounts for purchases required to be passed on to consumers to stimulate demand.  

Of course, the relaxation of the cartel prohibition is not an invitation for an all- you-can-cartelize buffet.

For example, a no-go would be an agreement between undertakings aiming to pass on to customers increased prices for raw materials.

Joint Purchasing of Gas

The Commission has put forward an initiative for the joint procurement of gas in the EU, largely in view of spring 2023, when the winter gas storages will most likely be depleted.

In order to avoid that Member States outbid each other, leading to a potential fragmentation and distortion of the Single Market, the Commission suggested setting up a mechanism for the joint procurement of gas.

The idea is that the EU becomes a sort of buyers cartel  a kind of reverse of OPEC, but for gas, as Politico put it.

The Commission published draft legislation on 18 October under the Article 122 TFEU emergency measures procedure, whereby legislation can be passed with the agreement of the Commission and the Member States, excluding the European Parliament."
Hengeler Mueller,Brussels à Jour: Turn off the Light!,"The joint purchasing scheme is designed as a two-step mechanism based on demand pooling and joint purchasing:  

First, companies have to aggregate their demand through a service provider contracted by the Commission, which would then seek offers via a public tender process for volumes of natural gas sufficient to meet the aggregated demand.

The Member States will request companies to participate in the aggregation of demand for at least 15% of the total volume needed to fill the underground storage facilities, while, at the same time, leaving the participating companies the freedom to go ahead or not with the purchase at the end of the aggregation process (depending on the volume of gas obtained, as well as the price and other conditions).

October 2022 4  In a second step, companies participating in the demand pooling, if they decide to go ahead with the purchase, can decide to either enter the contracts individually or to form a gas purchasing consortium coordinating their positions with respect to volumes, prices, delivery points and so on, and to enter into contracts with the suppliers that offered gas.

Creating a single gas purchasing consortium would offer strong buying power and increase the likelihood of achieving better prices, but more than one consortium will be allowed to operate.

The Commission has volunteered to provide informal guidance to companies which intend to jointly procure gas, according to the draft regulation.

More specifically, the Commission indicated that it stands ready to support companies in the design of the gas purchasing consortium (most likely through informal guidance) and to issue a decision, pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation 1/2003, on the inapplicability of Articles 101, 102 TFEU if relevant safeguards are incorporated and respected.

This is particularly the case since the companies might have to coordinate regarding the conditions of purchase, such as volumes, gas price, delivery points and time.

To facilitate the process, the draft foresees the creation of an IT platform, where gas purchasers can enter desired prices, volumes and delivery points.

The purchasing process itself will be facilitated by a steering board composed of representatives of Member States and the Commission.

The initiative will also receive the support of the newly-formed EU Energy Platform Industry Advisory Group  an informal expert group which will provide feedback on the options for demand aggregation and joint gas purchasing.

Going forward, the 25 October ordinary meeting of ministers acted as a first round of discussions on a formal draft document.

According to the current schedule, an extraordinary meeting is likely to be needed to finalize legislation in November.

EU Member States get energetic But the EU is not alone in taking on the energy crisis: Member States have already announced first steps and far-reaching measures in parallel.

In a nutshell (and as per the 7th edition of the State of the Energy Union report), all Member States have implemented measures to tackle higher energy prices, by 18 October 2022.

And according to the 20 October Council, Member States shall not only rely on the measures about to come on an EU level, but that all relevant tools at national and EU level should be mobilised.

Germany, for example, announced in late September that it planned to distribute up to EUR 200 bn into its economy via a national emergency fund.

To ease the financial burden, it inter alia plans to introduce a gas price cap for consumers and companies (whereby the State will absorb exceeding costs), tax cuts and more public support for companies affected by the war in Ukraine and the sanctions.

The plan sparked an unprecedented backlash by the Commission and other Member States (only to name France, Italy, Hungary and Poland)."

In a widely syndicated article, commissioners Thierry Breton (Internal Market) and Paolo Gentiloni (Economy) condemned the package as a beginning race for subsidies underpinning the European idea of solidarity and unity.

October 2022 5 the need for common European level solutions

[] in a united manner.

But so far, Germany seems intent to pull through, however it remains to be seen if the Commission might intervene and demand alterations  to maintain a level playing field  in case the package potentially involves State aid elements and requires EU approval.

State Aid to the Rescue A big part of crisis response burden lies on the shoulders of governments, undoubtedly more so in the rampant energy crisis.

But as we are all aware, public support falls within the ambit of the EUs rigid State aid control system.

Therefore, in particular the hefty criticism that Germanys envisaged EUR 200bn support scheme has provoked begs the question what role the EUs State Aid rules will play to alleviate the crisis.

Will Brussels be a roadblock rather than the promised rescue?

While there are certainly cases in which the former is true  a topic for another day, the latter seems to prevail now.

As in the pandemic, the Commission was fairly quick to hand out a Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF), setting out State aid-compliant conditions for public support.

And after Vice President Vestager assured us in late September that the Commission will not stand in the way of support in line with the principles of Article 107 TFEU, a second TCF amendment is just around the corner.

After a short consultation with the Member States and taking into account the recent and planned emergency measures to address high energy prices described above, the revised TCF to be published in the next days is set to allow for more support to mitigate the crisis, inter alia with the following:  

The TCF will be amended until 31 December 2023.  

Increased maximum aid ceilings (reportedly EUR 750k instead of EUR 500k) for direct grants to companies suffering from the crisis.  

Facilitated liquidity support (reportedly EUR 2m loan guarantee now per calendar year instead of at any given point in time, so possible in 2022 and 2023).  

Reportedly larger enterprises can receive higher loan guarantees to collateralise their trading activities on energy markets, provided there is appropriate justification.  

Criteria to be included for the assessment of equity interventions and recapitalisations (but, contrary to the Covid Temporary Framework, not a section of its own).

Rumours have it that the Commission is willing to give the Member States as much flexibility as possible to support companies facing significant cost increases, while at the same time trying  following the mentioned concerns regarding Germanys intended EUR 200 bn package  to avoid a harmful subsidy race between European economies.

So, by and large, rescue rather than roadblock it is.

And the Member States seem to accept this offer gladly, with the Commission having approved already over 85 aid schemes under the TCF since April 2022.

In addition to the TCF, Member States may also support companies by compensating them for damages caused by the energy crisis under Article 107 (2) (b) TFEU, for which however a detailed account of the incurred damages and a direct link to the energy crisis needs to be proven.

Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2023,"Supervisory Board Survey 2023 SEPTEMBER 2023 3 Foreword Over the last few years, aspects relating to sustainability and the ESG criteria have turned into critical factors for commercial enterprises to consider, and as a result supervisory board agendas have been devoting more and more attention to them.

This year, in general, posi- tioning the company to be fit for the future counted among the central topics addressed by supervisory boards.

Additionally, globally persistent geopolitical instability and supply-chain disruptions, triggered by bottlenecks, unrelenting inflation and energy pricing, continue to dominate in the German corporate landscape.

But what has this meant for supervisory boards and the work they do in concrete terms?

What further topics are defining supervisory boards' agendas at present?

How are these to- pics impacting the skills and expertise profiles of supervisory boards?

And what significance does the greater professionalisation of supervisory board work have in times of crisis?

To- gether with AdAR, the Arbeitskreis deutscher Aufsichtsrat e.V. (German Supervisory Board Working Group), we explored these and many more questions in this year's supervisory board survey.

We hope you find this reading enlightening and inspiring.

29 Please note: The values used in this study report are rounded figures.

Furthermore, 'prefer not to say' responses have been left out for better comprehensibility.

Therefore, in indivi- dual cases, total sums might not come out to 100 (per cent).

Moreover, not all respondents answered all of the questions, meaning that there may be different survey sample sizes for individual questions.

6 7 In general, like last year, the supervisory board members attached the greatest import- ance to setting their companies up to be ready for what the future brings.

In contrast to the results of the 2022 survey, while the subject of digitalising or digitally transforming their companies no longer ranks first this year, it still remains greatly relevant (with 84 per cent of respondents saying so)."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2023,"With a view to positioning their companies for the future, sustainability issues have kept the supervisory boards of listed companies somewhat busier than their counterparts at unlisted companies (92 per cent versus 79 per cent), while digitalisation is an almost equally common consideration at both listed and unlisted companies (83 per cent versus 84 per cent).

Because crises around the world are still ongoing, geopolitical instability also continues to loom over supervisory boards' agendas.

In the respondents' order of priority, this concern currently ranks third and rose slightly in importance compared to last year (82 per cent versus 77 per cent).

Overall, the three top issues for the work done by supervisory boards (sustainability/ESG, digitalisation and geopolitical instability) are equally relevant, and the differences in their weighting are marginal.

A. .Topics and agendas

The 2023 supervisory board agenda The subject of sustainability is growing into an ever more important competitive aspect for commercial enterprises.

And the ESG criteria figure centrally in that development.

In light of increasingly more stringent environmental laws and compliance and quality directives, but also considering companies' own ethical objectives, it is hardly astonishing that those factors are also impacting supervisory boards' agendas.

Eighty-five per cent of the super- visory board members we surveyed consider the subject of ESG and the transformation of their companies towards more sustainability the central matters on their agendas.

What subjects are defining your supervisory board's agenda in 2023?

ESG and sustainability Digital transformation Geopolitical instability Compliance Supply chains RMS and ICS effectiveness Succession planning Management/supervisory board remuneration Diversity Co-determination n very relevant n relevant n neutral n hardly relevant n not relevant n listed n unlisted Importance of the subjects (figures are in %)

What subjects have been on your agenda in particular in 2023 (compared to 2022)?

This year, for the very first time, our study asked supervisory board members whether they thought their internal control systems (ICS) and risk management systems (RMS) were effective.

Sixty-eight per cent of respondents said that they were.

The German Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity introduced the requirement that management boards of publicly traded companies must implement adequate and effective ICS and RMS.

The 2022 update of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) urges also taking sustainability aspects into consideration when complying with that requirement and has formulated tighter disclosure rules.

It is therefore unsurprising that this subject is also highly significant in the work supervisory boards do (with 74 per cent of the surveyed officers of listed companies and 64 per cent of those from unlisted companies saying so).

This was followed by succession planning (55 per cent), management board and supervi- sory board remuneration (44 per cent), diversity (43 per cent) and co-determination (17 per cent), some of which trail the one before it by a considerable margin.

In this regard as well, the order of the priorities is different at listed and unlisted com- panies.

Succession planning is given somewhat higher priority by the supervisory board members of publicly traded companies (63 per cent) than by their counterparts at unlisted companies (51 per cent).

The difference between listed and unlisted companies is greater with regard to manage- ment board and supervisory board remuneration."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2023,"The difference between listed and unlisted companies is greater with regard to manage- ment board and supervisory board remuneration.

According to 52 per cent of the respon- dents from listed companies, this is a far more established topic there than on the super- visory boards of unlisted companies (38 per cent).

Differences between the respondent groups can also be seen in their opinions regarding diversity.

Forty-seven per cent of the surveyed officers of listed companies reported having this subject on their agendas, while only 37 per cent of the respondents from unlisted companies said the same.

Distinct differences between the respondent groups are also apparent on the subject of co determination.

Survey responses are showing a consistent trend in this respect: like last year, unlisted companies considered co-determination to be far more preoccupying than publicly traded companies did (40 per cent versus 21 per cent in 2023 and 25 per cent versus 9 per cent in 2022, respectively).

This difference may be due to the fact that co-determination is enshrined at listed companies and tends to be part of the routine.

Supply chains have remained just as relevant in 2023.

Even though supply chains are now more stable again and, accordingly, the subject's significance has lessened margi- nally compared to last year (70 per cent of respondents calling them relevant in 2023 versus 79 per cent in 2022), they continue to preoccupy supervisory boards because of bottlenecks and the changes in energy prices influenced by unremitting inflation.

The entry into force of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains at the beginning of this year and the associated compliance measures have made the subject even more relevant.

The supervisory board members of both listed and unlis- ted companies deem this topic to be important to almost the same degree (71 per cent versus 69 per cent).

A greater disparity becomes apparent between the two respondent groups when it comes to compliance, which has been dominating the agenda of listed companies' supervisory boards to a far greater degree (83 per cent) than it has for their counterparts at unlisted companies (66 per cent).

ESG and sustainability Digital transformation Geopolitical instability Compliance Supply chains Succession planning Management/supervisory board remuneration Diversity Co-determination 10 11 B. .Supervisory boards' skills and expertise profiles With the revised version of the GCGC (dated 28 April 2022), the government commission responsible for the Code set out stricter requirements for supervisory boards' skills and ex- pertise profiles.

By virtue of the German Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity, these profiles have additionally gained new meaning.

Financial expertise constitutes a central aspect when providing holistic advice to and monitoring management boards.

1.

Financial expertise on supervisory boards The German Act to Strengthen Financial Market Integrity underscores the significance of financial know-how as a component of the skills and expertise profiles of listed companies' supervisory boards.

Since 1 July 2021, the Act requires public-interest entities to have at least two members on their supervisory boards with expertise in accounting or auditing.

Which is why it is not shocking that, like last year, most of the supervisory board members we surveyed (81 per cent overall) either agreed or strongly agreed that professional expe- rience as a CFO was important.

Besides that, obtaining the German public auditor (Wirt- schaftsprfer) qualification or working as one (66 per cent) and a membership on the audit committee of another company (65 per cent) were given nearly the same heavy weighting.

These were followed by long-term experience as an advisor in the field of auditing (61 per cent) and general expertise (59 per cent).

Working as a tax consultant was rated rather low as proof of expertise, the same as last year."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2023,"Working as a tax consultant was rated rather low as proof of expertise, the same as last year.

The supervisory board members of listed companies attached greater importance to pro- fessional experience as a CFO when gauging proof of financial expertise than their peers at unlisted companies did (82 per cent versus 77 per cent).

The same was true for obtaining public auditor qualification or working as one (68 per cent versus 60 per cent), just as it was for membership on the audit committee of another company (70 per cent versus 58 per cent) and long-term experience as an advisor in the field of auditing (64 per cent versus 54 per cent).

By contrast, acquiring expertise through continued education (63 per cent versus 54 per cent) and working as a tax consultant (44 per cent versus 36 per cent) were considered more relevant at unlisted companies regarding proof of expertise than at listed companies.

In your opinion, where did the relevant members on your supervisory board acquire the  necessary expertise?

n very relevant n relevant n neutral n hardly relevant n not relevant Professional experience as a CFO Work or qualification as a public auditor Membership on an audit com- mittee at another company Long-term experience as an advisor in the field of auditing Expertise in continuing  professional development Work as a tax consultant n listed n unlisted Importance of the subjects (figures are in %)

Sum of 'relevant' and 'very relevant' 60 41 23 22 21 14 21 25 42 39 38 28 6 12 17 14 16 19 3 3 6 6 13 13 6 12 5 10 6 18 82 68 70 64 54 36 77 60 58 54 63 44 12 13 3.

Supervisory boards' qualification matrices According to the GCGC's latest version, the implementation status of a supervisory board's skills and expertise profile is to be disclosed in corporate governance statements in the form of a qualification matrix.

Merely describing the profile will no longer satisfy these new guidelines.

Instead, the proficiencies and qualifications of the individual members of the supervisory board need to be presented in an overview table juxtaposing those with the know-how stipulated under the skills and expertise profile.

When supervisory board members were posed the question whether they had already had any experience in their companies with creating and publishing a qualification matrix, the majority (56 per cent) replied that they did.

At listed companies, that figure was even much higher at 76 per cent.

This meant, of course, that 44 per cent of respondents still lacked any experience with qualification matrices.

Have you already had any experience at your company with creating and publishing a qualification matrix?

2. Training and professional development for supervisory boards It is the duty of every member of a supervisory board under German stock corporation law to ensure that he or she has the required education and training.

The GCGC recommends that companies provide their supervisory board members with the appropriate support in this regard.

Currently, providing that assistance is relevant particularly when it comes to newer, and important, topics such as finances, sustainability and digitalisation.

When asked about how training and professional development were handled at their companies, 44 per cent of surveyed supervisory board members stated that they organised any such programme at their own responsibility and had to bear the costs themselves.

At unlisted entities, that number even rose to 56 per cent.

Some 29 per cent said that their company took care of the organisation as well as the costs.

At publicly traded companies, that figure jumped to 39 per cent.

A further 27 per cent stated that the costs were covered by their companies, but that they needed to organise any continuing education or training course themselves.

In this respect, the difference turns out not to be major between listed (30 per cent) and unlisted (27 per cent) companies."
Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2023,"In this respect, the difference turns out not to be major between listed (30 per cent) and unlisted (27 per cent) companies.

Sustainability expertise on supervisory boards Particular expertise is also being increasingly demanded of supervisory boards when it comes to sustainability.

This new importance follows from the amended preamble of the GCGC, in which the Code commission emphasises the impact that corporates have on peo- ple and the environment.

The preamble makes clear that that impact is to be taken into account by management and supervisory boards in their companies' leadership, monitoring and enterprise strategy pursued in the company's best interests.

Accordingly, the Code's new recommendations provide that supervisory boards' skills and expertise profiles also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues relevant to the enterprise.

While just a narrow majority (51 per cent) of those surveyed last year believed that their companies met this criterion, a clear majority (69 per cent) said the same this year.

That number spikes to 82 per cent at publicly traded entities.

According to the guidelines of the German Corporate Governance Code, supervisory boards should have expertise on sustainability.

Does your company already meet this requirement?

When asked by whom or how the qualification matrix was prepared and made, the lar- gest percentage of the surveyed supervisory board members (42 per cent) replied that their matrix was created based on a self-assessment, followed closely (41 per cent) by the entire supervisory board contributing.

In near equal measure, the supervisory board members responded that their qualification matrix was prepared and put together either by the super- visory board chairman or in a committee, 32 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.

Fifteen per cent of respondents stated that their qualification matrix was drawn up elsewhere within the company.

Who on the supervisory board prepares and makes the qualification matrix and how?

no 31% yes 69% 16 17 5.

Meeting the sustainability expertise requirements Our study shows that sustainability expertise requirements are being addressed in entirely different ways.

Like last year, the surveyed supervisory board members view training and seminars as the means of choice to fulfil the requirement for this particular ESG expertise.

Unlike in 2022, when training and seminars were given greater weight, this year just as many respondents look to board members with a professional background in this area (each category receiving positive responses from 83 per cent of those surveyed).

By contrast, 64 per cent of supervisory board members would call on the expertise of consultants, or are already doing so.

Minor importance however is still given to an academic background when it comes to choosing a supervisory board member with expertise on sustainability (47 per cent), the same as setting up an ESG committee or appointing an individual to oversee ESG matters (43 per cent).

How does your supervisory board intend to address fulfilling the sustainability expertise re- quirements in the future, or how does your supervisory board meet the requirements already?

Assessing the importance of an aptitude for sustainability The following results of our survey underscore the increased importance of sustainability for the work supervisory boards do.

A clear majority of those surveyed (71 per cent) agreed that the importance of an aptitude for sustainability topics on supervisory boards had risen in the past year.

That assessment was shared by the supervisory board members of listed and unlisted companies to virtually the same degree at 70 per cent and 71 per cent, respec- tively.

Another 27 per cent considered the importance unchanged, and only 1 per cent of the surveyed supervisory board members believed that sustainability aptitude had become less important for their work in the previous 12 months.

Has your assessment of the importance of sustainability aptitude for the work your supervisory board does changed in the last twelve months or has it remained the same and why?

The supervisory board office Expanding obligations and requirements due to stricter regulations and the growing com- plexity of responsibilities are increasingly putting supervisory board members in a tight spot to organise their work in such a way that they can fulfil their responsibilities.

One way to address these challenges is to set up a supervisory board office.

Depending on a supervisory board's responsibilities, its office can assist both it and the management board in providing information to the supervisory board members or function as the liaison between the two corporate bodies.

According to our survey however, this approach is not yet very widespread.

One reason for this may be the lack of awareness of the advantages of such an office.

A clear majority of the supervisory board members we surveyed responded with 'no' (67 per cent) to the question of whether or not there was a distinct supervisory board office at their company.

Fifty-six per cent of those answers came from listed companies.

How is the supervisory board at your company organised?

Is there a distinct supervisory board office?

2.

Services performed by supervisory board offices When asked about the services that their supervisory board office performed, respondents stated that logistical support (92 per cent) and minute taking (82 per cent) counted among the main tasks.

By a fairly considerable margin, those tasks were trailed by 'assisting with the supervisory board's reporting' (60 per cent), 'assisting with certification and professional development' (43 per cent) and 'advising supervisory board members on technical matters' (21 per cent).

What services are performed by the supervisory board office at your company?

Hengeler Mueller,Supervisory Board Survey 2023,"What services are performed by the supervisory board office at your company?

A supervisory board budget The activities performed by supervisory boards entail a wide range of costs and expenses, for which there is no explicit rule, certainly not of a statutory nature, governing their classi- fication.

Because of that, the importance of a distinct budget has risen in the last few years as supervisory boards' responsibilities have expanded.

The reason: more obligations and re- quirements have also meant greater expenditure.

Our study shows however that the majority of supervisory boards surveyed (76 per cent) do not have their own budget.

This is equally true for both listed and unlisted companies (76 per cent and 78 per cent, respectively).

Does the supervisory board at your company have its own budget?

3. Responsibility for the organisation of the supervisory board With regard to the responsibility for their supervisory board's organisation, a clear majority of respondents (61 per cent) stated that this rested with the management board.

Of those responses, 63 per cent came from the members of listed companies' supervisory boards and 58 per cent from their counterparts at unlisted companies.

Thirty-eight per cent said that their supervisory board itself was in charge of its own organisation.

Only 2 per cent of the surveyed supervisory board members responded that an external service provider was taking care of the organisation.

yes 24% n the management board  n the supervisory board  n an external service provider listed unlisted 20% 40% 60% 80% 38% 2% 61% 22 23 5.

Importance of nomination committees The GCGC recommends that listed companies in particular institute nomination committees that are in charge of preselecting candidates for their supervisory boards.

That committee, according to the GCGC, should ensure that the preselection process is efficient, transparent and confidential.

Even though finding competent people to fill supervisory boards has be- come increasingly challenging in light of additional qualification requirements, the import- ance of nomination committees in the work supervisory boards do has not risen in the last few years however.

An obvious majority (71 per cent) of the supervisory board members surveyed did not attach any increased relevance to nomination committees.

Fifty-eight per cent of those respondents came from listed entities.

Has the importance of the nomination committee at your company grown?

6. Nomination committees' remuneration Remuneration for serving on a nomination committee is an aspect handled in very different ways.

Notable differences are apparent between listed and unlisted companies.

Forty-se- ven per cent of the supervisory board members surveyed said that the members of their nomination committee were not remunerated.

At unlisted companies, that figure is even higher at 59 per cent.

On the other hand, 32 per cent responded that the remuneration for serving on this committee was currently comparable to that for being a member of other committees.

The figures here also showed that listed companies tend to be more willing (41 per cent) to remunerate their nomination committee members.

Another 20 per cent stated that remuneration was given exclusively in the form of an attendance fee, and just 2 per cent said that remuneration was paid only if a certain minimum number of meetings took place in a calendar year.

yes 29% 24 25 D. .Supervisory board efficiency Professionalising supervisory boards also encompasses the regular review of their operations and decision-making processes.

The aim behind this is to bring about a lasting improvement in company supervision.

The GCGC also espouses this goal.

1. Frequency of reviewing supervisory board operations and  decision-making processes Compared to last year, the percentage of surveyed supervisory board members dropped notice- ably who stated that their corporate body is reviewed regularly on an institutionalised basis: 46 per cent in 2023 versus 63 per cent in 2022.

Thirty-one per cent of supervisory board members replied that such a review occurred only irregularly or on an ad hoc basis.

No such evaluation of the board occurs with another 12 per cent of respondents.

The reason for this may be that in many cases a self assessment of the supervisory board had just taken place according to the relevant company's chosen cycle.

Conducting self assessments too frequently involves the risk of them taking on a routine character and the quality of their findings not being entirely meaningful, thereby reducing their efficacy..

How regularly does your supervisory board review its operations and decision-making  processes?

Like in 2022 previously, major differences appeared between listed and unlisted companies with regard to efficiency reviews.

For example, according to the responses from the surveyed supervisory board members, assessing the work and decision-making processes of supervisory boards is institutionalised at 64 per cent of listed companies, while at unlisted companies it is only 28 per cent.

Further, noticeably more respondents from unlisted companies (38 per cent) than listed companies (24 per cent) stated that irregular evaluations were conducted at their companies.

Considering that the GCGC encourages regular efficiency evaluations, it is scarcely surprising that the degree of institutionalisation of such reviews was distinctly higher at listed companies again this year.

2. Performing efficiency evaluations on supervisory boards In principle, there are many ways that a supervisory board can evaluate its efficiency.

Sixty- seven per cent of surveyed supervisory board members stated that their reviews were conduc- ted without external assistance (64 per cent at listed and 71 per cent at unlisted companies).

The remainder indicated that their evaluations were in fact performed with external assistance or sometimes with and sometimes without (16 per cent and 17 per cent respectively).

The added value of efficiency reviews on supervisory boards Seventy-two per cent of the supervisory board members surveyed attest to the (high) import- ance of efficiency reviews.

One-fifth (21 per cent) found them neither important nor unimport- ant or attached little importance to them.

Two per cent even view them as having no added value whatsoever.

Supervisory board members conducting a self-evaluation, in many cases with external support, constitutes a relatively simple and good way of gauging opinions on the quality and the efficiency of the work performed by supervisory boards directly.

Every company answers the question differently, however, how to approach such assessments.

How do you rate the added value of your supervisory board's efficiency reviews?

E. .Summary

After three challenging years in which especially the coronavirus pandemic and managing the effects resulting from it were at the top of supervisory boards' agendas, this year's sur- vey shows once again that the work being done by supervisory boards is clearly orientated towards issues relating to the future.

Sustainability/ESG as well as digitalisation are the issues of the hour and  to little surprise  have no. 1 priority on agendas.

Without a doubt, financial expertise continues to dominate on supervisory boards and will certainly remain one of the core skills needed going forward.

But, with a view to positio- ning companies for the future, obligations and expectations are growing considerably in the fields of sustainability and ESG in particular.

And, in a majority of cases, the expertise of supervisory board members is already adapted to meet these demands.

Consequently however, the focus of the work supervisory boards do is shifting, which has inevitably led to new challenges in their operations and decision-making processes.

In addition, the 2022 revision of the GCGC underlines the expanded requirements for the skills and expertise profiles of supervisory boards.

The changes are of great practical rele- vance and have had a direct impact on the makeup of supervisory boards.

Hence coming up with and publishing a commensurate qualification matrix in order to comply with the skills and expertise profile has taken on decisive importance.

By contrast, additional professionalisation aspects such as the regular assessment of supervisory boards' operations and decision-making processes have currently dropped in priority somewhat, even though those supervisory boards that do conduct efficiency evaluations deem them highly important.

The fact that these reviews are only belatedly finding their way onto supervisory boards' agendas may also have to do with the constant increase in the workload and effort required of supervisory boards to monitor their ma- nagement boards.

Performing mandatory responsibilities and obligations and handling obviously important issues thus have utmost priority.

Mastering this balancing act will certainly remain one of the greatest challenges for supervisory boards.
