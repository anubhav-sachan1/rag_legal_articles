Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Michael Wolitzer Quoted in Law.com and FundFire on New SEC Private Funds Rules,"Michael Wolitzer, Head of the Firm’s Investment Funds Practice, was quoted in a Law.com article titled, “'They Didn't Blow Up the World': Big Law Reacts to New SEC Fund Rules,” and a FundFire article titled, “Hedge Funds Zero In on Side Letters, Preferential Treatment with SEC Private Funds Rule,” which highlighted the SEC’s newly adopted substantial rules for private equity firms and hedge funds.

When discussing the rules with Law.com , Michael noted that there “clearly was a pullback from the initial proposal” and that “this is now more of a disclosure and reporting statute with some substantive regulation changes.”

Michael additionally stated that challenges are to be expected.

“The most substantive regulations did go away, but there is still a lot here that the industry finds concerning.

The challenge could come in the form of saying the SEC did not do an adequate economic analysis or that they are exceeding their authority,” he added.

When speaking with FundFire, he indicated that many areas, especially side letters, will require a lot of thought to determine how firms will manage those.

When describing the important role opportunistic funds play in a more challenging real estate market, Sas explained that, “anytime there's a schism in terms of a dislocation in the market, the opportunistic funds that are well-capitalized do well because they're able to step in and really get assets at distressed levels, as opposed to when things are just ticking along at extremely high valuations.”

Jason added that more real estate firms are forming opportunistic credit funds, noting, “I think you'll see continued activity in real estate credit, including acquisition of loan books from failed banks.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Release of Pro Bono Client Wrongfully Sentenced to Life Imprisonment,"Together with the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Southern District of Mississippi, Simpson Thacher represented a 51-year-old Black individual who was erroneously sentenced to life in prison under the federal “three strikes” law based on purse snatchings that occurred when he was seventeen years old.

These prior convictions, which involved conduct that took place in a three-week period, should have only counted as one strike—not two as required to trigger the application of the law.

Our client was originally sentenced to six consecutive life sentences for three bank robbery convictions and three stacked convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which imposes additional punishment for the use of a firearm during a crime of violence.

The team moved for a sentence reduction under the compassionate release provisions of the First Step Act on the grounds that the sentencing error and the non-retroactive changes to § 924(c)’s penalties for stacked convictions constituted extraordinary and compelling reasons for a sentence reduction.

On August 9, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi granted our client’s motion and reduced his sentence to 24 years and one day.

Because our client had already served more than two decades in prison and had accrued good time credit, he was released from prison the following day.

In a remarkable opinion, the court acknowledged that it had “clearly erred.”

The court stated that its “imposition of life sentences on the bank robbery convictions vastly exceeded both the statutory maximum sentence and the applicable guideline range and was an illegal sentence.”

The court further stated that its “sentence on the § 924(c) convictions also substantially exceeded [our client’s] correct sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines.”

The court found that “these facts are extraordinary and compelling reasons for granting [our client] relief from the multiple life sentences which the court erroneously ordered.”

The court separately found that the “disparity” between the 60-year sentence he should have received for his § 924(c) convictions under the law in effect at the time of sentencing and the 24-year sentence he would receive today for those same convictions also “constitutes an ‘extraordinary and compelling reason’ to modify [his] sentence.”

In granting our client’s motion for compassionate release, the court credited his “genuine remorse” and “remarkable efforts at rehabilitation.”

The court found it significant that although he had “no prospect of release from incarceration,” he “obtained his GED, completed extensive prison course work, paid several thousand dollars in restitution, and positively impacted the lives of individuals with whom he [came] in contact” during his time in prison.

Our client was welcomed home by his family and looks forward to rebuilding his life.

The case received media coverage by publications including Law360 .

Lauren explained that while it is not currently required, many firms already obtain fairness opinions in secondary deals to mitigate inherent conflicts, noting “This rule is not going to necessarily impact all GPs running GP-led processes, but it will certainly impact those GPs that were not planning to get a fairness option.”

HSBC appealed the Supreme Court’s decision to the Appellate Division, First Department, which affirmed the dismissal in November 2019, and the Court of Appeals granted leave to appeal.

The Court of Appeals decision noted that HSBC, as Trustee, could not avail itself of CPLR 205(a) because the original action was initially filed by different plaintiffs, in this case certificateholders who lacked standing to do so, and because the complaint subsequently filed by the RMBS trustee in the prior action was untimely.

In its decision, the Court reiterated its long held position that “the savings statute [CPLR 205(a)]

‘applies only where the second action is brought by the same plaintiff’ or an estate representative.”

The Court ultimately reaffirmed that “HSBC is not ‘the plaintiff’ in the prior action and the benefit of CPLR 205(a) is unavailable to save its untimely complaint.”

Antonio explained that signs of divergence between the CMA and the Commission have become more visible in the post-Brexit landscape, noting that, before the U.K. left the EU, the agencies never reviewed a merger at the same time because it either had an EU dimension so was examined by the Commission or was U.K.-only so was left to the CMA.

He further noted that while most of the recent divergence has centered around remedies, this case shows that the CMA is comfortable reaching a different final outcome altogether.

“We will soon have another data point to measure the degree of EU/UK divergence – so watch this space,” he said.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,David Blass Quoted in Law360 Article on SEC’s Proposed Rules Related to Form PF,"Corporate Partner David Blass was quoted extensively in a Law360 article titled “SEC's Onerous Form PF Proposal Puts PE Firms On Notice.”

The article offers an overview of newly-proposed rules from the SEC related to Form PF, including those that would require PE funds to make the filing within one business day of certain triggering events.

David explained that, “It feels like it sets up firms for potential compliance pitfalls more than it provides a reasonable method to inform the [SEC] and its staff of important events,” posing as an example the challenge firms could face, given the severely shortened reporting timelines, if a key employee happens to be out on the day a filing is required.

He suggested that the agency’s goals might instead be better achieved through other means, such as requiring fund managers to disclose reportable information in a “prompt” Form ADV filing or amendment.

“That would be a more logical place to require that disclosure rather than the Form PF, and that kind of timing makes more sense, too,” he said.

Eric further identified that increased activity in the IPO market and the sense that the Federal Reserve may soon stabilize its rate increases may indicate a pickup in deal activity in the months to come.

The article, part one of a two-part series, explored the flexible investment opportunities afforded by Single Investor Funds (SIFs), factors associated with inequitable allocation practices between SIFs and commingled funds and steps sponsors can take to mitigate those risks.

When discussing the spectrum of how much authority investors can exercise over SIF investments, Peter noted that those where they have the right to review and veto investment opportunities function more like deal-by-deal funds and share similar uncertainty risk.

“If each SIF has the ability to decide for itself whether it’s going to do a deal, then that really raises issues with a manager’s ability to commit to a deal in the first place,” he explained.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,"The Firm, ACLU and ACLU-MS Secure Order Mandating Mosque Approval in Anti-Bias Case","In a complete victory for its clients, Simpson Thacher, the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi secured a consent decree on January 3, 2022, mandating the approval of the construction of a mosque in Horn Lake, Mississippi.

The consent decree resolves a federal lawsuit, Abraham House of God v. City of Horn Lake, filed against Horn Lake officials who unlawfully denied zoning approval for the proposed mosque due to anti-Muslim bias.

Under the terms of the consent decree, the City of Horn Lake and the other Defendants have agreed to approve plans to permit construction of the first-ever mosque in DeSoto County,

Mississippi. ACLU, ACLU-MS and Simpson Thacher filed the federal lawsuit on November 3, 2021, on behalf of the mosque and its founders, noting that the City’s actions violated the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which provides heightened protections for houses of worship in zoning proceedings, and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The complaint asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi to issue an injunction allowing construction of the mosque.

Under the consent decree, in addition to approving the mosque’s site plan, which they previously rejected, Horn Lake officials must also act quickly in the future to address any other permitting and building-related matters.

The order also provides that the Defendants will pay Plaintiffs $25,000 for expenses incurred in connection with the delay in construction and the initial appeal of the denial of the mosque-site application.

Defendants must also separately pay for Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs associated with the federal lawsuit.

The federal district court will have continuing jurisdiction over the action for a period of five years to facilitate the enforcement of the consent decree.

The article previewed the upcoming trial for the DOJ’s challenge to the Spectrum Brands/Assa Abloy merger and examined how the agency has recently demonstrated less willingness to discuss remedies with merging parties and taken a tougher stance on merger settlements, resulting in companies turning to litigating-the-fix cases.

Preston provided insights on the issues that can arise surrounding these types of cases, raising the question: “Whose job is it to prove the impact of the divestiture?

The parties’ position is that the government must show, as part of their prima facie case, that the merger would harm competition, even taking the divestiture into account.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Jason Glover Quoted in Private Equity International on Growth of the Mega-Funds Market,"Jason Glover, Head of Simpson Thacher’s London Funds Practice, was quoted extensively in an article titled, “Fund formation in the era of mega-funds,” which was published by Private Equity International.

The article addressed how factors including growing fund sizes and LP demands are putting pressure on fundraising timelines and leading to an increasingly challenging negotiation process for advisors.

Jason explained that “There are a lot of investors that historically had a lot of power as significant investors in funds, and now find that changing,” as “mega-funds are growing at a faster rate than LPs are growing the size of their commitments.”

He further noted that fundraising timelines are lengthening as a result of “newer investor types, such as private wealth managers,” that take longer to raise their own capital “in addition to time needed to overcome regulatory hurdles.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Railroad Commission of Texas Issues Financing Order,"Simpson Thacher advised the Railroad Commission of Texas in connection with the issuance of a Financing Order that authorizes the securitization of approximately $3.4 billion of extraordinary gas costs in connection with Winter Storm Uri.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Funds Partners Quoted in Two PEI Articles on Fundraising Trends,"Michael Wolitzer, Head of the Firm’s Investment Funds Practice, and Partner Deborah Gruen were quoted in an article titled, “GPs get creative amid slow fundraising,” which was published by Private Equity International and detailed key trends in fundraising terms from industry practitioners in 2023.

Michael noted that prewired conflicts provisions that enabled GPs to potentially forgo limited partner advisory committee approval are likely to see some changes, as will management fee discounts.

Deborah enumerated ways that GPs have been addressing fundraising extensions, explaining “There’s a trend towards rolling closing, which means that you are just continuing to close as soon as LPs are done.”

She added that another way to extend the fundraising period is to adjust the date from which the period starts so it starts from the effective date when GPs turn on the fund.

With reference to initial closing discounts, Deborah further noted that there are rewards for loyalty for interest in multiple funds.

Michael was additionally quoted in a Private Equity International Article titled, “Oversubscription in a downturn,” which explored how one-and-done closes and significantly oversubscribed funds will no longer be the norm in today’s fundraising environment.

Michael explained the most common definition for ‘oversubscription,’ explaining that “There’s often a cap in the terms of the fund agreement that says you can’t raise more than X without LP consent.”

He further added that “When the GP says its oversubscribed, it is saying that it received subscriptions in excess of that amount.”

The article, which is the first of a two-part series on secondaries funds, explored the process of documenting a secondaries fund and provided details surrounding how the terms differ between other types of PE funds as well as between LP stakes and GP-led transactions.

Lauren provided insights on the timeline of a secondaries fund, the capital contribution obligations of investors, what sort of clawback provisions are typically included and some of the confidentiality restrictions that can differ from a buyout fund.

She also explained the difference in side letters for LP stakes and GP-led transactions.

“A lead investor in a GP‑led continuation fund is often investing up to hundreds of millions of dollars and negotiating the relevant documents directly with the GP.

The GP needs the lead investors, as opposed to the LP transfer scenario where the secondaries fund needs the GP’s consent,” Lauren said, noting, “It’s a completely different dynamic than a typical LP transfer.

It’s very similar to a primary fund investment with respect to the side letter process.”

John explained that the ruling could impact the DOJ’s criminal enforcement efforts far beyond bid-rigging matters and may affect all potential antitrust conspiracies in which companies have “hybrid” relationships.

“The per se rule continues to be chipped away at and there's less and less that the department can actually prosecute as a per se matter,” he said.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Appeal Securing Veteran’s Disability Benefits,"Simpson Thacher successfully obtained a decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) overturning a denial of a portion of disability benefits for a veteran who had served both in the Army and the Army Reserve for a total of 17 years.

The Army veteran suffered a service-related injury leaving him with significant lumbar and cervical spine injuries.

Following his discharge in 2000, the veteran was granted disability benefits in 2001 for the lumbar injury, but despite relying on the same evidence to support the lumbar injury, the VA denied benefits for the cervical injuries.

In 2004, based on the substantially similar evidence provided in 2000, the VA finally granted disability status recognizing the veteran’s cervical spine injuries, but would not amend his discharge status to reflect the total disability severity and would not issue retroactive payments to cover the difference in benefits for the preceding four years.

After the veteran’s 20 year fight with the VA to appeal that decision, Simpson Thacher filed an appeal of Clear and Unmistakable Error seeking to overturn the VA’s original 2001 decision, which had denied the veteran the cervical spine injury disability benefits.

Despite an initial denial, the Firm filed a subsequent request for a Higher Level Review of the Clear and Unmistakable Error appeal, which was granted.

As a result of the Firm’s success in overturning the VA’s 2001 decision, the veteran will not only receive retroactive payments covering 2000 to 2004, but this will now enable the veteran to petition to change his discharge status such that he would become eligible for additional disability retirement benefits that have been withheld for more than 20 years.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Todd Crider Quoted in Report on 2023 M&A Trends and Outlook in Latin America,"Todd Crider, Head of the Firm’s Latin America Practice, was featured in a recent report titled, “In An Uncertain World, Latam M&A Is On The Rise,” based on data from a global survey on M&A in Latin America conducted by KPMG and produced in partnership with FT Longitude .

The report discusses the outlook on M&A in Latin America in 2023 and examines trends and data from a survey of 400 business leaders who have been involved in M&A investments in the region.

When commenting on companies and investors taking advantage of the economic landscape, Todd indicated that many non-Latin American companies are looking to invest into the region, and many local companies are looking outside of the region.

“A lot of companies within Latin America are looking to diversify outside of the region, because many are overly invested in their home countries, which leaves them more exposed to political or sovereign risk.

These shifts have made them wake up, pay attention to that, and explore potential changes to their strategy,” he explained. 

Todd’s quotes were also included in a Law.com International story highlighting the report.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Lynn Neuner Quoted in Law360 on Potential Codification of Remote Commercial Trials,"Lynn Neuner, Global Co-Chair of the Firm’s Litigation Department, was quoted extensively in a Law360 Pulse article titled, “NY Mulls Codifying Power To Order Remote Commercial Trials.”

The article detailed a proposed amendment that would change the consent requirement for remote proceedings in New York commercial courts even when litigants refuse it, in a change that could streamline trials and further enhance the state’s status as a preferred legal venue for commercial disputes.

Since the height of the pandemic in 2020, several proceedings in the Commercial Division began to shift to remote proceedings and court decisions have clarified that Commercial Division judges have the authority to order virtual hearings even if parties do not consent.

Lynn noted that this case law has made it “very clear to litigants that they should not bother contesting whether the Commercial Division has the authority to do this, because they do.”

Lynn described the efficacy of remote trials as an additional tool to ensure cases progress in a timely manner, saying that “[t]he fact of the matter is, the technology is very good.

It’s not a perfect replica of being in person.

But that being said, it's pretty fair as a substitute.""

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Todd Crider Speaks at UN-Sponsored Event on the Human Right to Rivers and the Rights of Nature,"Todd Crider, Head of the Firm’s Latin America Practice, spoke on March 24, 2022 at the Permanent International Seminar sponsored by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Due Process of Law Foundation to facilitate a regional dialogue as to rights to water in Mexico and Latin America, especially in relation to indigenous peoples.

Todd addressed the “Rights of Rivers and Rights of Nature.”

His contribution to the permanent seminar was based on the report co-authored by the Cyrus Vance Center for International Justice on the “Rights of Rivers: a global survey of the rapidly developing Rights of Nature jurisprudence pertaining to rivers”. 

The Rights of Nature is an emerging area of law that departs from conceptions of nature as property or in relation to its utility to human beings, and instead sees nature as a separate and legally protected value, with standing (through organizations or people) and intrinsically deserving protection.

This emerging area of law derives from multiple influences, and most directly from conceptions of nature common to indigenous peoples that place humanity as part of nature, such that many of the countries in which the Rights of Nature are most recognized are countries with large populations, and influences, of indigenous peoples, such as Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and New Zealand.

The Permanent International Seminar is an international space for dialogue and reflection on the human right to water and its effective validity in Mexico, taking into account current national and international standards, advances on the subject in comparative law and the interrelation of this right with other fundamental rights of indigenous communities such as self-determination or prior consultation."

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Martin Bell Quoted in Law360 and HR Magazine on SCOTUS Job Bias Case,"Litigation Partner Martin Bell was quoted in a Law360 article titled, “4 Highlights From High Court Arguments Over Job Bias Test,” and HR Magazine articles titled, “Supreme Court Analyzes Discrimination Law in Job Transfer Case” and “Job Transfer Case May Implicate IE&D Programs,” which discussed the U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments for the job bias case Muldrow v. City of St. Louis .

When discussing the arguments, Martin observed that the justices appeared to be considering a Title VII that would cover a wider range of discrimination and said that broadening Title VII might make way for more of these types of suits, even if damages aren't available.

He went on to further note, “One can imagine that a ruling in favor of expanding Title VII here might be a boon for anti-DEI movement-focused organizations that have been motivated solely by steadily compiling favorable legal rulings.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Rajib Chanda Quoted in BoardIQ on Valuation Considerations for Alternative Asset Classes in ’40 Act Funds,"Corporate Partner Rajib Chanda was quoted in an article in BoardIQ, a Financial Times publication, titled, “Alternatives Growth Creates Headache for Boards Around Valuation.”

The article discussed how the growth of asset classes such as private equity, real estate and credit in ’40 Act funds may require boards to consider valuation issues more carefully, particularly in the wake of the SEC’s Fair Valuation Rule that recently went into effect and in the context of growing economic uncertainty.

With reference to valuation challenges, which can have significant implications for how ‘40 Act alternatives offerings are structured, Rajib explained that “boards are definitely very focused on it, particularly the accuracy of NAV for any period more frequent than independent review of the underlying assets.”

He added that, “Valuation is an art, not a science, so most people use third-party valuation agents on a quarterly basis, then will value inter-quarter for any events that may affect value, depending on the asset class.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,"Simpson Thacher Wins Largest Jury Verdict in History for Mail Withholding, Proving Multiple Constitutional Violations","On September 20, a jury found that our pro bono client’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated and awarded $475,000 for the withholding of mail.

This was the largest verdict of its kind and nearly 50 times larger than any previous award for withholding mail.

In a three-day jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, Simpson Thacher successfully proved that a prison worker violated our pro bono client’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by unlawfully withholding his mail for nearly nine months in 2007 and 2008.

Sending and receiving mail, and being able to access the courts, are First and Fourteenth Amendment rights afforded by the Constitution, even to those who are incarcerated.

The jury agreed with the Firm’s arguments that our client’s Constitutional rights were violated three different ways during the nearly nine months his mail was illegally withheld.

That withholding caused our client to miss letters setting critical court deadlines to appeal and assert his innocence in his underlying conviction.

Worse, he missed family letters letting him know his father was sick and dying, and that he should try to call home one last time.

His father died four days before our client’s long-delayed mail was finally delivered.  

Moved by our client’s story, the jury decided to award $475,000, providing some recompense for the time he lost.

This win follows the Firm’s role in securing our client’s release from prison in December 2022, after persuading the court to reduce his sentence by over 30 years.

“If this process does anything, it may actually help companies think about how to structure a deal in a way that satisfies them if they do find a problem,” he said.

He further noted that the policy shift may have a larger impact on prosecutions of the False Claims Act and other forms of fraud than it will on antitrust enforcement.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Patrick Ryan and Matt Einbinder Quoted in The Deal on the Evolution of the Direct Lending Market,"Partners Patrick Ryan and Matt Einbinder were quoted in The Deal in an article titled, “Direct Lenders Dial Up Big Deals.”

Patrick explained how direct lending grew out of the term B loan market that emerged in the 1990s.

He added that term B loans, which typically carry a higher interest rate than traditional bank debt, appeal to investors willing to trade amortization and certain terms for a higher return.

Patrick further described that private credit funds developed out of the institutional loan market as financial sponsors saw an opportunity to expand into private credit.

Matt noted that credit funds have also adjusted their orientation to the market, stating that while some borrowers focus on issues of future control, “private lenders are also prioritizing the development of lending relationships and often emphasize issues such as pricing, willingness to extend capital, confidentiality and other primary commercial terms.”

Leah told Reuters that while the final rules reduced the burden on companies to disclose emissions, they require information that will give investors an ""important window"" into companies' approach to climate risk.

She went on to note to Compliance Week that the final rule package “goes to great lengths” to clarify that only risks considered material would need to be disclosed, but that most 10-Ks don’t currently report information on climate-related risks that are material to companies’ financial conditions.

When discussing with Law360 how the SEC, California and EU climate disclosure frameworks may interact, she observed that there is a degree of uncertainty in how the three reporting regimes will mesh, since other implementing regulations are not fully in place and the reporting regimes do not currently have any substituted compliance.

When reflecting on the uptick in “litigate-the-fix” disputes, Sara explained that the agencies might be extending their authority when they have insisted that a divestiture fully restore any competitive intensity threatened by a transaction as opposed to barring only mergers that pose a “substantial” threat to competition as noted in Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Secures Reversal of Punitive Damages Award In Asbestos-Related Case,"On July 5, the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Second Appellate District, reversed a $3 million punitive damages award against Simpson Thacher client Whittaker, Clark & Daniels in the case Willie McNeal Jr. vs. Whittaker, Clark & Daniels.

The Plaintiff alleged that the Old Spice talcum powder he used in the 1970s partially caused his mesothelioma, and that Whittaker was the supplier of the talc in Old Spice that contained asbestos fibers.

In April of 2021, a Los Angeles County jury awarded Plaintiff $448,761 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages. 

Simpson Thacher was retained by Whittaker to prosecute the appeal of the punitive damages award.

In its decision, the Appeals Court agreed with Simpson Thacher and Whittaker that, “no one knew exposure to talcum powder could cause mesothelioma until 1994—years after plaintiff’s exposure to talc ended in 1980,” and “[m]edical or scientific developments years after plaintiff’s injury cannot establish defendant’s executives knew of ‘probable dangerous consequences’ of contaminated talc before plaintiff’s injury.”

The Court further found that “the evidence was insufficient to establish any officer, director or managing agent acted with the malice, oppression or fraud necessary for an award of punitive damages.”

As a result, the Court reversed the award of punitive damages.

The team received a “Shout Out” in The American Lawyer ’s “Litigator of the Week” coverage .

Martin explained that the prosecution used a more narrowly-focused strategy to keep the jury centered on the facts in this case in particular, rather than entertain the press and public’s want for new details related to the surrounding scandal.

“The goal is not to put on a show and answer the press or public’s lingering questions about this or that,” he said.

When commenting on the potential for reforms to include a mention of an “all-in” fee that shows the total cost of investing in a fund, David indicated that presenting fee information that way could send the wrong signal to investors, because doing so “has the potential to incentivize investments in less-traded funds.”

He goes on to explain that investors may perceive the overall cost as lower than for funds that trade more frequently and may select them over funds that are more appropriate for their investment goals.

She explained that “In many cases, the specific restrictions are similar to those passed by other states and are not actually the most stringent we’ve seen.

But collectively they constitute the most sweeping law targeting consideration of ESG factors in investment decisions.”

Leah further described how the law establishes “a new playbook” for other states, and how the biggest impact of the new law will be on state and local bond provisions, proxy voting and reporting.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Alan Cannon Quoted in Law.com International on Japanese Startups’ Growing Interest in Nasdaq IPOs,"Corporate Partner Alan Cannon was quoted in an article titled, “Japanese Tech Startups’ Nasdaq IPO Thirst Generates Deal Work for US Law Firms in Japan,” which was published by Law.com International.

The article discussed how Japanese startups are more frequently seeking out Nasdaq listings to potentially achieve higher valuations and face less stringent listing standards.

Alan explained that Japanese small to midsize companies are attracted to listing on the Nasdaq because it enables them to more easily anticipate if their IPO application will be approved.

“The challenge with the exchange process here [in Japan] is that it is a quality review, so if the exchange has reservations about something they essentially have the discretion to delay you indefinitely, whereas, primarily, the U.S. process is a disclosure-based process,” he said.

He further noted that, unlike the exchange in Japan, the SEC is not in a position to make value judgements about the riskiness of a business model.

Reflecting on this growing trend, Alan emphasized that the size of IPOs by Japanese growth enterprises is likely to increase, as bigger companies are considering potential listings on the Nasdaq.

Specifically, the suit alleges that over the past several years (both before and after HCA’s acquisition of Mission), Mission obtained a monopoly over inpatient services in Asheville to raise prices for both inpatient and outpatient care in the Asheville area and to monopolize other markets surrounding Asheville.

HCA and the other defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on October 14, 2021, and a reply to Plaintiffs’ opposition brief on January 13, 2022.

Oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss was held on April 27, 2022 and a supplemental hearing was held on August 17, 2022.

Following oral argument and a supplemental hearing, the Hon.

Mark A. Davis, Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases for the Superior Court Division of the State of North Carolina, granted the majority of the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss—including dismissing Plaintiffs’ statutory claims of monopoly acquisition, monopoly maintenance, monopoly leveraging, and attempted monopolization, as well as Plaintiffs’ claims of monopolization under the North Carolina Constitution.

The Firm also previously successfully represented HCA in defeat of Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and ultimate resolution of an antitrust suit involving wages paid to hospital nurses.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,David Blass Quoted in Private Funds CFO on FINRA Rule Proposal to Allow for Broker-Dealer Projections,"Partner David Blass was quoted in an article titled, “FINRA Proposal Might Ease Friction Between B-Ds, Fund Managers,” which was published by Private Funds CFO.

The article discussed a recent proposed rule change by FINRA to allow for broker-dealers to offer private placement “projections” to qualified purchasers or institutional investors, which is currently prohibited under rule 2210.

David noted that the rule as it currently stands “creates friction in the marketing process, because the fund manager is allowed to use these projections in their marketing materials and broker-dealers are not.”

He goes on to further state, “I think FINRA appreciates that, and I’m guessing they wanted to provide clarity and relief.

But I do think private equity firms will benefit from the clarity this rule provides, as well as the end of the prohibition on projections.”

Meaghan added that transparency is a continuing theme for the SEC, explaining that additional risk alerts may be released for new rules, but advisers should still ensure their policies and practices are up to date because there will be no grace period for compliance with new SEC rules once their compliance dates pass.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Second Dismissal of “Data Exposure” Class Action Against Ally,"On March 25, 2024, Simpson Thacher successfully obtained the complete dismissal – with prejudice – of a putative class action filed against clients Ally Financial, Inc. and Ally Bank (together, “Ally”) in the Southern District of New York.  

This is the second time that Simpson Thacher secured the Court’s dismissal of plaintiff’s complaint for failing to plead any injury.  

The suit was originally filed in August 2021 by an Ally customer who alleged that his online username and password had been exposed to certain third-parties with which Ally has business relationships.  

Simpson Thacher moved to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiff lacked any cognizable injury and thus had no standing to sue under Article III of the Constitution.  

The Court agreed, dismissing the complaint on August 2, 2022.  

On January 9, 2023, the plaintiff amended his complaint in an attempt to cure the deficiencies of the original complaint.  

Simpson Thacher again moved to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiff still failed to allege any constitutionally cognizable injury and thus still had no standing.  

Judge Nelson Román again agreed, noting that the plaintiff’s amended complaint failed to address many of Ally’s arguments and relied on the sort of “attenuated chain of possibilities” insufficient to establish an Article III injury.  

The Court therefore dismissed the amended complaint in its entirety, this time with prejudice.

The team received a “Shout Out” in The American Lawyer ’s “Litigator of the Week” coverage.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Secures Ninth Circuit Appellate Victory in Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation,"On March 7, 2022, Simpson Thacher client Micron Technologies (“Micron”) won an appellate victory when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed dismissal of antitrust claims brought by indirect purchasers of products containing the memory chip DRAM (“Plaintiffs”).

The appellate win stems from the Hon.

Jeffrey S. White of the Northern District of California’s September 3, 2019 dismissal of claims alleging a conspiracy between Micron and other DRAM manufacturers to inflate the price of DRAM by tacitly coordinating to limit its supply.

On October 28, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Firm subsequently moved to dismiss.

On November 24, 2020, Judge White again held that Plaintiffs had failed to “raise a reasonable inference of conspiracy in light of the possibility of conscious parallelism.”

The court consequently dismissed the federal antitrust claims and certain state law claims.

Plaintiffs then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

On March 7, 2022, a three-judge panel unanimously affirmed the lower court’s decision, finding that Plaintiffs’ allegations did not plausibly suggest the existence of a conspiracy through evidence of parallel business conduct.

“Plaintiffs’ allegations of parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action, combined with defendants’ criminal history from twenty years ago, do not provide a context suggesting unlawful agreement,” Circuit Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo wrote in the 23-page opinion.

The team received a “Shout Out” in The American Lawyer’s “Litigator of the Week” coverage .

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Appeal on Behalf of Female Student-Athletes in a Title IX Action,"On April 4, 2022, Simpson Thacher, in partnership with the ACLU of Hawaii and Legal Aid at Work, successfully won a pro bono appeal in a Title IX action on behalf of female student-athletes at Hawaii’s largest high school, James Campbell High School.

The Firm, along with the ACLU of Hawaii and Legal Aid at Work, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Hawaii Department of Education and the Oahu Interscholastic Association based on allegations of systemic discrimination and gender inequities for female student-athletes as well as retaliation against those student-athletes who advocated for equity.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Fifth Circuit Overturns Mississippi’s Felony Disenfranchisement Law,"On August 4, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a monumental decision in Hopkins v. Hosemann , overturning Mississippi’s criminal disenfranchisement laws.

The Court held that the law was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishment.”

The decision overturns Mississippi’s lifetime voting ban for people with disqualifying felony convictions who have completed their sentences and restores the right to vote for tens of thousands of Mississippians.

The Court noted that, “Mississippi stands as an outlier among its sister states, bucking a clear and consistent trend in our Nation against permanent disenfranchisement.”

The Court said, “Mississippi denies this precious right to a large class of its citizens, automatically, mechanically, and with no thought given to whether it is proportionate as punishment for an amorphous and partial list of crimes.”

In its decision, the panel of the Court, voting 2-1, ruled that, “By severing former offenders from the body politic forever, Section 241 [of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890] ensures that they will never be fully rehabilitated, continues to punish them beyond the term their culpability requires, and serves no protective function to society.

It is thus a cruel and unusual punishment.”

The Court ruled that Section 241 is unconstitutional and enjoined Mississippi’s Secretary of State from enforcing the provision against the plaintiffs and the class they represent.

Simpson Thacher and Southern Poverty Law Center are counsel to plaintiffs.

The class action lawsuit was filed on March 27, 2018.

The decision was highlighted by publications including The New York Times , Washington Post , Reuters here and here , Associated Press , MPB Think Radio’s Mississippi Edition , 16 WAPT News , ABC News , Bloomberg Law , Michigan Chronicle , Mississippi Today , Reckon , The Guardian , The Hill and The United Business Journal .

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Lauren King Quoted in The Wall Street Journal on Single-Asset Secondary Transactions,"Funds Partner Lauren King was quoted in a Wall Street Journal article titled “Third-Party Valuations Gain Traction in Single-Asset Secondary Transactions.”

The article examined the growing trend among private equity firms of selling small stakes in portfolio companies to other private equity firms before seeking to recapitalize those companies on the secondary market.

The deals can help a private equity firm to set a company’s valuation, which may then be used to price the asset in a separate secondary transaction.

Lauren explained that these types of transactions may also help alleviate investor concerns about potential valuation conflicts associated with single-asset secondary deals.

“These kinds of deals could be especially attractive for pension systems who are hypervigilant about conflicts and I would imagine they would welcome this external pricing of assets—a validation by a third party,” she said.

When commenting on climate disclosure regulations, Leah noted that U.S.-based companies should watch to see how the disclosure requirements play out with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive because “This regime will not only pull in global operators, but also trickle down to suppliers and other related vendors, requiring a much more granular reporting on a wider range of sustainability topics.”

On SEC enforcement priorities, Michael indicated that the regulator’s focus on off-channel communications may land squarely on registered investment advisers in 2024.

He explained, “Rather than waiting, CCOs should ensure that they continue to enhance their policies and procedures applicable to off-channel communications and continue to educate and train investment professionals as to the importance of conducting advisory business on firm-approved communications channels.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Patrick Ryan Quoted in The Deal on Impact of Antitrust Review on Financing of Private Equity Deals,"Patrick Ryan, Head of the Firm’s Banking and Credit Practice, was quoted in an article titled, “Antitrust Poses Financing Challenges for PE,” which was published by The Deal .

The article discussed how the FTC and the antitrust division of the DOJ are increasingly scrutinizing deals involving private equity firms and their portfolio companies.

With reference to the potential impact of extended antitrust review from a financing perspective, Patrick noted that, in the bank loan market, “A ticking fee can be enough to hold together a syndicate for a fairly long period of time.

In some deals, the ticking fee can be the economic equivalent of the fully drawn cost of the money.”

He further explained how deals with an extended period between signing and closing raise distinctive issues for direct lenders, who are playing an increasingly important role in funding PE deals, stating that, “…for a direct lender, holding capital in abeyance might be an issue because it ties up capital for a longer period.

Holding unfunded commitments for a large period of time is not something private credit funds have historically done over time.”

The article discussed an Oklahoma lawsuit that has been filed to challenge the state’s anti-ESG law over its impact on pensions and broader questions that have been raised over the implementation of ESG-related state laws.

Leah noted that terms such as ESG or what constitutes an “ordinary business purpose” don’t necessarily have an accepted meaning, which makes these types of state ESG laws difficult to interpret from a legal perspective.

She went on to further comment, “This is part of why this suit filed in Oklahoma is so important, because often in the legal system, laws are passed by legislatures, or actions are taken.

And it’s really not until we see a legal challenge that the interested parties can really understand how the laws are supposed to be implemented.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Patrick Ryan Quoted in The American Lawyer on Impact of Leveraged Finance Market on Deal Activity,"Patrick Ryan, Head of the Firm’s Global Banking and Credit Practice, was quoted in an American Lawyer article titled, “Deal Watch: A Light Week in Deals.

Are Bonds to Blame?”

In the article, which discussed some of the potential hurdles facing the deal market, Patrick observed that activity in the leveraged finance market is slower than previous years, in part due to higher bond yields and interest rates as well as overall market volatility.

“The decline in market activity may be more of a function of the cost of credit rather than the supply of credit, as deals have been getting financed but the cost may be impacting the willingness of buyers to seek financing in order to pay more for assets,” he explained.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,George Gerstein Quoted in Pensions & Investments on Department of Labor’s ESG Rule,"Senior Counsel George Gerstein was quoted in a Pensions & Investments article titled, “DOL secures key dismissal in challenge to ESG rule.”

The article explored the Department of Labor’s (DOL) recent win in a lawsuit challenging its rule that allows retirement plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors when choosing investments.

George explained that the current rule and the DOL’s track record should provide plan fiduciaries a sufficient framework to manage their responsibilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), but noted the risks associated with factoring ESG issues into investment decisions.

“I think ERISA fiduciaries should recognize that there is perhaps a heightened litigation risk, at least in the short- to medium-term, when ESG-related factors are being incorporated, and, therefore, be prepared to defend the decision-making process as being one of cool-headed prudence,” he said.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Ryan Brizek Quoted in Fund Board Views on Control Share Defenses for Closed-End Funds,"Corporate Partner Ryan Brizek was quoted in an article in Fund Board Views , titled, “Saba v. Nuveen: Adviser, fund board fight for control share amendment.”

The article examined recent developments in the litigation involving Saba Capital and certain Nuveen closed-end funds. 

The Nuveen closed-end funds, all organized as Massachusetts business trusts, had adopted control share bylaw amendments that a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York recently found to be inconsistent with Section 18(i) of the 1940 Act.

The case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit.

Ryan explained that the Nuveen decision appears to be incompatible with a prior decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which permitted a closed-end fund organized in Maryland to remain opted in to the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act (the “MCSAA”) notwithstanding a counterclaim alleging that the fund’s decision to opt in to the MCSAA violated Section 18(i). 

He noted “[i]f you’re a board [member of a closed-end fund organized in Maryland] and you think there is a risk of predatory activity, one protective aspect

[for long-term shareholders] is to be able to opt into a control share statute. 

A fully informed board can determine what the best option is” for the fund.

Keith discussed boards’ responsibilities to make sure management is doing the right thing and noted that “from a regulatory standpoint and from a market standpoint…the board and management collectively have their reputation and the company’s reputation on the line,” making the regulatory aspect of governance all the more important.

Defining governance as “managing complexity and credibility,” he stated that “technology is really where we’ll see the revolution in terms of this governance aspect.”

He explained that, since boards don’t manage the company, there are limitations to their oversight, but added that technology can perhaps overcome some limitations to human nature with regards to what a board can do.

He explained that “the more information you can get to them in discrete increments that allows the firm to develop a reputation for good governance and compliance, then the less the board will probably have to do.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Leah Malone Quoted in Law360 on Overlap of ESG Initiatives and Real Estate,"Leah Malone, who leads the Firm’s ESG and Sustainability Practice, was quoted in a Law360 article titled, “ESG In Real Estate Hasn't Left The Building.”

The article discussed the impact of ESG initiatives on the real estate sector going into 2024, despite rocky market conditions last year.

Leah explained that global private equity funds that invest in real estate will continue to place an emphasis on promoting some sort of environmental or social cause, partly due to the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.

“Because global funds, to the extent that they're touching the EU, really do have to put themselves in these boxes and hold themselves to certain reporting standards that they set out at the fore, I think you will see less of a pull away from these issues,” she said.

She further noted that the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will have a significant impact on U.S. companies that have sizeable operations in the European Union.

When discussing the changes with Pensions & Investments , George indicated that while the final amendment features changes from the 2022 proposal on which it was based, “the macro effect of these changes may result in asset management firms and fund sponsors reassessing whether an alternative exemption is the way to go when managing plan assets.”

Erica also noted to InvestmentNews that, “these changes to the QPAM exemption will likely lend themselves to additional diligence considerations in the M&A space.”

Sara also shared additional insights on how the proposed overhaul could create a “huge pendulum swing” to where U.S. requirements would exceed most other jurisdictions and questioned whether or not it would make engagement between enforcers and companies more meaningful.

When commenting on the Private Fund Advisers rules, Michael noted, “Based on the discussion at the SEC’s open meeting, the final rule has eliminated many of the most aggressive substantive regulations that would have impacted the private equity industry, and has become mostly a disclosure and reporting regulation with some exceptions.”

He further explained, “There are substantial requirements relating to side letters that will impact open-end funds most acutely, but will also impact the private equity industry as well, especially as it relates to portfolio company reporting to investors.”

He added, “There is no question that these regulations will add to legal, compliance and finance/accounting costs to operate a private equity fund.”

The Firm, along with the ACLU of Hawaii and Legal Aid at Work, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Hawaii Department of Education and the Oahu Interscholastic Association based on allegations of systemic discrimination and gender inequities for female student-athletes as well as retaliation against those student-athletes who advocated for equity.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Release of Pro Bono Client After Court Cuts Over Thirty Years of His Sentence,"Simpson Thacher successfully secured a reduced sentence for a 56-year-old Black individual who was serving a 54-year sentence that could have kept him incarcerated until 2041.

Instead, Simpson Thacher persuaded the court to release our client this year under one of California’s newly enacted sentencing laws, SB 483, under which thousands of inmates are eligible for a one-year sentence reduction for prior drug related offenses.

Notably, for our client, this new law also permits the court to consider resentencing an inmate to a lesser term “in the interest of justice.”

Following several conversations with the San Diego County District Attorney’s office, prosecutors agreed to Simpson Thacher’s recommendation to strike over thirty-years from our client’s sentence “in the interests of justice.”

The court then granted the joint stipulation and resentenced our client to twenty-four years, eight months.

Because our client had already served more than two decades in prison and had accrued good time credit, he was released from prison on December 6, 2022.

Welcomed home by his daughter, sister, nephews, nieces and mother, our client looks forward to spending Christmas with his family for the first time in twenty-three years.

Simpson Thacher will continue to represent our client in an upcoming jury trial in August 2023 against prison officials who unlawfully withheld his mail, preventing our client from continuing to prosecute his habeas petition and thwarting any chance our client had to say goodbye to his father before he died.

Pierce A. MacConaghy presented the recommendation to the court.

This alert explored additional observations pertaining to failures to act in accordance with disclosures, misleading performance and marketing materials, inadequate investment due diligence and due diligence of service providers, and the use of “hedge” clauses.

With reference to implications for private funds, Michael noted that while many of the observations identified in the alert are not new, they highlight that the SEC is rapidly accelerating their effort to focus in on the private funds industry.

He further explained how, “the Risk Alert takes an extremely skeptical view of the adequacy of many of the core functions of private fund advisers, including fee calculations, consultations with LPACS, due diligence and marketing practices.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Antonio Bavasso Quoted in GCR on CMA Reliance on Private Litigation,"Antitrust Partner Antonio Bavasso was quoted in a GCR article titled, “Lawyers Caution Against CMA Reliance on Private Litigation After Cardell Speech,” which explores some of the implications of a recent speech U.K. Chief Executive of the Competition and Markets Authority Sarah Cardell gave at the Competition Appeal Tribunal’s 20th anniversary conference.

In her comments, she signaled that the agency will consider the overlap between public enforcement matters and private litigation when deciding on the cases to prioritize for investigations.

Antonio noted that, while it is understandable that the CMA would want to use its resources efficiently, he cautioned that it should not come to the detriment of cases that require the CMA’s ability to investigate.

Private antitrust litigation is likely to be even less suitable as a substitute in abuse of dominance cases, where corrective and remedial action that can be achieved via public enforcement is often the key to real success, he explained.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Obtains RMBS Appellate Victory for Countrywide,"On February 8, 2022, Simpson Thacher secured dismissal of RMBS claims filed against Firm client Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. by Ambac Assurance Corporation.

The appellate win stems from the December 8, 2020 dismissal of a complaint filed in 2015 by Ambac against Countrywide in connection with five residential mortgage-backed securities transactions that closed in 2005.

Ambac sought hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, alleging that it was fraudulently induced by Countrywide, the originator of the mortgages that were securitized in the transactions, to issue insurance policies on the securities.

In a 17-page decision, Justice Marcy S. Friedman of the Commercial Division, New York County held that the complaint is time-barred, as Ambac was on inquiry notice of its fraud claim by November 21, 2009, two years prior to the parties’ execution of a tolling agreement.

By that date, the ratings of the securities at issue had been downgraded to junk status, and well-publicized litigation and media reports disclosed alleged misconduct in Countrywide’s originating practices.

Ambac appealed the order of dismissal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Department.

On February 8, 2022, a five-judge panel unanimously affirmed the lower court’s decision, finding that Ambac knew about separate fraud litigation that Countrywide was facing before November 2009 and the insurer’s 2015 complaint was filed outside of New York’s two-year inquiry notice limitation for commencing fraud actions.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Law360 Profiles Simpson Thacher as a 2023 Healthcare Practice Group of the Year,"Simpson Thacher was named a Healthcare Practice Group of the Year for 2023 by Law360 .

The publication highlighted the Firm’s successes in major transactional and litigation matters affecting the healthcare space over the past year, including advising WeightWatchers in its $132 million acquisition of the telehealth platform Sequence, as well as guiding Change Healthcare and HCA Healthcare through antitrust challenges to transactions.

Simpson Thacher Healthcare Partner Vanessa Burrows told Law360 that WeightWatchers’ acquisition of Sequence exemplified a trend of growing interest in digital health companies.

“[T]his is an area that we’ve seen increased interest in over the last number of years,” she said.

The Firm’s ability to adapt to such emerging trends, as well as to other challenges and uncertainties in an evolving marketplace, was key to its success in 2023, according to Capital Markets Partner John Ericson: “The fact that there are these uncertainties actually can often play to our strengths because we work together across our different practice groups,” he said.

The victory for Change Healthcare marked a rare example of “litigating the fix,” or arguing at trial that purported competitive concerns in mergers are remedied by a voluntary measure undertaken by the parties—in this case, the divestiture of Change Healthcare’s ClaimsXten business.

“There haven’t been many cases in which the merging parties have successfully litigated a fix like this in the past,” said Sara Razi, Global Co-Chair of the Firm’s Antitrust and Trade Regulation Practice, who led the team representing Change Healthcare.

“And so this case demonstrates a nice playbook for how parties can do that.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Dismissal of Securities Litigation Against Qudian,"The Firm successfully secured the dismissal of a putative securities class action filed in the Southern District of New York against client Chinese online micro-lender Qudian Inc.

Amidst the turmoil of a regulatory crackdown on Chinese lenders, and a budding pandemic set to send shockwaves through the world, Qudian’s retraction of its 2019 future earnings guidance led plaintiffs to bring claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act against the company.

The alleged misstatements and omissions related primarily to Qudian’s earnings guidance.

Plaintiffs also alleged misstatements or omissions in connection with the regulatory environment, Qudian’s historical lending platform, its credit lending standards in that business, and its new Open Platform business.

In September 2020, the Simpson Thacher team filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ consolidated Amended Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiffs failed to state a claim, failing to adequately plead either a material misrepresentation or scienter.

On September 13, 2022, the Hon.

Gregory H. Woods dismissed the Complaint in its entirety with leave to amend, finding that Plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged that Defendants’ statements violated federal securities laws.

The court noted that “[m]ost of the challenged statements are not actionable” at all and that Plaintiffs’ arguments also contained “clear attempt[s] to plead fraud by hindsight,” as well as failing to adequately allege scienter.

Following the ruling, Plaintiffs elected not to amend the Complaint and did not oppose the entry of judgment in Qudian’s favor, which was entered on December 7, 2022.

In November 2021, the team secured a preliminary injunction with a federal court temporarily blocking the challenged provisions.

Following the entry of the preliminary injunction, in February 2022, the court permanently enjoined by a stipulated order one of the challenged provisions, which prohibited the distribution of advance mail ballot applications by out-of-state persons/entities, finding that the ban violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Navigating an Uncertain Examination and Regulatory Environment.”

The article, part one of a two part series, detailed their expectations on the nature and focus of SEC examinations, as well as regulatory happenings likely to affect the PE industry in 2024.

Michael Osnato explained that, factoring in the intensifying focus on private funds, “we expect Examinations to be very active in 2024.

That will likely manifest in the form of both a high exam volume and an aggressive focus from examiners.”

He further noted that “In 2024, we expect AI to enter the mainstream of exams through a standard module of questions in ordinary course exams that explore whether a firm is using AI.”

Michael Wolitzer highlighted that “the SEC may zero in on certain types of conflicts of interest because it pulled back on them somewhat in the Private Fund Rules,” adding that there is likely to be additional activity in the bread-and-butter areas identified in the SEC’s recently released 2024 examination points.

He also described how industry participants are moving forward in light of the uncertainty around the challenge to the Private Fund Rules in the Fifth Circuit, explaining “we are definitely not advising clients to hold off on preparing for the requirements in the Private Fund Rules.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Secures Denial of Class Certification in Suit Against M&T Bank,"On February 7, 2024, the Firm secured a major victory for client M&T Bank Corp. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in connection with a proposed investor class action related to the $3.7 billion merger between M&T Bank and Hudson City Bancorp Inc. Revisiting his own prior order from August 2023 that granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, U.S. Circuit Judge Evan Wallach, sitting by designation in the District of Delaware, held that plaintiffs failed to meet the class certification requirements of Rule 23.

Plaintiffs, former shareholders of Hudson City Bancorp, filed suit in 2015 alleging violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Among other things, plaintiffs claimed that defendants failed to disclose material information about the regulatory risks related to the merger, which was ultimately delayed for over two years.

In rejecting plaintiffs’ efforts at class certification, the Court ruled that “Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their burden in their Motion for Class Certification regarding the commonality and predominance” requirements of Rule 23 for the proposed class, vacating the earlier order.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Secures Dismissal of Removal Proceedings for Three Pro Bono Clients,"On June 23, 2022, the Firm secured the dismissal of removal proceedings initiated in April 2017 for two pro bono clients.

The Firm also previously secured dismissal for a third pro bono client on May 17, 2022, whose removal case was predicated on the same set of facts.

The clients were part of a group of nine men who were initially stopped ostensibly for speeding while traveling home to New York from Georgia by a Pennsylvania State Trooper.

Upon stopping the group, the State Trooper demanded to see “papers, work permit, visa, passport and ID” from each showing their lawful status.

When several individuals, including the Firm’s clients, could not produce documents to his satisfaction, the State Trooper held the group at a nearby rest stop, where they were prohibited from obtaining any food, drink, using the bathroom, or even turning on the vehicle’s air conditioner.

During the encounter, the State Trooper called agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) and held the Firm’s clients for more than two and a half hours in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights so those ICE agents could respond to determine alienage.

The day after this encounter they were placed into removal proceedings.

After several men from the group, including the Firm’s clients, unsuccessfully moved the Immigration Court to suppress the Government’s evidence through prior counsel, the Firm began representing those three who lived in New York in October 2017, and sought reconsideration of the prior Immigration Judge’s decision on the motion to suppress by filing three separate motions to reconsider and reopen.

For one client, the Immigration Judge quickly disposed of the motion and ordered the client removed.

Simpson Thacher successfully appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), where a three-member panel of the BIA sustained the Firm’s appeal that extension of a traffic stop on the basis of race or perceived ethnicity violated the client’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure and remanded the case to the Immigration Court for the purposes of holding a suppression hearing.

The Firm successfully secured a suppression hearing for its other two clients.

Subsequent to remand from the BIA, in May 2021 each of the client’s cases were consolidated.

In February 2022, the Firm submitted a request for prosecutorial discretion on behalf of its clients.

While the Government agreed to dismiss one of the client’s cases, they also filed motions, which proposed to submit evidence of alienage that was not derived from the traffic encounter for the other two individuals.

After full briefing on the Government’s motions, but before the Immigration Judge adjudicated them, upon further negotiations, the Government ultimately decided to approve the prosecutorial discretion requests the Firm had previously submitted, and the Immigration Court granted the parties’ requests for dismissal of the pending removal proceedings for each of the Firm’s clients based on the Government’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

The Simpson Thacher team included Associates Stephen DiGregoria and Taylor Sutton, Partner Mike Osnato and Retired Partner Tom Rice.

The article outlined the obstacles that U.S. antitrust agencies face in persuading courts to accept the validity of merger challenges that deemphasize sector-share statistics and highlight the competitive effects of a transaction.

When discussing how agencies could bring a series of challenges that combine a traditional supply-side horizontal theory of harm with another theory that they want the courts to acknowledge as independently sufficient for a case, Preston noted, “If they do it as a secondary theory, and it gets favorably reviewed by a judge a couple times such that they think it now has two legs to stand on its own, then I can envision them potentially bringing a case, but that to me is years down the road, versus tomorrow.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice Defeat a Motion to Dismiss Their Clients' Constitutional Challenge to a North Carolina Law Criminalizing Voting,"On March 28, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina rejected an effort by North Carolina’s District Attorneys to obtain dismissal of a federal lawsuit brought by Simpson Thacher and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.

At issue is the constitutionality of a vague and racially discriminatory law that criminalizes voting by North Carolina residents who vote while they are on parole, probation or post-release supervision for a felony conviction, even if they mistakenly believe they are eligible to vote .

High-profile prosecutions under this strict liability law have chilled countless eligible voters with criminal convictions from exercising their right to cast a ballot.

This fear of prosecution has impeded voter engagement efforts by the North Carolina A. Philip Randolph Institute and Action NC, the Plaintiffs in the suit.

The District Court adopted in its entirety the Magistrate Judge’s February 14, 2022 memorandum opinion and recommendation, which found that the Complaint adequately alleges that “enjoining the DA Defendants . . .

from enforcement of the challenged statute would necessarily prohibit investigation and ultimate prosecutions of any violation of the statute, and substantially reduce the resources that Plaintiffs expend in their focus on eligible voters who fear prosecution” for voting.

The District Court also denied a motion for permissive intervention by Philip E. Berger, the President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Timothy K. Moore, the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives.

The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s finding that ”permitting the intervention sought will unduly delay the adjudication of Plaintiffs’ rights and unnecessarily burden judicial resources.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Eleventh Summary Judgment Ruling for Travelers in Insurance Coverage Case,"On September 23 rd , Judge Lorna G. Schofield of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York awarded summary judgment to Firm client Travelers in a dispute concerning Northrop Grumman’s claims for insurance coverage for a putative class action brought by Long Island residents and property owners.

The claims stem from contamination generated by Northrop Grumman’s historical operations at its Bethpage, New York facility.

In this opinion, Judge Schofield ruled that Travelers has no obligation to defend Northrop Grumman under certain umbrella policies because the umbrella policies only provide a duty to defend when insurance is not “afforded” by the underlying primary policies.

Judge Schofield ruled that coverage was “afforded” under the primary policies but forfeited by Northrop Grumman’s late notice to Travelers—as determined in a prior summary judgment ruling that the Firm obtained for Travelers.

This latest win marks the Firm’s eleventh summary judgment ruling establishing that Travelers has no obligation to provide coverage to Northrop Grumman for claims arising from this contamination.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Successfully Overturns Jury Verdict in Product Liability Case,"The New York Court of Appeals has overturned a $16.5 million jury verdict against Whittaker Clark & Daniels Inc. After a Manhattan jury determined that the talcum powder supplied by Whittaker Clark was contaminated and caused a woman’s fatal cancer, Simpson Thacher was retained to prosecute the appeal.

In an opinion described by one commentator as a “seminal decision which will likely change the face” of low dose tort litigation in New York, the Court held plaintiff’s proof of causation insufficient as a matter of law, reversed with costs and dismissed the case.

To establish liability, the Court required a plaintiff to establish, using expert testimony based on generally accepted methodologies, sufficient exposure to a toxin to cause the claimed illness.

Rejecting plaintiff’s argument that the Court of Appeals’ standard is impossible to meet

, the Court stated that “[t]he fault here is not in our standard, but in plaintiff’s proof.”

The Court reaffirmed its decision in Parker v. Mobil Oil Corp ., 7 N.Y.3d 434 (2006) that “an [expert] opinion on causation should set forth a plaintiff’s exposure to a toxin, that the toxin is capable of causing the particular illness (general causation) and that plaintiff was exposed to sufficient levels of the toxin to cause the illness (specific causation).”

This case is Nemeth v. Brenntag North America, Inc. , 2022 NY Slip Op 02769 (April 26, 2002), and has received media coverage in several publications, including Reuters , New York Law Journal and Law360 .

Africk of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Simpson Thacher client HCA Healthcare (“HCA”) and co-defendant Louisiana Children’s Medical Center (“LCMC”).

The FTC had hoped to force HCA and LCMC to submit HSR filings and to force LCMC to pause its integration plans for the acquired hospitals.

Judge Africk explained in his decision that the state action doctrine reflects the limited reach of federal antitrust laws.

Further, he held that the state action doctrine applies to the HSR Act like it does to other antitrust laws, because application of the HSR Act to COPA-approved transactions could frustrate a state’s regulatory agenda in granting the COPA.

As a matter of statutory interpretation, he held that the HSR Act lacks a clear statement from Congress of an intent to preempt such state policies.

On the undisputed factual record before the court, Judge Africk agreed with the hospitals that the COPA at issue in this case satisfied the requirements for state action immunity because the Louisiana Attorney General had actively supervised the acquisition pursuant to a clearly and expressly articulated state policy.

In April 2023, the hospitals sued the FTC in federal district court in Louisiana, noting that they did not need to report their deal to federal antitrust regulators since they received a COPA in Louisiana.

One day later, the FTC counter-sued in the District of Columbia, contending that “LCMC and HCA flouted their HSR Act obligations by failing to report their transaction and then consummating it, without filing the required premerger notification and without a cognizable justification or exemption.”

In a related win, the Simpson Thacher team secured a decision transferring the FTC’s case to the Louisiana court, where the cases were consolidated in June 2023.

The Simpson Thacher team included Sara Razi, Abram Ellis, Joshua Hazan, Avia Gridi and Matthew Munro."
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,John Terzaken Quoted in Global Competition Review on Legal Argument in Cartel Conviction Case,"John Terzaken, Global Co-Chair of the Firm’s Antitrust and Trade Regulation Practice, was quoted in a Global Competition Review article titled, “Former engineering executive appeals against cartel conviction.”

The article detailed the former executive’s appeal of his bid-rigging conviction alleging that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina improperly told a jury to analyze the case as a per se violation of the Sherman Act.

John noted that federal appellate court is likely to reject the appellant’s argument that the per se doctrine should not have been applied because of the nature of the colluding companies’ relationship outside of the context of the bid.  

He explained that the government only needed to prove that the companies agreed to manipulate their submissions for the particular bid to tip the competitive balance, stating, “If they prove that agreement at a trial, they prove an antitrust violation.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Owen Lysak Quoted in Ignites Europe on Revised Draft Technical Standards for the ELTIF,"Partner Owen Lysak was quoted in an Ignites Europe article titled, “ESMA Waters Down ELTIF Liquidity Rules.”

The article discussed the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) revised draft technical standards for the ELTIF, which lessen the liquidity requirements for European long-term investment funds as compared to the prior iteration of the proposal.

Owen noted that the ESMA revisions on liquid asset limits are “much closer to what we see currently in the market for retail funds.”

He went on to further add that the technical standards still “remain very prescriptive, and do not really take into account that these funds do not, and probably should not, just rely on a liquidity sleeve to provide liquidity.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,The National Law Journal Remembers Roy Reardon’s SCOTUS Victory,"The National Law Journal honored the legacy of former Simpson Thacher Litigation Partner Roy L. Reardon in an article that highlighted his Supreme Court victory for famed golfer Casey Martin in PGA Tour v. Martin .

Simpson Thacher Litigation Partner Joe McLaughlin and Global Co-Chair of the Litigation Department, Lynn Neuner, who teamed with Roy on the case, commented in the article about his strategy and approach in litigating the matter.

The case stemmed from the PGA’s denial of an accommodation in the PGA tour that would have enabled Martin to use a golf cart, which he required due to a degenerative leg impairment .

Roy won on behalf of Martin in cases brought before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2000 and the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001.

In describing Roy’s process in preparing for his arguments, Joe noted him as exhaustive, saying, “He would read every document, every line of the trial record.

And then he would highlight and annotate it with his personal commentary.”

Lynn remarked that, despite knowing that he was likely to face tough questioning from Justice Scalia, Roy was equal to the task.

“Roy did not shy away from the contest.

Roy was superb at oral argument,” she said.

The article noted that, in reflecting on the impact of the case, Roy said, “It was the most rewarding pro bono effort I had ever made, and it was a good thing for Casey and the disabled.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Ben Spiers and Deborah Harris Quoted in Law360 on Reforms to U.K. Listing Rules,"Partner Ben Spiers and Counsel Deborah Harris were quoted in a Law360 article titled, “Listing Reforms May Not Be Enough To Attract Tech Stocks.”

The article detailed the Financial Conduct Authority’s reforms to the Listing Rules in the U.K. with the goals of making the U.K. more commercially attractive to foreign issuers post-Brexit and broadening the investment landscape for U.K. investors.

Deborah highlighted how the rules differ from the U.S. regime and how, “In the U.K., the recent rule change is far more limited, effectively enabling a founder-director to ward off shareholder activism and hostile bids for a transitional five-year period but not permitting them to retain voting control over the company post-IPO.”

She further explained that the London market is synonymous with high levels of investor protection and the new rules aim to strike a balance between safeguarding investors and boosting London's attractiveness as a listing venue.

Ben explained that “the current landscape means that the pace of change seems to be slowing, which is pushing some companies to list elsewhere.”

Beckman sued Jabil in June 2021 alleging breaches of the parties’ contract by which Jabil agreed to manufacture certain printed circuit board assemblies at a discounted price.

Jabil counterclaimed for breach of contract against Beckman and also asserted fraud claims against both Beckman and Danaher, alleging that it had been fraudulently induced by Beckman’s and Danaher’s material misrepresentations and omissions to enter into the long-term deal.

Justice Schecter of the Commercial Division, New York County, granted Beckman’s and Danaher’s motion to dismiss Jabil’s fraud claims.

On September 29, 2022, the First Department modified Justice Schecter’s decision, finding that the Supreme Court erred in dismissing Jabil’s fraud claims to the extent based on allegations of fraudulent omissions, focusing on Beckman’s and Danaher’s plans for a new Danaher subsidiary that detrimentally impacted Jabil’s deal with Beckman.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Deborah Harris Quoted in Law360 on Potential Merger of U.K. Listing Segments,"Counsel Deborah Harris was quoted in a Law360 article titled, “FCA Will Need Upgrade If U.K. Merges Listing Segments.”

The article explored how companies could be more attracted to list in London rather than the U.S. or Europe if the standard and premium listing segments were merged and burdensome standards reduced, as well as whether this could result in the loss of the sponsor role and require more Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversight.

Deborah commented that “Switching to a unified listing segment would remove an element of choice for issuers — the high standards of governance and investor protection offered by a premium listing comprise a core part of London's listing infrastructure and reputation but may not be appropriate for some issuers, particularly high growth businesses or those looking to list at an earlier stage of their growth.

“If you look at it, there are, even on a per capita basis, several times as many lawyers in a place like New York as there are in Mississippi.

In his order granting a joint dismissal motion from the shipbuilders, U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga rejected the plaintiffs’ contention that their complaint sufficiently alleged fraudulent concealment to toll the Sherman Act’s four-year statute of limitations, which had otherwise expired.

He further reflected, “My sense is that the SEC saw ESG as an emerging risk a few years ago, but it isn’t much of an emerging risk anymore,” but noted “That doesn’t mean they’re not going to look at ESG.

They don’t talk much about the custody rule in this year’s exam priorities.

But I can almost guarantee you that they’re going to ask about custody in an exam.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Mark Brod Quoted in Financial Times on Redemptions for SPAC Investors,"Capital Markets Partner Mark Brod was quoted in a Financial Times article titled “Spac investors set for $75bn boost as redemptions loom,” which explored how many SPACS are now approaching their two-year time limit to close an acquisition and, if they do not seek an extension, will have to return all the raised funds to investors.

Mark noted that “Many investors prefer to redeem and get back 100 cents on the dollar while holding on to their warrants as risk appetite is significantly lower than before.”

He additionally stated that, because of recent stock market declines, even investors who approved of a SPAC’s merger could choose to take back their cash with the expectation that they could buy the combined company’s stock at a cheaper price in the secondary market afterwards.

Stephen noted that the emerging trend of SPAC-related securities litigation continues in 2022, although cases may have hit their peak in 2021, as “SPAC deal volume appears to be dropping.”

The lawsuit, filed against the NYCDOE and NYCDOE Chancellor David C. Banks, alleges that students with disabilities in NYC face unacceptably long delays in obtaining necessary special education evaluations, exacerbating their underlying disabilities and hindering their educational progress.

The extensive delays have deprived the Plaintiffs and the proposed class of their right to a free and appropriate public education by denying them the special education services to which they are entitled.

The suit also alleges that Defendants have delayed providing special education evaluations directly to students, have delayed responding to requests for independent educational evaluations (“IEEs”), and have failed to pay independent evaluators who provide IEEs for their services in a timely manner, with delays sometimes exceeding six months.

Critically, the Defendants’ excessive delays in paying independent evaluators who provide IEEs for their services has severely limited the pool of providers willing to contract with the City of New York to deliver special education services.

This has a disproportionately harmful impact on low-income students, primarily of color, whose families cannot afford to pay for IEEs independently.

The article examined the SEC’s recently proposed amendments to Form PF and the impact these could have on fund managers.

David noted how the proposal contains inconsistencies between the scope and purpose of the Form PF disclosures, with particular reference to the reporting events required of PE advisers given that the FSOC is the intended recipient of the filing information.

“It is hard to imagine what the FSOC would do with the information that a PE fund terminated at the end of its term,” he explained.

He further noted that the SEC needs to connect the new reporting requirements to true systemic risk or otherwise consider abandoning those parts of the proposal.

David also commented on the difficulty of the one-business-day reporting requirement, stating that “the many other burdens a fund manager would likely be facing surrounding some of the events requiring that reporting,” including ensuring a proper internal review of the information contained in the filing, should also be considered.

Jon noted how “The trends fit with the events of the past year and the year before that.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Leah Malone Quoted in Bloomberg Law on Varied State Approaches to ESG Legislation and Global Impact,"Partner Leah Malone was quoted in an article titled, “GOP Governors Push Anti-ESG Goals With Mixed Legislative Success,” which was published by Bloomberg Law and analyzed the various pathways and successes of state level ESG legislation.

Leah explained that there are currently more anti-ESG bills than pro-ESG proposals moving through legislatures, but that, in some states, scaled-back anti-ESG bills may be “more likely to win the day” compared to broader or more stringent approaches.

When explaining the global impact of ESG regulation at the state level, Leah noted that, while multinational companies are used to balancing different laws and standards around the world, ESG regulation “poses an interesting problem of bifurcating approaches” between the U.S. and much of the rest of the world, which is moving toward more ESG disclosures and heightened requirements.

The article highlighted how industry experts have interpreted SEC Division of Investment Management director William Birdthistle’s discussion of how swing pricing for money market funds can be an alternative to fees and gates as an indication of future SEC guidance.

Rajib noted how, particularly with institutional prime funds, the ability of a fund to offer redemptions in kind is a way to address a liquidity event, returning underlying assets to investors on a pro-rata basis.

He added that “Making it easier to receive redemptions in kind would be easier.”

He further explained that ring fencing is more prevalent in Europe and is similar in practice to redeeming in kind and is far more precise than swing pricing.

In the Law360 article, John explained that the recent trend of a decline in fines is likely due to the larger global trend of enforcers prioritizing domestic enforcement.

He also noted that the decrease in U.S. leniency application numbers likely aligns with global trends, and that U.S. enforcers are shifting cartel gears, pointing to a greater emphasis on self-correcting behavior by leniency applicants and efforts to drum up more cases.

In GCR, John explained how lower fines don’t necessarily mean less enforcement, noting that, “It depends on how enforcers view what may drive greater deterrence – being more active or achieving more significant results.

Enforcers typically seek to accomplish a combination of both.”

It’s part of the natural examination process that the SEC does in the ordinary course.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Michael Osnato Quoted in Law.com on SEC Chair’s First Year and Enforcement Efforts,"Partner Michael Osnato was quoted extensively in Law.com ’s weekly Compliance Hot Spots newsletter discussing SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s first year at the agency, as well as the state of the agency’s enforcement efforts.

Michael noted how, at the beginning of Mr. Gensler’s tenure, “a lot of us felt and saw an uptick in enforcement activity across a whole range of areas,” and sensed “that it was the beginning of a really sustained wave of robust enforcement.”

He explained that the most notable change has been “that the wave of rulemaking efforts have taken a little bit of the focus and energy away from enforcement.

The investigations are still being pursued, but it feels like some of the bandwidth, at least from the chair and the commission-level perspective, has been redirected into rulemaking.”

Michael added that “generally there has been a view that the agency can achieve a lot of regulatory goals through enforcement,” pointing specifically to recent priorities like crypto or climate, but further noted that “Because the cases are often very different and fact-specific, and can frankly take too long, sometimes the natural pivot is to rulemaking, which many might view as being more effective or efficient, at least in the short term.”

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,David Caldwell Quoted in The Anti-Corruption Report on Increasing DOJ Focus on Data Preservation in Legal Process Settlement,"David Caldwell was quoted in an Anti-Corruption Report article titled, “Google’s DOJ Legal Process Settlement Shows Increased Focus on Data Preservation.”

The article detailed the Department of Justice’s increasing focus on data preservation, and the implications of Google’s agreement to improve its legal process compliance program, which ended a long dispute over compliance with a search warrant issued in conjunction with a criminal investigation of a third party.

David noted that the “DOJ appears to be signaling that preserving data responsive to legal process…is a priority.”

He explained how the agreement may be an extension of an emerging trend in which regulators are focused on data preservation.

With reference to Google’s agreement to appoint an independent compliance professional for three years, David added that while the concept of a professional focused on data preservation efforts may seem unusual, compliance practitioners will find familiar recommendations in the DOJ’s expectations for Google’s compliance enhancements rooted in prior DOJ guidance.

He additionally noted that the DOJ’s expectations when evaluating the effectiveness of a company’s compliance program differ company to company, depending in part on the risks a company faces.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Featured in Law360 on Successful Release of Pro Bono Client Erroneously Sentenced to Life Imprisonment,"Law360 featured the Firm in an article titled, “Simpson Thacher Helps Free Miss.

Man From Life Sentences.”

The article highlighted the Firm’s role, working alongside the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Southern District of Mississippi, in successfully securing the release of our pro bono client, a 51-year-old Black individual, who was erroneously sentenced to life in prison under the federal “three strikes” law and had already spent more than 20 years in prison.

The team moved for a sentence reduction under the compassionate release provisions of the First Step Act on the grounds that a sentencing error—based on our client’s prior convictions which involved conduct that took place in a three-week period and should have only counted as one strike, not two as required to trigger the application of the “three strikes” law—and the non-retroactive changes to § 924(c)’s penalties for stacked convictions constituted extraordinary and compelling reasons for a sentence reduction.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi granted our client’s motion on August 9, 2022, reducing his sentence to 24 years and one day, and, because of his previously served time and accrued good time credit, he was released from prison the following day.

In the article, Litigation Partner Joshua Levine noted, how the day after the court’s opinion came out, the team learned that the government had taken the client out of the maximum security facility where he was imprisoned and arranged for his transportation home to his family, saying, “It was both thrilling and startling that after 20 years of incarceration, the wheels of justice could turn so quickly.

And it was something we'll never forget.”

Pro Bono Attorney Nihara Choudhri was also quoted and Litigation Associate Conor Mercadante was mentioned in the story surrounding their roles on the Simpson Thacher pro bono team who worked on this case.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Dismissal of Suits by Baseball Teams and Casinos Seeking Billions,"Simpson Thacher has won dismissal of three separate lawsuits seeking to recover business losses attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic filed by Major League Baseball and each team, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority against the Firm’s client, Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

Major League Baseball cancelled much of the 2020 season and played part of the season without fans in the stands during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority both closed their casino resorts starting in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

They each separately sought to recover from their property insurer for business interruption losses based on the notion that the COVID-19 virus and related government social distancing orders caused physical loss or damage to their insured property within the meaning of their commercial property insurance policies.

Claimants sought damages exceeding a billion dollars.

Three different judges sitting in the Superior Court of California (Alameda County) and the Connecticut Superior Court (Hartford) adopted the Firm’s arguments and dismissed the claims with prejudice.

After more than a year of discovery, Judge Seligman dismissed Baseball ’s claims primarily because it failed to show covered physical loss or damage as a matter of law.

Judge Noble similarly dismissed Mohegan ’s claim because it failed to allege the required physical loss or damage.

Finally, Judge Moukawsher dismissed the Pequot ’s claim because “[c]osts caused by a virus are the very thing the policy does not cover by virtue of the contamination exclusion.”

The cases are Oakland Athletics Baseball Co. v. Factory Mutual Insurance Company , Civil Case No. RG20079003 (Superior Court of California, County of Alameda); Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority v. Factory Mutual Insurance Company , No. HDD-CV-21-6147037 (Superior Court Complex Litigation Docket at Hartford, Connecticut); and Mashantucket Pequot Tribal National v.

The article explored the ways in which alternative investment products designed specifically for financial advisors to recommend to individual investors have undergone a major transformation over the past seven years from a niche marketplace into a hotbed of product development.

Rajib observed that there is a recent emphasis on vehicles that go beyond standard models or that mix and match across existing formats to shape new hybrids.

“What we’re seeing for the foreseeable future is less of a cookie-cutter approach,” he said.

Looking ahead, Rajib explained that having products in multiple asset classes makes sense for managers from a cost perspective, and allows sales teams to always have some entry in the roster that can be in favor regardless of market environment.

The article discussed the disclosure requirement on preferential treatment that was included in the SEC’s final Private Fund Advisers rule.

When discussing how the SEC’s final rule will increase complexity for GPs and their legal advisors when determining how to disclose these terms, Michael noted that they will now need to make judgment calls on special arrangements that could have a “material, negative effect” on other LPs.

In other words, he explained, every time a GP grants any type of side letter, it needs to think about how that relates to either liquidity or reporting, and how it impacts other LPs.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice Overturn Unconstitutional North Carolina Law Criminalizing Voting,"On April, 22, 2024, Simpson Thacher and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice (SCSJ) secured a decisive victory for their clients in a federal lawsuit in North Carolina District Court challenging a North Carolina law criminalizing voting.

The win overturned a racially discriminatory law that made it a Class

I felony for North Carolina residents to vote if they are on parole, probation or post-release supervision for a felony conviction, even if they mistakenly believe they are eligible to vote.

Virtually every other election crime punishable as a Class

I felony in North Carolina requires intent.

Under this strict liability law, there had been high-profile prosecutions which chilled countless eligible voters with criminal convictions from exercising their right to cast a ballot.

This fear of prosecution impeded voter engagement efforts by the North Carolina A. Philip Randolph Institute and Action NC, who were the Plaintiffs in the suit.

The lawsuit was originally filed in September 2020.

The team successfully argued that this law, which dates back to the nineteenth century, violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In her decision, U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs found it “extraordinary and telling” that the state did not dispute the discriminatory origins of the law or its current discriminatory impact on Black voters.

She also noted that vagueness around the strict-liability nature of the law, enabled North Carolina district attorneys to “pursue their personal predilections” in deciding whether to enforce the law.

After Simpson Thacher and SCSJ moved for summary judgment, the North Carolina legislature amended the law on a prospective basis for elections after January 1, 2024.

The team received a “Shout Out” in The American Lawyer ’s “Litigator of the Week” coverage .

The decision was highlighted by publications including Associated Press , Law360 , Wilmington StarNews , Fox 8 , Courthouse News Service and NC Newsline .

The Simpson Thacher team included Jonathan K. Youngwood, David Elbaum, Jacob Lundqvist and Nihara K. Choudhri."
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,Simpson Thacher Wins Two Appeals For Factory Mutual,"The California Sixth District Court of Appeal found that the San Jose Sharks and other members of the National Hockey League’s claims for hundreds of millions of dollars of business interruption insurance due to the shutdown of hockey operations during the COVID-19 pandemic were properly dismissed by the trial court.

The Sixth District relied on the insurance policy’s “contamination exclusion” to find in favor of Firm client Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

Separately, the Connecticut Court of Appeal found that $76 million of business losses due to the closure of Foxwood Resorts Casino during the COVID-19 pandemic are not covered by Factory Mutual.

The Court of Appeal held that the presence of COVID-19 did not cause physical loss or damage within the meaning of the insurance policy and even if it did, the “contamination exclusion” would preclude insurance coverage.

The cases are San Jose Sharks, LLC v. Superior Court , and Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation v. Factory Mutual Insurance Co .

The article summarized key takeaways from a recent ACA Group panel discussion that featured Allison, and highlighted preparation expectations for increasing digitalization of compliance, recommendations for regulatory examination responses, methods to leverage existing platforms and insights for choosing and implementing new technologies.

Allison explained how technology enables compliance teams to respond to SEC exam requests more efficiently, and that while technology can aid in the preparation of documents by automating the process, it cannot be relied on entirely and should be monitored, stressing the importance of reviewing SEC requests, speeches, risk alerts and statements for guidance.

In addition to a compliance team, Allison suggested robust training and dedicated time for compliance staff to help end-users ensure that compliance reporting is accurate and complete when using technology for tasks such as annual reporting.

Once processes are automated, Allison explained that compliance teams must respond to reports, stating, “You do not want to have a failure to supervise because all of the reports generated showed a problem and you did not resolve it.”

Similarly, she warned that it’s important to remember that the SEC has recently pursued pure policy and procedure cases in which there is no underlying “bad act,” and that technology can help compliance departments schedule reviews of their policies to show the SEC that they are dedicated to ensuring procedures are maintained and in compliance.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,The Firm Secures Win for Bumble in Litigation Over Shareholder Voting Structure,"Simpson Thacher successfully secured a motion for summary judgment in a case brought against Bumble Inc. (“Bumble”), Whitney Wolfe Herd and Blackstone by Kristyn Colon on behalf of similarly situated Class A shareholders.

The Plaintiff challenged the legality of certain stockholder voting right provisions in Bumble’s corporate charter.

On September 12, 2023, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware granted Bumble’s motion for summary judgment and sided with the Defendants in the case.

In a September 16, 2022 complaint, Plaintiffs challenged two provisions in Bumble’s certificate of incorporation that stated that each share of Class A and Class B Common Stock will carry one vote per share, unless the share is owned by a “Principal Stockholder,” in which case it will carry ten votes per share.

The Principal Stockholders are defined as parties to a publicly disclosed stockholders agreement.

The Plaintiff alleged this amounted to “identity-based voting” which violated Sections 212(a) and 151(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), and sought a declaration that the challenged provisions are invalid.

Simpson Thacher filed a motion for summary judgment on behalf of Bumble.

In his September 12, 2023 decision, Vice Chancellor Laster noted that Plaintiffs’ allegations “cannot overcome the plain language of the DGCL,” agreeing with Defendants’ arguments and holding that the challenged provisions comply with Delaware law and are valid.
