CMS,Focusing on Funds: An update on the Register of Overseas Entities regime,"The UK’s Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (ECTE Act) originally implemented the Register of Overseas Entities regime in 2022 and as of 21 December 2023 has resulted in over 30,000 registrations at Companies House.

In this Focusing on Funds we look at recent and upcoming changes to the Register of Overseas Entities regime made by the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCT Act) and the implications for funds and other investors owning real estate in the UK through non-UK legal entities.

What is new The ECCT Act, which forms part of the UK’s ever expanding focus on implementing and enforcing transparency and enforcement legislation relating to economic crime and transparency of ownership, has amended the ECTE Act to expand the Register of Overseas Entities regime to include the following new requirements: Overseas entities holding property as nominees must look through to the owners of the land for its  registrable beneficial owners (previously it only looked through to the owners of the nominee).

Any legal entity in the overseas entity’s beneficial ownership chain that is a trustee (whether or not a professional trustee) is disclosable as a registrable beneficial owner, together with the supporting trust information.

An overseas entity must disclose its principal office (previously it was possible to disclose its registered office instead).

Likewise, it must disclose the principal office, rather than the registered office, of any registrable beneficial owner that is a legal entity.

Tougher information and compliance requirements including the potential loss of registered status and the ability to deal with land.

Other upcoming changes There are a number of other notable changes to the Register of Overseas Entity regime that will be brought in by the ECCT Act, but the Government has not yet indicated when these will come into force.

These changes include: A requirement to provide the title number of the relevant property to Companies House – though this information will not be publicly available on the Register.

A requirement to disclose the registrable beneficial owner(s) of the overseas entity between the period of 28 February 2022 and 31 January 2023.

Further information is set out below.

Fund managers and other investors in UK real estate should consider their UK land ownership structures, alongside any upcoming acquisitions and disposals, including certain leases in progress, to understand the implications on their organisations of the Register of Overseas Entities regime, including the latest and upcoming changes. .

The Register of Overseas Entities – a recap and its implications The Register of Overseas Entities (the Register) is a separate public register at Companies House for non-UK legal entities (overseas entities) that directly own or acquire qualifying UK real estate.

It was established by the ECTE Act and launched on 1 August 2022.

The relevant overseas entity is required to give comprehensive information about itself, its ‘registrable beneficial owner(s)’ (including, where the registrable beneficial owner is a trustee, information about the trust) and, in some circumstances, its managing officers.

UK companies (and other UK entities)  have to disclose their beneficial owner on a separate register under the People with Significant Control (PSC) regime.

Information contained on the Register is for the most part available to the public.

Overseas entities owning UK real estate (in particular, property registered since 1 January 1999 in England and Wales and since December 2014 in Scotland), or that have made disposals of UK real estate since 28 February 2022, originally had six months since 1 August 2022 to register on the Register.

Overseas entities seeking to acquire UK real estate (freeholds and grants of leases of more than seven years) need to be registered on the Register at Companies House before an acquisition can be registered at the Land Registry."
CMS,Focusing on Funds: An update on the Register of Overseas Entities regime,"For further detail regarding the implications of the Register for UK real estate transactions, including Land Registry requirements, see our Law

Now “ Important deadline imminent for Economic Crime Act ”.

Overseas entities on the Register are required to annually confirm and, when relevant, update their information on the Register, and can apply to be removed from the Register when they cease to hold qualifying UK real estate.

For more information on the updating duty, see our Law Now “ Be aware of the updating requirements for overseas entities at Companies House ”.

There are fines and criminal penalties for non-compliance – and non-compliance will seriously impact an overseas entity’s ability to acquire, sell, let or charge UK real estate.

Scotland has its own transparency regime, the Register of Persons Holding Controlled Interests in Land, that applies there in addition to the Register of Overseas Entities regime.

For more information on the Scottish regime, see our Law Now “ Register of Persons Holding a Controlled Interest in Land – (cms-lawnow.com) ”.

Overseas entity The obligation to register under the ECTE Act is on the ‘overseas entity’, which is a body corporate, partnership or other entity that (in each case) is a legal person governed by non-UK law.

The overseas entity needs to provide specific information about itself, any ‘registrable beneficial owners’ (including, where the registrable beneficial owner is a trustee, information about the trust) and, in some cases, its managing officers to Companies House as part of its application to register on the Register.

The information contained in the application for registration must be verified by a registered verifier.

Information provided in the annual update statement must also be verified.

Registrable beneficial owner(s) Overseas entities that register on the Register will need to identify their ‘registrable beneficial owner(s)’.

A beneficial owner is an individual, a legal entity or a government or public authority (X), who meets any of the following conditions in relation to the overseas entity (Y):"

CMS,Overview of the competent authorities under MiCAR,"Building on the CMS series of articles “ Legal experts on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation ”, this new article describes the powers of the competent authorities of EU member states, the European Banking Authority ( EBA ) and the European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCAR ).

With more than 50 articles and a dedicated Title VII with 5 chapters, MiCAR creates an extensive regulatory framework for both national and EU competent authorities.

The following article is a concise summary of the most relevant rules.

1. Powers of competent authorities Member states will designate their responsible competent authorities to carry out the functions and duties provided for in MiCAR.

Where more than one authority is appointed, they must determine their tasks and designate one of them as the single point of contact.

MiCAR determines the minimum supervisory and investigative powers of the competent authorities, which will cooperate and render assistance to the authorities of other member states, the EBA and the ESMA by exchanging information and cooperating in investigations, supervision, and enforcement activities.

Two of the more relevant powers are the suspension and prohibition of (i) crypto-asset services, and of (ii) public offers or admission to trading of crypto-assets.

The authority of one member state can request assistance from the competent authority of another member state regarding on-site inspections or investigations, which must be coordinated by the ESMA if requested by a national authority.

Competent authorities must work in close coordination to identify and remedy infringements of MiCAR, develop and promote best practices, facilitate collaboration, foster consistency of interpretation, and provide assessments in case of disagreements.

Further to this, the ESMA and EBA will do the following: specify the information to be exchanged between competent authorities; establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the cooperation and exchange of information; promote discussion on the classification of crypto-assets; and identify the sources of potential divergences in the approach to this classification, and promote a common approach.

In some circumstances, the ESMA, EBA and the competent authorities of a member state will be entitled to temporarily prohibit or restrict the marketing, distribution or sale of certain crypto-assets or any practice related to crypto-assets.

2.

ESMA register The ESMA will establish a register of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers as well as a register of non-compliant crypto-asset service providers, which will ensure more transparency for holders of crypto-assets across EU.

The crypto-assets register will be made up of: crypto-assets white papers (for crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens), which will include all crypto-assets white papers reported to the competent authority as well as any modified crypto-assets white papers; all issuers of asset-referenced tokens (including information on the issuer, together with their crypto-assets white papers); all issuers of e-money tokens (including information on the issuer, together with their crypto-assets white papers); and all crypto-asset service providers (including information on the crypto-asset service providers together with a list of crypto-services provided by the respective entity, a list of countries where services will be provided, the date of their authorisation, etc.).

A non-exhaustive public register of non-compliant crypto-asset service providers will be established for all entities providing crypto-assets services without authorisation."
CMS,Overview of the competent authorities under MiCAR,"A non-exhaustive public register of non-compliant crypto-asset service providers will be established for all entities providing crypto-assets services without authorisation.

Hence, all entities providing crypto-assets services not authorised by a competent authority and all entities providing crypto-assets services outside the scope of reverse solicitation (i.e. on the client’s own exclusive initiative) will appear on a ""shame list"" on the ESMA’s website.

The competent authorities will be tasked with the reporting duty whereas the ESMA will be tasked with maintaining both registers, which will be publicly available on the ESMA’s website and will be updated on a regular basis.

3.

Penalties Under MiCAR, the competent authorities will be provided with the power to take appropriate administrative measures (including penalties) for infringements of certain dispositions of the regulation.

Penalties will include public statements identifying the offender, a cease order, fines of up to EUR 700,000 for natural persons, and for legal persons 15% of the total annual turnover or at least twice the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided because of the infringement, even if this figure exceeds the previous caps.

CMS,UK REITs - refocus for funds and investors,"This Back to Basics note follows our key concepts briefings, which intend to provide high-level insights regarding funds fundamentals, funds vehicles and operational considerations, available here .

In this Back to Basics, we look at UK Real Estate Investment Trusts (“ REITs ”), including their requirements, benefits and growing use for fund structures and investment by institutional type investors in UK real estate.

Background and relevance Recent changes in UK tax legislation – most recently in the Finance Act 2024 – as well as changing investor attitudes, have bolstered investor and manager appetite for UK REITs as part of a fund or as holding vehicles (“ Private REITs ”).

They were originally introduced in 2007 for listed companies but can now be more “private” in nature and it is no longer necessary for the REIT to be traded or listed on a recognised stock exchange if the relevant ownership requirements are met.

What is a UK REIT?

A UK REIT is a UK tax resident company limited by shares (or a group of companies of which the principal company is a UK tax resident) that has an HMRC approved tax status for its property rental business and associated investment in real estate assets.

What are the key benefits?

Prominent benefits of using UK Private REITs to hold and invest in UK property include: tax efficient structure – see Tax benefits further below; use for real estate – this can be single or multi sector asset classes and includes student accommodation, private rented sector and life sciences; private REITs can be used by funds and institutional investors – see Private REIT structures below; possible use for a single asset – a REIT can hold a single commercial property of £20 million or more; and flexibility – a UK REIT can be an overseas entity, provided it is a UK tax resident, and can be a group structure.

It can be managed internally or externally.

REITs are also permitted to hold non‑UK assets, which will be subject to local taxes, and to carry out a limited amount of non‑real estate investment activity.

REIT requirements Set out below is a diagram illustrating some of the key “qualifying conditions” of REITs:

There are other conditions such as for financing, maximum holdings of shares by single corporates as well as continuing requirements.

If these are not met, a tax charge can arise, or even loss of REIT status.

Tax benefits A key incentive for using Private REITs is the tax efficiencies that are offered.

These efficiencies include: no UK corporation tax is payable on tax derived from the property rental business: this has particularly become more favourable for investors following the uplift in main rate corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023.

It is required to distribute at least 90% of its rental income profits; no capital gains tax is payable on profits arising from its property investments: this includes gains on the sale of qualifying UK property rich companies; ability to eliminate tax on latent gains: REITs can eliminate latent gains in property holding companies they acquire that hold UK property and can sell such property holding companies free of latent gains.

This is highly desirable for purchasers when bidding for property holding companies at a gain; tax is levied at the shareholder level than at the REIT level itself: this enables certain institutional investors to claim exemptions on profits received from the property; a company acquiring REIT status is not subject to any additional tax charges for becoming a REIT ; and ability to reclaim withheld tax: while distributions out of its ring-fenced profits (otherwise referred to as property income distributions (“ PIDs ”)) made by the REIT are subject to a 20% withholding tax, these payments can be made gross where a shareholder is a UK corporate, pension fund, local authority or charity.

UK companies will be liable to corporation tax on the PIDs at the current rate of UK corporation tax."
CMS,UK REITs - refocus for funds and investors,"UK companies will be liable to corporation tax on the PIDs at the current rate of UK corporation tax.

Non-resident investors may be eligible to a reduced (or nil) withholding tax rate.

Recent legislative amendments of REIT law Further changes to the REIT regime have recently been made by successive Finance Acts, with the most recent in the Finance Act 2024.

Many of the recent amendments seek to reduce barriers to entry which we anticipate will heighten investor interest and participation in the REIT regime and create greater flexibility in fund structuring as it can accommodate REIT subsidiaries.

These include: amending the non-close condition, which applies where a company is only close because it has an institutional investor as a participator, so that it is possible to trace through the intermediate holding companies to an institutional investor which is an ultimate beneficial owner; and allowing more fund structures to meet the “genuine diversity of ownership” condition, by allowing the fund structure to be looked at as a whole, rather than just the investing vehicle.

The amendments made in the Finance Act 2024 include a change to the definition of “institutional investors” such that authorised unit trusts, open-ended investment companies and collective investment scheme limited partnerships must meet either: a “genuine diversity of ownership” condition (i.e. it is widely marketed) can be fulfilled by looking at the fund structure as a whole rather than just the investing vehicle; or a “not a close company” condition (i.e. not controlled by 5 or fewer participators).

Private REIT structures It is possible for institutional investors to hold the Private REIT directly or through a fund structure if the relevant investor and other requirements are met (see 70% institutional ownership requirement in the diagram and proposed legislative changes above).

Institutional investors include relevant authorised unit trust schemes, pension schemes, sovereign wealth funds, open-ended investment companies, collective investment scheme limited partnerships, other UK REITs (or overseas REIT equivalents), UK charities and certain insurance companies.

Private REITs often do not need a listing or to be traded on a recognised stock exchange.

An example of a UK Private REIT structure set up as a fund is provided below.

Luxembourg vehicles The new Luxembourg-UK double tax treaty (as explored in our separate briefing ( The new Luxembourg-UK double tax treaty: key points for investors in UK real estate (cms-lawnow.com) ))

with its new taxing right taking effect from 1 January 2024 in respect of withholding tax, and from 6 April 2024 applying to other taxes on income and gains in Luxembourg, is anticipated to have a knock-on effect on how existing UK real estate holdings should be most effectively structured where shares or interests are held by Luxembourg holding structures.

This Luxembourg-UK double tax treaty, in conjunction with the UK corporation tax increasing to 25% on 1 April 2023, is expected to propel UK real estate investors further in considering the use of Private REITs in their own structuring.

CMS,Belgium: New decision about an advertisement for an SUV,"The Belgian self-regulatory body for advertising “JEP” (Jury for fair advertising practices) rendered a decision about an advertisement for an SUV.

The advertiser was an international car manufacturer, who introduced his new SUV model to the public, by showing a picture of it on a billboard.

The surface behind and around the SUV model was entirely green and was composed by vertically growing plants.

A consumer filed a complaint with the Jury against the car manufacturer, accusing him of greenwashing.

According to the consumer, the polluting car (which was not an electric vehicle) was presented (in the advertisement) in an utterly green environment, in the hope that the consumer would associate the car with an environmentally friendly means of transportation.

The Jury rejected the complaint, stating that the green environment in the advertisement points out that the car can be used off-road.

The advertiser does not claim that the car has a positive effect on the environment and the public will not believe that advertiser is offering an environmentally friendly car.

The decision of the Jury is available online in French: https://www.jep.be/fr/decisions-des-jep/land-rover-12-06-2023/ and in Dutch: https://www.jep.be/beslissingen/land-rover-12-06-2023/

This case shows that one can raise an ethical question about a car manufacturer offering for sale a not-so-green SUV in a completely green environment, but from a legal point of view, such advertising might not be misleading.

Consumers know that presenting a car in a green environment does not necessarily mean that the car itself is “green”.

CMS,The scope of application of the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation,"In April 2023, the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation ( MiCAR ) was ratified becoming the first regulatory framework for crypto-assets with the strategic goals of protecting consumers, investors and market integrity; ensuring financial stability; and supporting innovation.

Thus, MiCAR sets out several rules for crypto-assets players, namely for issuers and Crypto-assets Service Providers ( CASP ).

In this context, it is therefore relevant to determine MiCAR’s scope of application, specifically, to whom does MiCAR apply; what kind of assets are covered by MiCAR; and which activities or services are included in MiCAR.

In addition, what is excluded, either directly or indirectly, by MiCAR is also relevant.

To whom does MiCAR apply?

The regulation is clear in this respect stating that it is applicable to issuers of crypto-assets and to CASPs engaged in the issuance, offers to the public and admission in the trading of crypto-assets or issuers providing services related to crypto-assets in the Union.

What kind of assets does MiCAR cover?

As for the second question, the regulation refers to three different types of crypto-assets covered by the new regulation: Asset-referenced token a crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referring to another value or right or a combination thereof, including one or more fiat currencies, and is not an electronic money token (paragraph 6, no.1 of article 3 of MiCAR); Electronic money token a crypto-asset with the main purpose to serve as a means of exchange and one that purports to maintain a stable value by referring to the value of a fiat currency (paragraph 7, no.1 of article 3 of MiCAR); Utility token a crypto-asset that is only intended to provide digital access to a good or service supplied by its issuer (paragraph 9, no.1 of article 3 of MiCAR).

Which activiti es/services are included in MiCAR?

MiCAR specifically provides a list of crypto-assets services the custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of clients; the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets; the exchange of crypto-assets for banknotes and coins, scriptural money or electronic money; the exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets; the execution of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of clients; the placing of crypto-assets; the reception and transmission of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of clients; providing advice on crypto-assets; providing portfolio management on crypto-assets; and providing transfer services for crypto-assets on behalf of clients.

What is excluded from MiCAR?

On one hand, MiCAR expressly excludes from its scope of application any crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets.

MiCAR also lists the following assets excluded from its regulation: Financial instruments; Deposits, including structured deposits; Funds, except if they qualify as e-money tokens; Securitisation positions in the context of a securitisation; Non-life or life insurance products falling within certain classes of insurance or reinsurance and retrocession contracts; Pension products that, under national law, are recognised as having the primary purpose of providing the investor with an income in retirement and that entitle the investor to certain benefits; Officially recognised occupational pension schemes; Individual pension products for which a financial contribution from the employer is required by national law and where the employer or the employee has no choice about the pension product or provider; A pan-European Personal Pension Product; Social security schemes.

Border situations

Although MiCAR brought certainty about the entities and services covered by the new regulation, it may prove difficult to assess whether a crypto-asset should be considered covered by MiCAR.

A possible solution lies on the crypto-asset features, such as its fungibility or uniqueness."

CMS,NFTs under MiCAR – are they regulated or not?,"The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCAR ) sets down a harmonised regulatory framework for crypto-assets.

MiCAR's overarching goal is to extend regulatory oversight to those categories of cryptos and tokens that have so far remained outside the scope of regulation.

The following focuses specifically on non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) and examines whether they are covered by MiCAR.

What are NFTs?

NFTs are cryptographic records stored on a blockchain that are unique in that they are linked to a specific asset.

They primarily serve as the electronic ""embodiment"" of mainly digital, but also physical art.

NFTs provide technical benefits for the digital economy: they can take on the function of digital certificates of authenticity for electronic works, which can possibly prevent legal disputes about the granting of rights of use.

NFTs have experienced a rapid boom in the digital economy, even for the crypto world.

The most successful projects worldwide include the Bored Ape Yacht Club, the CryptoPunks and the CryptoKitties.

NFTs under MiCAR

MiCAR explicitly excludes crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible from its scope.

This means that most NFTs (i.e. those that are unique and non-fungible, such as digital art and collectibles) are not regulated by MiCAR.

Even though NFTs might be traded in a marketplace and accumulated speculatively, NFTs are not readily interchangeable and the relative value of an NFT in relation to another cannot be ascertained by comparison to an existing market or equivalent asset.

This is because NFTs are unique.

The value of NTFs is attributable to each token's unique characteristics and the utility it gives to the token holder.

Such characteristics limit the extent to which NFTs can be used financially, thereby reducing risks to holders and the financial system.

MiCAR may apply to the issuer of the NFT and the platform where the NFT is traded if an NFT has characteristics that make it similar to an asset-referenced token, electronic money tokens or a crypto-asset other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens (mainly utility tokens).

For example, NFTs issued in large series or as a collection could be considered fungible and therefore may be subject to MiCAR (i.e. fractional NFTs).

MiCAR is intended to apply to crypto-assets that may appear to be unique and non-fungible, but whose actual characteristics or associated use would make them either fungible or non-unique.

Thus, it is not the label or designation of a crypto-asset but rather the values and rights it embodies that decide whether an NFT falls under MiCAR.

Crypto and blockchain businesses that operate in the NFT space should carefully assess the characteristics of their NFTs on a case-by-case basis.

Other financial regulations The exemption under MiCAR for specific NFTs is limited only to the scope of MiCAR and does not affect the implementation of other financial regulations within the EU.

NFTs meeting the eligibility criteria for classification as financial instruments in accordance with the directive on markets in financial instruments ( MiFID II ), which includes transferable securities and financial derivatives, fall within the scope of MiFID II and the relevant EU securities regulations.

In addition, if NFTs meet the criteria for classification as electronic money or payment services as defined by the electronic money directive or the payment services directive, they are bound by the regulatory frameworks applicable to these domains.

Conclusion The predominant nature of NFTs as unique and non-fungible assets places them outside the primary scope of MiCAR.

As a result, most NFTs, particularly those relating to digital art and collectibles, are not regulated by MiCAR.

However, NFTs issued in substantial series or as part of collections may potentially trigger MiCAR oversight."
CMS,NFTs under MiCAR – are they regulated or not?,"However, NFTs issued in substantial series or as part of collections may potentially trigger MiCAR oversight.

Issuers of NFTs and trading platforms where NFTs are traded should carefully assess the characteristics of the NFT in order to ascertain its unique and non-fungible status, thereby ensuring compliance with the applicable regulatory framework.

CMS,UK: ASA bans Toyota advertisement for promoting environmentally irresponsible...,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom has banned a Toyota advertisement for promoting behaviour that is damaging to the environment.

The advertisement depicted Toyota’s Hilux model driving off-road through rural and wilderness environments, which was intercut with scenes showing the vehicle in urban settings.

This was accompanied by the slogan “BORN TO ROAM”.

The advertisement was criticised by the campaign group AdFree Cities, who argued that the advert encouraged environmentally harmful behaviour (a complaint that was subsequently upheld by the ASA).

In their response to the complaint, Toyota drew upon their wider environmental credentials and maintained that the production of the advertisement had been done responsibly.

The ASA did not address these points as they were irrelevant.

Toyota also argued that the advertisement showed the Hilux in the harsh environments it was designed for, and that their target market included specialised workers like farmers and forestry workers.

On this point, the ASA said that although Toyota may have been targeting specialised vehicle users, these users were not shown.

In addition, the wilderness scenes intercut with realistic urban environments gave the impression of driving across natural ecosystems with no apparent purpose, and with no regard for the environmental impact of this driving.

The ASA therefore upheld the complaint for breaching rule 1.3 of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing, which requires marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to both consumers and society.

The decision reflects what the ASA increasingly sees as its mission in upholding environmental values.

CMS,Energy Transition 2023,"While there is an expanded awareness and also ambitious goals coming out of fora, like the COPs, and policy developments, such as the EU’s REPowerEU initiative , the continuing year-on-year increase (aside from in the Covid years) in global CO2 emissions serves as a reminder that the transition to a low carbon global economy remains enormously complex, challenging and a work in progress.

This report illuminates how oil and gas majors across three key regions – Europe, North America, and Asia – are responding to the ongoing transition.

We see growing alignment around net-zero emissions targets for 2050, aggressive methane reduction goals and more standardised sustainability reporting frameworks.

However, companies are pursuing quite differentiated strategies based on their specific geographic and policy contexts, shareholder pressures and existing asset bases.

European firms like Shell , TotalEnergies , Eni and Equinor are diversifying most aggressively into large-scale renewable power generation, leveraging not only growing policy support but also their resources and expertise as utilities serving European markets.

In contrast, US majors like ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are maintaining comparatively more focus on their core oil and gas portfolios while directing investments into developing lower carbon solutions for their fossil fuel customers – seen by many as a pragmatic strategy given uncertainty around US national climate policy.

We see state-owned national oil companies in Asia and the Middle East charting pathways reflecting their home countries’ evolving climate priorities and development needs.

While overall spending on renewables and low carbon initiatives averaged 7.4% of capital expenditure in 2022 for the sampled companies, the wide variances between individual companies underscores how the energy transition remains in its early days as a collective strategic priority.

The majors must still make difficult trade-offs balancing investments to maintain returns from existing oil and gas assets, while staking out a future space in the wider landscape opened up by the energy transition.

As yet, there are no uniform pathways or dominant models.

This report seeks to provide objective benchmarks to assess how the oil and gas industry is progressing on the road towards a net-zero carbon economy, recognising that the pivotal years still lie ahead.

Preparing this report illuminated the complexities of any comparative analysis, which is why transparency and information sharing is likely to become increasingly essential.

For an economic shift as monumental as the global energy transition, there are no easy answers or straight lines.

Honest dialogue and innovative thinking will be required to maintain affordable access to energy while ensuring buy-in to measures addressing the impact of our energy choices on climate change.

The companies assessed here face pressures from all sides.

But their commitments and initiatives demonstrate the energy transition is nevertheless now underway and augmenting business as usual, even as the destination for each of them remains unclear."

CMS,Germany: Effective activation of apps on prescription: Regulator tells...,"On 26 February 2024 a deadline ended that could prove important to manufacturers of digital health applications ( DiGA ) in Germany.

The German regulator in this space, the Federal Office for Social Security ( Bundesamt für Soziale Sicherung , BAS), had urged health insurance funds to amend their operating procedures to ensure that apps on prescription can be activated effectively by patients.

The claim of patients to DiGA was implemented in German law by the Digital Healthcare Act of 3 June 2021.

DiGA supplement the catalogue of possible treatments in the event of illness for which the costs are covered by the public health insurance funds.

A DiGA can be provided either after a doctor's prescription or after approval by the health insurance fund.

Even if a DiGA is prescribed by a doctor, the respective health insurance fund is still involved in the process.

Because the patient receives the activation code for the prescribed DiGA from the health insurance fund on presentation of the prescription.

Only then can the insured person download the app or open the web application.

It has become established practice for health insurance funds companies to check the economic necessity of prescribing the DiGA, and, if it considers the provision of the DiGA not economically reasonable, to restrict the insured person's access to the DiGA.

This may obviously be contradictory to the prescription made by the treating doctor and this clash with the medical assessment.

For patients, such subsequent and unpredictable access restriction can lead to a negation of care, although the legislator originally intended that insured persons should be able to contact the developer directly without the intermediary of the health insurance fund.

For DiGA manufacturers the practice can entail a potential loss of revenue.

The practice established by several public health insurance funds had been controversially discussed in 2023 already.

In June 2023 the BAS published a first statement in this context (see here: Vermerk RL-SB (bundesamtsozialesicherung.de) .

In November 2023 it reiterated its position, pointing out that health insurance funds are generally prohibited from interfering with the doctor's decision to prescribe (see here: Prüfung der Notwendigkeit von verordneten Digitalen Gesundheitsanwendungen (DiGA) nach § 33a SGB V - www.bundesamtsozialesicherung.de ).

In individual cases - if there are justified doubts about the necessity or cost-effectiveness of the prescription - they have the option of submitting the doctor's prescription to the independent Medical Service ( Medizinischer Dienst ) for examination as to its necessity.

However, they do not have their own substantive right of review.

This is a strong and unusual signal to  the health insurance funds.

The BAS has explicitly asked them to amend their operating procedures and to hand in their modified procedures to BAS by 26 February 2024.

It will be interesting and of high practical relevance to see how the insurance funds react and whether the process of activating apps on prescription will be run more smoothly soon."
CMS,EU creates regulatory framework for crypto-asset service providers,"The EU regulation on markets in crypto-assets ( MiCAR ) sets down a harmonised regulatory framework for service providers, known as crypto-asset service providers ( CASP s), carrying out activities in relation to crypto-assets falling within the regulation's scope.

Under MiCAR, CASPs are subject to authorisation requirements and supervision by relevant national authorities.

Furthermore, CASPs are bound by prudential and organisational requirements along with the obligation to abide by rules of conduct in the provision of their services.

This regulatory framework ensures not only the protection of customers but also a level playing field among service providers.

The following article briefly summarises these requirements.

Authorisation requirements The long-awaited crypto licensing obligation MiCAR introduces a harmonised and uniform licensing process for CASPs, facilitating the pursuit of crypto business on a EU level and putting an end to disparities between national regimes.

More specifically, the following service providers will be subject to authorisation requirements: Custody services providers , which safekeep or control the client’s crypto-assets or the means of access to them (e.g. private keys).

Trading platforms operators , which manage a multilateral system that facilitates the bringing together of buying and selling interests for crypto-assets.

Exchange services providers , which conclude purchase/sale contracts concerning crypto-assets against funds or other crypto-assets by using proprietary capital.

Broker-dealers, which conclude agreements to buy/sell or subscribe crypto-assets on behalf of clients.

Broker-dealers can also receive an order from the client to buy/sell or subscribe crypto-assets and transmit this order to a third party for execution.

Placers, which market crypto-assets for purchase, on behalf of or for the account of the offeror or of a party related to the offeror.

Transfer providers, which transfer, on behalf of a client, crypto-assets from one distributed ledger address or account to another.

Advisors, which provide personalised recommendations to a client for transactions relating to crypto-assets, or the use of crypto-asset services.

Portfolio managers , which manage portfolios in accordance with mandates given by clients on a discretionary basis where such portfolios include crypto-assets.

The process for obtaining an authorisation is detailed under MiCAR, including the checklist of information and attachments to be provided.

As part of the application process, information relating to the legal form of the entity, a description of the internal governance framework, programme of operations, identity of shareholders, etc. will need to be communicated to the relevant competent authority.

Upon receiving a complete application file, the relevant competent authority has a period of assessment during which it will examine the request, prior to granting (or refusing) the authorisation.

Authorisation upon notification for (already) authorised entities The European legislator foresees a simplified authorisation procedure for certain regulated entities, including investment firms, credit institutions and e-money institutions, wishing to add crypto-asset services to their existing services portfolio.

Regulated entities will be able to extend their authorisation onto MiCAR services upon a notification to be submitted to the local regulator at least 40 working days before the intended start of the provision of crypto-asset services.

Reverse solicitation MiCAR explicitly recognises the concept of reverse solicitation in relation to crypto-asset services, similarly to the equivalent provision under Directive 2014/65/EC of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments ( MiFID II )."
CMS,EU creates regulatory framework for crypto-asset service providers,"More specifically, if a client based in the EU initiates at its own exclusive initiative the provision of a crypto-asset service or activity by a third‐country firm, the authorisation requirement under MiCAR will not apply to the provision of that crypto-asset service or activity, including a relationship specifically relating to the provision of that crypto-asset service or activity.

A client’s own exclusive initiative does not, however, allow the marketing of new types of crypto-assets or crypto-asset services to that client.

Passport

Once a CASP has obtained authorisation to provide crypto-asset services in a member state, it may passport such authorisation in another EU member state.

It will thus be authorised to provide its services throughout the EU, either through the right of establishment (branch) or the freedom to provide services (i.e. cross-border provision of services).

Bearing in mind that many CASPs operate digitally, by way of platforms and service clients established throughout the EU, being able to rely on the EU passport is a definite advantage introduced by MiCAR. Obligations for CASPs Once authorised, CASPs are subject to prudential and organisational requirements as well as rules of conduct, similar to the requirements applicable to investment firms under MiFID II.

Prudential and organisational requirements Similar to other types of entities in the financial sector, CASPs will be bound by prudential and organisational requirements.

These requirements are both general (i.e. applying to all types of CASPs) and specific, depending on the service provided.

In relation to the general requirements, CASPs are required to have prudential safeguards equal to an amount of at least the higher of either (i) the amount permanent minimum capital requirements, depending on the type of the crypto-asset services provided; or (ii) one quarter of the fixed overheads of the preceding year, reviewed annually.

These safeguards may take the form of either the CASP's own funds or an insurance policy.

Furthermore, CASPs must have adequate governance arrangements with effective policies and procedures (e.g. business continuity, complaint handling, management of conflicts of interest, outsourcing) and employees, which have the knowledge, skills and expertise necessary to carry out their tasks.

CASPs must ensure the continuity and regularity in the performance of their services.

CASPs are also bound by record-keeping obligations.

In relation to specific requirements, for example, CASPs that hold crypto-assets belonging to clients or the means to access such crypt-assets are required to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the ownership rights of clients and to prevent the use of clients’ crypto-asses for their own account.

Rules of conduct CASPs are required to act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interests of their clients and prospective clients.

Information provided must be fair, clear and not misleading and marketing communications must be identified as such.

Warnings regarding risks associated with transactions in crypto-assets must be communicated.

Certain information must be publicly available (e.g. policies on pricing, costs and fees).

Conclusion There is already a strong interest in the market for the regulatory regime available to CASPs under MiCAR.

While waiting for the application of the regulation's provisions, relevant players can adapt their business models to the new requirements set out under MiCAR.

We would expect that this new regulatory framework (alongside the DLT pilot regime and other relevant texts) marks a new era for crypto-asset service providers.

CMS,General purpose AI models and measures in support of innovation,"General purpose AI models (Chapter V  V, Art. 51-56) The AI Act is founded on a risk based approach.

This regulation, intended to be durable, initially wasn’t associated to the characteristics of any particular model or system, but to the risk associated with its intended use.

This was the approach when the proposal of the AI Act was drafted and adopted by the European Commission on 22 April, 2021, when the proposal was discussed at the  Council of the European Union on 6 December, 2022.

However, after the great global and historical success of generative AI tools in the months following the Commission’s proposal, the idea of regulating AI focusing only on its intended use seemed then insufficient.

Then, in the 14 June 2023 draft, the concept of “foundation models” (much broader than generative AI) was introduced with associated regulation.

During the negotiations in December 2023, some additional proposals were introduced regarding “very capable foundation models” and “general purpose AI systems built on foundation models and used at scale”.

In the final version of the AI Act, there is no reference to “foundation models”, and instead the concept of “general purpose AI models and systems” was adopted.

General Purpose AI models (Arts. 51 to 56 ) are distinguished from general purpose AI systems (Arts. 25 and 75).

The General Purpose AI systems are based on General Purpose AI models: “when a general purpose AI model is integrated into or forms part of an AI system, this system should be considered a general purpose AI system” if it has the capability to serve a variety of purposes (Recital 100).

And, of course, General Purpose AI models are the result of the operation of AI systems that created them.

“General purpose AI model” is defined in Article 3 (63) as “an AI model (…) that displays significant generality and is capable to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications”.

The definition lacks quality (a model is “general purpose” if it “displays generality” 1 Recital 98 contributes to clarify the concept saying that “generality” means the use of at least a billion of parameters, when the training of the model uses “a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale”. ) and has a remarkable capacity for expansion.

Large generative AI models are an example of General Purpose AI models (Recital 99).

The obligations imposed to providers of General Purpose AI models are limited, provided that they don’t have systemic risk.

Such obligations include (Art. 53 (I) (a)  (i) to draw up and keep up-to-date technical documentation (as described in Annex XI) available to the national competent authorities, as well as to providers of AI systems who intend to integrate the General Purpose AI system in their AI systems, and (ii) to take some measures in order to respect EU copyright legislation, namely to put in place a policy to identify reservations of rights and to make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used.

Furthermore, they should have an authorised representative in the EU (Art. 54).

The most important obligations are imposed in Article 55 to providers of General Purpose AI models with systemic risk.

The definition of AI models with systemic risk is established in Article 55 in too broad and unsatisfactory terms: “high impact capabilities”.

Fortunately, there is a presumption in Article 55.2 that helps: “ when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is greater than 10^25 ”."
CMS,General purpose AI models and measures in support of innovation,"Fortunately, there is a presumption in Article 55.2 that helps: “ when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is greater than 10^25 ”.

The main additional obligations imposed to General Purpose AI models with systemic risks are (i) to perform model evaluation (including adversarial testing), (ii) to assess and mitigate systemic risks at EU level, (iii), to document and report serious incidents and corrective measures, and (iv) to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity.

Finally, an “AI system” is “an AI system which is based on a General Purpose AI model, that has the capacity to serve a variety of purposes” (Art. 3 (66)).

If General Purpose AI systems can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk (Art. 75), an evaluation of compliance will need to be done."
CMS,On your radar | Issue 17,"This edition of On yo ur radar highlights important employment law developments expected in 2022 At the time of writing Omicron continues to cause chaos, but away from Covid-19, Chile discuss changes to their novel system of compulsory profit sharing by companies to consider alternative approaches.

Many European countries discuss the introduction of national laws to implement the EU Whistleblowing Directive .

While aimed at providing a common framework of protection, companies will need to understand the detail across locations relevant to them.

For example, as a result of Brexit the UK has not – so far – made changes to their existing system for protecting whistleblowers, and in Germany it has been announced that the new national law implementing the Directive will extend to areas of law outside the scope of the Directive.

Workplace vaccination remains a theme, with Peru refusing to allow employees to enter a workplace of more than ten employees unless they are fully vaccinated.

Many other countries are adopting a “3G” approach allowing entry to a workplace depending on proof of vaccination, recovery or testing negative for Covid-19.

A sectoral approach has been chosen by the UK , Belgium and Germany who are among the many countries mandating vaccination for health care workers.

The pandemic response continues to evolve, and other countries report that their governments are still weighing up how to deal with the unvaccinated in the workplace.

And finally, the Netherlands explain that from 1 January 2022 employers can provide a tax free allowance of EUR 2 a day for home workers to cover energy and coffee costs.

This may seem like a small issue of itself, but is a timely reminder for employers who are moving to longer term hybrid or otherwise ‘dispersed’ working models to be sure and take into account local tax, employment and health and safety laws.

It can be surprising how many variations there are, and we are seeing interesting points come up from the projects we are working on.

CMS,EU: First directive to combat greenwashing adopted and published in Official...,"On 6 March 2024, the EU published the first directive to combat greenwashing, which was adopted by the EU legislation institutions in February 2024, namely the “Directive amending Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empowering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information ("" Empowering Consumers Directive "").

The published Empowering Consumers Directive is available here .

The Empowering Consumer Directive provides for adaptations to Directive 2005/29/EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (""Unfair Commercial Practices Directive"") on the one hand, and Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights .

(""Consumer Rights Directive"").

Among other things, the adaptions cover significantly stricter regulations for the admissibility of environmental claims in advertising.

For example, there will be new specific per se bans on the use of sustainability labels, (generic) environmental claims and claims based on greenhouse gas emissions offsetting.

In addition, concrete requirements for the use of environmental claims related to future environmental performance will be established for the first time.

For providers of sustainability labels , the definition of ""certification scheme"" contained in the directive is also of particular importance, as they must ensure compliance with the requirements until the new regulations come into force in order to be able to continue to offer their sustainability labels on the European market.

The use of self-created sustainability labels will no longer be permitted in future.

The amendments to the Consumer Rights Directive also provide for increased information requirements for consumers regarding legal guarantees of conformity and commercial guarantees of durability of more than two years for goods (including goods with digital elements) as well as digital content and digital services.

New information requirements are also included on the reparability of goods.

These requirements are complemented by further new per se prohibitions in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, such as on specific unfair commercial practices in connection with claims regarding software updates, goods containing a feature introduced to limit its durability as well as durability and repairability.

The new directive has to be implemented into national law by the Member States until 27 March 2026 and will become binding on 27 September 2026."

Almost all are currently considering M&A.

Undervalued targets and distressed sales to drive activity: the biggest buy-side driver is expected to be the availability of undervalued deal targets, whilst on the sell-side it is expected to be distressed situations.

Cost of financing will increase: 87% of deal makers expect financing to be tighter compared with 2021 – this includes 45% who expect it to be much harder.

CMS,UK ad regulator publishes research on consumer understanding of green claims...,"A new report by the UK advertising regulator, the ASA, on environmental claims in food advertising, highlights the importance of being specific, and of thinking through the implications of claims.

While broad environmental statements are readily accepted, consumers increasingly want specifics and verifiable details to back them up.

Additionally, terminology and visuals can create unintended associations – for example, the word ""natural"" or pictures of fresh produce could suggest eco-friendly practices without explicit claims being made.

Interestingly, health and nutrition considerations are largely prioritised over environmental concerns as the primary drivers of food choices, with green claims resonating more for their perceived health benefits than their environmental impact.

This challenges the usual assumption that environmental factors are a top priority for consumers.

The ASA is taking action to address issues of vague and unsubstantiated environmental claims with stricter enforcement and new guidance materials, emphasising clear messaging for effective and compliant food advertising."
CMS,Handling the new EU sanctions against Russia,"Since 2014, the EU has progressively imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the war in Ukraine.

Following the Russian invasion into Ukraine in February 2022 and the ongoing military aggression, more comprehensive and robust sanctions have been imposed by the EU in eleven sanctions packages against Russia on 23 February, 25 February, 28 February/2 March, 15 March, 8 April, 3 June,21 July, 6 October, 16 December 2022, 25 February and 23 June 2023.

The measures include: individual sanctions (asset freezes, prohibition to provide funds or economic resources); economic sanctions (restrictions on exports, imports, transit and the provision of services); price cap on Russian oil; media sanctions; anti-circumvention measures.

The basic legal acts are Council Regulation (EU)

No 269/2014 (regarding individual sanctions) and Council Regulation (EU)

No 833/2014 (all other sanctions), as amended by each sanctions package.

In addition, the EU has stopped treating Russia as a Most-Favoured-Nation within the WTO framework as of 15 March 2022.

For the time being the EU decided not to increase import tariffs, but this could change in the future.

Individual Sanctions (Asset freeze and prohibition to provide funds or eco-nomic resources)

The EU has by now designated almost 1,800 individuals and legal entities, including: Approx.

1,550 individuals, including top political representatives such as Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov, members of the Russian State Duma, the Russian National Security Council and the Russian military, propagandists, political parties, media holdings as well as wealthy individuals and businesspeople (among them “oligarchs”) and their relatives and individuals considered to be responsible for atrocities committed in Bucha and Mariupol, missile strikes against civilians and critical infrastructure, kidnappings and subsequent illegal adoptions of Ukrainian children, recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to fight in Ukraine, members of the proxy governments of the illegally annexed Ukraine regions, facilitation of circumvention or for operating in the Russian IT-sector with a license administered by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), as well as Approx.

250 legal entities including 15 banks – Alfa Bank, Bank Rossiya, CMR Bank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Far Eastern Bank, MRB Bank Novikombank, Otkritie FC Bank, Promsvyazbank, Rosbank, Sberbank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff Bank, VEB/Vnesheconombank and VTB Bank.

The designated individuals are subject to: Travel ban preventing them from entering or transiting through the EU Asset freeze Prohibition on providing funds or economic resources.

The designated legal entities are subject to: Asset freeze Prohibition on providing funds or economic resources.

The European Commission takes the view that the asset freeze and the prohibition on providing funds or economic resources apply not only to the individuals and legal entities actually designated, but also to all entities owned or controlled by such designated persons, unless it can be demonstrated that the respective economic resources or funds are outside the control of the designated person, and/or that the funds or economic resources provided would in fact not reach or benefit the designated person.

In practice, this essentially means that EU companies may no longer deal with designated individuals or entities and the entities owned or controlled by them."
CMS,Handling the new EU sanctions against Russia,"In practice, this essentially means that EU companies may no longer deal with designated individuals or entities and the entities owned or controlled by them.

Economic Sanctions The EU has imposed various types of economic sanctions, such as: Restrictions on the export of goods and technologies Restrictions on imports of certain goods Restrictions on providing financing or financial assistance or otherwise on access to the EU capital markets SWIFT ban on certain Russian banks Prohibitions on providing rating or certain consultancy and advisory services (advertising, architecture, auditing, bookkeeping, engineering, IT, legal, management, marketing, PR, tax) Prohibitions on transactions with the Russian Central Bank Prohibitions on public financing or investment in Russia Prohibitions on investment/contribution to projects co-financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund Prohibition on providing certain services in the transport and logistics sectors (e.g. ban on road transport in the EU for Russian trucks, trailers and semi trailers, restriction or access to EU airspace and EU ports)

Prohibitions on the provision of banknotes denominated in any official currency of EU Member States to Russia Prohibitions on new investments in the Russian energy sector and Russian quarrying and mining sectors.

These sanctions apply to various industry sectors, as described in more detail below.

General restrictions on trade in goods and technologies The EU imposed restrictive measures regarding export and imports of various goods and technologies.

CMS,Handling the new EU sanctions against Russia,"All relevant licences, authorisations and distribution arrangements are suspended.

The advertising of products or services on sanctioned outlets has also been prohibited.

Anti-circumvention measures A novel circumvention tool allows the EU to restrict the sale, supply, transfer or export of goods and technology whose export to Russia is already prohibited – mostly battlefield products and technologies – to third countries that are expected to be used for circumvention.

The respective goods and technologies will be listed in Annex XXXIII Reg. 833/2014 according to CN codes and indicate the affected third country separately for each good.

For the time being Annex XXXIII Reg.

833/2014 remains empty and the EU has vowed to use this new tool only as a measure of last resort.

Decisions to include a country in that Annex require a unanimous decision by the Council, so it remains to be seen how quickly countries will be added to the Annex.

Restriction of trade with the regions of Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia The EU also has imposed restrictions on dealing with the non-government controlled areas of Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia by Council Regulation (EU) 2022/263.

The restrictions are much like the restrictions the EU has imposed on Crimea and Sevastopol since 2014 in Council Regulation (EU)

CMS,Turning the Corner? CMS European M&A Outlook 2024,"The report offers a comprehensive assessment of dealmaking sentiment in Europe’s M&A market and reflects the opinions of 330 corporates and PE firms based in Europe, the Americas and APAC about their expectations for the year ahead.

M&A activity in Europe this year has been entangled in higher inflation, rising interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook.

Against this backdrop, projections for M&A over the coming 12 months are undoubtedly mixed. 

Yet the vast majority of respondents to our survey anticipate engaging in M&A over the coming period, suggesting a healthy volume of activity in the near term.

And, as valuations appear to have stabilised over the course of 2023, the stage looks set for a meeting of minds between buyers and sellers over the medium term – at which point M&A may well start truly turning a corner.

Key findings of the report include: M&A expectations have moderated and diverged: dealmakers are showing greater hesitance overall about the prospects for European M&A than at this point last year, but views are undeniably mixed and a divergence has emerged between PE dealmakers and their corporate counterparts.

Macro backdrop weighs on dealmakers: respondents cite inflationary pressures and underlying economic weakness as key challenges to financing acquisitions over the next 12 months.

ESG scrutiny will create new deal opportunities: whilst respondents expect ESG scrutiny in M&A deals to increase, they believe ESG regulation will ultimately boost dealmaking in Europe.

Undervalued targets and turnaround opportunities: dealmakers cite these amongst the primary catalysts driving M&A activity in Europe for the coming year.

Digitalisation and the energy transition will drive activity: dealmakers predict the TMT and Energy sectors will experience the most significant surge in dealmaking across Europe.

Regional prospects have changed: expectations for M&A across the different regions of Europe have shifted considerably from last year."

The legal sector has a key role to play in global sustainability says United...

The United Nations has pledged to use its purchasing firepower to accelerate sustainability along the healthcare supply channel and called on the legal sector to support its efforts.

Lawyers are critical to establishing strong regulatory frameworks and providing contractual guidance that would allow greener and more equitable practices to flourish, said a senior UN executive.

Ian Milimo, project manager for the United Nations Development Programme’s regional hub for 128 nations, told the CMS Global Life Sciences & Healthcare Forum 2022, that the organisation would use its $6 billion of purchasing power to leverage improvements in healthcare.

He used his keynote address to highlight that, if the healthcare sector were a country it would be the fifth largest emitter of carbon, while also praising collaborations with legal experts that empowered countries, healthcare providers and suppliers to pursue carbon zero ambitions.

“We need to strengthen our contracts for goods that we procure for services.  

We don't have that expertise, you have that expertise, and this is an open call for you to join us in making sure that we are championing sustainable development,” he  told the Forum of invited guests from legal, financial and healthcare sectors.

“We need lawyers to sensitise citizens on their rights and responsibilities with regards to climate.

We need your support, we need your expertise, we need your technical ability to ensure that governments are supported to have a win-win situation in terms of sustainable de­vel­op­ment.

”Leg­al acumen will be needed to enhance access to technology, ensure privacy and security, establish regulatory frameworks and empower contract design across the healthcare supply chain.

This expertise will underpin the United Nations Sustainable Procurement in the Health Sector (SPS) programme which aims to encourage industry, manufacturers and suppliers to champion sustainability.

The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals include healthcare where a complex landscape of law and regulations demands legal skills across areas such as Intellectual Property, risk management, AI technology disputes and economic and social re­spons­ib­il­it­ies.

Lawyers are increasingly being called upon to develop policies, regulations and laws to protect the environment and public health, and have a positive impact helping emerging nations to develop sustainable practices.

“We need to make sure that we wake up to this crisis that we're facing and begin to address those things that are within our means and it's very good that we are speaking to lawyers because that partnership is very important,” added Mr Milimo.

“We need leadership from our politicians.

We need leadership from our church and healthcare to religious institutions.  

We need leadership from business.  

We need leadership from lawyers, we need leadership from all angles for us to achieve what we are trying to achieve.

“A partnership with an institution like CMS can only help us to move forward and can only make us have sustainable development on our agenda and we will need your help to ensure that we are supporting countries come up with very strong laws.”Dr

Roland Wiring, a life sciences partner and Head of Intellectual Property at CMS Hamburg, commented: “Governance, social responsibility and environmental protection risk is of course at the core of the ESG issues that pharma companies and tech companies face.  

What the UN does in this context, is impressive, and can also inspire, from our point of view both our work and the work of the clients of the industry.”

CMS,International Disputes Digest - 2022 Winter Edition,"Welcome to the winter edition of the International Disputes Digest, our bi-annual publication that considers and analyses current trends in global dispute-resolution and their wider impact.

With war raging in eastern Europe and no end to the conflict in sight, the world and the global economy continue to face complex challenges.  

In response to the invasion of Ukraine, Russian sanctions have impacted a world economy already suffering from supply-chain deficiencies and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Economic stresses have also been magnified by the decision of western countries to reduce reliance on Russian energy supplies, resulting in gasoline and natural gas shortages and widespread inflation in both the energy sector and the general economy.  

Although Ukraine's resilience on the battlefield raises the hope that the conflict will be resolved sooner rather than later, the international business community still faces a plethora of uncertainties.

In this edition, we feature a range of articles from around the world on topics as diverse as directors’ duties for companies in financial distress, potential reform of the English Arbitration Act 1996, and risk management in the life sciences sector.  

We also consider how businesses in the UK can take steps to protect themselves in a “season of protest” and the obtaining of evidence abroad for use in international arbitration, amongst other matters."

Changes range from big picture concepts around future ways of working, to the finer details of leave entitlements and statutory protections.

Both Belgium and Portugal discuss moves towards a 4-day working week , showing a consistent trend, while demonstrating different domestic approaches to achieving that – interesting to see whether other countries will follow either.

Another theme we continue to see coming through is ESG , and there are interesting sustainability aspects to that.

The Netherlands report that large employers will need to register their employees’ CO2 emissions from 1 July 2023 and file a report annually.

Undoubtedly this is an area where we expect to see more regulation of this type in the future.

Social security contributions, pension provisions and unemployment allowances are also covered in this edition, as countries around the world deal with challenging economic circumstances.

On a more optimistic note, the extent of global workforce mobility is apparent as countries change their visa requirements and rules around the employment of foreign nationals.

Singapore’s new rules are aimed at highly talented foreign nationals with the Spanish changes including provisions aimed at international “digital nomads” .

The United Arab Emirates also discusses the expansion of categories of work visa, which includes a remote working visa.

CMS,CMS Funds Group AI & Tech interviews,"This series of interviews focuses on the meaning of digitalisation, digital services and tokenisation within the funds sector, leveraging off the experience of various players in the ecosystem."
CMS,CMS Class Actions video series,"In this video series, CMS experts take a deep dive into the key insights detailed in our latest class actions report ."
CMS,Prohibited AI practices and high-risk AI systems,"Prohibited Artificial Intelligence practices (Chapter II, Art. 5) 1.

Introduction to the unacceptable risk category Article 5 categorises certain AI technologies as posing an “unacceptable risk” ( Unacceptable Risk ).

Unlike other risk categories outlined in the AI Act, the use of AI technologies that fall within this category is strictly prohibited (""Prohibited AI Systems"").

It is therefore necessary to distinguish between: those technologies that are clearly prohibited; and those AI applications that are not clearly prohibited but may involve similar risks.

The most challenging problem in practice is to ensure that activities, which are not prohibited, do not become Unacceptable Risk activities and therefore prohibited.

2.

Unacceptable Risk: Prohibited AI practices Article 5 explicitly bans harmful AI practices: The first prohibition under Article 5 addresses systems that manipulate individuals or exploit their vulnerabilities, leading to physical or psychological harm.

Accordingly, it would be prohibited to place on the market, put into services or use in the EU: AI systems designed to deceive, coerce or influence human behaviour in harmful ways; and AI tools that prey on an individual’s weaknesses, exacerbating their vulnerabilities.

The second prohibition covers AI systems that exploit these vulnerabilities, even if harm is not immediate.

Examples include: AI tools that compromise user privacy by collecting sensitive data without consent; and AI algorithms that perpetuate bias or discrimination against certain groups.

The third prohibition focuses on the use of AI for social scoring.

Social scoring systems assign scores to individuals based on their behaviour, affecting access to services, employment or other opportunities.

Prohibited practices include: AI-driven scoring mechanisms that lack transparency, fairness or accountability; and Systems that discriminate based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion).

The fourth prohibition covers biometric real-time identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes.

This includes: AI systems that identify individuals without their knowledge or consent; and Continuous monitoring of people’s movements using biometric data.

3. Clearly listed: Best practices and compliance Transparency and accountability are essential in complying with the prohibitions under Article 5.

Firms using AI must design and continuously test systems, be transparent about their intensions and avoid manipulative practices.

They should also disclose AI systems functionality, data usage, and decision-making processes.

Companies should conduct thorough impact assessments to identify unintended vulnerabilities and implement specific safeguards to prevent exploitation.

This should form part of assessments of AI systems to understand their impact on individuals and society.

Companies should develop clear guidelines for scoring systems to prevent the development of social scoring characteristics, and prioritise ethical design, fairness and non-discrimination.

Privacy impact assessments should be pursued to ensure compliance with the various prohibitions.

In particular, firms should be very careful using any real-time identification systems.

In all cases, companies should maintain comprehensive records of AI system design, training, and deployment.

Any critical decision made by AI systems should be overseen by a human.

4. Not clearly listed: Categorisation Unacceptable Risk AI systems cover systems that are deemed inherently harmful and are considered a threat to human safety, livelihoods, and rights In contrast, high-risk AI systems cover systems designed to be applied to specific use cases, including using AI for hiring and recruitment that may cause harm but are not inherently harmful.

High risk AI systems are legal, but subject to important requirements under the AI Act."
CMS,Prohibited AI practices and high-risk AI systems,"High risk AI systems are legal, but subject to important requirements under the AI Act.

It is therefore crucial to determine the difference between high risk and unacceptable risk AI systems.

In essence, any high risk activity can escalate to Unacceptable Risk under the following circumstances: Bias and Discrimination : if AI perpetuates bias or discriminates against protected groups.

Privacy Violations : when AI systems compromise user privacy or misuse sensitive data.

Psychological Harm : if AI manipulates individuals, causing psychological distress.

AI systems that are able to perform generally applicable functions and are able to have multiple intended and unintended purposes (being General Purpose AI models) are not inherently prohibited under the AI Act, but must be used with care since in certain scenarios they lead to Unacceptable Risk activities.

To assess whether a General Purpose AI Model poses an Unacceptable Risk, it is necessary to consider the context in which the model operates.

If it influences critical decisions (e.g. hiring, credit scoring), perpetuates bias or discriminates, compromises user privacy (e.g. by collecting sensitive data without consent), the risk increases, and the model may need to be adapted.

5. Best practice and compliance While the AI Act provides examples of explicit prohibitions under the AI Act, it cannot cover all possible situations as the technology is, through updated versions and by definition, constantly evolving.

As a guide, legal and compliance teams should ask the following questions when considering high- risk AI systems: Risk assessment: What is the evidence that the categorisation of the AI application is minimal, limited, high or Unacceptable Risk?

Does the application in any circumstances use or act on sensitive data or influence critical decisions?

Contextual analysis: Does the application operate in a sector that has a presumption of increased risk, for example, (a) financial services, or (b) healthcare?

In what ways does the deployment of the application impact (a) individuals, and (b) society?

Specific criteria: Can any decisions of the application be considered to give rise to manipulation, exploitation, discriminatory scoring, or biometric identification?

Does the application operate or have access to data that could give rise to the exploitation of subliminal techniques or vulnerabilities related to protracted characteristics, such as age or disability?

Transparency and Documentation: In what ways is the AI system transparent about its inherent functioning and decision-making?

In what ways does the user’s documentation of the design, training and deployment of the application demonstrate compliance with the various rules?

6. Conclusion Unacceptable Risk AI activities are those practices that pose inherent harm to people and are strictly forbidden under the AI Act.

The potential for reputational damage and regulatory sanctions serve as strong deterrents for firms to avoid breaching these provisions of the AI Act.

It is essential for companies to take proactive measures to ensure compliance and prevent harm to individuals and society."
CMS,Germany: New decision concerning CO2 positive and climate neutral production...,"In another case concerning, inter alia, the green claims “CO2 positive” (“CO2 positiv”) and “climate neutral production” (“klimaneutrale Herstellung”), the Munich Regional Court (LG München I) on December 8, 2023 held that an advertisement with these claims and without immediately recognizable further information regarding the background of the claims to be misleading (case no.

37 O 2041/23).

The defeated brewery added a QR code on the bottles which allegedly lead the relevant consumer to a website that provided information about the significance of the carbon footprint and the defendants’ measures in this regard.

This, however, was insufficient in the eyes of the court.

As other courts before, the Munich Regional Court stated that consumers would have a significant interest in the extent to which the respective claimed climate neutrality is actually achieved.

This would be particularly the case as offsetting measures would nowadays often be at the center of public debate.

That being said, the court concluded that the assessment criteria for the claims “CO2 positive” and “climate-neutral production” would have to be provided and disclosed on the beer bottle itself, which was not the case in the present matter.

The claims “CO2 positive” and “climate-neutral production” did not contain any indication that further information would be available on a homepage.

The QR code was “also not printed in such a close spatial connection to the environmental advertising that it would be readily apparent to the customer that the information they need would be available in this way”.

A reference by way of a clear and unambiguous link was thus missing.

Eventually, the QR code in question did not lead directly to a website explaining the climate-friendly measures, but rather to the defendant's general homepage from where consumers would have to click through to the desired information on climate neutrality measures.

Ultimately, the court held the provided information on climate neutrality as being insufficient.

Precise information on the calculated carbon footprint and on the extent to which climate neutrality is to be achieved through offsetting measures or through savings were missing.

CMS,On your radar | Issue 19,"The new EU Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions is mentioned frequently in this edition of On your radar.

Belgium, Germany, Italy and Slovakia all share the key points of their national laws implementing the directive.

The common theme for employers is the need to update contracts of employment, and the process for doing so.

For more information on the implementation of this directive across the EU please refer to the CMS Employment team overview .

Like all directives, while the themes are common across EU borders, each country has variations in the way in which the directive has been transposed, which will need to be considered at a national level.

Several countries also discuss the new directive on work-life balance which was also supposed to be implemented across the EU this summer; another legislative measure reflecting the challenges of modern ways of working and increased desire to manage this.

France shares workplace measures to help support the purchasing power of French households as countries across the world face rising inflation .

In the UK inflationary pressure is one key factor that has resulted in an increase in industrial action in recent months.

To minimise disruption caused by strikes, new legislation has been brought in to allow UK employers to hire agency workers to replace striking workers.

Both China and Singapore explain their proposals to improve diversity and inclusion .

Singapore is planning to change guidelines on discrimination into legislation, with China planning new legislation on eliminating discrimination against women and preventing sexual harassment.

This is a topic we explore in depth in our recent CMS Expert Guide on Discrimination. 

Finally, Belgium outline an interesting way of detecting discrimination; by allowing labour inspectors to carry out mystery calls or anonymous practical tests.

CMS,"Hey, Copyright Directive","While designed to protect contributors with unequal bargaining power, the Copyright Directive’s package of measures introduces great uncertainty into long-established industry structures.

Further, the significant discretion given to Member States means that, far from increasing harmonisation, the Directive will result in further fragmentation of EU copyright law.

Watch this video series where CMS copyright lawyers consider how the many parts of the Directive are likely to have an impact across the creative industries."
CMS,DeFi and MiCA: How much decentralisation is enough?,"The European Union Council has recently adopted a regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) that applies to crypto-assets, their issuers and service providers, and covers a range of services that are not addressed in the European financial regulation.

However, for blockchain-based financial services developed in a highly automated manner with minimal or no intermediaries (commonly known as Decentralised Finance or DeFi ) determining whether the MiCA regulation covers these services is not a straightforward task.

This issue particularly challenges the provision of crypto-asset exchange services or the operation of trading platforms for crypto-assets (known as decentralised exchanges or DEX ).

Only partially decentralised crypto services are subject to the MiCA regulation while fully decentralised services provided without intermediaries are excluded from its scope.

The challenge lies in the fact that players in the DeFi market operate across a spectrum of decentralisation.

So it is not clear when decentralisation transitions from being partial to full .

In practice, “decentralisation"" is not a binary fact, and this circumstance has generated a heated debate in the crypto industry that to this day discusses what the content and scope of this concept should be.

So, what are we to understand by “full” decentralisation within MiCA?

Since blockchain services are built on a series of layers and compartments that enable their operation, it is difficult to establish a priori at which layer or compartment the level of decentralisation is relevant for regulatory purposes.

For example, should we be concerned with decentralisation at the infrastructure level, or should decentralisation also extend to the front end and custody?

On the other hand, it is reasonable to think that decentralisation for the MiCA regulation is not just a question of how many nodes or physical computers support the service, but rather a political question of how many individuals control it and how they control it.

Ultimately, what should matter is that many players control the network (and its underlying protocols) and make their decisions independently.

But how many players and how much control must each have for a service to be fully decentralised?

Should there be a ratio between validator nodes, ownership, transactions or other factors to assess decentralisation (e.g. the Nakamoto coefficient)?

In this scenario, in the absence of specific guidelines, crypto service providers will need to determine for themselves where on the decentralisation spectrum their business model no longer qualifies as being only partially decentralised.

The European Commission has already been asked to present a further assessment of decentralised finance, which is likely to shed light on this matter.

However, given the dynamic nature of these technologies, the open interpretation of concepts such as ""decentralisation,"" ""distribution,"" ""intermediation"" and the associated semantic difficulties, a continuous flow of soft-law instruments and guidelines will be necessary to provide interpretative tools.

Such guidelines can serve as a flexible mechanism to implement the MiCA regulation in this area and would also be useful in providing and applying common interpretations internationally.

An article on theoretical considerations about the term “decentralised” will follow shortly.

CMS,CMS European Energy Sector M&A and Investment Outlook 2024,"As the world economy increasingly embraces the push towards decarbonisation , Europe has actively sought to place itself at the vanguard of the discussion on energy transition.

Opportunities to deploy capital abound as power sources switch further towards offshore and onshore wind, solar, heat, hydrogen, battery storage, new networks, carbon capture, and industrial decarbonisation.

The latter brings an interface with other sectors such as technology companies (with power hungry data centres a particular focus), real estate, low carbon transport and decarbonisation of industrial processes such as cement, glass and steel production.

As much as it is difficult, complex and highly political, the energy transition is also a huge business opportunity .

To reach net zero by 2050, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global investment in clean energy alone will need to increase from the USD390bn in the first half of 2023, to USD 1.3tn in 2030.

Many commentators worried that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would put back the transition and shift Europe back towards fossil fuels.

While it appears to have resulted in a renewed political focus on energy security it has also laid bare the financial and political consequences of relying on oil & gas imports, giving further impetus to renewables as a secure form of energy.

Europe has also sought to be a leading light on the concept of “reaching net zero” , with the European Union (EU) having set out its ambition, back in 2019, to become the world’s first major economic bloc to be climate-neutral by 2050.

This has added momentum to energy investment and M&A over recent years – 2021 and 2022 saw the second and third highest annual aggregate values of Western European M&A in the sector on record, at USD 59.8bn and USD 53.7bn, respectively, bested only by the anomalously high total of USD 89.4bn logged in 2018.

Energy M&A in the region has been more subdued in 2023, but our survey demonstrates that energy executives are gearing up for a more active dealmaking period, with most expecting more opportunities and anticipating increased levels of investment in the year ahead.

Capital looks set to continue to flow primarily to renewable energy projects and related assets, with solar and batteries topping the list of attractive subsectors among our respondents.

Consistent with this, South West Europe takes pole position as the most promising region for investment opportunities.

But there are thorns among the roses.

Our respondents are cognizant of the challenges in the energy market, with supply-chain volatility and commodity price increases emerging as a prominent concern.

This is unsurprising after a period of dislocation following the pandemic and amid a time of rising global demand for renewable products and commodities.

Persistent inflation and elevated interest rates, combined with an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, are raising investors’ concerns, with financing risk (including the increased cost of financing) also coming to the fore for respondents.

Overall, while some sense a recent softening of the market due to these fundamentals, our survey paints a picture of steadily improving investor sentiment in Europe’s energy sector, laying the foundations for a busier period ahead for M&A activity."
CMS,Time for transition: Energy M&A 2022,"While world leaders have been gathering for COP meetings for decades, what made COP26 perhaps particularly notable is that the private sector also gathered in force, and with a commitment and determination to be a key driver in the decarbonisation of the world’s economies.

In previous years, there have been murmurings from various corporates that to make social or environmentally driven investment decisions may not align with their fiduciary duty to act in the interests of shareholders.

As shareholder activism has driven the debate into boardrooms from above, this attitude is rapidly reversing direction.

While returns are generally seen as lower in the clean sector compared to, say, the oil & gas sector, being invested in the green transition is increasingly seen as a key route to preserving and protecting shareholder value.

At the same time, voluntary and mandatory climate related disclosures are aligning the drivers for investors across the board so that capital is increasingly driven by the metrics they produce.  

This is being reflected in, among other things, the plummeting cost of capital for green investments.

At the same time high carbon intensive investments, such as coal based projects and businesses, are struggling to secure funding, with many facing insolvency.

Investments in the energy transition, a key part of the green transition, will principally take the form of M&A.

The outcome of COP26 and the momentum it has generated means that European dealmakers in the energy sector will be even busier in 2022.

Europe leads the world in the energy transition and the race to net zero is driving near-record levels of dealmaking – notably in wind and solar photovoltaic generation.

At the same time, the energy transition is both expanding and fragmenting the energy sector.

For many, it has traditionally been focused on energy generation.

The transition is bringing to the fore less visible technologies.

Everything from traditional hydropower to grid-scale batteries, electrification of transport and hydrogen.

It is also bringing into the mix sectors that have not traditionally been focused on energy, such as industrial decarbonisation, shipping and mining for the natural resources needed for the energy transition.

In parallel with this, there is a huge and growing story around energy transmission and distribution.

Electricity networks will need to expand massively to facilitate electrification and new technologies.

They are also becoming smarter with the use of digital technology to optimise the way power is distributed, traded and consumed.

Further, new types of networks may provide investment opportunities for those looking for stable long term assets, such as hydrogen and carbon networks.

Against this background, traditional fossil fuel-based players are decarbonising their operations.

For the oil and gas majors, this means acquiring or significantly enhancing their capabilities in renewables, including wind, solar and hydrogen, while simultaneously divesting selected carbon-intensive assets in response to mounting ESG pressures.

This may be one of the reasons why 50% of respondents in our study point to distress-driven deals as a top sell-side driver.

Change is endemic in the energy sector, but the current transition makes the years since liberalisation of energy markets in the late 1980s seem almost steady-state in comparison.

Despite the momentum and push for capital to be invested in the energy transition, there remain obstacles, not least the limited pipeline of good quality investment opportunities, continuing concerns over lockdowns and COVID-19 variants, financing difficulties arising from potentially unstable long term revenue streams and diminishing rates of return.

Notwithstanding these challenges, our study finds that energy sector M&A will increasingly be an engine driving capital into propositions that match social and political ambitions for the green transition."
CMS,Time for transition: Energy M&A 2022,"Key findings Energy remains a premium asset class for most institutional investors, with its performance during the pandemic and impetus from COP26 further enhancing its attractiveness 75% of energy companies are considering an acquisition and/or divestment in 2022 Alongside premium assets, in some subsectors there are undervalued targets driving buy-side activity, with sellers shedding distressed assets as the sector shifts in response to the energy transition 45% think COVID-19 will be a major M&A obstacle in 2022, but this remains a fluid situation that can change rapidly"

CMS,Focusing on Funds: ELTIFs and LTAFs,"Background Both focus on investing in long-term and illiquid assets in areas such as venture capital, private equity, private debt, real estate and infrastructure.

These long-term assets are not typically traded on public markets and so are not subject to continual daily opportunities to buy and sell them.

Investment usually requires a long-term commitment.

These types of funds need to be authorised by their regulator and are subject to investment restriction rules set out in their respective regulatory framework.

Reasons for Change ELTIFs failed to meet their original intended success due to restrictive features and not having the same international brand recognition as UCITS.

However, they are starting to become more popular within the EEA.

This is in part due to the reforms of the ELTIF regulation (as discussed further below) which is intended to increase flexibility.

Another factor in increased interest in these funds is because the reforms make it easier for retail investors to invest in ELTIFs by removing some barriers to entry.

As private funds managers are increasingly looking to access retail capital, especially high net worth investors, we can expect to see more of these funds.

The table below shows a breakdown of where ELTIFs are currently domiciled: In the UK market we can see a similar trend.

In July 2023, the Government laid legislation to repeal the European Long-Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) Regulation, which will come into force from 1 January 2024.

This will not be replaced, because no ELTIFs have been established in the UK, and the new UK LTAF regime and recent FCA reforms enabling wider distribution provide an alternative fund structure better suited to the needs of the UK market.

Since the launch of the first LTAF earlier this year, there has been an uptick in interest for the LTAF and this may grow with the FCAs recent amendments to the distribution of LTAF units.

Key Features Comparison Below we set out some comparisons of the key features of these funds.

It should be noted that most of the ELTIF features described below will only start applying as from 10 January 2024 which is the date of application of the new Regulation (EU) 2023/606 (ELTIF Amending Regulation) 1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R0606&qid=1680537336258&from=en , which amends the current ELTIF framework.

CMS,ARTs in detail,"EU regulation MICAR now regulates asset-referenced tokens 1. 

DEFINITION OF ARTS MiCAR defines Asset-referenced tokens ( ARTs ) as a type of crypto-asset that is not an electronic money token and that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing another value or right or a combination thereof, including one or more official currencies.

Knowing which crypto-assets fall under the MiCAR definition of ARTs is the first step in determining which regime will apply to the crypto-asset white papers, issuers’ licensing, reserve assets and own capital requirements .

The classification between the different categories of crypto-assets under MiCAR is based on the risks they entail and whether the crypto-assets seek to stabilise their value by reference to other assets.

Both ARTs and e-money tokens purport to maintain a stable value by reference to other assets, while the third catch-all category of other crypto-assets does not pursue such function through collateralisation.

Algorithmic stablecoins, which are not backed by reserve assets will not classify as ARTs.

The demarcation line between e-money tokens and ARTs is drawn by the type of reference assets.

E-money tokens may refer only to a single fiat currency while ARTs may refer to a broader class of assets, including baskets of goods, commodities, other crypto-assets, a combination of such assets or fiat currencies.

ARTs cover only crypto-assets, which do not qualify as e-money tokens.

In contrast to e-money tokens, ARTs may refer to a fiat currency only in combination with other fiat currencies or a basket of assets.

To ensure the regulation is future proof, the final version of the definition of ARTs under MiCAR includes a broad reference to the scope of possible collateral assets.

However, such a broad reference allows for a large variety of reference assets, which means that the price of some types of reference assets may fluctuate.

The intended function of ARTs as a means of exchange as opposed to store of value and investment instrument is reflected in the prohibition for the issuers and crypto-asset service providers to grant interest on the holding of ARTs.

The European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) will publish guidelines on the criteria for distinction between crypto-assets, and in particular ARTs, under MiCAR and financial instruments under the Directive on markets financial instruments ( MiFID II ).

2.AUTHORISATION:

REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS Firms issuing ARTs must be incorporated and licensed under MiCAR within the territory of the EU .

Therefore, non-EU entities issuing ARTs currently in the EU should act now to establish a company in a EU member state and obtain a license, given that the authorisation process is time-consuming.

Firms based in the EU already offering ARTs but are not authorised should analyse if their activities could be and to what degree covered by MiCAR requirements in order to prepare for licensing before MiCAR comes into force.

Validity of ART license for the entire European Union Offering to the public and admission to trading of ARTs will require an authorisation .

The issuer of ARTs must be: a legal person or undertaking established in the EU that has obtained a license by the Competent Authority ( CA ) of its home member state; or already licensed credit institution (which does not need a special authorisation, but must comply with certain rules).

The authorisation gives access to the European passport.

It means that the license granted by the home regulator is valid across the entire EU and allows an issuer of ARTs to offer to the public, throughout the EU, the ART for which it has been authorised or to admit to trading such ART on a crypto platform.

Exemptions"
CMS,ARTs in detail,"Exemptions

The rules stated above on who can issue ARTs will not apply: if the offer to the public of ARTs is addressed solely to and can only be held by qualified investors; or the average outstanding value of issued ARTs does not exceed EUR 5 million (or the equivalent amount in another official currency) over a 12-month period.

Application for authorisation and assessment The authorisation process involves detailed investigation of the application submitted by the issuer to the regulator and extends to, among other things, information on the issuer, a programme of operations setting out the business model adopted, a crypto-asset white paper, governance arrangements and a number of policies and procedures (e.g. BCP, internal control mechanism and risk management policy, safeguarding data procedure, etc.).

The documentation and data to be filed under the licensing procedure will be further specified in the regulatory technical standards to be developed by the European Banking Authority ( EBA ) in close cooperation with ESMA and the European Central Bank ( ECB ).

Although formally the timeframe for issuing the draft decision by the regulator is 60 working days from the receipt of a complete application, it is likely that the final authorisation would be in the range of a few months of minimal processing period, given the involvement of EBA, ESMA and ECB (or relevant central bank) in the process.

The regulator could refuse authorisation where there are objective and demonstrable grounds that the issuer fails to meet MiCAR’s requirements or that the issuer’s business model might pose a serious threat to market integrity, financial stability, systems for the smooth operation of payment, or exposes the issuer or the sector to serious risks of money laundering and terrorist financing.

3.WHITE PAPER The white paper should contain all information concerning the issuer, the ART itself and the offer of ARTs or their admission to trading that is necessary to enable prospective buyers to make an informed purchase decision and understand the risks relating to the offer of ARTs.

The crypto-asset white paper must contain detailed information about the issuer and the ART, which includes detailed information on certain technical, environmental, financial and legal aspects of the ARTs.

The whitepaper has to be clear, fair and not misleading.

The white paper will need to be published on the issuer’s website.

If the issuer does not meet the obligations regarding the quality of the content, the management or CA may be liable to a holder of ARTs.

Compliance with the obligations for an ART white paper is essential for issuers of ARTs.

Failure to meet these obligations may result in liability for the management of the issuer .

The issuer is obliged to publish and notify a crypto-asset white paper to the relevant supervising authority.

The white paper should contain all the information about the issuer of the ART, the ART itself, the offer to the public of the ART or its admission to trading, the rights and obligations attached to the ART, the underlying technology, the risks, the reserve of assets and the principal adverse impacts on the climate and other environment-related impacts of the consensus mechanism used to issue the ART.

Furthermore, the white paper must contain a clear and unambiguous statement that the ART may lose its value in part or in full, that it may not always be transferable, that it may not be liquid, and that the ART is not covered by investor compensation schemes and deposit guarantee schemes.

The white paper will need to be published on the issuer’s website.

The information mentioned in the white paper should be fair, clear and not misleading and should be presented in a concise and comprehensible manner.

If the issuer fails to do so, the management body of the issuer may be liable to a holder of the ART for any loss due to that infringement.

4.OBLIGATIONS FOR ART ISSUERS"
CMS,ARTs in detail,"If the issuer fails to do so, the management body of the issuer may be liable to a holder of the ART for any loss due to that infringement.

4.OBLIGATIONS FOR ART ISSUERS

In order to ensure the stable value of their ARTs, issuers must establish and maintain reserves of assets that support the value of their ARTs.

There are also requirements regarding the own funds of the issuer of ARTs.

These issuers are required to have own funds equal to an amount of at least the highest of the following: EUR 350,000; 2% of the average amount of the reserve of assets; or a quarter of the fixed overheads of the preceding year.

The marketing communications relating to the issuance of ARTs also must comply with certain requirements.

Issuers of ARTs must carefully assess the financial requirements related to the issuance of their tokens, taking into account the reserve of assets and own funds requirements .

Reserve of assets and prudential requirements Issuers of ARTs must establish and maintain an asset reserve at all times.

The composition and management of the reserve should effectively mitigate the risks linked to the assets referenced by the ARTs and address the liquidity risks following from the ongoing redemption rights of the token holders.

The reserve of assets should be separated from the issuer's assets and from the reserve of assets of other ARTs.

Furthermore, issuers should establish and implement custody policies, procedures and contractual arrangements regarding the reserve assets.

These reserve assets may be invested by the issuer.

However, a part of the reserve of assets must only be invested in highly liquid financial instruments with minimal risk.

As stated before, there are also requirements regarding the own funds of the issuer of asset-refences tokens.

These issuers are required to have own funds equal to an amount of at least the highest of the following: EUR 350,000; 2% of the average amount of the reserve of assets; or a quarter of the fixed overheads of the preceding year.

The CA of the home member state may require an issuer of an ART to hold an amount of own funds up to 20% higher than the amount if it considers that there is an increased risk in relation to the tokens or assets held.

Other obligations for ART issuers The marketing communications relating to the issuance of ARTs must comply with certain requirements.

The marketing must be clearly identifiable as such and provide accurate and transparent information that aligns with the white paper.

Furthermore, the marketing should clearly disclose the publication of a white paper and provide contact details for the issuer's website, telephone number, and email address.

The marketing communications should be notified to the relevant CA upon request.

5.SIGNIFICANT

ASSET REFERENCED TOKENS Issuers of ARTs need to consider the criteria on significant ARTs in order to be prepared to comply with the related additional obligations set in MiCAR.

Under any circumstance, if the ART complies with at least three of the characteristics of a significant token, it will be classified as such.

The following are some of these characteristics: The size of the client base of the asset referenced token is greater than 10 million; The value of the ART issued, its market capitalisation (if any) or the size of the reserve of assets of the issuer of the ART exceeds EUR 5 billion; The issuer of the ART is a central platform service provider designated as a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Regulation.

The CAs have the obligation to report to the EBA the information about the significant ARTs at least twice a year.

The EBA will make the final decision and will notify the issuers of such tokens.

The main consequences for the issuers of significant ARTs will be to comply with additional obligations related to the remuneration policy, assessment, and monitoring of liquidity needs or to hold an average amount of reserves of at least 3%."
CMS,ARTs in detail,"Subsequently , issuers of ARTs must carefully assess the criteria that could classify ARTs as significant , taking into account the period during which the CA must report to the EBA.

ARTs may be classified as significant as long as they meet at least three of the following criteria : The size of the client base of the asset-referenced token is greater than 10 million; The value of the ART issued, its market capitalisation (if any) or the size of the reserve of assets of the issuer of the ART exceeds EUR 5 billion; The average number and aggregate value of transactions in that ART per day during the relevant period, is higher than 2.5 million transactions and EUR 500 million respectively; The issuer of the ART is a central platform service provider designated as a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Regulation; The importance of the activities of the issuer of the ART on an international scale, including the use of the ART for payments and remittances; The interconnectedness of the ART or its issuers with the financial system; The fact that the same issuer issues at least one additional ART or e-money token, and provides at least one crypto-asset service.

In this regard, ARTs will be classified as significant during two possible periods covered by: The first report of information submitted by the CA to the EBA; or At least two consecutive reports of information submitted by the CA to the EBA.

Therefore, if the EBA considers the ARTs to be significant, it will prepare a draft decision to that effect and notify the issuers, making its final decision within 60 working days.

The consequences to be classified as significant ARTs is that ARTs’ issuers will have the subsequent additional obligations : Adopt a remuneration policy that promotes sound and effective risk management; A duty on issuers to ensure that these ARTs can be held in custody by different crypto-asset service providers authorised for providing custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of clients; A duty to assess and monitor the liquidity needs to meet potential redemption requests.

Thus, issuers of significant ARTs must establish, maintain and implement a liquidity management policy and procedures; Conduct liquidity stress testing on a regular basis; and Increase of the average amount of reserve assets to 3%.

Additionally, it should be noted that issuers applying for authorisation should indicate in their application that they wish to classify their ARTs as significant tokens, and demonstrating, by providing their programme of activities, that the requirements to be considered significant tokens will be met.

6.Conclusion MiCAR regulates for the first time the issuance of ARTs, which will change the entire EU crypto-asset market, including the need to comply with new regulatory obligations.

Issuers of ARTs must take into consideration the requirements and obligations set out in this article.

CMS,France: A public consultation on Digital Medical Devices for mental health,"As part of the France 2030

Innovative Medical Devices Plan, a public consultation will be held on the digital challenge in mental health ("" Grand défi numérique en santé mentale "").

The purpose of this challenge is to create and ensure a framework favourable to digital medical devices in the prevention, detection and care of patients suffering from mental disorders.

According to the French government 1 https://www.gouvernement.fr/upload/media/content/0001/08/2970cec8c68a8485eb80ddc75944672cba1f474d.pdf , psychological disorders affect one in four people over the course of their lives, and represent the top expense item for the French health insurance system.

However, there is a significative gap between the growing needs of patients (Covid-19, economic insecurity, geopolitical context, etc.)

and the mental health care services available.

Therefore, an action plan on digital medical devices has been set up, in cooperation with various players from the ecosystem, and will be now subject to a public consultation, focusing on four areas: innovation and research; evaluation of tools; user training; and coverage and financing 2 https://www.contexte.com/actualite/e-sante/une-consultation-publique-sur-le-grand-defi-numerique-en-sante-mentale-attendue-avant-la-fin-du-mois-de-mars_185825.html .

In particular, the issue of coverage and financing is a key aspect in the development of the digital mental health sector.

According to the co-pilots of the digital challenge in mental health, innovative digital medical devices in the field of mental health are not currently covered by health insurance 3 https://www.ticpharma.com/story?ID=2454 .

Indeed, in practice, the medical devices concerned would either be covered by private players (insurer or complementary health insurance), or directly sold to patients.

The public consultation could therefore lead to some improvements in this regard, especially since the new early coverage regime (“PECAN”) of DTx was recently implemented in France (Decree No. 2023-232 of 30 March 2023).

As a reminder, this legal framework allows DTx reimbursement by the health insurance scheme for a non-renewable period of 1 year, under strict conditions (Art.

L. 162-1-23 of the Social Security Code).

CMS,CMS international construction study 2024,"In recent years, construction and engineering businesses have faced a whole storm of headwinds.

CMS, in partnership with YouGov, asked in-house lawyers about the biggest challenges of managing disputes in this environment - and how those challenges can be met.

Sixty-second summary The evolving nature of construction risk will see changes to standard contracts and negotiation positions.

It may also bring more disputes, particularly where those changes lag behind project realities.

Fewer than half the businesses we surveyed reported that the in-house legal or contract management team is always consulted at the start of a project to identify areas of risk and to establish appropriate risk management strategies.

Most in-house lawyers believe their businesses could improve the way in which risk is managed during projects - often in a number of important ways.

Despite the potential benefits, only 17% of the in-house lawyers we surveyed are using AI in disputes or contract management.

Some say they will never use it.

Most in-house lawyers believe their businesses have a lot of scope to improve the way that project risks are managed.

AI has the potential to be a game-changer in this area by optimising processes, planning, scheduling and other elements of case management and by revolutionising the way a business handles its portfolio of contracts."
CMS,5G: A reality check,"If you were to ask the average citizen or business executive about 5G, they would probably tell you it’s been rolled out across most developed markets and making money.

But this is not the case: deployment tends to be partial and patchy, and telcos are yet to see return on investment on the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been invested globally.

In compiling this year’s edition of our 5G report, we spoke to legal and technology experts in over 50 markets to learn the true state of last-generation roll-outs across the world.

We asked which technology companies are offering, whether consumers and industry can access it, whether it’s being monetised, where regulation stands, which spectrum is being used and how it’s being auctioned, how networks are being shared, whether network-specific cybersecurity measures are in place, and what each country’s positions are on Chinese network equipment.

North America had the highest 5G penetration (41%) as of the end of 2022, according to Ericsson’s June 2023 Mobility Report.

Behind that region were North East Asia (30%), the Gulf Cooperation Council (18%) and Western Europe (13%).

By December, the vendor predicts that there will be 1.5 billion 5G subscriptions globally.

In terms of number of 5G subscriptions, China is in the lead, with more than 60% of the world’s total (644m, versus 417m outside the country) as of the end of 2022.

Other markets are home to technical quirks that are delaying 5G.

In The Netherlands, for example, the 3.5 GHz band is not yet commercially available because NATO is operating a satellite 'listening station' with Inmarsat using the 3.4 and 3.8 GHz bands, and Inmarsat is using the 3.5GHz satellite traffic band to provide emergency communications to ships and aircrafts.

The US and Canada dealt with interference between air traffic control systems and consumer 5G by setting up exclusion zones around airports.

Spectrum rights - award and duration Spectrum rights have tended to cost far less than they did for 3G and 4G, because governments have recognised that high licence prices may have hampered investment.

They are mainly awarded via tender or public auction, though in China, 5G licences are assigned directly to the four main telcos (China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom and China Broadnet).

The duration varies across markets, from 15 (eg France) to 30 years (Chile) - often with five-year extensions.

Network and spectrum sharing agreements Network sharing agreements are already a priority in large countries with vast swathes of low population density regions that are expensive to connect.

The US, like Africa before it, is seeing mobile as more efficient in rural areas than fixed-line (in this case fibre), which takes longer and is more expensive to deploy.

T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T are offering separate Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) 5G services they hope will replace wired internet access in those areas.  

According to Ericsson 1 , by 2028 more than 25% of global mobile data traffic will be through FWA, part of it with passive network sharing.

In Australia, some state governments have proposed funding active network sharing initiatives in areas with low population density.

For example, New South Wales’ Gig State programme includes a trial to fund the design and build of Multi-Operator Core Networks (MOCN), which enable active sharing between carriers.

In the US, T-Mobile as part of its agreement to acquire Sprint, had to offer 5G network access to Dish, in a deal lasting until 2027.

Standalone vs non-standalone As of January 2023, there were 229 commercial 5G networks, according to the GSMA.

But in most countries, the majority of services sold as 5G are in fact non-standalone (NSA), meaning that the radio access network (RAN) is 5G, but the core network remains 4G."
CMS,5G: A reality check,"But in most countries, the majority of services sold as 5G are in fact non-standalone (NSA), meaning that the radio access network (RAN) is 5G, but the core network remains 4G.

The Global Suppliers Association (GSA) says that 36 operators in 21 countries and territories have launched public standalone networks , while 111 operators in 52 countries are running trials, planned or actual deployments.

In the meantime, the GSMA is forecasting that of the new 5G networks deployed in 2023, 15 will be standalone (SA).

It noted that some operators have blamed the limited number of mobile devices that support standalone as a reason for delaying deployment.

A notable exception is Singapore, whose telcos now all provide at least 50% outdoor coverage using standalone networks, with Singtel hitting 95% as of July 2022.

Monetisation - consumer vs industrial Experts in almost all markets noted that telecom operators are yet to monetise 5G, especially in the consumer segment, where prices have remained the same as 4G. In Sweden, however, Telenor Sverige and Telia Sverige buck the trend, but offer enhanced benefits such as insurance, streaming services or more/unlimited data.

Tele2 Sverige and Hi3G Access, for their part, have stopped offering new 4G subscriptions altogether.

In Europe and Asia, the industrial segment is showing more promise thanks in part to government subsidies, though more time is needed to demonstrate use cases.

Industrial 5G In most countries, it is telcos that are setting up industrial 5G, enabling private networks that connect specific areas such as factories and campuses.

But starting this year, industrial companies in Sweden can apply directly for local licences to use radio transmitters in the 3.7 GHz and 26 GHz bands, enabling coverage in mines, harbours and hospitals.

This year, the Spanish government announced it would reserve part of the 26 GHz band for direct award to industrial players, without the need for intermediation by telcos.

The German Federal Network Agency has already allocated frequencies in the 3.7 to 3.8 GHz and 26 GHz bands for local 5G, meaning that more than 140 companies are now able to operate their own local networks.

Network slicing, which enables multiple virtual networks to sit on top of a shared physical infrastructure, represents another way to offer differentiated services to enterprise clients across industries - though it requires SA

5G.

However, because slicing uses software and virtualisation, telcos will both compete and partner with cloud providers.

According to the GSMA, operators outside China have so far shown limited interest in slicing deployments due to concerns about return on investment.

China The tech decoupling between the US and China has left other countries caught in the middle when it comes to selecting which companies will provide network equipment.

Many European governments have signed up to the US ‘Clean Network’ initiative, with Portugal in May becoming the latest to show signs it will ban “high risk” vendors.

Some countries like Brazil, Mexico and Turkey are remaining neutral, while others such as Bulgaria and Angola are entering into explicit partnerships with high risk vendors.

In June, the Financial Times reported that the European Union was considering banning all member states from using equipment from companies that might present a security risk to 5G networks.

Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Markets, told telecom ministers he was disappointed that only one third of member states had banned high risk vendors from “critical parts” of 5G infrastructure, which risked “exposing the union’s collective security.”

Germany was named as a key outlier.

Conclusion By and large, most countries covered in the survey appear committed to launching 5G, but progress has been slower than hoped due to factors including Covid, regulatory delays, and high costs for operators whose investors want to see return on investment."
CMS,5G: A reality check,"Governments appear to be trying to ease the way by lowering spectrum costs and removing some red tape, while telcos generally aren’t charging customers more for 5G than 4G. As roll-outs continue, and providers upgrade core networks to proper 5G, it is likely that telcos will continue the trend towards seeking outside investment by selling off infrastructure and sharing networks.

The GSMA estimates that there are 400 million people who lack access to mobile broadband.

Looking ahead, it is unclear how the expected launch of mobile satellite services (MSS) by the likes of Starlink, Kuiper, Vodafone+AST Space Mobile, and Orange+OneWeb will impact the deployment and profitability of the 5G networks in less populated areas.

It is possible that 5G operators could face hurdles to monetising rural networks, which are part of their coverage obligations, depending on the level of competition from MSS service providers.

Based on our conversations with clients, we see 5G as an example of a long-term investment subject to the short-term technological and commercial landscape and other challenges.

In future, there will be a range of competing technologies: optical fibre, Wi-Fi7 and SA 5G (with network slicing) in populated areas, and a mixture of SA 5G, FWA and satellite mobile services in rural areas.

All of them will serve both humans - and increasingly, IoT. SA 5G will become not just a way for individuals to communicate, but an environment for digital ecosystems housed in different network slices.

In all scenarios, these technologies will have to co-exist and cooperate, providing the fullest service to the client - now, and as we head towards 6G. 1 Ericsson: https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/mobile-traffic-forecast?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5Y-qzby-_wIVQwgGAB3ZyAOVEAAYASAAEgI08PD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds See also https://www.ericsson.com/4a9aa7/assets/local/cases/customer-cases/2022/uscellular-bridging-digital-divide.pdf ."

CMS,EU Parliament positions itself in favor of a strong Green Claims Directive,"On 12 March 2024, the European Parliament (“Parliament”) adopted its position on the Green Claims Directive (COM (2023) 166 final 2023/0085 COD, in the following “GCD”) and positioned itself in favor of strong legal regime for environmental claims ( see here ).

While safeguarding most of the Commission’s proposed main provisions, the Parliament voted to improve some parts.

Among other things, the Parliament confirms the Commission’s proposal that companies are to be expected to submit environmental marketing claims for verification before being allowed to use them with the adjustment that the respective claims and their evidence should be assessed within 30 days .

An even quicker respectively “easier” assessment should be possible regarding simpler claims.

The proposed exemption of non-applicability of the GCD for micro enterprises remains unchanged.

Moreover, the Parliament addresses stakeholders concerns by stating that SMEs – compared to larger businesses – should have one more year to become compliant with the GCD .

Regarding the sanctions, the Parliament keeps the Commission’s strong approach and refers to the proposed exclusion from public procurement tenders as well as high fines.

In accordance with the “blacklist” of the Empowering Consumers Directive (Directive EU 2024/825; “ECD”), the Parliament states that green claims which are solely based on carbon offsetting schemes remain banned.

However, the Parliament considers it permissible for companies to refer to offsetting and carbon removal schemes in their advertisement as long as they have already reduced their emissions as much as possible and use these schemes for residual emissions only.

This applies only under the condition that the carbon credits of the schemes are certified and of high integrity.

It remains to be seen to what extent this proposal might collide with the provision under lit.

4c) of the so-called blacklist of the ECG.

The Parliament also expresses its opinion on green claims for products containing hazardous substances .

With the reservation that the Commission reassesses their potential ban in the future, these should remain possible for now .

The Parliament adopted this first reading with 467 votes to 65 (and 74 abstentions).

The legislative process will continue with the new Parliament which is to be elected in June this year."
CMS,On your radar | Issue 18,"Not surprisingly a dominant theme in this edition of OYR is the war in Ukraine.

We hear from our remarkable Ukrainian colleagues how labour law has been deregulated during the period of martial law.

Further across Europe, we see how the war has had an impact on employment law.

Several countries (Czech Republic, Belgium, Slovakia, Poland) discuss new immigration rules introduced to make it easier for Ukrainian refugees to work as they are forced to relocate.

In Spain, new measures have been introduced to avoid dismissals as a response to the economic effects of the war and high energy prices.

Transposing EU Directives into national legislation is often discussed in OYR.

While the Whistleblowing Directive has been the most recent focus of attention in this regard, in this edition the Netherlands explain their measures to implement the EU Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions.

Covid-19 continues to cast its long shadow over the world of work as some countries (Portugal and Norway) address the introduction of remote working laws, while in Colombia they have introduced a new right to disconnect.

The changing nature of Covid-19 restrictions is also mentioned by Poland; while in Italy new rules for entering workplaces have been introduced, as they move beyond the state of emergency.

In contrast, several provinces in China have experienced an increase in restrictions with some workplaces facing temporary closures.

And finally, although common themes exist in employment law, there are always nuances in different jurisdictions.

On this occasion Switzerland explain what an employment certificate is and why employers need to retain data for 10 years following the end of an employment relationship, while France outline their new rules on gender equality.

CMS,Grasping the opportunity in digital regulation,"Europe stands on the cusp of a new era in the digital revolution.

An ongoing wave of digital regulation – some already in place, some still in development – will shape how the European economy uses digital technology for decades to come.

With GDPR, the EU has shown that it can set new standards that shape global markets.

But the current wave of regulation being implemented by the EU and other jurisdictions such as the UK goes deeper, creating a comprehensive new framework for the digital era.

It is unfolding faster than any previous regulatory intervention.

And while governments across the globe are building new regulatory platforms for the digital economy, the EU approach is the most ambitious, and will arguably set the agenda for the rest of the world.

As a result, regulatory dynamics will completely redefine companies’ business models and operations – and those of their competitors.

Crucially, business leaders must recognise that the current wave of digital regulation in Europe is more than a matter of compliance.

Together, new regulations on non-personal data, AI, digital platforms and cyber safety will establish new commercial dynamics, new risks and opportunities and, in some cases, new markets, all of which demand a global strategic response.

Adaptation is a necessary precondition of survival.

Those that live up to the challenge will also be better placed to capture first mover advantages, to bolster their competitiveness in digital markets, to reduce their technology costs and to enhance the resilience of their digital systems.

To explore the views of business leaders on this wave of digital regulation, we surveyed 450 senior in-house legal counsel from across the EU and UK.

The survey revealed that, although regulation presents commercial threats and compliance challenges, European businesses also see opportunities in this wave of regulation to gain competitive advantage – and not just in Europe, but around the globe as well.

This is encouraging.

Regulation need not always be seen as a threat.

In Europe, the comprehensive framework and the legal certainty provided by proactive regulation offers businesses an opportunity to get a head start in the next wave of digital innovation.

Companies that recognise this opportunity, and act upon it, will be the ones that thrive in the coming decade."
CMS,International Disputes Digest - 2023 Summer Edition,"We are pleased to present the summer edition of the International Disputes Digest , our bi-annual publication bringing essential news and analysis on the latest trends in dispute-resolution around the world.

There are many crises and problems that continue to complicate global business.

These include inflation, particularly in the energy sector, as the EU and other regions struggle to wean themselves from Russian natural gas and oil. 

There is also the US debt crisis, which has weakened international confidence in the economy and distracted Washington from pressing issues, such as its relationship with China and the on-going war in the Ukraine.

We hope that the articles in this digest provide readers with the know-how and tools to help them resolve any disputes or setbacks they may face.

In this edition, we feature a range of articles from around the world on topics such as ESG litigation, the financial impact of cyber-attacks on businesses, post-merger disputes, the use of arbitration in resolving M&A-related issues, and how disputes can be managed in digital trade transactions.

We also explore the reasons behind a wave of class action lawsuits in Portugal, the influence of personal relationships among arbitrators on disclosure, recusal, or appeals, and the 'without prejudice' principle, amongst other matters.

This is part of a series that we host around every two to three months on the topics that are most pressing.

Just one month ago, we were at the Mobile World Congress where everyone came from around the world to showcase their services, their products, to discuss trends, not only in telecoms but also in tech, in data and increasingly having in mind the geopolitical situation that we are living in today.

The Mobile World Congress this year focused on four key areas , but against this backdrop of the geopolitical reality that we are living in.

Those four areas were AI, sustainability, inclusion, and for me who has spent most of her professional life in space, satellites, which was a lot of fun.

CMS,Looking ahead to the EU AI Act,"Introduction In February 2024 EU lawmakers reached an agreement on the “Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence ” (the so-called AI Act ).

The final adoption and entering into force of this of this ground-breaking law is now imminent.

The European Parliament adopted the AI Act by a large majority on 13 March 2024.

Following alinguistic and systematic revision by the legal teams, a corrigendum implementing the changes following from this review was adopted on 17 April 2024 by the European Parliament.

This final text now requires formal approval by the Council of the European Union, which is expected for May 2024.

With this  adoption of the world’s most significant legislation on Artificial Intelligence , solidifying its position as a pioneer among global legislators.

This initiative aims to establish and reinforce the EU’s role as a premier hub for AI while ensuring that AI development remains focused on human-centered and trustworthy principles.

To expedite the achievement of these goals, on 8 December 2023, after three days of debate, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union finally reached a provisional agreement on the “Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence ” (the so-called AI Act ), which aims to ensure that AI systems placed on the European market are safe and respect the fundamental rights and values of the EU.

Subsequent to this provisional agreement, technical refinement of the AI Act continued to finalise the regulation’s details and text.

After a long and complex journey that began in 2021 with the European Commission’s proposal of a draft AI Act , this new regulation is expected to be passed into law in spring 2024.

The AI Act aims to ensure that the marketing and use of AI systems and their outputs in the EU are consistent with fundamental rights under EU law, such as privacy, democracy, the rule of law and environmental sustainability.

Adopting a dual approach, it outright prohibits AI systems deemed to pose unacceptable risks while imposing regulatory obligations on other AI systems and their outputs.

The new regulation, which also aims to strike a fair balance between innovation and the protection of individuals, not only makes Europe a world leader in the regulation of this new technology, but also endeavours to create a legal framework that users of AI technologies will be able to comply with in order to make the most of this significant development opportunity.

In this article we provide a first overview of the key points contained in the text of the AI Act 1 This article (including the relevant citations below) is based on AIA Corrigendum as adopted by the European Parliament on the 17 April 2024.

CMS,Legal experts on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation,"The European Parliament's approval of new crypto licensing regulations has been largely well-received by the industry, marking a significant first step towards a uniformly regulated digital asset market.

The anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation , designed to safeguard consumers and maintain financial stability, is set to come into effect in mid-2024, a move that has garnered initial positive responses.

While MiCA applies exclusively in the European Union (EU), its global relevance is undeniable.

It positions the EU as a leader in managing this complex domain, providing the world with a regulatory framework for further refinement.

Consequently, legal experts and enthusiasts from CMS specialising in crypto and other digital assets have collaborated to provide their perspectives on various facets of MiCA.

This webpage serves as a repository for articles encapsulating the present state of affairs.

CMS,Performing services in a decentralised manner under MiCAR,"At the end of April 2023, the European parliament decided on a uniform regulation of crypto assets across the EU by voting on the MiCA regulation (i.e. markets in crypto-assets).

The intended innovations are ""explosive"" for activities related to crypto assets, in particular if they were not yet regulated in Germany where the legislator had provisions already in place, which are similar to those under MiCAR. MiCAR regulates a broad range of crypto-asset services and requests providers to obtain a license from the competent authorities (e.g. BaFin in Germany).

It is therefore crucial to identify MiCAR's scope of application.

According to recital 22 of the MiCAR, crypto-asset services are not covered by the scope of the MiCAR if not even a ""part of such activities or services is performed in a decentralised manner"".

This means: ""Where crypto-asset services are provided in a fully decentralised manner without any intermediary, they should not fall within the scope of the MiCAR"".

It is noteworthy that if only a part of the service is carried out in a decentralised manner, the regulation applies.

A project that considers itself decentral (and thus outside the scope of MiCAR) might run into severe difficulties, which is why it is crucial for projects to understand the narrow sense of this term.

This article takes a closer look at when the requirement of decentralisation can be fulfilled or is not fulfilled.

To this end, certain criteria are developed that could be taken into account.

Since authorities have not yet given any guidance on this question, and since the MiCAR is silent on a clear interpretation of the term ""decentralised manner"", the aim of this article is to give some food for thought for market participants.

Further developments need to be observed carefully.

In the interim, this article will contribute to the public debate.

Criterion No. 1: Factual (i.e. writing) access to the technical infrastructure In case a smart contract or other relevant software used to provide crypto-asset services can be modified by individuals, one can assume that at least a part of the services is not performed in a decentralised manner.

By having access to the technical infrastructure, these individuals may even be qualified as crypto-asset service providers ( CASP s), even if they only deploy the smart contract without having any technical possibility to change it afterwards.

This scenario raises many legal questions (for German laws, see Möslein/Kaulartz/Rennig, RDi 2021, 517 ), but one can assume that MiCAR applies to many of those structures.

Criterion No. 2: DAOs being qualified as a legal entity Crypto projects are often governed by DAOs, decentralised autonomous organisations that describe the governance and decision-making by token holders.

As this term indicates, the hope of founding teams often is that those ""organisations"" (MiCAR uses the term ""undertaking"") are decentralised and could thus not be regulated by MiCAR.

This might certainly be the case, but in many jurisdictions including Germany, DAOs may be considered legal entities if the token holders pursue a common purpose, even if the DAO is not registered with an authority.

If this criterion is fulfilled, the DAO is necessarily not decentralised, but centralised.

Apart from the legal question around DAOs qualified as legal entities, the conviction has spread that DAOs need a ""legal wrapper"".

This might be necessary to protect the token holders from personal liability (which may exist in the aforementioned case), but token holders may also be able to act in business life, pay suppliers, give grants and rent offices.

Some projects are convinced that the Swiss association is the solution for all DAO issues (it is not).

While others prefer some sunny islands, often with regrets since those ""secret tips"" are often not challenged legally and in consideration of tax laws, which is a big problem in this space."
CMS,Performing services in a decentralised manner under MiCAR,"While others prefer some sunny islands, often with regrets since those ""secret tips"" are often not challenged legally and in consideration of tax laws, which is a big problem in this space.

Regardless of whether those structures make sense in the individual case, MiCAR brings a new aspect into this discussion: Due to the legal wrapper being a legal entity, the project is no longer decentralised.

Criterion No. 3: DAOs with concentration of voting rights Now let's assume that the DAO is structured in a way that it is not a legal entity, and a legal wrapper has not been used (see No. 2 above).

In this case, one should take a closer look on the DAO governance to answer the question whether the DAO is, nevertheless, at least partly centralised.

A key decision criterion may be the concentration of (tokenised) voting rights.

Governance tokens convey ""voting rights"" with which members can, for example, decide on the further development of a smart contract.

One could take into account the following aspects: A project is not fully decentralised if the voting power is concentrated in one person.

A project is rather not fully decentralised if the voting power is concentrated in the founding team and investors, assuming that those are tied closely together.

The reason is that this can easily be qualified as a circumvention of the aforementioned case.

A project is likely not fully decentralised if the voting power is not concentrated in the aforementioned sense, but individuals or groups of individuals, which are closely linked to the project (e.g. founders), have sufficiently strong market power that it can be assumed that the majority of other token holders follows their vote.

In all other cases, decentralisation is possible.

This includes, in particular, cases where one would not even speak of DAOs (e.g. in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain).

Criterion No. 4: Governance review Finally, when assessing whether a service is ""decentral"" or not, one should have lawyers and technical auditors conduct a code review of the underlying smart contracts.

This review should, in particular, assess whether individuals may influence the code, whether there are kill switches going beyond what the EU Data Act proposes, whether quorums try to prevent voting concentrations, whether individuals or neutral third parties have a possibility to object against governance decisions, etc.

Furthermore, it should be assessed whether or not there are procedures in place to legally protect individuals from legal consequences resulting from voting decisions.

Outlook and upcoming developments Market participants should not expect that they fall outside of the regulatory umbrella only because they decided on a structure with the term ""decentral"" in it.

Rather, a variety of requirements must be assessed and there are many criterions that will, once fulfilled, close the door for qualifying a service as decentralised.

According to Art.

142

(1) and (2) MiCAR, the EU Commission will, 18 months after the MiCAR comes into force, provide a report including ""an assessment of the development of decentralised-finance in the markets in crypto-assets and of the appropriate regulatory treatment of decentralised crypto-asset systems without an issuer or crypto-asset service provider, including an assessment of the necessity and feasibility of regulating decentralised finance"".

This report will certainly shed some light on the discussion around decentralisation.

CMS,CMS European Class Actions Report 2023,"Welcome to the 2023 CMS European Class Action Report, the only study to analyse data from class action proceedings across Europe and to map a true picture of class action risk.

Class action risk in Europe continues to increase, driven by new class action procedures, the growth in litigation funding, a more active plaintiff bar – including more U.S. firms setting up in Europe, and the use of new technologies and techniques to facilitate large groups of claimants.

Data in the report shows a relentless rise in class actions being filed in Europe: 55 in 2018; 72 in 2019; 119 in 2020; 120 in 2021 and 121 in 2022.  

With the Representative Action Direction now being implemented in the Member States, we expect these numbers to further increase in the years ahead.

The key findings of the 2023 Report are: Europe and the UK continue to see record-high numbers of class actions, with 121 claims filed in 2022, up from 55 in 2018 With the RAD's adoption in EU states, Europe expects a surge in consumer legal actions There is no “safe” sector i.e., whether financial products and professional services, tech or consumer products and life sciences, all sectors are affected In the UK alone, we identified issued class actions seeking collectively in excess of €120bn UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Portugal experience the most class actions (76%)

The countries with the steepest growth in class actions are Germany, Slovenia, and Portugal Three key claim types: Financial Products/Securities (31%), Competition (26%), Products Liability (24%) Features of the 2023 Report: Quantum : This year, for the first time, we have collected data on the claimed quantum in issued claims, initially focussing on the UK and the Netherlands.

Risk map : Class action risk in Europe is unevenly distributed between jurisdictions.

Our risk map gives an ‘at a glance’ picture of the current class action risk across the continent.

However, the relevant ESG expertise that is necessary for a professional sustainability set-up is rarely found within law firms.

As is the case with other businesses, law firms should hire ESG or sustainability specialists to professionally guide and oversee their ESG and sustainability strategies.

ESG specialists can impart their expertise by developing and managing the firm’s ESG structures, strategies and activities.

However, they need to collaborate closely with a variety of stakeholders and be embedded into the wider firm.

The responsibility for solving operational challenges relating to ESG, from supply chain standards to employee health and safety, lies within several different departments.

Within these departments, some resources should formally be reallocated to the firm’s ESG strategy.

Prioritise limited resources Rome was not built in a day and neither was the sustainable law firm.

ESG encompasses many fields of action.

There is so much that law firms can do to become more sustainable, however it will take time and resources to achieve these goals.

Firms should narrow down the issues to be addressed by means of a materiality analysis, as required by professional ESG standards, but it will still be necessary to prioritise targets and projects.

Even if a firm has invested into hiring ESG professionals and freed up resources in its various departments, its resources will be limited.

While this is not law firm-specific, ESG ambitions are often unrealistic.

Therefore, choices around what to prioritise will need to be made in order to make any progress.

Harmonise communication It is tempting and easy for a law firm to present itself as sustainable to the outside world.

Marketing professionals have the means and skills available to advertise their firms as the most sustainable law firm, which excels in supporting diversity initiatives, commits to a sustainable future for the next generation by sponsoring education projects and engages extensively in pro bono activities.

While no law firm needs to hide its light under a bushel, it might be worth considering whether the firm is practising internally what it preaches.

For example, if the firm supports external diversity initiatives and proudly emphasises this on its social media accounts, but has a corporate culture that discourages parental leave for men, the firm could be accused of bluewashing.

In addition, employees might not feel happy about this contradiction and the firm’s reputation as a credible and reliable employer might suffer.

Therefore, external and internal communication and action should be consistent and aligned when it comes to ESG.

Build competencies ESG is relevant to all units and departments in the firm.

Therefore, it requires capacity building at the firm across all levels of seniority of legal and non-legal staff.

It generates several benefits for firms in the immediate and long term, from staff retention to valuable knowledge that can be captured in client advisory work and contributes to realising the firm’s ESG strategy and ambition.

Manage the change Implementing sustainable business practice in a law firm is a demanding transformation project.

Many certainties, behaviours and philosophies that big law has taken for granted will be turned upside down.

Just like with other transformation projects that touch on fundamentals, the successful implementation of a professional ESG strategy within a firm requires proactive change and expectation management.

CMS,Law firms and ESG: getting it right,"Governance as well as communication and stakeholder involvement are key, as professional corporate sustainability is not self-explanatory.

It is an emotional matter for many and requires sympathy for the different perspectives and collaboration across different departments, given ESG’s interdisciplinary nature.

CMS,Top 10 Questions asked by Corporate Counsel considering Third Party Funding...,"1. Why consider Third Party Funding?

Third Party Funding allows businesses to pursue legal claims without diverting liquidity to cover the legal fees and associated costs of a dispute.

Third Party Funding can help clients whose assets are the subject of the dispute (e.g. where money has been misappropriated) or who would otherwise not necessarily have the available cash to pursue their claim, as well as clients who wish to reduce the ongoing impact of a dispute on their business activities or balance sheet."
CMS,Side Letters and MFN,"In simple terms, a side letter is an agreement which documents terms that are specific to a particular investor's investment in a fund .

In that respect, a side letter is distinct from the fund's principal constitutional documents, which set out the terms that apply to the fund as a whole.

Side letters have become a fixed feature of most private funds as investors increasingly seek to supplement and improve the terms of their investment and address requirements specific to their position.

This briefing explores common themes in relation to side letters and their negotiation, including how side letters interact with a most favoured nation (or “ MFN ”) mechanism.

Common side letter terms Side letters originally emerged principally for the purpose of encouraging cornerstone and strategic investors to commit to a fund by granting preferential terms in exchange for early stage or large commitments.

However, investors now see side letters as fundamental to the negotiation process and will often have an extensive shopping-list of requirements.

The terms negotiated in a side letter will depend on various factors, such as the type of investor and the investment strategy and legal, tax and regulatory features of the fund.

The table below includes examples of some common side-letter terms: Columns Common side letter terms Accommodating an investor’s specific reporting and tax requirements Imposing participation limits (an investor may seek to cap its investment to a percentage of aggregate commitments in order to control risk exposure)

Offering reductions or rebates in the management fee for larger or first close investors Moderating the fund’s ability to make 'distributions in kind' (i.e. non-cash distributions) to investors Granting an investor the right to participate on an investor advisory committee Granting an investor the right to transfer interests in the fund to its affiliated entities Imposing restrictions on the disclosure of an investor's name and its use in marketing materials Representations and notifications regarding anti-bribery, corruption and sanction policies Imposing additional restrictions or limitations on the fund's investment and borrowing activities Confirming compliance with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) policies Granting rights for the investor to co-invest alongside the fund in investments Imposing restrictions on an investor’s participation in alternative investment vehicles We have picked out some of the side letter terms in more detail below.

Fee arrangements Managers may grant special management fee and, in some cases, carried interest arrangements with respect to certain investors in order to incentivise repeat, larger and/or early stage commitments to the fund.

These fee arrangements may be substantial in the case of cornerstone and strategic investors.

While certain aspects of the fee arrangements may sometimes be formalised in the LPA, documenting these arrangements via the side letter provides the manager with greater flexibility to tailor arrangements between different investors in order to preserve fee revenue and avoid creating a precedent.

Investment Restrictions Whilst it is not uncommon for closed-ended LPAs to contain an excusal provision - being a mechanism allowing an investor to request to be excused from participation in an investment which would contravene its own legal requirements or investment policies (for example an investment related to armaments manufacture or the production of alcohol) - side letters can offer an opportunity for investors to pre-notify the manager of these prohibitions.

The manager will want to limit discretion on the part of the investor so the investor is unable to cherry pick deals."
CMS,Side Letters and MFN,"The manager will want to limit discretion on the part of the investor so the investor is unable to cherry pick deals.

ESG Investors increasingly expect funds to have detailed ESG policies and for managers to commit to firm-level ESG commitments, including net zero carbon emissions targets and alignment with frameworks such as the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.

In addition, certain investors may require the manager and the fund to comply with, and/or report in relation to, the investor’s own ESG policies, principles or regimes.

Managers should be mindful of ensuring that they are practically able to adhere to and meet any obligations, especially in circumstances where the fund does not exercise control over the underlying investments.

Consideration should also be given as to who bears the expense of compliance with ESG related reporting requirements, which may be costly and require input from specialist external providers.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption and Sanctions In light of recent events, investors understandably want to ensure that funds into which they are investing are compliant from an anti-bribery and corruption (often referred to as “ABC”) perspective.

Related side letter provisions can come in many forms, including assurances that the fund and the manager have implemented ABC and anti-money laundering policies, obligations to comply with the investor’s own ABC policies, and representations and warranties that the fund and the key persons are not the subject of ABC investigations or proceedings.

The manager should consider during the negotiation process whether, by agreeing to any such provisions, it is extending its liability beyond the scope of existing ABC regimes applicable to the fund and the manager.

Who are the parties to the side letter?

Where a fund is structured as a limited partnership, the side letter is typically entered into between the general partner (GP) acting on behalf of the fund, and the relevant individual investor.

Some investors will ask for the fund manager entity to be an additional party to the agreement, to facilitate the enforcement of any terms relating to the manager's activities.

However, both managers and investors should treat this approach with caution.

Managers should generally look to ""ring-fence"" liability for side letter obligations within the GP, which is usually a limited liability special purpose vehicle.

At the same time, case law has suggested that investors in a limited partnership fund may risk prejudicing their limited liability status in taking legal action against the manager of the limited partnership under a side letter, as this could amount to ""taking part in management"" of the limited partnership.

A sensible solution is to provide that the GP must procure the actions required of the manager under the side letter, whilst excluding the manager as a party to the side letter.

AIFMD Fund managers whose activities are subject to the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), or the equivalent UK regime, are required to disclose details of the nature of special arrangements (including side letters) with investors, and the types of investors eligible to receive them.

While the rules do not specify the level of detail in which side letter arrangements must be disclosed, managers should certainly bear this in mind when agreeing to side letter terms with investors.

Most Favoured Nations (MFN)

An MFN provision is a mechanism, which may be contained either in the fund’s constitution itself (in which case all investors benefit from the MFN on the same terms) or offered to one or more investor(s) within their respective side letters, which typically requires the manager (i) to disclose to relevant investors details of preferential rights granted to other investors in the fund and (ii) to offer investors the right to elect the benefit of certain of those provisions, in each case subject to certain conditions."
CMS,Side Letters and MFN,"The election process (and in certain cases the disclosure process too) is typically provided on a “tiered” basis, meaning that the relevant investor can only elect the benefit of (and, as applicable, receive disclosure of) another investor's terms if its commitment to the fund is equal to or higher than such other investor's commitment.

In other words, bigger ticket investors generally have a better deal in terms of the rights on offer.

Carve-outs

In addition to the MFN tiering referred to above, it is common practice for certain types of side letter provisions to be excluded (or “carved-out”) from the MFN.

The carve outs may apply solely to the election process, or to both the disclosure and the election process.

Carve outs may include, for example, rights granted on the basis of an investor's specific legal, regulatory or tax position or its investment policies, or in consideration of an investor's status as a ""first-close investor"" or an existing client of the manager.

The inclusion of MFN carve outs provides the manager with a means of managing the burden of the MFN process as well as controlling potential escalation in the scope and complexity of side letters across the investor pool, particularly in open-ended products.

Some common carve-outs include: LPAC:

Investors may be precluded from electing a provision which permits the investor to appoint a representative to the Limited Partners Advisory Committee (“ LPAC ”).

The LPAC is formed for the purpose of consulting with the manager or general partner on specific issues during the lifetime of the fund and the right to appoint a representative to the LPAC may be reserved for larger or first close investors or those investors who the manager otherwise considers to be of strategic importance to the fund.

Investor specific legal, regulatory or tax requirements: as described above, certain investors in the fund may be subject to legal, regulatory or tax requirements by reason of their specific individual circumstances.

For example, a German domiciled investor may be subject to its own reporting requirements to the German regulator or tax authorities.

While the German investor’s side letter may therefore contain provisions entitling it to receive certain information required to fulfil these reporting requirements, a non-German investor would typically be precluded from electing this provision.

Co-investments: In certain cases, the manager may agree to grant certain strategic investors first-look rights or pro-rata participation in co-investment opportunities alongside the fund.

However, most managers will typically prefer to retain some degree of discretion over the allocation of co-investment opportunities and such side letter rights are therefore often excluded from the scope of the MFN.

Summary – Pros and Cons of Side Letters Columns For investors For fund managers For investors For fund managers Advantages of side letters Negotiate tailored terms to address specific needs Ensure parity with other investors via the MFN process Incentivise cornerstone investors and larger / early-stage commitments Limit the grant of preferential rights to specific investors Avoid need to amend core fund documentation (which may require investor / regulator consent)

Disadvantages of side letters Confidentiality issues – disclosure to other investors of side letter rights (albeit typically on an anonymised basis)"
CMS,Side Letters and MFN,"Disadvantages of side letters Confidentiality issues – disclosure to other investors of side letter rights (albeit typically on an anonymised basis)

Cost (legal fees and management time) of negotiation as well as review and elections during the MFN process Managing investor relations where certain investors are granted more favourable terms than others Compliance with applicable fiduciary duties - e.g. to disclose nature of preferential rights and to maintain the fair treatment of investors Practical difficulties in operating a fund governed by differing terms within a multitude of side letters Practical Considerations It is important to remember that side letters are designed to supplement the fund’s constitutional documents and should not be used to replicate provisions of the fund’s constitutional documents.

When negotiating side letter rights, managers should always bear in the mind the MFN and, as far as possible, seek to ensure consistency of side letters terms.

Consistency in approach between side letters will typically help with streamlining the MFN process and also in facilitating the manager’s ongoing compliance with side letter obligations.

In an open-ended fund, investors should only have the benefit to elect side letter provisions granted to other investors admitted at the same or later closings.

Further, where closings on open-ended products are anticipated to occur frequently, the manager may even wish to avoid an MFN provision altogether or to restrict the scope of the MFN provisions to fees, redemptions and other essential rights, so as to avoid running a burdensome MFN election process following each closing.

Managers should ensure that a record is kept of any key operational side letter obligations, such as deadlines or obligations to notify investors of specific events.

An appropriate set of MFN carve outs in the fund’s constitutional documents can reduce the scope of the manager’s ongoing compliance burden.

Managers should consider who will bear the costs incurred by the fund and the manager in complying with the specific investor requirements, which investors may seek to push onto the fund or the manager.

The MFN process can get complex where a manager is raising successor funds.

Repeat investors often expect substantially similar side-letter rights in respect of a successor platform, leading to a considerable increase in the length and complexity of their side letters with each new fund.

The inclusion of an MFN provision, in either an investor’s side letter or the fund’s constitutional document, should be carefully considered by both investors and managers alike.

Investors should be aware that sponsors will often require MFN elections to be submitted within a certain period following closing.

Late MFN election submissions are at risk of being rejected by the manager.

Managers may seek to limit their disclosure obligations in the MFN process by choosing to only disclose the general terms or a summary of other investors’ terms, without fully disclosing the specifics.

Investors may wish to insist on full disclosure obligations on the part of the manager.

Conclusion Side letters can vary considerably in scope and complexity, from a one-page document to an agreement which may be comparable to the fund's principal constitutional document in length.

Their content ranges from the mundane, such as detailed requirements on the service of notices, to the ominous, such as clauses restricting investments in businesses involved in the development weapons of mass destruction, or in engaging with organised crime syndicates or persons conducting ""indiscriminate mass murder"" (some investors obviously feel that the ESG culture has yet to become fully embedded in the market!)."
CMS,Side Letters and MFN,"Managers should consider side-letter provisions carefully at all times: during the investor negotiations (with a focus on ensuring that the terms are workable); following closings; during the MFN process; and on a forward basis (to ensure ongoing compliance with their terms).

CMS,CMS comments on proposal for EU foreign investment screening regulation,"CMS is an integrated, multi-jurisdictional organisation of law firms that offers full-service legal and tax advice.

With 80+ offices in more than 40 countries and 5,800+ lawyers worldwide, we combine deep local market understanding with a global overview.

Advising on more transactions in Europe than any other law firm, our FDI group has vast experience with the foreign investment screening mechanisms in the EU and worldwide.

We welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the Commission’s proposal for a new regulation on screening of foreign investments in the Union (the “Proposal”).

We recognise the political desire to further improve the effectiveness of the EU foreign investment screening framework for protecting security and public order from risky foreign investment in the EU.

Accordingly, our comments will focus on those aspects of the Proposal which, in our experience as legal advisors in hundreds of transactions involving Union targets, threaten to place an additional and potentially disproportionate burden on economic operators.

We encourage the co-legislators: to carefully consider the interests of economic operators, to further harmonise national frameworks, including by clarifying the requirements of national screening regimes and reducing scope for divergent interpretations of the Proposal, to only introduce rules that further burden economic operators if they offer a clear, risk-based improvement to the effectiveness of the screening mechanism and to incorporate more specific rules protecting the legal rights of economic operators, including to transparency, and expand on their procedural rights and entitlement to judicial recourse.

Extension of EU foreign investment screening framework to indirect foreign investments The Proposal extends the scope of the EU foreign investment screening framework to indirect foreign investments, i.e. intra-EU investments, where investments in EU targets are made by EU entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign shareholder (Recital 10 and Articles 2(1) to 2(3) and 2(7) of the Proposal).

The Proposal does not only extend the scope to such indirect foreign investments where the foreign investor intends to circumvent foreign investment screening mechanisms in the EU (i.e. by creating an EU subsidiary as an investment vehicle in the EU which will then invest in the actual EU target or other artificial arrangements), but also to investments where the acquiring EU subsidiary is a full-function undertaking which intends to invest in another EU entity.

While we tend to believe that the latter cases are less likely to pose significant risks for security and public order, and that extending the scope of the EU foreign investment screening framework to bona-fide intra-EU investments might not strike the appropriate balance between security interests and the fundamental freedoms of the EU (establishment, capital), we recognise that this is ultimately a political question.

However, it appears that the current Proposal does not define key terms sufficiently clearly and does not address crucial jurisdictional concepts concerning such indirect foreign investments at all.

In particular, the notion of “effective participation in the management or control of a Union target” (Article 2(1) of the Proposal), and the definition of “investment within the Union with foreign control” remain unclear, ultimately leaving the meaning of ‘indirect foreign investment’ open: The definition in Art.

2(1) clarifies that “investments within the EU with foreign control” are only within the scope of the Proposal if the investment “enables effective participation in the management or control of the Union target”."
CMS,CMS comments on proposal for EU foreign investment screening regulation,"However, the Proposal does not provide any additional guidance, and case-law from the European Court of Justice (from which the notion of this Proposal appears to be derived) does not provide guidance which is conclusive enough to ensure uniform application of the notion within the EU foreign investment screening framework.

The definition of “investment within the Union with foreign control” in Article 2(3) seems contradictory in itself.

Article 2(3) is intended to define the concept of indirect foreign investments via EU subsidiaries, i.e. investments characterized by the lack of direct links between the foreign investor and the Union target.

However, Article 2(3) defines such indirect investments as investments which aim at establishing “lasting and direct links between the foreign investor and a Union target […], and to which target the foreign investor makes capital available”

[emphasis by us].

This leaves significant scope for divergent interpretations between Member States, which makes a uniform application of the proposed EU foreign investment screening framework by individual Member States unlikely.

It also threatens to render obsolete the intended harmonisation of the approach across Member States to intra-EU investments, which is where consistency in approach arguably matters most.

The potential for differing interpretations by Member States also creates the risk of the new framework significantly increasing the overall number of screenings, which not only puts substantial additional burden on EU investors with foreign shareholders but also appears to run counter to the Proposal’s aim, which is to reduce the number of low-risk cases reported to the cooperation mechanism.

As a result, the new framework as proposed, or its implementation by Member States in practice, may also raise questions as to its legal basis and consistency with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the freedom of establishment, as set out in Articles 49 to 55 TFEU, or with the provisions on the free movement of capital, as set out in Article 65 TFEU.

We recommend that the co-legislators carefully consider whether extending the scope of the EU foreign investment screening framework to bona-fide intra-EU investments by full function EU entities which are controlled by a foreign shareholder is indeed appropriate.

In any event, we urge the co-legislators to unambiguously state under which circumstances indirect foreign investments are within the scope of the EU foreign investment screening framework, e.g. by providing specific voting rights thresholds.

Obligation to introduce authorisation requirements in national screening mechanisms The Proposal includes a new obligation for Member States to introduce authorisation requirements for foreign investments, if the Union target is active in areas of the economy listed in Annex II (Article 4(4)).

While we recognise that authorisation requirements are a means to render the EU foreign investment screening framework more effective, we submit that authorisation requirements should be limited to cases which are sufficiently likely to have a negative effect on security or public order.

We further note that economic operators should be able to swiftly and clearly identify potential authorisation requirements in the individual Member States – which is not the case under the current EU foreign investment screening framework, where the significant differences in scope and approach between screening mechanisms in individual Member States create legal uncertainty and substantial compliance costs for businesses.

We therefore welcome the Proposal in that it aims at harmonising the national screening mechanisms by introducing a common “minimum standard” and focussing authorisation requirements on Union targets which are active in areas listed in an Annex to the Screening Regulation."
CMS,CMS comments on proposal for EU foreign investment screening regulation,"However, we submit that under the current Proposal the scope of Union targets which would be subject to an authorisation requirement is excessively wide and would in practice include almost any legal entity in the EU: Annex II of the Proposal appears to be overly generic when it includes items such as “processors” or “batteries”.

We submit that Annex II does not yet provide the desired level of clarity and specificity.

In its current draft it could even force Member States whose rules are currently formulated more clearly to make their rules more vague in order to comply with the Proposal’s standards.

The definition of “active in an area listed in Annex II” in Article 2(9) of the Proposal appears to be too wide, as it would capture cases where companies merely own, use or supply items listed in Annex II.

By combining an overly generic list in Annex II, which includes for example “processors”, “photovoltaics” or “batteries”, with the extremely broad definition of “active in” in Article 2(9) of the Proposal (according to which merely using or owning items listed in Annex II qualifies as being “active in”), any entity in the EU which owns or uses processors, photovoltaics or even batteries would qualify as a Union target which is “active in one of the areas listed in Annex II” and therefore fall within the scope of Article 4(4).

In fact, given that under the definition in Article 2(9) of the Proposal “active in” includes “intending to be active in”, even an EU entity only intending to purchase a battery falls within the scope of Article 4(4) of the Proposal.

The above examples demonstrate that a list such as Annex II which identifies sensitive areas, items, technologies or services: should be limited to those areas, items, technologies, and services which are indeed of particular importance for the security or public order interests of the Union, and should define these on the basis of a risk-based approach as precisely as possible, and should additionally specify, for each area, item, technology, and service separately, the exact economic activity which is considered sensitive.

For most of the items, technologies and services listed in the current Annex II, mere ownership, supply or use of such items typically would not be relevant to security and public order interests of the Union, and the sensitive activity could be limited to development and production..

In contrast, when considering items on the Common Military List of the European Union (Annex II 2. of the Proposal), not only their development, production or supply but also the mere ownership of these items could be relevant.

In the context of this review of the EU foreign investment screening framework, achieving a mutually agreed list of sensitive areas, items, technologies and services which is sufficiently specific would be a major breakthrough, and would assist economic operators enormously in their handling of EU foreign investment screening.

We therefore call upon the co-legislators to prioritise agreeing such a list.

Obligation to report foreign investments into the cooperation mechanism The Proposal introduces an obligation for Member States to report certain foreign investments into the cooperation mechanism (Article 5).

We recognise that introducing criteria which help identify the cases to be reported into the cooperation mechanism should ensure that the most relevant cases are reported.

However, the current Proposal in our view runs the risk of not contributing to this goal and might even lead to the mechanism being overloaded with irrelevant cases.

While in principle Union targets which are part of or participate in projects or programmes of Union interest should be of higher-than-average relevance to the security and public order interests of the Union, this may not be the case in practice if no de-minimis or materiality threshold applies."
CMS,CMS comments on proposal for EU foreign investment screening regulation,"In particular, where the amount of funding received is only marginal, security interests or public security are unlikely to be affected.

We therefore recommend introducing a materiality threshold to Article 5(1)(b)(i) or Article 4(4)(a) of the Proposal, which could filter likely irrelevant de minimis cases.

This would help both screening authorities and economic operators.

We further submit that requiring Member States to report into the cooperation mechanism all cases where the investor (or any of its subsidiaries) was involved in a screening and where the investment was not authorised or only authorised with conditions (Article 5(1)(b)(iii) of the Proposal) is also likely to direct unwanted cases into the system.

In particular, in our experience from past cases, it is very often the Union target’s business which determines whether mitigation measures are required whereas the identity of the foreign investor is rarely decisive in cases where the Union target’s business is relevant to the interests of national security and public order.

We accordingly suggest this filter be reconsidered.

One option could be to require Member States to notify all investments relating to a Union target that was involved in a screening and where the investment was not authorised or only authorised subject to conditions.

Obligation to introduce call-in right for 15 months

post-closing / Right to open own initiative procedure The Proposal introduces an obligation for Member States to empower their screening authority to initiate – at its own initiative – screening for at least 15 months post-closing for foreign investments which were not subject to an authorisation requirement under Article 4(4) of the Proposal (Article 4(2)(c)).

The Proposal further introduces a right for the Commission and for Member States to open own-initiative procedures in relation to foreign investments in other Member States which have not been notified to the cooperation mechanism (Article 9(1) and 9(3); see also comments below).

As a result, unless the Member State where the investment occurs has already terminated its own screening, the Commission and other Member States can – via the cooperation mechanism – ask the Member State where the investment occurs to screen the foreign investment post-closing, and the respective Member State is then empowered to initiate a screening for at least 15 months post-closing.

We submit that an obligation on all Member States to introduce such post-closing screening powers would have very serious consequences for the transaction security of foreign investments.

The negative impact on all economic operators concerned (investors and sellers) would, if implemented as proposed, in our view be disproportionate.

We acknowledge that several Member States already provide for post-closing call-in powers, sometimes for periods substantially exceeding 15 months.

However, these Member States recognise that parties have a legitimate interest in obtaining legal certainty before the call-in deadline expires.

They allow investors to actively trigger screening e.g. by means of voluntary applications, thereby enabling them to obtain legal certainty within the timeframe of regular screening.

Should the co-legislators pursue the idea of obliging Member States to introduce post-closing call-in rights, we consider it imperative that the EU foreign investment screening framework allow the foreign investor to obtain legal certainty prior to the 15-month period.

This is necessary to (1) ensure both protection of the rights of the economic operators concerned and (2) mitigate the negative effects caused by such a post-closing call-in right."
CMS,CMS comments on proposal for EU foreign investment screening regulation,"This is necessary to (1) ensure both protection of the rights of the economic operators concerned and (2) mitigate the negative effects caused by such a post-closing call-in right.

This would require the EU foreign investment screening framework to entitle the foreign investor to: actively trigger screening for the investment in the Member State where the investment occurs and request the respective Member State to notify the Commission and the Member States through the cooperation mechanism.

As a result, however, the cooperation mechanism could be flooded with non-problematic cases.

In our experience, investors and in particular financial investors tend to be risk-averse and, in the face of regulatory uncertainty, will prioritise transaction security.

We would expect investors to trigger screening and request notification through the cooperation mechanism as a matter of precaution, even if the investment were not subject to a strict authorisation requirement and therefore, prima facie , is less likely to have any negative impact on security or public order interests of the Union.

Right to open own initiative procedure As mentioned, the Proposal introduces a right for the Commission and for Member States to open own initiative procedures in relation to foreign investments in other Member States which have not been notified to the cooperation mechanism (Article 9(1) and 9(3); It is not entirely clear what consequences an own initiative procedure in the meaning of Article 9 of the Proposal could potentially have.

We understand that those Member States where the investment occurs cannot be required, as a result of own initiative procedures of the Commission or other Member States, to re-open screenings which they have already terminated, but we recommend that the co-legislators clarify this point.

The own initiative procedure as provided for in Article 9 of the Proposal also widens the material scope of the Proposal substantially.

In case of a suspected or alleged threat to security and public order, the Member States and the Commission will have a basis to intervene whenever a transaction has not been notified to the cooperation mechanism, irrespective of whether there was an obligation on the transacting parties to do so.

In this regard, the areas of the economy in which the Union target is active are also irrelevant.

In view of this widening of the scope, ensuring foreign investors have rights to actively trigger screening and to have their investment notified through the cooperation mechanism in order to obtain legal certainty quickly (see above) becomes even more important.

Greenfield investments Under the current framework, Member States have taken divergent positions on greenfield investments.

In some national screening mechanisms, greenfield investments are in scope, in others they are out of scope.

The Proposal remains somewhat unclear with regard to how greenfield investments should be treated.

According to recital 17 of the Proposal, greenfield foreign investments occur where the foreign investor or a foreign investor’s subsidiary in the Union sets up new facilities or a new undertaking in the Union.

The recital states that these investments should fall within the scope of the Proposal to the extent they are considered relevant by a Member State, and the recital encourages Member States to include greenfield foreign investments in the scope of transactions covered by their screening mechanisms.

While the definition of “foreign investment” in Article 2(1) of the Proposal does not take any position on greenfield investments, the definitions of “foreign direct investment” in Article 2(2) and “investment within the Union with foreign control” in Article 2(3) refer to an “existing or to be established” Union target, which suggests that greenfield investments are in scope."
CMS,CMS comments on proposal for EU foreign investment screening regulation,"In contrast, according to the definition of Article 2(8) of the Proposal, “Union target” means “an undertaking established” under the laws of a Member State, which could be understood to exclude greenfield investments, as these undertakings still need to be established.

Finally, Article 4(4) of the Proposal reads that Member States shall ensure that their screening mechanisms impose an authorisation requirement for foreign investments where the Union target is established in their territory and already is part of projects or programmes or active in one of the areas in Annex II, which could be understood to exclude greenfield investments.

A possible interpretation is that greenfield investments are within the scope of the EU foreign investment screening framework and qualify as foreign investments under Article 2(1) to 2(3), but are not subject to an authorisation requirement under Article 4(4) of the Proposal.

We recommend that the co-legislators clarify this."
CMS,Tackling the misuse of crypto-assets for ML-TF purposes,"As a constantly evolving sector, the crypto-assets ecosystem presents continuous challenges, particularly in terms of money laundering and terrorist financing ( ML-TF ) risks.

To tackle the misuse of crypto-assets for ML-TF purposes, it is necessary to subject players active in this sector to anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing ( AML-CTF ) supervision.

Consequently, such players have been progressively included within the AML-CTF framework.

The framework initially covered professionals operating “virtual assets”.

This scope has been amended to refer to professionals dealing with “crypto-assets”, following the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on markets in crypto-assets ( MiCAR ).

Thus, it is worth reminding players of the amendments made to the current AML-CTF regime (Section 1.

below) before focusing on the applicable AML-CTF requirements under MiCAR (Section 2. ).

Amendments to the current AML-CTF regime Overview of the current AML-CTF regime Following the adoption of the amended Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) Recommendation 15 and of Directive (EU) 2018/843 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, virtual asset service providers ( VASPs ) have been brought within the scope of AML-CTF obligations.

As set out under the FATF recommendations, a VASP is a natural or legal person providing certain services in relation to virtual assets, such as the exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies (or between one or more forms of virtual assets) or the transfer of virtual assets.

Consequently, VASPs are currently subject to the obligation: to be supervised for AML-CTF purposes and hence subject to a licensing or registration procedure depending on applicable national laws; and to comply with AML-CTF requirements.

Changes brought by MiCAR

The regime currently applicable to VASP is set to change following MiCAR’s upcoming entry into force, which marks a significant milestone for the crypto-assets’ sector.

MiCAR introduces a new category of professionals: crypto-asset service providers ( CASPs ), which are defined as legal persons that are duly authorised to engage in the provision of crypto-asset services on a professional basis.

Among other obligations, CASPs are subject to specific AML-CTF obligations, which will need to be implemented by CASPs (see Section 2 below).

Upon the date of applicability of MiCAR, CASPs will also be brought within the scope of AML-CTF obligations resulting from Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing ( AMLD ).

This derives from an amendment introduced by Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets.

CASPs are indeed included within the category of financial institutions falling within the scope of application of AMLD and hence subject to AML-CTF requirements.

These changes will apply beginning 30 December 2024.

Changes brought on by the AML-CTF Package Pursuing the ongoing objective of managing and mitigating ML-TF risks inherent to crypto-assets,  the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing ( AML Regulation ), which has been published as part of the European Commission’s AML-CTF Package, will include CASPs as obliged entities under the AML Regulation.

2.   AML requirements for CASPs under MiCAR In the following section, we will analyse the specific AML-CTF related obligations that have been included for CASPs in MiCAR for: programme of operations; honourability requirements; and policies and procedures."
CMS,Tackling the misuse of crypto-assets for ML-TF purposes,"Programme of operations Entities wishing to apply for an authorisation as a CASP must provide the national competent authority ( NCA ) with a description of their internal control mechanisms, policies and procedures to identify, assess and manage risks, specifically ML-TF risks.

These internal control arrangements must be adapted to the activities to be carried out, particularly to the crypto-asset services in their programme of operations.

There will be regulatory technical standards developing MiCAR, which will specify the information to be included in the application for CASP authorisation, and specifically in connection with AML-CTF topics.

In fact, before granting or refusing an authorisation as a CASP, NCAs may consult the local competent authorities for AML-CTF and financial intelligence units, to verify that the applicant CASP has not been the subject of any investigation relating to ML-TF.

In addition, NCAs must withdraw the relevant authorisation if the CASP does not have effective systems, procedures and arrangements in place to detect and prevent ML-TF.

Honourability CASPs are required under MiCAR to employ personnel with the knowledge, skills and expertise to discharge the responsibilities allocated to them, taking into account the scale, nature and range of crypto-asset services provided.

In particular, the members of the management body and direct and indirect CASP shareholders and members that have qualifying holdings are subject to specific requirements in connection with AML-CTF to ensure their honourability.

In addition to the general honourability conditions applicable to them, MiCAR also requires that they must not have been convicted of any offence in the field of ML-TF.

Consequently, NCAs will refuse authorisation as a CASP where there are objective and demonstrable evidence exposing the applicant CASP to serious risk of ML-TF.

Policies and procedures CASPs must adopt the necessary policies and procedures effective in ensuring compliance with MiCAR.

In particular, CASPs are required to define and implement an AML-CTF manual approved by the management body, which must be provided in the application for authorisation as CASP.

This manual typically encompasses comprehensive client due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting mechanisms, also in accordance with applicable European and local AML-CTF regulations.

Finally, MiCAR establishes the obligation for CASPs to carry out increased checks on financial transactions involving customers and financial institutions from third countries listed as high-risk third countries.

Conclusion With MiCAR, CASPs are required to comply with a series of AML-CTF obligations.

Therefore, it is essential for entities contemplating a CASP authorisation to be aware of the AML-CTF obligations, which will be imposed on them and to prepare for their implementation.

CMS,Social aspect of ESG - Lexicon of most important terms and phrases,"Why ESG is taking centre stage Issues such as climate change, corporate corruption and financial inequality have become pressing global concerns.

In turn, companies have faced growing calls to be more environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and culturally transparent in how they run business.

This focus has become encapsulated in one term: Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG.

What do we mean by ESG?

ESG has become an umbrella term for a broad range of environmental, social and governance factors used to assess a company’s impact on people and the planet and how ethically and transparently the company is run as a business.

These issues are increasingly central to a company’s reputation, its financial performance and risk profile, and how it is likely to be judged and evaluated by an array of stakeholders, including investors, clients/customers, rating agencies, and regulators, as well as the media and civic groups.

ESG factors now have the power to influence a company’s ability to raise capital.

They have also become extremely relevant to recruitment and the retention of talent.

In short, it is no longer sufficient simply to fulfil legally prescribed obligations on these issues.

For a business to be valued and perceived to operate effectively and sustainably, ESG considerations need to be properly embedded across its culture, operations and business strategy."
CMS,How political and economic turbulence affects Central and Eastern Europe’s...,"With no clear end in sight, the devastating war in Ukraine threatens to divide Europe politically and economically.

Countries in the Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe (CESEE) region are right in the middle of this divide, but war on the easternmost fringes of Europe is not the only geopolitical issue multinationals across the region must be aware of.

Among frequent flare ups of tensions on the Kosovo-Serbia border, peace and stability is once again far from assured in the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia).

With all these countries at some stage of EU accession, two regional integration initiatives (the “Berlin Process” and the “Open Balkan”) are in place to improve regional cooperation, including workforce mobility between Western Balkans countries, and prepare them for membership of the bloc.

While Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia are full-fledged members of both initiatives, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Kosovo are still reluctant to formally join, even though they participate in some summits.

The agreements already signed within the Open Balkan initiative will unify the labour market for member countries, and remove the requirement for work permits or other formalities.

The Open Balkan initiative is particularly supported by the US and its Chamber of Commerce offices in the region, as international companies with regional hubs in Serbia are looking forward to having easier access to labour from neighbouring countries.

However, even though the framework agreements were signed more than a year ago, not much has been done to implement them.

2023 is expected to be the year that this is finalised.

On the other hand, the EU has been slow to come to decisions on expansion.

For example, North Macedonia has been a candidate country since 2005.

According to analysis by the International Institute for Middle East and Balkan Studies, the indecisiveness of the EU has strategic consequences in the Western Balkans.

In particular, there are real dangers that the uncertainty of the EU enlargement process, combined with local popular pressure, could, after many years of waiting, propel some countries to change their geopolitical orientation.

This is particularly concerning at a time when Russia, China, Turkey, and other outside countries are seeking to increase their influence in the region.

2023 may therefore be another politically turbulent year in the CESEE.

This year’s parliamentary and/or presidential elections in Turkey, Greece, Poland, Montenegro, and Bulgaria could trigger further unrest or instability.

And all of this could obviously affect the labour market in the region.

Employment shortages driving wage inflation The inflation rate is forecast to remain elevated throughout 2023.

Minimum wages have recently increased in most CESEE countries.

However, these nominal wage increases do not match the pace of inflation, causing real wages to fall.

A predicted economic recession in 2023 is not expected to cause high unemployment, given tight labour market conditions with high vacancy rates.

Mass layoffs are expected in technology, media, and telecoms, but mostly impacting companies that overhired during the pandemic.

At the same time, deep shortages in particular jobs and professions are expected to drive up wages and stimulate the migration of labour – especially skilled labour – between companies, and even sectors.

For example, the Serbian Ministry of Electronic Communications estimates the country needs 30,000 software developers to meet the planned growth demands of many international companies with R&D hubs or service centres.

Talent management is becoming a corporate priority as companies struggle to attract, retain and engage workers."
CMS,How political and economic turbulence affects Central and Eastern Europe’s...,"Talent management is becoming a corporate priority as companies struggle to attract, retain and engage workers.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are taking centre stage in order to attract workers, even at a time when companies are navigating unprecedented energy costs and supply chain disruptions.

That’s highly important when employees, especially the “Gen Z”, seek purpose and connection within their work.

Employees are becoming more and more interested in internal mobility and career progression opportunities, as well as in diverse forms of work and mobile work possibilities.

Also, it is important for employers to do some self-introspection on whether the way they attract talent is truly inclusive, or if employees perceive their leadership style as empathetic.

EU emigration continues to hit productivity Workforce shortages are one of the main barriers to growth in the CESEE region.

A migration crisis, which has boosted labour supply in Poland and Czechia in particular, has not changed this.

A significant part of the EU 2023 Work Programme is focused on facilitating workforce mobility within the bloc and enabling easier access by non-EU nationals to the EU labour market.

Given that non-EU countries in the region have struggled for decades with the loss of highly skilled workers to the EU, continued emigration is certain to continue to impact the productivity of non-EU economies.

Digital nomad working on the rise Another important trend post-pandemic, and in light of the need to attract skilled labour, is remote working from another country.

According to the 2022 Special Eurobarometer on intra-EU labour mobility, almost one-in-five Europeans envisage working outside their own country, and half consider living and working abroad as an important experience with benefits beyond their professional life.

Digital nomad visas – which enable foreign citizens to stay and work remotely in their host country for a certain period, usually one year, without paying income taxes or other social contributions in that jurisdiction – are becoming more popular.

Several CESEE countries, including Romania, Croatia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Montenegro, and Albania, already issue digital nomad visas.

Serbia is planning to adopt relevant regulations this year and North Macedonia is expected to follow soon.

More workplace legislation in the pipeline As to other notable legislation in 2023, most EU countries within the CESEE region are planning to implement in full the EU directives on work-life balance and on predictable working conditions.

Several countries are also finalising implementation of the Whistleblowing Directive – though Hungary is still falling behind, with no draft laws in place.

One novel idea being discussed in Slovenia is a possible shortening of the working week to 30 hours.

In Serbia, we finally expect a change in regulation that will introduce a combined residence and work permit and provide a proper legal framework for internships.

CMS,"CMS Technology, Media & Communications Global Brochure","Digital transformation redefines business and social structures Digital communications have been connecting people for almost 20 years, but the digital era poses an ever growing set of legal challenges.

The pervasiveness of communications technologies has allowed the delivery of immense benefits and possibilities for individuals. 

However, it has also raised critical issues that may seriously affect human and privacy rights.

Accordingly, governments, multinational entities and global organisations have placed these topics at the heart of their agendas and are fighting to keep abreast of the impact of emerging and maturing technologies.

Digital platforms have certainly provided solutions to human life challenges (some we didn’t know we had) and this will increase exponentially with the deployment of 5G networks and the Internet of Things.

Its significantly improved performance characteristics make 5G the first mobile technology truly able to extend the reach of broadband wireless services to IoT business cases.

This needs dedicated shared network infrastructure.

Over recent years the ownership structures for communications infrastructure have been radically reviewed and redesigned.

This has been driven by a number of forces: regulatory, financing, competition and technological.

Finance providers have been able to offer lower cost of capital to businesses where particular assets can be identified and produced, and a closely correlated cash flow which can be used to finance the debt.

The lower cost of capital available for precisely delineated ownership structures means that operators can compete more effectively at the wholesale level both on price and on rollout or facilities.

Finally, technology and equipment providers can supply equipment for clearly specified outcomes and uses and effectively where the cost of capital is lower more equipment can be sold.

As industries converge and new ones emerge, a wide range of stakeholders in the technology, media and communications sector from users, financiers and investors to business owners and regulators face an urgent need to understand how digital transformation presents commercial and financial opportunities and is redefining conventional business and social structures.

CMS,Netherlands: KLM: Flying to high in Dutch greenwashing class action,"In a recent landmark judgment, the Amsterdam District Court found that certain marketing claims of Dutch airline KLM contained misleading environmental claims.

Class action The Netherlands is a front-runner in climate change civil litigation.

In a number of landmark cases, both government as well as private companies have been confronted with class action claims brought against them to further their climate change mitigation efforts.

In the famous Urgenda judgment, the Supreme Court ordered the Dutch state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

In the Shell case (that is currently being litigated in appeal) the first instance District Court of The Hague ruled that Shell has an obligation to reduce the Shell group's  CO2 emissions with 45% by 2030.

While these climate change cases are grounded on constitutional and human rights, the KLM case is the first case in the Netherlands where such a class action is brought against a company based on misleading environmental advertising.

The environmental claims The cases revolved around 19 environmental claims, communicated by KLM through its social media channels, website as well as via billboards.

These included amongst others, the following statements: 1. “ Together towards more sustainable travel ” This is part of an (advertising) video that can be found on KLM's Fly Responsibly website, containing the following claim: “ Fortunately, the way we travel is changing And together we are moving towards a more sustainable future Because travelling more sustainably is our greatest adventure ever Together towards more sustainable travel ” The Court held that the advertisement is not sufficiently concrete about what environmental benefit will be achieved and to which aspects of (flying with) KLM this then relates.

KLM communicates quite firmly that consumers are heading for a more sustainable future with KLM, while it is not clear whether and if so how flying with KLM contributes to this.

The ad also fails to sufficiently clarify that this is merely an ambition of KLM.

Even though KLM also explained in its advertising that they are an airline and realize that aviation today is far from sustainable, the advertisement is found to be misleading.

2. “Join us in creating a more sustainable future” This claim was published on a poster on a billboard (see above) at Schiphol Airport showing a child sitting on a swing, against a background of sky, water and mountains.

The advertisement is considered misleading for the same reasons as mentioned above for ad #1 (not sufficiently concrete and detailed).

In addition, the background reinforces the impression that there are environmental benefits to be gained by ‘joining KLM’ without making it clear in what way.

This ad is therefore also found to be misleading.

3.

“Fly Responsibly” This claim was published on the website, with the text: “ With Fly Responsibly, KLM is taking the lead in creating a more sustainable future for aviation.

We recognise the urgent need to limit global warming.

That is why we are committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement.

But we can only succeed if we all work together.

So join us today for a more sustainable future .”

The Court holds that KLM seems to have aligned its own environmental objectives with the Paris climate agreement targets.

The feasibility of KLM’s objectives (and therefore also the linked Paris agreement targets) are however, in the advertisement, made conditional on cooperation with others (“all work together”) and are not formulated in concrete, measurable and specific terms.

This ad is therefore also found to be misleading.

4.  “ KLM Group CO2 emissions have decreased significantly ”

The table outlines the KLM Group's CO2 emissions over the period from 2005 to 2020 and an ambition for 2030.

Given the statistics provided, the text accompanying the table that CO2 emissions have been steadily decreasing, is not incorrect."
CMS,Netherlands: KLM: Flying to high in Dutch greenwashing class action,"Given the statistics provided, the text accompanying the table that CO2 emissions have been steadily decreasing, is not incorrect.

Therefore, the statement is not considered misleading and does therefore not constitute an unfair commercial practice.

5.

“Smaller carbon footprint, more forests.”

This slogan was accompanied with the following logo and additional text: “For ten years, we have offered you a simple service that allows you to offset your personal share of your flight's CO2 emissions.

With our CO2ZERO service, you can reduce the impact of your flight on the environment (...).”

The Court underlines that the term CO2ZERO creates the impression that customers thereby (can) contribute in a relevant way to zero CO2 emissions.

This is therefore an absolute claim, that has a high threshold of use as the claim of zero CO2 emissions is very hard, if not impossible to proof.

Secondly, the ad seems to suggest that there is a link between the customer's contribution and reducing the negative environmental aspects of the customer's own flight.

It incorrectly gives the impression that the customer can completely erase the negative effects of CO2 emissions caused by himself.

Moreover, the Court held that the impact of reforestation, even though a welcomed initiative, is uncertain because, for example, it is not clear whether the trees will remain permanently.

Against this background, the statement is considered misleading.

6.      “ Sustainable Aviation Fuels: a promising solution ” In its explanation of this claim in the KLM website, KLM states that the world is still far away from using SAF as alternative fuel source.

Globally, 0,1% of the fuel used is SAF.

KLM argues that it uses 10x as much, being 1% of its fuel sourced as SAF.

It acknowledges that this is still a small amount but strives to increase it to 10% of its entire fuel consumption.

SAF is presented by KLM as ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel.

Although SAF can contribute to reducing the harmful environmental aspects of flying, the term ‘sustainable’ as used by KLM is considered too absolute and not concrete enough.

The statement that it is a ‘promising solution’ also paints too rosy a picture.

Even though KLM then nuances the share of SAF and its application on a larger scale to some extent, it does not do so sufficiently.

The fact that a more substantial share of SAF can be expected in the distant future, is too uncertain.

The ad is therefore considered misleading.

Comment In conclusion, the Amsterdam Court found that KLM's marketing claims contained (in most cases) misleading environmental claims, characterized by vague and generalized statements about uncertain environmental benefits.

It further found that, in other statements, KLM painted an overly optimistic picture of the effects of measures such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (made from renewable sources) and reforestation.

These measures only marginally reduce the negative environmental aspects and therefore wrongly created the impression that flying with KLM is sustainable.

The ruling has garnered attention both within legal circles and in the public domain, as it sets a precedent for the accountability of corporations in their sustainability advertising practices.

It underscores the importance of transparency and accuracy in corporate communications, particularly in matters related to environmental and social responsibility.

Additionally, it highlights the role of collective action in holding companies accountable for misleading advertising and seeking redress for affected consumers.

CMS,Limited Qualified Investor Fund,"Switzerland is not very well known as a fund jurisdiction, in particular when it comes to alternative investment funds.

One reason has been the lack of a fund vehicle, which does not require approval by the local supervisory authority, such as, for instance, the Luxembourg Reserved Alternative Investment Fund ( RAIF ).

Therefore, Switzerland has introduced the Limited Qualified Investor Fund ( L-QIF ), which is available from 1 March 2024.

The L-QIF is a fund for qualified investors which does not require approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority ( FINMA ).

The present briefing gives an overview on the new Swiss fund vehicle, by providing an executive summary and addressing, in more detail, the following topics: Legal form Administration and investment management Investment restrictions Illiquid investments or investments difficult to valuate Tax The L-QIF may be of interest to Swiss Managers and others looking at being active in the Swiss market.

Executive summary The L-QIF is a new Swiss fund for qualified investors, which does not require approval by FINMA.

The L-QIF is available from 1 March 2024 (date of entry into effect of the respective legal provisions).

The L-QIF can take on the form of a Swiss contractual fund, a Swiss investment company with variable capital, or a Swiss limited partnership for collective investments.

L-QIFs must be administered and managed by a licensed fund management company or, under certain circumstances, a manager of collective assets.

These institutions must, as a rule, be Swiss.

However, to a certain extent also licensed foreign managers may be involved, which presents an opportunity for them to enter the Swiss market.

The standard risk diversification rules and investment restrictions applicable to regulated vehicles do not apply to L-QIFs.

L-QIFs may thus be attractive for alternative or illiquid investments.

Despite the new vehicle, the main disadvantages of Swiss funds in an international context, which are the lack of EU market access and Swiss withholding tax, remain.

A L-QIF will thus likely be most suitable if mainly Swiss investors shall be targeted, or for asset pooling by sophisticated investors when an active distribution is not required to raise funds.

Which legal forms are available to structure L-QIFs?

L-QIFs can be structured as Swiss contractual funds ( SCFs ), Swiss investment companies with variable capital ( SICAVs ), or Swiss limited partnerships for collective investments ( Swiss LPs ).

They will not need FINMA approval, which does, however, not imply the absence of any regulation.

Rather, the L-QIF remains subject to the provisions of the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act and Ordinance unless they are expressly disapplied.

In particular, L-QIFs must be administered or managed by a supervised entity.

What are the requirements concerning the administration and management of L-QIFs?

L-QIFs structured as SCFs can only be managed by a Swiss fund management company, which may, in turn, delegate the investment decisions to a manager of collective assets.

L-QIFs structured as SICAVs will be required to delegate both the administrative and investment decisions to a fund management company, which may sub-delegate the portfolio management to a manager of collective assets.

L-QIFs structured as Swiss LPs must delegate their executive management, including investment decisions, to a manager of collective assets.

There will be no such requirement, however, if the general partners of the Swiss LPs are banks, insurance companies, securities firms, fund management companies, or managers of collective assets.

Managers of collective assets, as defined in the Financial Institutions Act ( FinIA ), must be fully regulated investment managers under FinIA.

De minimis collective asset managers with a license as portfolio manager are thus not eligible."
CMS,Limited Qualified Investor Fund,"De minimis collective asset managers with a license as portfolio manager are thus not eligible.

When it comes to the delegation of the investment decisions, also foreign managers with an equivalent license may be involved.

This may in particular be of interest to foreign managers with experience in managing similar vehicles, such as RAIFs.

Which investment restrictions apply?

The standard risk diversification rules and investment restrictions applicable to regulated vehicles do not apply to L-QIFs.

This increased flexibility, however, will not exempt L-QIFs from defining in their documentation the applicable investment restrictions in line with the applicable limitations on leverage, collaterals and total exposure of net assets of L-QIFs.

In addition, specific provisions, restrictions and limitations apply to open-ended L-QIFs investing in real estate, such as rules on co-ownership, risk diversification, transactions with related parties and requirements for experts in charge of valuation.

Specific rules also apply to L-QIFs structured as Swiss LPs (i.e. closed-end vehicles) in terms of transactions with related parties.

Requirements for valuation experts will also apply to such L-QIFs.

Furthermore, the partnership agreements of Swiss LPs must expressly mention investment restrictions and authorised investment techniques.

L-QIFs will be able to use the model-based approach as a risk measurement method (i.e. value at risk, VaR).

The method will not be examined by FINMA, but ex post by the auditor.

Finally, requirements applicable to securities lending, repo transactions, derivatives and security management for regulated vehicles apply also to L-QIFs.

Are L-QIFs suitable for illiquid or investments difficult to valuate?

L-QIFs may in particular be considered for alternative or infrastructure portfolios with illiquid investments.

The most suitable legal form for such purposes is the Swiss LP.

The open ended structures (SCFs and SICAVs) are generally less suitable for such type of investments, even if open ended L-QIFs with investments that are difficult to value or not negotiable may provide for termination possibilities only at specified intervals, but at least every five years.

L-QIFs in the form of Swiss LPs may for instance be used for investments in private (early stage) companies.

Open-ended L-QIFs, on the other hand, may be relevant for real estate investments as well as investments in digital or other alternative assets.

For real estate investments, the Swiss LPs may, however, again be the better alternative depending on the type of real estate in question.

Eventually, we may point out that side pockets require a specific approval by FINMA, in the absence of existing international standards or other points of comparison as well as empirical values.

As a result, it will currently – unfortunately – not be possible for L-QIFs to create side pockets.

What is to be considered from a tax perspective?

L-QIFs are not treated differently in terms of tax, compared to other regulated funds/collective investment schemes.

On the one hand, the L-QIF thus enjoys favourable treatment in terms of stamp duty and VAT.

To the extent the L-QIF does not hold direct real estate, it is also treated transparently for income tax purposes.

On the other hand, distributions and reinvested net income are subject to 35% withholding tax.

This is an evident obstacle to the use of the L-QIF once also foreign investors shall be addressed.

Coupled with the limited EU market access, the L-QIF will thus – like other Swiss funds – probably remain most suitable if (mainly) Swiss investors shall be targeted, or for asset pooling by sophisticated investors when an active distribution is not required to raise funds.

Despite these limitations, the L-QIF is an attractive new fund vehicle, in particular when it comes to alternative investments."
CMS,Limited Qualified Investor Fund,"Despite these limitations, the L-QIF is an attractive new fund vehicle, in particular when it comes to alternative investments.

It also offers possibilities for foreign managers to enter into the Swiss market considering their experience with similar foreign vehicles.

Looking ahead It will be interesting to see how L-QIFs evolve and if they become a popular investment vehicle for fund managers looking to enter the Swiss market.

CMS,CMS European Real Estate Deal Point Study 2023,"Demand for office property is on the rise again Following the record low of 2021 (19%), investor interest in this segment revived.

Its percentage share rose to 24%, making office real estate the most sought-after asset class in Europe alongside residential property.

Investment in residential properties accounted for a 24% share of the market.

That made them the most sought-after asset class with regard to the transactions on which CMS advised.

The main reason for the popularity of residential properties is the stable income that they generate, which is particularly attractive to investors during uncertain times.

International investors accounted for the majority of real estate investments.

At 54%, their share was almost the same as in the previous year (55%).

National buyers, whose investments accounted for 46%, dominated the market as recently as 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

This trend has now reversed slightly in favour of international investors, following the lifting of pandemic-related travel restrictions.

Sustained a strong desire for security on the part of sellers.

The proportion of transactions in which steps were taken to ensure the buyer met its financial obligations remained at the record high level of 70% seen in the previous year (2021).

Buyers were frequently able to negotiate favourable terms with regard to contractual provisions on limitation periods.

On the one hand, the parties agreed to the buyer-friendly statutory limitation rules more often than before.

On the other, limitation periods of more than 24 months were often agreed in 2022, whilst there was a slight fall in the proportion of short limitation periods of up to 18 months.

Notable increase in seller-friendly limits on liability.

De minimis and basket clauses were agreed significantly more often in 2022 (52% and 42%, respectively), thus setting the market standard even in more buyer-friendly times.

This represented an 8% increase in de minimis clauses and a 10% increase in basket clauses in transactions carried out by CMS last year.

Most interestingly, the number of transactions with agreements on limits to liability was particularly high in Eastern Europe, including de minimis clauses (70%), basket clauses (52%) and caps (75%) – a trend that has since driven segment growth in Europe more widely."
CMS,Technology Transformation: Managing Risks in a Changing Landscape,"Whilst technology is pervasive, we only now understand with greater clarity its impact on financial systems, markets and supply chains, allowing organisations to monitor and manage risks.

The push to maintain a competitive advantage, drives increased investment in new technologies.

This investment may reduce operational cost and ease the retention of legacy systems, but what challenges arise and how do businesses approach the changing risk profile?

With this in mind we wanted to better understand how well technology risks are appreciated and mitigated, and what plans businesses adopt to manage future technology risk at a time of significant change.

In February and March 2022, we surveyed over 500 corporate counsel and risk managers from multiple industries around the world on the risks associated with business critical technologies, including emerging technologies.

We will release the detailed findings over 2022 and 2023, starting with this report covering our key findings across all sectors.

What are the key trends?

Organisations plan to invest in new technologies in the near future, but recognise this will bring with it additional technology risk – read more in Chapter 2 .

The risks arising from existing technology appear to be well understood.

However, organisations need to do more to embed systems to manage those risks – read more in Chapter 3 .

Taking both those points into account, organisations will need to invest more time in managing existing technology risk (which shall remain) whilst at the same time, ensure additional effort is put into managing risks arising from new technology.

Organisations that can embrace new technology whilst managing risk will prosper.

Those that fail to embrace that technology or fail to invest in better risk management of technology may falter.

The findings set out in this series give a helpful picture for legal and risk management teams to assess their organisation’s approach to technology risks.

This will be particularly useful for understanding: Expected sources of future technology disputes ( Chapter 2 ) Levels of industry preparedness ( Chapter 3 )

Current attitudes to the resolution of technology disputes and how dispute resolution and risk management will need to adapt to future uncertainties ( Chapter 4 )."
CMS,CMS European M&A Study 2024,"It's been a wild ride for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) around the world this year.

Yet, despite the turbulence, we are seeing plenty of reasons to be hopeful about M&A activities in Europe for 2024.

The resilience shown amidst economic and geopolitical ups and downs is truly inspiring.

Our Study dives into an impressive 559 M&A deals that CMS advised in 2023 and reports on deal trends and current market standards on risk allocation.

Key Findings and Takeaways Resilient M&A Market : despite challenges, 2023 saw a slow but resilient M&A market.

The outlook for 2024 remains optimistic.

Pricing Structures Shift : notable decrease in PPAs and earn-outs, indicating a shift towards more predictable deal terms.

However, smaller transactions show continued pricing uncertainty.

ESG Considerations Grow : ESG due diligence is on the rise, signalling growing interest in sustainable and responsible investment.

Expect growth due to increasing regulatory and reputational demands.

Rise in Strategic Investments : a significant presence of strategic investors both as buyers and sellers, indicating a strategic reshaping of business portfolios to adapt to market changes.

Risk Allocation Consistency : the period for operational warranties is narrowing but stays within 12-24 months, with liability caps under 50% of the purchase price.

W&I Insurance Use Steady : use of W&I insurance in large European deals remains stable, with the UK leading.

Impact of Geopolitical and Economic Factors : geopolitical and economic challenges are impacting deals but the Study notes a rebound in debt market confidence and potential boosts from election cycles.

Special features: CMS European / US risk allocation comparison: headline analysis of the differing risk allocation on standard issues in European and US M&A. CMS European regional differences : analysis of issues peculiar to one or more of the seven European regions covered.

CMS deal size analysis : data against three different deal values: deals <EUR 25m; deals from EUR 25m to EUR 100m; and deals >EUR 100m. Regional commentary: special Commentary from CMS offices in LATAM, China, Asia Pacific and Middle East.

Historical comparison: 2023 data compared against both 2022 and the previous 12-year average.

We hope the CMS European M&A Study 2024 will again be a useful guide for you in a more and more challenging investment climate."

CMS,CMS European Class Actions Report 2022,"Welcome to the 2022 CMS European Class Action Report.

Class action risk in Europe continues to develop.

A total of 110 class actions seeking damages were filed in 2021.

This is slightly higher than the figure for 2020, which was itself a record high.

Class actions remain a board level concern.

With an increasing number of claimant law firms focusing on these claims, supported by increased capital available from litigation funders, we expect that the risk will continue increasing.

The key findings of the 2022 Report are: The number of class actions filed in 2021 exceeds 2020, at 110 claims.

This equates to growth of over 120% between 2018 and 2021.

There was significant growth in product liability / consumer law / personal injury claims, with triple the number of consumer claims being filed in 2021 as in 2020.

The number of competition and data protection claims is increasing.

In 2021, competition claims accounted for 40% of new claims against defendants in the tech sector.

New features of the 2022 Report:
