        "This alert highlighted a new suspicious activity report (SAR) key term that FIs were directed to use when they report potential efforts to evade US export controls beyond the Russia-related circumstances that were the focus of two prior alerts on 28 June 2022 and 19 May 2023.\n\nSimilarly, a 26 July 2023 joint compliance note released by the Department of Justices (DOJs) National Security Division (NSD), BIS and the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) discussed the benefit of making voluntary self-disclosures as a tool to reduce the risk of enforcement and mitigate civil or criminal liability.\n\nThis Tri-Seal Compliance Note also highlighted the availability of significant monetary awards for whistleblowers who provide information about sanctions and export control violations.\n\nThe compliance alerts provide compliance tips, ranging from steps to prevent funding streams for terrorist organisations to highlighting the risks posed by the use of convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing services by a variety of threat actors.\n\nThey simultaneously provide a compliance roadmap for companies while demonstrating that the federal government is focused on compliance with the expectation that companies take action to protect themselves against the multitude of risks in these areas.\n\nAdapting to changing rules and regulations In addition to providing guidance through compliance alerts, the federal government continues to issue new rules and regulations to promote compliance.\n\nFor example, agencies have continued to raise the bar on corporate diligence expected of companies that do business in the US.\n\nThe Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which aims to combat illicit activity, including money laundering and terrorism financing, became effective on 1 January 2024, with a suite of regulations designed to require companies in the US to report detailed beneficial ownership information to FinCEN.\n\nAlthough 23 types of entities are exempt from the CTAs reporting requirements  including securities reporting issuers, banks, registered investment advisers, large operating companies and subsidiaries of certain exempt entities  millions of US entities and non-US entities registered to do business in the US will be subject to filing requirements.\n\nIn another development, in October 2023 FinCEN issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would require domestic FIs and agencies to adopt new recordkeeping and reporting requirements for transactions involving CVC mixing.\n\nThis was the first time since 2018 that a new proposed rule relying on section 311 of the Patriot Act was issued, and the first ever targeting of a class of transactions as opposed to a specific entity or country.\n\nAdditionally, in the same month, BIS released a package of rules designed to update export controls on advanced computing semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\nThese rules impose licensing requirements for US persons who seek to export semiconductor manufacturing equipment to any of approximately 40 countries.\n\nThey also impose end-use controls for companies dealing in semiconductors whose ultimate parents are located in China or certain other countries where licensing requirements now exist.\n\nCompanies should assess the impact of these restrictions on their activities, both domestically and internationally, and ensure that their compliance programmes incorporate the new recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n\nThe US government has also broadened sanctions against numerous targets, with a particular focus on Russia.\n\nFor example, in December 2023, President Biden issued a new executive order (EO) expanding sanctions targeting Russias military- industrial base and tightening restrictions on imports into the US of certain Russia- origin goods.\n\nThe EO was the latest in a series of coordinated actions whereby the US expanded and strengthened enforcement of its sanctions and export controls against Russia.",

Shoyer, Sven De Knop, Jen Fernandez and Todd Friedbacher, Sidley Austin LLP 4 CHAMBERS.COM\n\nContinuing Trade Tensions Create Increasing Challenges The legal landscape for cross-border trade and investment has been dominated by the war in and around Ukraine, and efforts by the United States and the EU to restrict Chinas access to sophisticated supercomputing and semiconduc tor technology.\n\nThe EU, for its part, is actively pursuing regulation to protect its industry and level the playing field caused by differences in the level of regulation in areas such as climate action, labour and human rights, and subsidies.\n\nThese trends are likely to continue through 2024.\n\nBusiness leaders charged with developing strat egies for the future will need to adapt to the fol lowing:  the new reality of increased sanctions, export controls and tariffs;  more regionalised and complex supply chains, impacted by increasingly stringent due diligence and reporting requirements related to responsible sourcing (including in relation to, eg, forced labour, greenhouse gas emissions, critical raw materials, etc);  increased trade remedy protections; and  enhanced scrutiny on (foreign) investments and trade, likely subject to complex foreign investment screenings and foreign subsidies investigations.\n\nHowever, while risks abound, so do opportuni ties.\n\nNot long ago, tariffs remained something of an afterthought for most products imported into the USA  but, in 2018, the country doubled its tariff revenue.\n\nFurthermore, in 2020, the UK left the EU, sparking discussions on the tariff treatment for goods moving between the EU and the UK.\n\nMany predicted that the Biden administration would reduce tariff levels aimed at China, but that has not occurred.\n\nAnd the impact of high tariffs is felt keenly in Europe, where they may contribute to overall inflationary pressures felt across the globe.\n\nAlthough the spike in US tariffs emanated in large part from trade tensions with China, they led to tariff duels with the likes of Turkey, India and the EU.\n\nThe result was an increase in prices for goods such as aluminium, steel and washing machines.\n\nThe response to Russias further invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has combined asset freezes, import and export restrictions extending to key services sectors (most notably banking) and new investment bans.\n\nIn taking action aimed at Russia, the EU, UK and USA have moved aggressively and in relative concert.\n\nIn contrast, the USA has imposed unilaterally significant export controls on China, covering supercomputing technology and semiconductor manufacturing, with the Netherlands and Japan having followed suit.\n\nThere has also been a stronger focus in trade restrictions on human rights and sustainable sourcing, adding an additional layer of com plexity to compliance.\n\nThe EU so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism started applying, which aims to impose reporting obligations and a carbon charge on imports of certain products for emissions released during their production."
